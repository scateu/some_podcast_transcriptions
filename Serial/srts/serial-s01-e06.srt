1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:02,304
Previously on serial

2
00:00:02,816 --> 00:00:04,096
It's a really tight

3
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:07,424
Free Windows time taking place right

4
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:08,960
All right ready

5
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:11,008
I started it

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,848
It's 2:51 and we're making a right out of the Best Buy parking lot

7
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:18,432
Isn't that sort of tantamount to say

8
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:20,480
I think you're telling the truth

9
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:23,552
The cell phone was in Lincoln Park

10
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:33,280
This is a Global Tel Link prepaid call from

11
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:39,680
An inmate at a Maryland Correctional Facility

12
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:46,080
From This American Life and WBEZ Chicago it's serial one story

13
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:52,480
Week-by-week I'm Sarah Koenig the most incriminating piece of fish

14
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:55,552
Physical evidence against Adnan Syed was a fingerprint

15
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:57,088
Or rather a palm print

16
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:58,112
A map

17
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:01,440
It was one of those big math books you buy at a gas station

18
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:04,000
Police found it in the backseat of his car

19
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:07,840
On the back cover with a partial print of anions left palm

20
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:10,144
One page was ripped out from the map

21
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,984
A trial a pointed out that it was the page that showed leakin Park

22
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:19,104
The defense argued on fingerprints

23
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,968
They could have been six-week-old fingerprints or six months old fingerprints there's no way to tell

24
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:28,832
Bedridden and driven his car many times all their friends said so

25
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:35,488
Show the whole lot more than just leakin park in fact it showed their whole neighborhood the school the mall

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,560
Probably 90% of where they most often drove

27
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:39,840
And that page

28
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:41,632
Didn't have enough prints on it

29
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:43,936
His palm print was only on the back cover of the book

30
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:51,104
13 other unidentified prints turned up on and in the map book

31
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:54,432
The prince weren't exactly conclusive

32
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,344
Over the past few weeks I've been holding up bits of evidence here and there that look bad for add-on

33
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,744
Today I'm just going to lay out the rest everything else that a person could reasonably add to the Adnan is guilty side of the scale

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,144
Everything that the state had that I know about before but let's just hang them all up

35
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,544
Side-by-side and see what they look like first off there's a question of whether Adnan asked me for a ride that day after

36
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,616
Score movie looking for an excuse to get in her car

37
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:25,408
So he could kill her

38
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:30,784
Officer Adcock testified that the day she disappeared Anon told him he'd asked her for a ride

39
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,112
Then later told he didn't ask for a ride

40
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:39,232
He can't remember much at all about the missing

41
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:42,048
I was just a normal day to him something which stands out

42
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:45,376
I wondered about that the normalness of the day

43
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:51,776
When to call from officer Adcock asking whether he's seen her

44
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,824
Not normal.

45
00:02:55,104 --> 00:03:01,248
Something pretty unusual did happen

46
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:07,904
I do remember that phone call and I do remember being high

47
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,672
Because

48
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:13,792
Crazy fingers behind have the police call your phone I'll never forget that

49
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:20,704
I guess that's the only thing that seems weird to me that you wouldn't

50
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,776
Come into Focus for you

51
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:27,104
You got this call from the cops

52
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,408
You know you lit

53
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,968
You were high you were young you know

54
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:36,064
It's a it's a scary call together or just a jarring call to get

55
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,600
I mean at the time

56
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:44,000
The only thing I really associated with that call was that night

57
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:52,960
Whatever reason she didn't get no go home or she went somewhere else in no way that I associate this

58
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:55,008
Call

59
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,056
The beginning

60
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:00,384
I know where it is it's like

61
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:11,904
Your mother's going to be pissed

62
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:17,280
If this really was his reaction then he wasn't the only one

63
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:21,887
The seriousness of his disappearance didn't start sinking in with her friends for a while

64
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:26,751
School was canceled on January 14th and 15th because of the ice storm

65
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:30,079
And The Weeknd came then Monday was Martin Luther King Day

66
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:33,919
So the kids didn't all reconvene at school until the following Tuesday

67
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:40,319
All his friends I spoke to said they initially thought he had either run off someplace with her new boyfriend on

68
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:43,391
This is another rumor that a lot of people talked about at the time

69
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,439
Did she run off to California

70
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:49,791
Friend said she talked about that sometimes that her dad or maybe with her stepdad

71
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,327
Was in California

72
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,607
And she wanted to go there

73
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,399
I told the cops the same thing

74
00:04:54,655 --> 00:05:00,799
Next the night before he disappeared and then called her house three times

75
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:07,199
Actually spoke with the third call at 12:35 a.m. that's what a non says he was probably calling to

76
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:10,783
To give his new cell phone number and she does write it in her diary

77
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,599
Here's something that makes me pause though

78
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:19,999
If you look at his cell records from that day forward neither Hayes home number nor her pager shows up again

79
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:26,399
Which suggests he never tried to contact her after she went missing there supposedly such good friends

80
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:29,471
His friend said she was paging her like crazy

81
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:32,287
Did you ever try to page her and just good like

82
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,823
You know see if you could

83
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,639
Find her raise her see if you could get a response from her

84
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,175
Well

85
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,711
I know that we would always

86
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,527
I can't remember if I just paid you're not but

87
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:47,391
We would always talk about in school I would always like get my information first-half like I used to

88
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,183
What usually skin contact

89
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:53,279
If I can remember she was like in contact with his family

90
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,071
Cypress College I would always

91
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:57,631
Christopher Orr

92
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:01,983
I mean it was like I was just sitting around like not even thinking about her

93
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:06,079
You don't not patient or whatever but I used to always get my information from them first half

94
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,407
It's not it's not that

95
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,199
I don't have a pastry or not

96
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,735
No just seems like

97
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:18,623
I know Krista was trying to page Rhino Aisha was trying to pager during this time to just be like where are you where are you where are you

98
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,671
And I was wondering if you had

99
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,975
We're in that group of like where are you

100
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:28,863
Ask me a question

101
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:35,519
I don't know I'm just explaining why I'm asking the I'm explaining why I'm asking

102
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,567
Play from the relationship you had with her

103
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,615
You would have been one of those people saying

104
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:43,455
Give a holler where are you okay

105
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,735
We're all worried about you

106
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:51,135
That mean I'm right alongside what's them though it's not like they're in a whole other everyday we're talking about it

107
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:56,511
Whatever he comes up in the conversation I'm leaving

108
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:01,631
Another side of the classroom or something like that I mean I'm just as involved as they are

109
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,423
DSLR mean

110
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,447
I don't know

111
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:16,223
Things that I don't know what they mean

112
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,551
In case it came up a trial

113
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:24,415
After he broke up in early November a letter

114
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:28,255
I'm really getting annoyed that the situation is going the way it is she wrote

115
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:31,839
You know people break up all the time your life is not going to end

116
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:37,215
Apparently you don't respect me enough to accept my decision and quote

117
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:41,567
Aisha Pittman read this note a trial he was her best friend

118
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,895
Initial letter apparently in health class

119
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,943
Handwritten notes to each other on the back

120
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:49,247
Asian pencil and not in pain

121
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:53,855
They were joking making fun of him making fun of themselves they'll just silliness

122
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:57,439
Event at the top of the page it says I'm going to kill

123
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,463
In pain

124
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,999
I talked about it

125
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,815
And I mean did you take any of that is as

126
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:07,423
Medicine or anything was it just a part of the joke

127
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,495
I know just seems like you guys are

128
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:14,079
Messing around on the know when I was riding with it so fruit

129
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:16,895
To see it later it was one of those things where it's like that

130
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,687
Weird to see that

131
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:24,319
I don't know when that would have been written or what this wasn't part of the conversation

132
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,391
Cuz I remember like

133
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,927
Show

134
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,207
Weather it is just

135
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:34,303
Like on it was our conversation on letterhead and then at the top of it was kind

136
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,071
Out of

137
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,351
Context

138
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,167
Did you or did you take it to mean anything

139
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,215
I mean did you take it to be meaningful I guess

140
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:41,983
I don't

141
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:46,591
No because when I'm first seeing that part of it was sitting in court

142
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,383
Having to read the rest of the letter

143
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,223
Police had found the note when they searched the nuns house

144
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,527
But tonight was about that one right

145
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:57,343
Seems like a detail you find in a Cheesy detective novel

146
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,903
The other one I'm not sure about

147
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,975
Is this kind of stray report in the police file

148
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,303
I called the cops and said

149
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,863
My daughter just heard something about a dead body

150
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,399
Tell the cops

151
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:12,191
Who's the neighbor boy who mentioned it

152
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:16,031
Names the neighbor boy but I'm just going to call him the neighbor boy

153
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,055
Here's Dave

154
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:20,895
I just remember he had told my daughter he had seen

155
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:26,783
Cut the body of a girl in the back of such are in the trunk of some vehicle

156
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,319
And

157
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:33,439
I seem to me that it was an a said it was like an oriental girl or something but that's

158
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:36,511
That's all I remember that's all I know about it

159
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,839
Did he tell it to you or just to your daughter my daughter didn't talk to me

160
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:43,935
They gave me his daughters number I went to see her right away

161
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,471
Her name is Laura

162
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:49,055
Here's what she remembered about what the neighbor boy told her that day

163
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:50,847
He was

164
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,383
With a friend

165
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,735
The friend said something like look what I have

166
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,271
Pop the Trunk

167
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,295
And

168
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,343
That's what he saw

169
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,391
Did he seem upset

170
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,183
You seem Disturbed

171
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:06,719
More like a

172
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,999
Wow I can't believe what I did

173
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,559
Almost like he was

174
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,351
Maybe getting something off his chest

175
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,887
Type of thing

176
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,679
I asked Laura

177
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:18,751
Did the neighbor boy tell you the name of this friend who showed him the body

178
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:22,079
I think the guy's name was maybe Adnan

179
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,063
This guy said

180
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:34,623
My friend Adnan showed me the body of a girl in the back

181
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,647
Car

182
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:36,927
Yes

183
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,975
Do you think he was telling the truth

184
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:39,999
Yes

185
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,047
Lord and go to Woodlawn

186
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,583
She didn't know at 9

187
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,399
Chicken on the neighbor boy since they were little they're friendly

188
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:50,495
Laura said she never spoke to police about this I never questioned her

189
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:54,079
So this sounds really really bad right

190
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:58,175
But there was another witness besides J who saw his body

191
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,223
Who shot at 9 with his body

192
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,759
That's huge

193
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,343
I called the neighbor boy that same night

194
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,903
He's now somebody else's neighbor and he's a man

195
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:11,999
He was affable and patient and he holy deny this episode

196
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,535
He's pretty convincing

197
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:17,887
He said the only dead body I've seen is on TV God's honest truth

198
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:20,959
Tepper my great-grandmother she died when I was like 9

199
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:24,287
Man said he wasn't friends with Adnan

200
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:27,359
He was friends with Jada they smoked weed together

201
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,383
I suggested

202
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:33,503
Maybe Jay told him the story and he kind of appropriated it and told it to the neighbor girl to freak her out

203
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,039
You said no way

204
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,599
I wouldn't kid around about something like that

205
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:43,487
The cops came to see him in 99 and he told them the same thing you know anything

206
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:49,375
The statement to the same effect to a private investigator who was working for the defense in an oz case

207
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,399
I've read it

208
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,703
This is what's weird

209
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:58,847
The original police report about Dave and his daughter Laura it's dated April 28th

210
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:02,175
I had already been in jail for nearly two months

211
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:06,271
I was under the impression that whatever happened to her neighborhood just happened

212
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:09,343
I told her dad right away and he called the cops right away

213
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,863
A guy untalented at keeping secrets

214
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,911
Which could play either way I guess

215
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:26,495
Nobody would tell him anything they wanted to stay quiet

216
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,591
I never shows up a trial he's never mentioned

217
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,127
Let It Go

218
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,199
You know what is weird

219
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,991
And if Laura Story is true

220
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:39,295
And there's another witness to this murder

221
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,879
Things about this case that kind of Bob's above the water for me

222
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,671
Like a disturbing buoy

223
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,631
Then there's Cassie

224
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:57,727
That's not a real name and we've changed your voice and I'm calling her Kathy

225
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,519
I mentioned her before

226
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:05,407
She saw Adnan and Jay together acting suspiciously the word cheese as Shady

227
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:09,247
At a critical time that evening of the 13th the day he disappeared

228
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,039
A story

229
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:15,135
He brought his apartment after he picked Adnan up from track practice

230
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:18,975
So after Haven killed but before they went to bury her body

231
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,511
About 6 at night

232
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:24,095
MJ and Kathy

233
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:27,423
Knowledge being together at the apartment there's no dispute about that

234
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:31,519
Kathy was a close friend of Jen's they were sorority sisters

235
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,335
A little bit but only for Jen

236
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,871
Chicken at all

237
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,735
Acquaintance and a stranger

238
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:45,599
Heather remembers that night pretty clearly her boyfriend Jeff was there at the apartment 2

239
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:48,671
Surprise Lake little confused because

240
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,951
Didn't call me last

241
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,999
Antlers with Jonathan

242
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,279
No it called

243
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:56,095
How long do you want to hang out

244
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:59,167
Nothing like that so it's a little strange that he would just pop up in the door

245
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:02,239
Cameron me like you do you want to smoke do you want to

246
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:05,055
Hang out and I remember being like why not a second

247
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,615
Asking Josh you know if you wanted to

248
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,407
Jada the door

249
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,199
For what

250
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,295
High School

251
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:19,647
So J came in and introduced his friend

252
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,207
Just like you know

253
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,743
It's a friend of mine

254
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:30,911
Kathy remembers J set over by the table on the floor on some big cushions that were there and didn't speak

255
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,447
And where the guy wasn't

256
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:34,751
Doing a whole lot of talking like he was just kind

257
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:36,799
Start over

258
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,847
Emma stole my car shows

259
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:43,455
I kind of thought it was really strange like who is a

260
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,991
Who is this guy

261
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:51,391
When I first heard about Kathy statement in her testimony didn't seem like a big deal to me

262
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:54,719
Does a girl who says some kid she didn't know who was high

263
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:56,767
Was acting strangely in our living room

264
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:02,143
I've been that girl for chrissakes having a deal with a stone friend-of-a-friend on the living room floor

265
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,959
I probably been that weird guy in the floor at least once

266
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,799
Listen to Kathy tell it all these years later

267
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:09,567
The way it's

268
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,591
Stuck with her

269
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:13,663
How she describes a whole night that's just feeling wrong

270
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,711
Stick with me

271
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:22,879
Happy thought J was acting out as well as super laid-back Stoner guy like Shaggy from Scooby Doo

272
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,439
Inconspicuously chatty

273
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:29,279
How is your day what's going on you know it's kind of like Phil

274
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,071
The Dominator conversation

275
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,167
She says why were there Jen called the apartment

276
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:37,727
Or maybe it was she who called Jen can't remember now

277
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:41,055
But she does remember talking to Jen and saying

278
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:44,127
He's here with some kid who's practically passed out on the cushions

279
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:47,199
That was curiously what's Jay doing there

280
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:50,783
Still kathy that jave been acting weird earlier in the day 2

281
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:56,159
The story he's telling is pretty close to what you told the cops during the investigation

282
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:59,487
Detective Miguel very energy Kathy in March of 99

283
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,279
Afternoon tea been arrested

284
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,071
She told him back then

285
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:05,887
Remember to nanjing only one thing to the group

286
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,679
How do I get rid of a high

287
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:10,239
How do I get rid of a high

288
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,103
It's really important

289
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:24,575
Do you have any idea where he was going to go who is going to be

290
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:30,975
I don't know I'm at my camera clearer but I remember him saying I have to go talk to someone actually meet someone.

291
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,375
I remember how to do

292
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:48,127
Incoming calls on the call log that King towers near Kathy's house

293
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,455
607 609 and 6:24 p.m.

294
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,735
That's the longest one

295
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,271
More than 4 minutes

296
00:16:55,551 --> 00:17:01,695
We don't know for sure who they're from but officer Adcock testifies that he calls around this time and he thinks the 624

297
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,975
For college probably him

298
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:08,095
Young also calls are not around this time looking for a sister

299
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,399
I don't know who the third College from

300
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,775
Kathy definitely remembers Adnan getting one song called while he was at her apartment

301
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:21,407
She says they're sitting around talking one of Kathy's favorite shows is on the TV Judge Judy

302
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,711
The phone rings and

303
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:26,527
You had said anything the whole time he had been there

304
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,831
So when he answers the phone

305
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:29,855
Anything

306
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:32,671
What am I going to do what am I going to

307
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,463
Say they're going to come talk to me

308
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,487
And what am I supposed

309
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,559
And I remember of sounding very

310
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:39,839
Worried

311
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,375
It's all right you know like this was

312
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:42,911
Whatever was happening

313
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,959
Not good on the other line

314
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,031
Lamborghini

315
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,567
Wow you know wonder what he's

316
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,871
Show me driving basically

317
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:54,687
Wondering what was going on

318
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,503
And then I'm not too long after

319
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,783
He hung up the phone

320
00:17:59,039 --> 00:17:59,551
Laugh

321
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:00,319
Just

322
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,111
Bust out the door

323
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:03,903
Left

324
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,695
Jay follows Adnan out

325
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,999
Leaves his hat and smokes behind Kathy says

326
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:13,375
Stairs and then she says they get in a car and just sit there in the car for a while

327
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:16,191
As so now they're outside in the car

328
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:21,311
Never going to the window like why they doing you know Jethro in the car that just sitting there you know what

329
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:24,639
Dallas going on you know just finding a whole situation

330
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:27,199
Super hot super strange

331
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,735
Jackie Chan

332
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:33,343
Don't matter what you know who cares you know

333
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,183
What is going on

334
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:41,023
And you never met

335
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:45,119
The other guy before it right so you didn't know what was normal behavior for him

336
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,703
Normal behavior for

337
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:51,263
I mean anybody I mean did I was just

338
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,103
Whether you know him or not

339
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,127
Philly Hotel

340
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:59,455
Something was going on something wasn't going on it wasn't good

341
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,479
Anna

342
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,271
Yeah

343
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:04,319
I was just drinking maybe for anybody

344
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,367
I think that's been

345
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:08,671
The one thing I've always remembered like

346
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:10,719
How he said how he looked when he said it

347
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:12,511
It's definitely

348
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:13,535
Panicked

349
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,583
He's definitely

350
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,911
Worried and

351
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:24,031
I can imagine if I was in the position just what I would have been saying on the phone

352
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,823
My best friend you know

353
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:29,407
My God what am I going to do they're going to come talk to me what am I supposed to say

354
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:31,199
You're trying to come up with some

355
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,759
Story quickly

356
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:45,023
Many hours later at the end of the night she came back to CAD

357
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,071
Without an ion

358
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,863
But this time John was with him

359
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:51,423
Living like so what the f***

360
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,495
Yeah when I remember kind of them both being like

361
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,031
Something you know

362
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,847
Smoothing it over think a little bit

363
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,895
And I thought it was kind of like

364
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:03,967
No big deal. You could death

365
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:07,039
A big deal and whatever

366
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:12,927
What's going on with kind of like a secret or you know because Jen and I were best friends I mean

367
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:15,999
Honey we talked about everything I mean we were

368
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:20,095
Any we don't do anything without talking about it or you know I knew what she was

369
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:23,423
Wearing in the morning anyway she was going at night you know I knew

370
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,775
Yoshi talk to on the phone you know it's a little strange that when I said so what happened

371
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,567
And I didn't get a full like

372
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,335
Account

373
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:41,343
Next time I talk to and I told him how Kathy still remembered all this stuff how Shady the whole scene was for her

374
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:45,951
How much water with them

375
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:52,863
First of all if someone had called him to warn him the police were about to call why would he then answer the phone when the police

376
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,631
What is called

377
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:57,215
Answer my phone

378
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,775
Turn the phone off

379
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:05,663
We're going in the scenario I'm trying to avoid the police

380
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,759
United mean that I wouldn't pick up the phone and engage them in a conversation

381
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:16,416
Well but there's also the other thing where you just like just act normal.

382
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,440
After school

383
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,024
You know like where you try to

384
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,304
Just play cool

385
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:35,360
Started visual

386
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,040
Right

387
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:45,344
Her story would imply a third man

388
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,880
A co-conspirator

389
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:49,184
Would be on the phone with

390
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,976
The clearly knew about the murder

391
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,536
Who would the third color be

392
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:55,584
Who's the third person on the phone

393
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:59,168
EBenefits

394
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:03,776
I mean it's that's a hard one it's her testimony does not look good for you you know

395
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:08,384
Because she is not really connected to Jay she's not connected to you

396
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:10,176
You know she's a little bit

397
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,968
More objective I would say

398
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:14,784
And she really thought you were acting

399
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,576
Very strangely

400
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:21,696
So it didn't it's not good for you what she has to say

401
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:30,656
I mean I listen to you but I kind of think that

402
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:35,008
This is not good for me if a person believes The Narrative of what you're saying

403
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:39,872
But if you don't believe in their civil would chase a horrible person questions

404
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:43,200
What did she say specifically that links me to Hays Market

405
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:46,272
You know she didn't say she didn't say that she saw me with any

406
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:51,392
Type of equipment or materials are charged clothes or Devils or anything like that

407
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,416
RTA

408
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:54,464
Well

409
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:59,584
I don't know

410
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,632
I feel really

411
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:04,192
All this in the car is in the context of her

412
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:08,800
Leaving okay well maybe he did this or he's charged with this and you know it now all this stuff

413
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:12,640
Make sense whatever may not have been estranged

414
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:13,920
Adam never been charged

415
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:14,688
What's this

416
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:16,992
Second thought

417
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:19,040
Had I never been charged with his murder

418
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:22,368
Maybe

419
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,648
Maybe not

420
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:34,656
Person who puts Jane and on together that night

421
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,680
Next gen

422
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:42,592
Now last episode we talked about those two incoming we can park calls on the call log at 7:09 and 7:16

423
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:44,640
She says they were burying hay

424
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:47,968
Are we think the cell phone really was in Lincoln Park

425
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:51,296
Jen has a cameo in that scene

426
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:54,112
Jen says she was one of those incoming calls

427
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:58,464
She said she call the cell phone around that time looking for Jay

428
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,000
Button on picked up

429
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:03,072
He didn't identify himself but she assumed it was an on

430
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,864
Hears from her police interview

431
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,632
When

432
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,168
I called them

433
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,240
I don't answer the phone

434
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:12,288
And said she would call you

435
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,824
You back when you're right when he's ready

436
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:16,896
Can you come and get him a few time meet him or whatever

437
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,712
Annum

438
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:21,248
So that's all

439
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,040
Very quick and very

440
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,464
Jen Story is true it does look an awful lot like Adnan was in Lincoln Park that night

441
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:33,536
Busy not handing the phone over to Jay

442
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:40,704
The second time Jen puts them together that night is pretty soon after that when she picks Jay up sometime after 8

443
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:44,032
So in Jesus timeline after they've already buried hey

444
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:48,640
She said she'd arranged to meet him in the parking lot of Westview Mall

445
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:51,456
She said she saw them arrive in add-ons car

446
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:55,040
And I said hi to me

447
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,064
Say what's up girl

448
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:58,368
And I was like Hey so

449
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:00,928
And then you left

450
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:01,696
The parking lot

451
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:04,000
Smj told me

452
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,280
What the exchange

453
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:07,840
Hey what's up girl how are you describe

454
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,936
It seems like you know

455
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:16,032
Inside that details always stuck with me to

456
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:18,336
Legend says Adnan seem so normal

457
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:21,664
She says neither his nor J's close he mustered dirty

458
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:27,040
Doesn't remember seeing Janet Westview Mall or where he dropped off Jade at night

459
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:30,112
And Jay doesn't say he met Jen at Westview either

460
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:32,416
Matter fact Chasez consistently

461
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:36,512
Turn on dropped him off at home and then Jen showed up at his house to get him

462
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,304
Just talked to that

463
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,328
Even a trial

464
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:41,120
When it contradicted Jen Story

465
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,496
The thing about Jen and Kathy though is that even if they don't look great for Adnan

466
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:49,824
They don't actually contradict anons on account of that evening

467
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:52,128
Which I think is why he kind of shrugs them off

468
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,432
Why I'm sometimes tempted to shrug them off

469
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,016
Because it has always admitted she was hanging out with Jay that night

470
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:00,832
So what if a couple of people saw them together

471
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:01,856
Does that prove

472
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:05,184
Now we come to the big one

473
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:07,232
The one nobody can shrug off

474
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:14,144
Just call Wilkinson a bad metaphor for a phone call but of all the calls on the log this is the one I think I've is the smoke

475
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,168
Pekin gun call

476
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:16,448
It's the Nisha call

477
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,752
Think of it as a title capitalized

478
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,288
The Nisha call

479
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:27,968
Between noon and 5 p.m. that there's 7 outgoing calls on the log 6 of them are two people jado's

480
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,040
The 7th is Tunisia

481
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:38,720
Anon story is that he and his cell phone were separated that day from lunchtime all the way until after track at around 5

482
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:39,488
5 something

483
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:43,072
Benicia call happens at 3:32 p.m.

484
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,864
Smack in the middle of the afternoon

485
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:49,216
The prosecution makes much of this call at closing and I can see why

486
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:55,616
NJ second tape statement granted is the one where detectives are showing him the call records

487
00:26:55,872 --> 00:27:01,248
Detective mcgilvery is asking Jay about all those afternoon calls on the log between 3 and 4

488
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:06,880
Again Jace's this is when they were driving all around Forest Park and Edmondson Avenue looking for weed

489
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:08,416
Did anybody else use the phone

490
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:09,696
Yeah

491
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:13,536
Adnan I can't remember whether he received to call place to call

492
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,584
But I remember he was talking to a girl

493
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,632
Can't remember her name

494
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:20,704
On the phone with her for like 3 minutes I said hello to her

495
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,984
Where did she live

496
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,032
Silver Spring

497
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:26,080
Your caller name

498
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,360
No I don't

499
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:29,408
You have any idea why Adnan

500
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,176
We call

501
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:32,992
This individual in Silver Spring

502
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:34,272
After he hits you

503
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,344
No strangled his girlfriend

504
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,880
I don't and

505
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:43,744
I have no idea why

506
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,512
You call

507
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:48,608
In a conversation didn't change anything if you just done

508
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:52,192
The cops went and talked to Misha to the high school student

509
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:57,824
Yeah there was a time when I spoke to an on his cell and he put his friend Jay on the phone

510
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:00,640
Misha testified at both trials

511
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:03,968
For Smoking Gun she's very cute like a chipmunk

512
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,248
Good afternoon

513
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,296
Good afternoon to you too sir

514
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:09,344
Do you know the defendant

515
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,368
Yes I do

516
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,160
This is from trial number one

517
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:16,000
It's a little hard to recall but I remember

518
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:19,328
I'm telling you that they invited invited him over

519
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,144
To arm a video store. He worked at

520
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,680
And

521
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:29,056
He basically walked in with a cell phone and then he said

522
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:32,128
Like he told me to speak with Jay and I was like okay

523
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:34,944
Cuz they wanted to say hi so I said hi today

524
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:37,248
And that's all I can barely recall

525
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:40,064
At what time of day did that occur

526
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:44,672
I would think towards the evening but I can't be exactly sure

527
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:50,304
The prosecutor Kevin urick asked her if this call the 3:30 to call in the log

528
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:53,376
Could it be that same call Lauren on PJ on the phone

529
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:54,400
And she says

530
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:56,448
It could be but I'm not sure

531
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:59,520
Video store

532
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:04,128
He worked mostly nights there so it makes sense this call would have happened towards the evening

533
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:08,224
What doesn't make sense if Nisha saying this call happened at the video store

534
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:11,808
Is it Jaden have that job yet on January 13th

535
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:17,440
As far as I can tell from j-zone testimony and from the notes of a private investigator for the defense

536
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:19,488
Who interviewed the video store manager

537
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:22,816
Jaden start working there until the very end of January

538
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:26,656
Listen to what happens at the second trial

539
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:28,704
I don't have a tape but I have a transcript

540
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:30,752
Your gas Tanisha

541
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:35,872
Become a time when the defendant called you and put a person he identified as J on the line

542
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:36,640
Yes

543
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:40,480
Please tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury what that call consisted of

544
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:42,272
You should start to answer

545
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:46,112
Basically

546
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:48,928
He says

547
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:49,696
No don't

548
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:51,488
Tell us the content of the call

549
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:58,656
I guess I said the prosecutor is trying to get her to not mention the video store because it contradicts their story

550
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,520
Ninja says okay he just asked me how I was doing the sitter and then she goes on

551
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:06,080
She doesn't mention the video start of your again

552
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:12,736
So I'm convinced this call the 3:30 to call on the 13th

553
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:16,064
That this was a call when a non put down the phone with Nisha

554
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:17,856
Still

555
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:24,768
Bernard is supposedly at school during this time and J's not talking to Nisha for 2 minutes and 22 seconds

556
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,840
Who the hell is calling Misha

557
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:31,168
This is what a non can't explain

558
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:33,216
I've asked him about it many times

559
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:37,568
He says niches number was entered into his phone on speed dial

560
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:39,872
You can see calls are allowed on the cell

561
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:44,224
And Fighters is the very first number he dials when the phone is activated on the 12th

562
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:50,624
What must have happened is some combination of a butt dial and an answering machine

563
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,672
This is from one of our very first phone calls

564
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:07,520
But if she but she says

565
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:08,544
She test

566
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:13,408
That's her phone does not have an answering machine or voicemail on it

567
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:19,552
So who is picking up that call and talkin for 2 and 1/2 minutes or whatever it was

568
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:21,856
2 minutes and 22 seconds or so

569
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:26,976
I'm sure

570
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:31,328
Call voicemail

571
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:33,632
Call Duck

572
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:36,960
Let me look let me look when I look older

573
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:38,240
I was right

574
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,520
Here's from the first trial

575
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:43,360
Eurocast Nisha does your home phone have an answering machine

576
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:45,664
Does your home phone have an answering machine

577
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,968
Not this phone number now

578
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:29,440
Past year I've swivel the Rubik's cube of this case so many different ways

579
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:34,304
I've arranged and rearranged it to come up with alternate versions of how this day might have actually gone

580
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:37,632
Certain hypothetical directions

581
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:41,728
Every time Jay says Adnan name in his story

582
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:44,032
Maybe he's really talking about someone else

583
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:50,432
Person we don't know about today's afraid of her he's trying to protect mean he's got the car j's got the phone

584
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:52,736
All these calls are to his friends

585
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:55,296
And then I remember

586
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:56,576
Tanisha call

587
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:58,368
Whole thing crumbles

588
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:05,024
No Way Around It the Nisha call is a big fat problem for a nun

589
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,984
His biggest fear is not being believed

590
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,776
When he's sure about something

591
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:18,080
He has a tendency to over explain

592
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:23,200
To inundate you with facts and information and then corroboration for the facts and information

593
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:27,040
I don't like this tendency in himself but he says he can't help it

594
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:33,440
Anyone who knows he was saying that I'll try to go over Force before my people be like alright man alright man we believe you

595
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:35,232
It rained yesterday

596
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:37,792
Because in my mind just like it just received something

597
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:40,864
Personality Quirk born of all this

598
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:44,448
I mean I really I don't like to talk about things unless I can prove

599
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:45,984
No matter how silly it is

600
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:48,544
He does it with anything

601
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:53,920
He's a cook at the prison and he said he got into a discussion with some guys recently about barbecue sauce

602
00:33:54,432 --> 00:34:00,576
And I was saying if you don't have Molasses for brown sugar you can substitute pancake syrup

603
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:05,184
Breakfast

604
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:11,840
Nobody needs barbecue sauce at breakfast time at the Maximum Security Prison in Cumberland Maryland but he didn't anyway

605
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:15,936
All these things that look bad for a nun

606
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:19,008
Everything that's raised my suspicions even stupid things

607
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,312
I run every single one of them by him

608
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:26,432
I got this thing in my head that I'll catch him in a lie maybe just a tiny meaningless lie

609
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:28,224
And that's going to be his towel

610
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,248
He'll be caught

611
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:33,600
Not as smart and clever he knows that's what's going on we talk

612
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:37,952
Every time I call he's a little on guard is not sure what's coming at him

613
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:40,768
Cuz what if I ask him something he can't prove

614
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:42,304
And then I don't believe in

615
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:48,192
That notion that people out there in the world people he went to school with who knew him

616
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:49,728
Don't believe him

617
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:52,544
But they could imagine he's capable of killing hey

618
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:55,104
And I'm spent 15 years thinking about that

619
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,152
And then try not to think about that

620
00:34:58,176 --> 00:35:00,992
What was it about me

621
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:04,576
It is what it is

622
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,440
What was it what was it about me

623
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:11,232
Difference between Xs

624
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:20,960
All the stuff of me like

625
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:26,592
Call me leaving with her

626
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:30,176
She said yes to going here like

627
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,040
MeetMe arrest

628
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,672
Yeah I mean that people

629
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,792
Not just random people clean a people who knew me that intimately do they intimately

630
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:47,584
Call Sonic daily basis

631
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:55,264
I used to really really like you know

632
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:58,336
Take me to my core

633
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:02,176
Just just like just like what is it

634
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:07,296
About me that would allow someone to even entertain the possibility that I could do this

635
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,624
Is that the thing

636
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:14,720
I mean when you really think about it

637
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:17,024
Pool

638
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:39,040
I don't think I ever displayed in Tennessee

639
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:41,088
He's like that like that you know

640
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,024
I'm actually would have assumed it was the police got the right guy they got them for the right reason

641
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,560
Because

642
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:52,352
You know he was ex-boyfriend

643
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:55,680
I will be doing the same thing but

644
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:58,752
But you know what I know and it's like the people who

645
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:05,152
Have told me that they think either they they should have after a long time came to the conclusion that you were guilty or the

646
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:12,576
They're kind of like I don't know maybe I've never really liked they all at some point in the conversation almost everybody

647
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:15,904
He has said well the unknown I knew didn't do it

648
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,464
Like the guy I knew couldn't have done it

649
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:27,680
You know what I mean

650
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:33,568
So what they're saying is maybe there was another guy in there that I just never

651
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:35,616
New

652
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:37,664
You know like everybody has

653
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:41,760
Deep dark

654
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:45,088
Not everyone has a good you do something cool and heinous like this

655
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:46,368
Uno

656
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:53,024
Galaxy paint color for June

657
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:09,664
I don't believe you're not someone who believes that like everyone put in

658
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:16,320
Anyone could kill depending on the circumstances like if they were innocent

659
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:20,928
If it's me or him

660
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:22,976
If my kids are in danger

661
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:23,744
No

662
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:25,792
Anyone

663
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:27,584
Or even majority of people

664
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:31,680
Doing something like this

665
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:36,288
What did she ever do to me that will cause me to feel so angry

666
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:37,568
But but

667
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,504
I thought I didn't care about this

668
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,040
I probably do

669
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:48,576
How could you not

670
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:50,112
How could you not care about it

671
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,768
What people say

672
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,584
I shouldn't care

673
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:04,704
I see many problems with the state's case

674
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:08,544
But then I see many problems with a non Story 2

675
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,336
As I start to doubt him

676
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:14,944
Then I talked to him and talk to him and talk to him and I start to doubt my doubts

677
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,760
I'm sucker that I don't know

678
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,040
That's the cycle

679
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:24,672
Once about six months after we began our phone calls and not ask me a little nervously

680
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:27,488
What's your interest in this case really

681
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:28,768
Why are you doing this

682
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:34,144
Explain all the interesting stuff I read in the people I talked to blah blah blah

683
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,984
But I also told him that really what hooked me most is him

684
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:40,800
Just trying to figure out who is this person

685
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:44,896
Who says he didn't kill this girl but is serving a life sentence for killing this girl

686
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:48,736
I interested it honestly has been you like you're really

687
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:50,784
Nice

688
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,576
I like talking to you

689
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:57,696
Give me hope so then it's kind of like this questionable what does that mean you know

690
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:07,424
Oh

691
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:09,984
You don't even really know me though

692
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:15,360
Maybe meet you know I don't

693
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,664
When we talk on the phone I don't understand

694
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:23,552
Weird to hear you say that because

695
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:25,600
I don't even really know you

696
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:29,952
Are you saying you don't think that I know you at all

697
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,352
I need for you to say that I'm a great person

698
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:40,704
I don't know

699
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,752
Investigating me back then

700
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,592
We had this conversation in July

701
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:49,664
At least 30 hours on the phone

702
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:53,248
More than I talk to a lot of people I think I know

703
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:54,784
Consider friends

704
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:56,576
I'm confused by this

705
00:40:57,344 --> 00:41:00,160
This is the closest thing to hostile Adnan has ever gotten with me

706
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:02,720
The next day I came back to him about it

707
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:04,256
And so

708
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:09,120
I was a little bit like taking a bath and I still like I feel a little taken aback that like

709
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:11,680
What do you think I don't

710
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:12,448

711
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:14,752
About you

712

Myself

713
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:22,688

715
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:27,808
Cuz you wouldn't know that but I've heard people say that to me over the years

716
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:34,208
I would love someone to hear I would love you so much but I don't think that you did it because I look at the case

717
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:38,048
It looks

718
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,584
You're selfish

719
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:44,448
You know you're a crazy sob

720
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,008

She'll like a little off

722
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:50,080
Feel like something's not right

723
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,687
I understand this

724
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:58,015
The nice guy doesn't count as exculpatory evidence

725
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:02,623
But if I'm going to spend a year figuring out that he's a nice guy I might as well piss off

726
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:03,903
