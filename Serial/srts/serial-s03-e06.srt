Previously on serial

18
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:58,624
Nearest versus a police officer can you smell raw marijuana

19
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,672
In a bag inside someone's pocket

20
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,024
I probably put more people on probation than any other judge in his Courthouse

21
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,352
Yeah because I can always put in a prison life

22
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:15,008
I don't think he had anything to do with officer

23
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:18,336
Guy currently has

24
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:24,736
How can you help us do that

25
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:31,136
From This American Life and WBEZ Chicago its serial one Courthouse

26
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:37,536
Public by week I'm Sarah Koenig

27
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,520
I was talking to this guy Kevin

28
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:52,384
40 years old he's been busted for giving someone out of college a marijuana cookie

29
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:55,712
It operated as a nice gesture really just pay have one

30
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:59,040
I thought the guy understood what it was ;-)

31
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:01,344
But he didn't know went wrong

32
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,904
Kevin ended up with a felony conviction

33
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,952
Another felony conviction

34
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,000
They sounded absurd

35
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:10,304
It been a trial over this cookie

36
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,584
That's funny right

37
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:14,144
I want to talk to Kevin the cookie Baker

38
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,472
In the hallway outside the courtroom in the Justice Center right after the verdict

39
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,008
Not funny

40
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:21,312
He was in what my mother would call us with it

41
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:25,408
Cracking angry jokes but also desperately upset have crying

42
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:28,736
Kevin said he been a drug dealer when he was young but he change

43
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:33,088
He was in school volunteering in a community trying to start his own business

44
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,624
Doing well

45
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,904
And now this

46
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,720
What Kevin called felonious childish stupidness

47
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:44,864
I got him kicked out of his college and it also triggered a probation violation on a case from a few years earlier

48
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:48,192
Kevin has been just two months shy of completing that probation

49
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,728
Is almost done

50
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,008
And now this

51
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:54,080
I'm sorry I said this is a rough day

52
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,384
He said it's alright it's alright

53
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,152
It's all right

54
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:59,200
I'm starting to get used to it actually

55
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:03,552
It started right about 16 17 in it

56
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,320
Kate

57
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,856
I Got Roots here

58
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:11,488
Just like a bad relationship I can't get out of there

59
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:17,888
So far in this series we've talked a lot about the system aspect of the justices

60
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,192
Other Machinery of it works

61
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:20,960
Or does it

62
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:26,080
Now for the rest of the series we want to look at the criminal justice system whole other way

63
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:29,152
We want to follow people who are like heaven

64
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,456
People who feel like they have roots in the system

65
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:35,040
I've been in it for years and who been shaped by its machinery

66
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:38,112
Probably nothing we've reported so far would be news to them

67
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,392
I know it

68
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,184
I know it's pretentious

69
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,488
To say this but I keep thinking of this Russian word

70
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,256
Choose two of us

71
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,328
It means to feel something almost sensually

72
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,608
To the point where you can taste

73
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,656
You know it in your bones

74
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:54,496
So now we're going to follow people out of the Justice Center

75
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:57,056
Out into the world into their normal lives

76
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,848
The guy we're going to start with

77
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,640
His name is Jesse Nickerson

78
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:08,064
Back in the summer of 2016 before we got to Cleveland

79
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,880
There been a police scandal with a satisfying twist

80
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,672
I'm allowed to call it that

81
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:16,256
Two officers had arrested this guy Jesse Nickerson

82
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:21,887
And instead of taking him back to the station they drove to a city park took off Jesse's handcuffed

83
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:25,215
And what are the officers got him denayne Dixon

84
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:30,335
6 foot four former linebacker in the arena football league challenge Jesse to a fight

85
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:34,943
Jesse squared off with denayne Dixon for a second but then he took off

86
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,991
Ran into the woods

87
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,551
The officers eventually found in cuff them

88
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,087
Jesse said they betta

89
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:43,135
The officers said he hurt himself

90
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,927
Story made the news

91
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,463
Absolutely second

92
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,999
Appaloosa shocks

93
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:52,607
Talking to a TV reporter

94
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:59,519
This all happened in East Cleveland East side of Cleveland East Cleveland is it

95
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,311
Unsmil city bordering Cleveland

96
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:06,687
17000 people in government and some Police Department

97
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:13,087
It seemed refreshingly as if those entities were taking responsibility for what happened and swiftly

98
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:16,159
Excuses police officers were fired within days

99
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:18,975
The police chief referred the case to State investigators

100
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:25,375
The County prosecutor's office criminal indictments guilty to a couple misdemeanors the other

101
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,399
Denayne Dixon

102
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,679
Plato couple felonies

103
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,751
We went to denayne Dixon Center

104
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,031
The Justice Center

105
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,871
He is a fog line of our criminal justice system

106
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,663
That's what the public see

107
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:38,943
That's the prosecutor

108
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,223
Ashley kilbane

109
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,503
Your honor

110
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,039
When you have

111
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,111
Somebody is a public official

112
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,391
Not only

113
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,975
A Lamborghini

114
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:54,559
But then tried to cover up cover it up by turning off their body

115
00:05:55,327 --> 00:06:00,191
A police officer convicted for bad behavior on the job already unusual in this Courthouse

116
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03,519
I'm here Ashley Cobain was arguing forcefully

117
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,311
For the harshest possible punishment

118
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,615
Who's pitching consecutive sentences

119
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,175
Minimum sentence for each crime would run back to back

120
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,479
The judge Nancy fuerst

121
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:14,271
Invited officer Dixon to speak

122
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,319
You have anything to say sir

123
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:18,879
And he did

124
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,159
He apologized

125
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:25,023
He said I understand I was put in a position of authority and I was entrusted with a public Trust

126
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,303
To make a difference

127
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,607
To be part of the solution and not part of the problem

128
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,887
And then he said

129
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,935
I know intention of assaulting anyone

130
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:34,751
Before

131
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:39,359
It's difficult to hear but he says it was a tactic I had seen done before

132
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:43,199
You know take a guy out of cuffs and get him to stop running his mouth or whatever

133
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:47,295
Officer Dixon's lawyer told the court that Dixon told him the same thing

134
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,087
Which is kind of disturbing

135
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,391
Other than that no one remarks on this

136
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,183
Kind of disturbing information

137
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,207
Just let it go

138
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:57,791
The judge sentenced today in Dixon to 2 years in prison

139
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:58,815
And it was over

140
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:03,167
Victim Jesse Nickerson was not in the courtroom the day of the Sun

141
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:06,239
But he's been in touch with the County Prosecutors throughout the

142
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:10,335
He told Emmanuel that it one point they given him some advice

143
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,359
That he found

144
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,383
Kind of disturbing

145
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,175
The prosecutor

146
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,455
And

147
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,991
Now they told me

148
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:19,039
They telling me to stay out of East Cleveland

149
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:22,879
Jesse said they told him remember the name Dixon's got friends

150
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,183
He said you know the name you know

151
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:28,767
You know they have you know you have people

152
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,303
Dallas Clayton

153
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:33,119
They like when I want to hear about you son happened to you

154
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,143
Daddy's Clayton

155
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:37,983
Usually these cases of police brutality the ones we hear about

156
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,263
The government responses

157
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,031
Constipated

158
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:44,639
Months sometimes years of stop-start internal investigations

159
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:48,223
Equivocating public officials officers placed on desk Duty

160
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,015
And then it just Peters out

161
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:51,807
In Jesse's case

162
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:52,831
There was none of that

163
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:56,927
The officers who abused him had been fired convicted and sentenced

164
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:01,535
Jessie gotten all the things there are things people say they want in cases like this

165
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,071
Just hit one

166
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,351
And yet

167
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,119
Jerry West

168
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,143
On high alert

169
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,447
This whole situation with the police

170
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,983
It was not over

171
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:14,591
Manuel he lived in Cleveland for most of the year we were reporting their

172
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:17,151
And this is one of the cases he began to look into

173
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,967
Manuel interviewed police and prosecutors

174
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,759
Any review Jesse Nickerson

175
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,295
And that interview

176
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:27,135
Turn into a nearly year-long Adventure is to happy a word

177
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,671
Misadventure I guess

178
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:32,255
A year Watching Jesse negotiate the afterwards of his case

179
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:36,095
The push and pull of one man's relationship with the police in his town

180
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,887
Is Emmanuel

181
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:43,263
Jesse Nickerson told me that he was so relieved the officers who taking him to the park that night

182
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,543
Black and white

183
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,591

Justino's D's Pekin police department and they know him

226
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,119
Probably because he's lived there all his life

227
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,935
Probably because he's been arrested a lot

228
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:54,335

370
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,175
The officers that was right there

371
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,479
Then they both knew who I was

372
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:55,295
They called and told him that we was down there

373
00:16:55,807 --> 00:17:01,951
Will you tell me about bad guy one of those guys up there he's like a good cop he's a good guy

374
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,999
You good cuz I know any but

375
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,535
These these officers

376
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:09,119
Good to who they work with who they know who they are here

377
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,399
In a field with

378
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,447
That's what lawyers do like

379
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:17,567
I said he was right about to come down here it came right down here

380
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,359
You can't write down here

381
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:20,895
All right

382
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,967
I'm ready to leave now cuz I'm thinking it like this

383
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:27,551
He know my car he know my car

384
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,855
Going to try and pull you over on the way out of here

385
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,671
I don't know

386
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,207
I don't know what you going to do

387
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:38,559
It just scared it scares me

388
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,095
It scares me

389
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:43,423
I see you when I get out of here

390
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,239
Yeah

391
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,263
By that point

392
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:53,663
We're both ready to get out of that

393
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:04,415
Acquired Ababa city of East Cleveland

394
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:09,791
Because everything that happened to Jesse happened in the city but doesn't function like a normal City

395
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:16,959
For example when I first started reporting about bees Cleveland Police Department I couldn't get any official information about property

396
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:18,751
Crimes violent crimes

397
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:19,519
Basic stuff

398
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,567
Bahamas is over

399
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,847
Give me the number of

400
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:28,991
A bunch of times direct call me flat out that the city simply quote

401
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,527
Does not compile crimes

402
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,367
Layoffs at disciplinary records for offices

403
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,903
Complaint summary report

404
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:40,255
I was initially told by City officials by the department could not supply of his records

405
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,047
Apparently

406
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:42,815
Asteroid

407
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,887
Direct violation of the city's on record retention

408
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,959
Optimus battering in a cool complain

409
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:55,359
City cop. Disciplinary records for just three of the 85 offices but it works in East Cleveland the last 2 years

410
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:59,455
East Cleveland can even give me records of officers who been publicly

411
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:03,551
Norfolk olbia sexually assaulted two women with a sex toy

412
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,343
You found in that cauldron the traffic

413
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,415
Is not a second income on

414
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:11,999
Completed the tax crime doctor running an illegal cigar business on the side

415
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,047
A note for the name Dixon

416
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,607
Who pleaded guilty to taking Jesse to the park

417
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,167
No disciplinary records what's the weather

418
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:23,519
It felt like East Cleveland has given up on basic governor

419
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:26,079
I'm not just an administrative

420
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:28,639
I got the same feeling driving around

421
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,943
Things are pretty bad though

422
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:34,271
One day a local took me down the street Cortez Road

423
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,831
We popped the fashion story apartment building

424
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,111
Pablo cologne

425
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,671
No windows

426
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,207
Make something outline Legend

427
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,743
Debris everywhere

428
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,815
And the guy was with told me

429
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:47,839
Watch them

430
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,631
Pay attention right now

431
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:50,911
Ibis point

432
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,191
East Weatherford Road

433
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,471
I'm over the Cubs

434
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,519
I started driving down the sidewalk

435
00:19:55,775 --> 00:20:00,639
Wow

436
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:03,199
He did this to get around the potholes in the street

437
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,223
Thousands of

438
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:08,063
I say Paul holes but really we're talking about braces

439
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,367
Someone has four feet wide

440
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:12,927
Anthony Fusco schools of tire tracks

441
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:15,231
Mama drivers who done the same thing

442
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:23,167
Cuz I don't want I got to pay for this car if you get broke and driving down the street

443
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:29,567
Cleveland Golf servicepoint partly because of Decades of mismanagement and Corruption

444
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:33,407
Perusal largely because of straight-up structural racism

445
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,711
Is Cleveland a black City

446
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:37,247
90% black

447
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:43,391
I like many black neighborhoods in cities it's been a victim of blockbusting white flight job loss

448
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,927
Collapsing tax base

449
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,719
I'll be right here

450
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:47,999
It's 42%

451
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,839
Is Cleveland is the poorest city in the state of Ohio

452
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:05,663
In the park with the name Dixon challenge st205 Jessie ran

453
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,711
Martha. Whole thing became public

454
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:10,527
Just decided he wanted to sue the police department

455
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,063
Why the lawyer

456
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,343
Scott Ramsey

457
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,672
Uncle Ramsey approach the city talk about love

458
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:20,512
He was surprised to find Buddy's Cleveland was very open to him

459
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,560
Go to meeting with a mat

460
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:25,120
And then I apologize for what happened to Jesse

461
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:28,960
Didn't want a soft pedal that said will be offices did was wrong

462
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:31,008
The band score Ramsey says

463
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:34,336
When he in the maglev to the subject of a possible lawsuit

464
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,384
There was an attitude that

465
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,760
You can file suit if you want and you can get a judgment if you want you may get a big chest

466
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:46,368
This is going to go into the stack over here and then I can date

467
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:52,000
Being such a paucity of countless disadvantages but it doesn't have this one advantage

468
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:57,376
When a person sues you can turn your pockets inside out and show there's nothing that

469
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:59,680
You called lose what you don't have write

470
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:04,288
Scott Ramsey newest Cleveland did not have insurance and not much in assets

471

New reminder

472
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:11,712
You told me in a normal City could get something like a hundred to $250,000

473
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,808
But he didn't want Jesse to join the stack of East Cleveland's unpaid lawsuit

474
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:18,368
Gwen stock

475
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,904

Loyola school today

484
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,848

00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:39,872
Well

More

488
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,968
Off the break

489
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:48,064
This is the road to hire

490
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:54,464
Brought to you by zip recruiter business school she learned about the statistic

491
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,048
But 95% of parents installed their kids car seat incorrectly

492
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,864
So she decided she wanted to build a company around that

493
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:03,936
Which would send actual experts install tune-up

494
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:05,728

Thought I was like I'm going to clean baby poop so

502
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:25,952
Everybody laughed at me and they would say oh what a cute little niche business idea

503
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:29,280

I'm getting kicked in the lungs by the baby right now

511
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,344
When I talked to her she was also 9 months pregnant

512
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:56,672
And I just hired a new operations manager through ZipRecruiter

513

Because I'll help you understand some of what's going to happen to Jesse

Crazy

I want to reach for another descriptor it starts out crazy and then it gets more crazy

543
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,904
First a caveat

544
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,208
Arnold black suit is Cleveland

545
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:37,024
I read the court transcript I interviewed his attorney

546
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:40,608
There was a trial but he's Cleveland the defendant

547
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:42,144
Did not defend itself

548
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,240
They did not offer evidence or Witnesses they did not cross-examine anyone

549
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:49,056
So what I'm going to tell you is one-sided

550
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:50,848
Which doesn't make it untrue

551
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:55,968
Everything I'm telling you now was testify to Underoath in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas

552
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,040
And again was not challenged by the city

553
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,832
Here's the story

554
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:04,160
This guy Arnold black East 44th

555
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:07,488
The time is driving down Euclid Avenue in the middle of East Cleveland

556
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:08,512
Nighttime

557
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:11,328
He done a landscaping job near where his mother lived

558
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,888
They got over to her house afterwards for dinner

559
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:15,168
Now he was heading home

560
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:17,216
He's driving his truck

561
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:19,008
A green Chevy Silverado

562
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:22,336
Equipment in the back weed wacker leaf blower lawn mower

563
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,360
And the cops

564
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,128
Poem over

565
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,944
One uniformed officer in a cruiser

566
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,504
The other officer is a detective in normal clothes

567
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,784
I was driving his normal car

568
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:33,088
The uniformed officer

569
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,368
Jonathan O'Leary

570
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,160
Tells Arnold to get out of the truck

571
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,184
Possumdown

572
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:37,952
Topsham

573
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,536
I take Arnold black to the rear of his truck sitting down on the bumper

574
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:46,144
The cop in street clothes detective Randy Hicks aggressively searches the truck

575
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,936
Ripped out the inside door panels

576
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:50,752
In court Arnold black testified to the following

577
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,288
He said detective Hicks

578
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,592
Start asking him about drugs and he's Cleveland

579
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,384
They told him he didn't know

580
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:59,968
Because I don't sell drugs I don't do drugs and I don't live in East Cleveland

581
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:05,344
He said he was looking for a kilo of cocaine and he said to me that I wasn't in the right truck

582
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:09,440
I don't lie detective Hicks was looking for a drug dealer and a green truck

583
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,720
But Arnold wasn't him

584
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:11,744
Not annoyed

585
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,560
He said you messed my night up

586
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:17,376
Arnold's that detective Hicks seemed off

587
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,400
Drunk probably

588
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:22,752
It keeps asking Arnold about drugs Arnold the saying why you keep asking me that

589
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:23,776
Then

590
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:24,544
Wham

591
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,568
Detective Hicks

592
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:27,104
Punches Arnold in the face

593
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:31,200
Arnold testified that he then starts to cut a slide off the bumper

594
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:32,992
Officer O'Leary props him up

595
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:35,296
Detective Hicks hits him again in the head

596
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,832
These are hard hits

597
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:42,464
Hard enough that three years later Arnold Blackwood need brain surgery to drain the fluid and blood from a skull

598
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,792
Even now he can't remember things properly his speech has slowed

599
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:47,840
Is trouble controlling his anger

600
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:51,168
His mother and fiance say his personality is changed

601
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:53,984
The officers put him in the cruiser

602
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,800
Take him back to the East Cleveland Police Department where the jail is

603
00:27:57,312 --> 00:28:03,456
And they put him in a room that Arnold's attorney calls a storage locker East Cleveland police called it a holding cell tomato tomato

604
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:07,808
So no one can decide what this room is called but whatever it is it is not a proper jail cell

605
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,880
No bad no toilet no window no water

606
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:13,952
Going to bench fuel lockers the tall kind

607
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:15,232
And some cleaning supplies

608
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,512
Brooms mops

609
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,072
They lock Arnold in there

610
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,864
That's according to his testimony

611
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:27,776
And now the timeline of all this is a little unclear the police and County records say one thing the trial transcript says another

612
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:29,568
If we go by the Wreckers at least

613
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:31,360
This began on a Friday night

614
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:35,712
Arnold says he could hear people talking and hollering walking around he could

615
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:36,736
Cheese

616
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:41,856
I knocked on the door and was screaming like I told him I had to use the bathroom and I said anybody

617
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:43,136
Anybody

618
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:44,160
No one comes

619
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,696
Arnold peas in a locker

620
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,024
Meanwhile his girlfriend Erica is getting worried

621
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:51,328
Where is he supposed to hear from him

622
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,144
Just calling around to friends she called the hospital

623
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:55,680
Sunday Times

624
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:58,752
Arnold's has an officer opens a door to the room

625
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:01,312
And ask him does anyone know you're in here

626
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,872
Arnold says no the guy says

627
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:05,408
And points to the ceiling

628
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:10,016
There's a microphone up there he says step back they won't pick up Whispers

629
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:16,928
Send text to Zone cell phone from his back pocket Arnold gives the guard Erica's number the guard dial to phone and the

630
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:18,464
Arnold and tell them to make it quick

631
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:23,584
Arnold tells Erica the cops beat me up I'm in East Cleveland jail come get me

632
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:26,656
Colonel says a bit later that same guy comes back

633
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:30,240
Houses in one of those little milk cartons like from a school cafeteria

634
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,544
Erica arrives

635
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:34,336
Ask to see Arnold

636
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:37,152
Now this is according to her testimony

637
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:40,736
The cops at the reception window, look at each other for a while

638
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:42,016
Finally someone says

639
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,552
He's under investigation

640
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:44,576
You can't see him

641
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:46,112
He's under investigation

642
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,184
She feels like something's wrong like they're lying to her

643
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:54,048
She called Arnold Family Arnold's brother he took the stand at trial to

644
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:58,912
Arnold's brother says he goes to East Cleveland and they tell him Arnold's in Cleveland jail

645
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,704
He drives over to Cleveland

646
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,752
Tell him there's no Arnold black here

647
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,288
And he's like I was just

648
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,824
They just told me to come here

649
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,592
Paycheck

650
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:07,616
Check again

651
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,992
He goes back to East Cleveland again where they again safe we don't know what to tell you

652
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:13,760
Get here

653
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:15,808
It's now Monday

654
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,600
Day 3 of the storage room

655
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:21,440
Arnold is in terrible pain from his head injuries he can't sleep really

656
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:22,464
Hungry

657
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:27,328
Cortana said that aside from that one little milk carton they gave him nothing to eat or drink

658
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:33,728
The p in the locker is stinking he's intensely anxious is where the cops are going to do something to Erica because he called

659
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,288
Feels like the room is closing in on him

660
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:40,640
Finally I got if I'm reading the records right on day 5

661
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:44,736
He's put in a van and taken to the county jail at the Justice Center

662
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:46,784
He's held there a couple days

663
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,112
Until Erica comes to get him paises Bond 250 bucks

664
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:55,488
But you see them walking out of the county jail she says his head is so swollen he looks like he's wearing a helmet

665
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,768
Take them home

666
00:30:57,792 --> 00:31:03,424
Sometime later Arnold gets a letter in the mail telling him he's been indicted by a grand jury for possessing crack cocaine

667
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:09,056
I was like charged with cocaine Arnold said I never had no cocaine charge with that

668
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:15,968
In the police report officer O'Leary claims he found a baggie of crack under Arnold's tongue and also that he had a baggie of marijuana

669
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:16,992
Moana

670
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:23,392
I'll point out that the East Cleveland detective who testified about the crack before the grand jury Eric Jones was at that

671
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:29,792
That time part of a couple of East Cleveland cops who were shaking down drug dealers stealing their money and falsifying evidence

672
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:31,328
Is now in federal prison

673
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,352
But I digress

674
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:38,752
In any case the prosecutor could see the circumstances of Arnold arrest or shady she been told about the beating

675
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:40,288
This file was going to be trouble

676
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:42,080
They dropped the charges

677
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:46,944
Arnold hires a civil rights lawyer Bobby the cello

678
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,968
Jesus

679
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:51,040
Suzhou city of East Cleveland Azusa police chief Ralph

680
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:51,808
Spots

681
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:54,624
This is Officer O'Leary Jesus detective Hicks

682
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:57,184
Is asking for 35 million dollars

683
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:01,792
Bobby 2Cellos 6 a settlement from the city on behalf of Arnold black

684
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:06,144
The delegates much the same pitch Scott Ramsey got when he sought a settlement for Jessie

685
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:08,448
There's only so much we can afford

686
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:10,496
Detellos response

687
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:11,520
Very different

688
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:13,056
Has Bobby 2cello

689
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,080
We heard

690
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,616
As the chief defense

691
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:16,896
Why are you doing

692
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:18,432
We don't have anymore

693
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:22,272
Don't you see where poor don't you see we're poor poor cities

694
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:24,576
Streets aren't very good don't you see that work

695
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:25,856
In a state of

696
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:28,672
It's called Financial or physical emergency where the

697
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:30,720
State of Ohio is running our books

698
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:33,024
And has to authorize every expenditure

699
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,048
You can't get paid

700
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,608
Here's what we can do we can give you 50 Grand

701
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:38,144
Would you be happy with 50 Grand

702
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:39,936
Would that be good enough

703
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,728
And I would respond

704
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,008
Let me get this straight

705
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:47,872
You guys beat up my client put them in a in a locker storage locker made him pee

706
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:50,432
There and by the way Federal nothing to the carton of milk

707
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,200
4 days

708
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:53,760
And you think I'm here just for 50 Grand

709
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:54,528
Billy

710
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:59,136
I'm going to ask you to bear with me a little longer here because the story gets better

711
00:32:59,392 --> 00:32:59,904
Flash worse

712
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:05,024
Are they prepare for trial tuccillo finds out there was dash cam footage of the arrest

713
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:07,328
The shows detective Hicks beating Arnold

714
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:12,448
And they also discover that that same raw video with later edited by the police

715
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,472
Altered

716
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:14,240
So is not

717
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,008
Cheshire the beating

718
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,056
And listen up here

719
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:19,616
At the police chief and the mayor knew about it

720
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:22,688
They discovered that the East Cleveland Police did this all the time

721
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:28,832
In fact they discover that nothing that happened to Arnold black during the time he was secretly in East Cleveland's custody was unusual

722
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:32,160
Police in East Cleveland routinely pull people over in rough them up

723
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:33,952
Badminton practice for decades

724
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:37,536
Routinely held them in jail for no reason routinely altered evidence

725
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:42,144
The police chief routinely told officers to keep quiet about abuse to avoid lawsuit

726
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:47,520
Dichello had found out about almost all this stuff from a most unlikely source

727
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:49,056
Detective Randy Hicks

728
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:50,592
The guy who beat Arnold black

729
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,176
Pics of walked off the job within days of Arnold arrest he said

730
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:56,992
Soon as he realized his bosses were going to blame everything on him

731
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,808
Event at the department for about 15 years

732
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:01,856
Head of the narcotics unit for 6

733
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:03,136
Modern commendation

734
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:05,184
He wasn't a rogue cop

735
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,256
He said he was doing what they'd all been taught to do in East Cleveland

736
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:12,096
We asked the city law director to respond to the story

737
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:12,864
She didn't

738
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:15,680
Neither did Officer O'Leary or detective Hicks

739
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:18,496
Then Mayor Gary Norton did respond

740
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:23,104
He's at the characterization from the Civil Trial are 1000% false

741
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:25,408
Is that all I knew about the dash cam video

742
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:28,224
Was that quote there was a gap in the tape on quote

743
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:29,504
Gap

744
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:33,600
And he said he didn't know about the holding cells / storage locker at the jail

745
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:35,392
Which is downstairs from his office

746
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:36,672
I just didn't know

747
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:37,696
I really didn't

748
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,536
The den police chief Ralph Spotts also called us back

749
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:42,816
He said ditto

750
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:46,400
There was no such culture of aggression within the police department he said

751
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:49,472
No pattern of altering evidence or hiding abuse

752
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:55,360
Mister spots at detective Hicks was just shifting blame for his own personal wrongdoing

753
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:57,664
The civil lawsuit drag on

754
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,688
Years go by

755
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,016
No point is East Cleveland ever hand over discovery

756
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:03,552
That one piece of paper

757
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:10,208
Nevermind the dashcam video or Personnel records or logs from the jail the cello never even gets a police report

758
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:15,584
City law director claims she doesn't know where anything is they simply have nothing to Handover

759
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:22,240
Is egregious enough this refusal to engage but the judge finally issued a ruling saying okay is Cleveland

760
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:25,056
You are now barred from introducing any evidence in trial

761
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:29,920
So we're going to have a trial but you cannot defend yourself you forfeited that right

762
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:31,712
City appeals this ruling

763
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:34,016
Once twice they get denied

764
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:39,392
In 2016 four years after Arnold's beating and arrest they finally go to trial

765
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:45,024
And the only person who shows up for the other side the only person is former East Cleveland Detective

766
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,048
Randy Hicks

767
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:48,864
No city law director no police chief no mayor

768
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:52,448
Just Randy hex all by himself and he admits everything

769
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:55,520
There's this extraordinary part of the trial transfer

770
00:35:56,288 --> 00:36:00,128
In which two cello reads a long list of all the things officers in East Cleveland dead

771
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:01,664
And Hicks confirmed

772
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,688
All of it

773
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:03,968
The cello

774
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:04,992
Number for

775
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:11,392
Officer Hicks was and his fellow officers were required by Chief spots to follow a custom of using violence in the city of

776
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:12,160
East Cleveland

777
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:14,720
We had officers using force on civilians

778
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:17,536
To compel statements from them to establish control

779
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:21,632
To instill fear and submission and to show dominance during arrest in traffic stop

780
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,656
The judge

781
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:23,936
That true

782
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:25,472
Text yes your honor

783
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:32,384
A jury awarded Arnold black 22 million dollars in compensatory and punitive damages

784
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,664
22 million-dollar judgement

785
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,456
Victory right

786
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:37,504
Not exactly

787
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,784
Because got this

788
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:40,576
The morning of trial

789
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:46,720
About an hour and a half before it started the city's lawyer filed a notice of appeal with the Ohio Supreme Court

790
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:50,816
It's a notice saying hey we're planning on filing something with you guys

791
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:56,704
The city had assumed that the notice would stop the clock on the trial and retroactively it did

792
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:03,104
An appeals court later ruled that the trial should not have gone forward with that notice pending so now as I write this

793
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:07,200
In 2018 the verdict in Arnold glass case has been overturned

794
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:11,296
Now the cello is Awana peeling he's not sure if he'll prevail

795
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:13,344
He might have to retry this case

796
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:20,256
Civil lawsuits are supposed to lead to reform that's the hope the city will fix the problems that are costing it

797
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:25,888
A lot of money we talked to 11 attorneys who do civil rights cases in Cuyahoga County

798
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:27,680
What attorney said yeah bring it

799
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:30,240
I have no problem pulling the trigger against East Cleveland

800
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:32,288
The other 10 attorneys

801
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:35,360
No way they said not worth it said one

802
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:39,456
Add a business to run to another we heard there's no reward we heard

803
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:40,224
It's a b****

804
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:40,992
You heard

805
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:43,808
I turned out any case that comes from East Cleveland

806
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:44,832
And it's heartbreaking

807
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,416
In other words Arnold black is a cautionary Tale

808
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:50,208
What makes the cello nuts

809
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:51,488
He doesn't see it that way

810
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,792
Mrs. Arnold black doesn't either

811
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:59,680
The city hasn't paid Arnold like a dime but he has gotten quite a bit of money as a result of a lawsuit

812
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:05,056
Chroma funding company that loans plaintiffs Money based on likely verdict I told financial industry apparel

813
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:11,712
But more to the point dichello says there's no public record of how he's Cleveland was running as Police Department

814
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:14,528
This case this verdict was national news

815
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,320
Because it went to trial

816
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:17,856
I'm talking about it right now

817
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:26,048
I asked a cello can you understand though how someone like Jesse Nickerson might not want to spend six

818
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,584
Plus years fighting the city

819
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:29,120
Especially if they live there

820
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:33,216
Mitchell said yeah but if a client did tell him that he pushed back

821
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,520
With a speech that goes something like this

822
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:38,080
We are the police of the police

823
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:39,872
By constitutional mandate

824
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,408
Thank God

825
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:44,736
This is got to be about you understand what's happening

826
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:47,552
Do you understand what their lives are there that are at stake here

827
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:49,088
It does impact us all

828
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,392
You're the guy you sneaked out and you know

829
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:53,952
Got out of the way the bully for a few bucks good job

830
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:59,072
Disappointed but did your community matter to you and if it didn't get the response comes back no

831
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:02,656
It doesn't I don't do it then I'm duty-bound to listen to my client

832
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:03,936
I get that

833
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:07,008
But I understand what's going to continue and we'll have that Converse

834
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:08,544
Responsible

835
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,592
Like I would with my own brother or sister

836
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:16,992
Look bro I get it you don't want to be in the fight but here's what's going to happen the blade on the streets going to do this again and again and again can you live in that town

837
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:21,600
If you settle for peanuts Like Jesse did 2Cellos says

838
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:23,392
You're not going to get real change

839
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:24,672
Organic peanuts

840
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:29,536
And now you're living in your same town along with the same people you're scared of

841
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,072
Right

842
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,376
And that's

843
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:34,912
Where Jesse is

844
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:37,728
Emmanuel is going to take it from here

845
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,848
About three weeks off we met up in the park I wanted to check in with Jesse

846
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,384
See how he was doing

847
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:47,456
See if you had any more run-ins with Cleveland Police

848
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,016
I thought they couldn't get ahold of him

849
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:51,808
Bangkok food his girlfriend Ashley

850
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,600
She wants into a whole thing

851
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:56,928
Something happened between Jesse and the police on the phone

852
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:57,696
July

853
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:59,488
The police Roxanne

854
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:02,048
She said Jesse wanted to tell me about it

855
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,584
Get a new phone

856
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,864
She gave me the number

857
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,144
Wechat out immediately

858
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:09,216
Crazy she told me

859
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:12,288
Yes

860
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:18,944
On the 4th of July Jessie Street for a block party

861
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:22,016
Neighbors block road cones and close off the street

862
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:23,808
About 70 people came out

863
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:25,856
Pictures of all the usual

864
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:28,928
Kids playing basketball people grilling fireworks

865
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:31,232
Does he get his friends help set it up

866
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,816
Is potty when an old a pan into the evening

867
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:37,632
Around midnight East Cleveland police showed up

868
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:42,496
Setting off fireworks about apartment is illegal in Ohio and you called

869
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:45,568
So the police said it was time to clear out

870
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:47,872
People started heading home

871
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:54,272
Jesse says he and his friends are dragging their feet messing around of a basketball given a costume attitude when

872
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:55,552
Quite abruptly

873
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:57,856
Police officer an older guy

874
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:59,392
Yell through the crowd

875
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,928
You in the red shirt

876
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:02,464
Give a f*** out of UC

877
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:04,000
I look around

878
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:10,400
Jesse and some of his friends confronted by officer

879
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:17,056
Comfortable

880
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:20,640
So I ain't doing nothing wrong

881
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:27,040
The other officer was like shut the f******

882
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:30,112
I'm not sure if it's such a thing at the office it's staying out of East Cleveland

883
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:36,256
Stepping up to an East Cleveland police officer and pooping like this my Pia

884
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:37,024
Directions

885
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:43,168
Best body cam footage

886
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,704
Three different offices

887
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:46,752
A lot of it is blurry and dark

888
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:48,544
But I watched it over and over

889
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:52,640
According to a police football Jesse's fat on an officer

890
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:54,687
Can you conceive on the body

891
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:58,271
Instead it seems different beliefs is founded on Jessie

892
00:41:58,783 --> 00:41:59,807
Does a crowd of people

893
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,855
But Jesse seems to be the one they want

894
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:06,463
In the body cam footage you see Jesse and some of his friends talking back to

895
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,231
The police officer

896
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:09,023
Death is in the Rio

Finally a bailiff told me he seen Jesse world out of courtroom

1012
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:15,455

00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:38,751

A young police officer iPhone might be more helpful

1035

Nope

1036
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,887
He said he wasn't allowed to tell me what charges were

1037
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:07,423
Even though I was a reporter

1038
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:09,471
Department policy

1039
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:10,751
Again

1040
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:11,519
Hijacked

1041
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:12,287

00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:16,639
I don't know. This door maybe they could help

1043
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:18,687
Everyone was gone for the day

1044
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:19,967

So sick of me cool thing as I was of Oz game

1051
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:45,311
Did his arraignment happen already

1052
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:48,127
According to the files just a did

1053
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:49,663
What they like a bone set

1054
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:51,967
We don't get that information out there

1055
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:54,015
It should be public information right

1056
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:54,783
Sir

1057
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,831
We don't give that information out on telephone

1058
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:58,111
Okay

1059
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:04,511
Can I also have a glass of wine.

1060
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:07,583
After while I go with a Hammonds on the phone

1061
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:08,863
Bethany's Lowell director

1062
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:13,471
You didn't hang up on me or ignore my arguments about things being public record

1063
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:14,495
She was nice

1064
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:16,287
Multiply

1065
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:19,359
But I didn't want to be recorded but she did answer my question

1066
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:22,687
She told me Jessie been arrested

1067
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:25,759
Charged with misdemeanors for a completely different guys

1068
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:29,855
Jesse the yelled at and intimidated an officer

1069
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:31,647
Instead of arresting Jessie then

1070
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:33,695
I believe they put a warrant out for his arrest

1071
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:36,511
Also we could talk in a couple minutes

1072
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:38,303
We lost if I could hold

1073
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:43,167
He must have something about wedding some of the details I had a ruffle for some papers

1074
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:48,543
Willis and the optavia rest just need to hit his head on the ground in the weight of a jail

1075
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:51,103

1076
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:53,151
Jessie been taken to the hospital

1077
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:55,711
Neuropsychological evaluation

1078
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:10,815
Literally I'm just getting out

1079
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:17,471
4 days went by before I heard from Jesse again as long as to ask him about your asks about what would have told me

1080
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:20,799
But Jesse coming off he said he didn't have time to get into that

1081
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:22,847
