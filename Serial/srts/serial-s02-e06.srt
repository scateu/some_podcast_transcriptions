A beautiful 7-part series that explores the life of one man in Alabama

12
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:30,464
S town starts out as one thing and then becomes something

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,232
Totally

14
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:32,256
Fascinatingly differ

15
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:34,560

Or At This americanlife.org and s-town podcast

18
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:45,312
First plan was

19
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:47,104
Go from point A to point B

20
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:48,896
Previously

21
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:49,920
I'm cereal

22
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:50,944
Opie master

23
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:52,992
Probably the worst place

24
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:55,808
Humanly imaginable that place sucks

25
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:56,832
He had to go

26
00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:03,232
The bucket everyone should and then he was in the town asking if people spoke English

27
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:10,656
Or somebody like that

28
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:15,264
Quechee 10-second and doors one minute wrinkle has a baby this is our mission

29
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,616
He's one of our guys we got to find him we're going to do it if we would have found them

30
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:23,200
I think a lot of us would a shot mm yeah yeah I still

31
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:27,552
Awesome so I think I'm so angry about it

32
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,512
Before Mark started asking but what

33
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,048
Why did he walk away from his

34
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:42,144
I had already talked about it to General Kenneth Dahl

35
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:46,752
That was in charge of investigating what bow did and writing up a report for the Army

36
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:51,360
His inquiry was confined to the. That led up to Bose decision to leave

37
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:53,664
Not those time with the Taliban or anything just

38
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,688
White Ewok

39
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:58,016
Mark asbill about the statement he gave General doll

40
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,552
How long is your statement

41
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:03,136
300 pages

42
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:07,488
Shut up it's 300 pages

43
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:11,840
300 + pages

44
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,656
Are you f****** serious dude

45
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:19,776
Your statement is 380 pages

46
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,336
Why

47
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:25,920
What did you do tell him every f****** meal you had when you were deployed

48
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:33,856
That was the

49
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:40,256
He told me to tell the story

50
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:42,304
Pick me up

51
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:46,912
Our military hearing doll said he and both spoke over the course of a day and a half

52
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:50,752
Quote and frankly at the end of that I had no more questions to ask him

53
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,544
And he had no more story to tell me

54
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:55,360
So exhausted each other and we were done

55
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,128
Unquote

56
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:02,528
Statement of what happened that night

57
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,296
Whatever

58
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,856
You wanted to understand

59
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:14,816
Nobody knew who I was because I was so quiet okay stand that I thought it was just

60
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,096
Just about the deployment

61
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:32,480
I need to go back and explain to you where it began

62
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:41,184
From This American Life and WBEZ Chicago its serial

63
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,720
One story told week by week

64
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,256
I'm Sara Canning

65
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:50,656
And fear not I am not going to take you through every one of those 380 some pages

66
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:57,312
But in the next two episodes we are going to zoom back in so you can understand what dollar landmark and I

67
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:59,104
I came to understand about bow

68
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,664
Whether he told the truth about what he did

69
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,712
And what does truth be told

70
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,760
Because those are two different questions

71
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:12,672
What is the things that's interesting to me about bow

72
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:15,488
Is Eddie Brooks is cardinal rule of the military

73
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,512
He left his unit

74
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,536
Walked away from his

75
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:22,143
But at the same time he was completely devoted to being a good soldier

76
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:24,703
And up until the day he left he was a good soldier

77
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:29,311
At the military hearing his former weapons squad leader guy named Greg Leatherman

78
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:33,407
So the leadership you should do this thing sort of like fantasy football like a mock draft

79
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,247
If you could form a squad from anyone in the company who would you choose

80
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,879
And first pick you know Sergeant Bergdahl was going to be the first pick for everyone almost every time

81
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,671
He said he was a great Soldier

82
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:51,583
He did things like study the ranger handbook which is something we were all supposed to do but none of us actually did you look through

83
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,655
The way you get to know some say yeah I look at it it's Jason fry

84
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,447
Using Bose platoon they were friends

85
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,799
The ranger handbook is a pocket guide for soldiers on tactics and techniques

86
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:07,455
He come back he highlighted you look at it and study it and Leadership saw that and they were like well you know this guy's trying

87
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:10,527
He cares about his job he cares about what he's doing

88
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:11,807
And

89
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:14,111
I think that's

90
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:18,975
Pet significant as far as understanding but he isn't a person who

91
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,023
Carelessly does something

92
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,839
Back then school with special forces

93
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:29,727
He joined the army in 2008 and was assigned to the 1st Battalion the five-oh-first Infantry Regiment

94
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:30,751
Blackfoot company

95
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:34,591
As an infantry Soldier you are so far from Special Forces

96
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,871
You're a Workhorse

97
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:39,967
You're the guys who get sent out to guard a traffic control point in the middle of nowhere Afghanistan

98
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:44,319
Intended to be a faultless example of an infantryman

99
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,623
He volunteered for extra Duty

100
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,415
Took impeccable care of his weapon

101
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:51,231
Helping other people with their jobs when he was done with his

102
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,023
Show Dexter snacks in his paw

103
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,559
In case the other guys got hungry

104
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:55,839
He was fit

105
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:58,655
One of his former platoon mates told me he was a PT stud

106
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:01,471
PTSD often dreaded physical training soldiers have

107
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,799
He was with military people call squared away

108
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,847
Right place right time right uniform

109
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,127
Everybody agrees

110
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,967
The other thing people will say about Bobak's

111
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:14,527
Is that is not your typical grown

112
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,831
They can all described below

113
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:19,391
But not one of them would say they totally got him

114
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,671
Understood what made him tick

115
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:24,511
Chain cross was friends with Bo also there in the same Platoon

116
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:28,863
You said was an isolated from the group he just wasn't into the usual stuff

117
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,655
These guys play video games

118
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:31,679
Odin

119
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,471
They talk about sex in women

120
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,239
Odin

121
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,799
It's a I'm not into that kind of thing

122
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:39,103
He didn't want to hear live the average now

123
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,895
Derek Soldier lifestyle

124
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,687
Of drinking

125
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:45,247
All night all weekend everything

126
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:49,087
He would always listen to classical music YouTube read a lot

127
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,647
Would he ever joke around

128
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,183
David sense of humor

129
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,231
Humor

130
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,583
Joining the community of

131
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,631
Teasing joking around

132
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,935
Not the extent that mostly soldiers will

133
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:06,239
Now playing the grab a stirring stuff

134
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:09,311
He kept journals he tried to study things

135
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,103
Pashto for instance

136
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:14,431
In the quietness it's just how bow is he's an introvert

137
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,967
It was also intention

138
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,295
Best way to create the least amount of friction

139
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:24,671
Don't run your mouth and act like a

140
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:29,023
Don't get in people's personal space

141
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,583
Don't go out of your way like a know-it-all

142
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:36,703
If you're quiet if you're off to the side if you listen and if you watch

143
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,007
Can you view help people

144
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:44,383
And you're able to help because you're watching your seeing me when somebody needs help

145
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:49,759
Take it off

146
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,063
He doesn't want to annoy anyone

147
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,087
Or create a problem

148
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:57,951
He's thinking about the best way he can contribute to the collective how he can be most useful

149
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,487
You like the perfect guest

150
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:03,839
Except that this strong philosopher nerd component he has

151
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,143
People might find it interesting

152
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:06,911
Or irritating

153
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,447
Example

154
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,727
Pick up smoking

155
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,495
Sort of

156
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,543
A lot of private smoke cigarettes

157
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,079
But he smoked a pipe

158
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:17,151
The other guys were hunkered up in the windows smoking cigarettes

159
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,431
Bring his pipe

160
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,271
So you know even though I don't smoke there and you know I'm going out now

161
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,319
Deal with the guys because

162
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:27,647
If you look at the cigarette

163
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,999
Bonding

164
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,095
But he was participating

165
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,887
With an anthropological band

166
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:43,263
Probably be the first to admit that he had a bit of a 10-year for social interaction some

167
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,567
Not with everyone but with some

168
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:50,175
1 * Akbar I was talking about wanting to travel around Europe go to Amsterdam

169
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:52,479
For all the reasons a young man would want to go to amps

170
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,527
Whose contribution

171
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:58,623
He talked about Amsterdam's major exports and the financial stability of the Netherlands

172
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:05,791
Yeah cuz I got to do that weird like you would tell stories like that or talked about women and he's like

173
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,071
Make a factory renewed

174
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,375
What was a factor of endued

175
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,399
The problem was

176
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:12,447
He wasn't always great in the moment

177
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:14,751
At sorting out what was fact and what was it

178
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:22,687
First time in the Army started out okay

179
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,991
Get specific ideas about leadership

180
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,271
About how you practice it

181
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:30,623
And in basic training at Fort Benning Georgia both found what he was looking for

182
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:34,975
Senior drill sergeant who is everything he felt like a military leader should be

183
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,935
Yeah

184
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:04,159
Full size of everyone he came into contact with in the army

185
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:08,255
Nice things to say about the confidence of some of his platoon mates or

186
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,279
Couple of the Sergeants

187
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:13,375
As far as I was concerned not one leader especially the guys up the chain

188
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:15,423
Hold a candle to the senior drill sergeant

189
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,495
Like I told General.

190
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,127
Guardian Afghanistan

191
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,087
Log back in my memory

192
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,903
A worrisome catalog began to compile

193
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,951
Heifers just a comment here there

194
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:41,279
We got to his unit in Alaska where the first of the five-oh-first

195
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,047
Based

196
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:44,095
Someone suggested belt lock up his stuff

197
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,375
Because otherwise I might get Swype

198
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,911
Advice to a new car

199
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,447
The both thought

200
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:50,495
How am I supposed to go onto a Battlefield

201
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,543
I can't even trust these guys here

202
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:56,383
All those years later he remembered it and he told it to General Dollar

203
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,711
Then there was a comment by the command sergeant major

204
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,479
Ken Wolfe

205
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:04,575
Prior to deployment wolf did a full formal inspection of the battalion

206
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:08,159
While I was at it he explained to them what the mission would be in Afghanistan

207
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,695
Early sweat it wouldn't be

208
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,743
And basically gave

209
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:15,071
The same speech are the same spill

210
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,351
To all 14

211
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,143
Which was

212
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,959
Hey we're not going here to rape kill pillage

213
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:21,727
Burn

214
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:25,567
It we're doing just the opposite of that

215
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,919
And I said I know lots of you guys

216
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:32,223
Join the Army to do that

217
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,759
And everybody

218
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,295
In the organization

219
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,135
Found the humor

220
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:39,903
In that

221
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:42,463
Not Bow he did not find the humor in that

222
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,791
Wilfit joke that he join back in 83

223
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,839
The rape kill pillage and burn also

224
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:51,167
Even if he understood it was intended as a joke

225
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,447
He did not think it was funny

226
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,983
You find it distressing

227
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,031
He told all he was taken aback

228
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,383
In early 2009

229
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,455
Who sent an email from Alaska to his family and friends

230
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:09,343
Call my deployment dates to Afghanistan have been set to the 9th or 10th of March so the countdown has started

231
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:13,183
I'm looking forward to the next year of learning and challenges

232
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:20,351
He rode marched in a pair of new boots trying to break them in

233
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:25,215
I got a blister on his left foot that turned into a serious staph infection had to go to the

234
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:29,055
Tri-State back on what's called rear D rear detachment

235
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,615
But almost everyone else shipped off

236
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:34,175
Pacheco Province Eastern Afghanistan

237
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,967
When they land

238
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,503
Spring of 2009

239
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,807
Was a turning point for US forces there

240
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:45,439
The Taliban and other anti-government groups had pushed back into the country in a big way

241
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:50,815
There were Taliban Shadow governors in 33 as a country's 34 provinces

242
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:53,631
Casualties

243
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:56,191
Almost every measure we were losing

244
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:03,359
President Obama had ordered a review of the war when he came into office that year and by the end of March in a speech he declare

245
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:09,759
Play the situation quote increasingly perilous on quote we've been focused as a country and as a military on a

246
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:10,527
Iraq

247
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:13,855
Now he said we be turning our attention back to Afghanistan

248
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:16,671
In the next year we more than double our troop numbers there

249
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:24,351
To meet The Surge the Army was scrambling for recruits issuing waivers to people who might not have qualified a few years earlier

250
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:30,751
And units like the first of the five-oh-first bows Battalion that had just done a 15-month tour in Iraq

251
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:36,895
We're coming home absorbing new recruits and turning around and heading back into war this time to Afghanistan

252
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:43,807
The day after Obama made his increasingly perilous speech those Battalion officially began its mission in Afghanistan

253
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:47,391
And that mission was counterinsurgency

254
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,671
Coin pusher

255
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:51,487
General David Petraeus had embraced the doctrine

256
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:55,583
In 2006 he co-wrote a new counterinsurgency manual for the Army

257
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:56,863
Explained

258
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,911
Koi means you're not just going to be fighting

259
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:03,263
Soldiers and Marines are expected to be Nation Builders as well as Warriors

260
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:09,407
Study of coin in Afghanistan was to be back the enemy

261
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:14,015
And at the same time train the Afghan Security Forces to take over the fight themselves

262
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,063
And very important

263
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:19,135
To build support among the people for the Afghan government

264
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,671
Try to win them over

265
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:23,231
Shore up the economy the infrastructure

266
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,279
So that they'll turn away from the insurgents

267
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:28,095
Became clear hold

268
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,375
Build transfer

269
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,751
Ambitrans is Manuel there's a graphic of something that looks sort of like a double A battery

270
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,823
At one end are the people who are for the cause

271
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,127
Are the other other people who are against the cause

272
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,199
Everything in between was the quote uncommitted middle

273
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:46,271
Those for the people we wanted to pull over to our side

274
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:50,367
Basically the first few months all we are doing was

275
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,159
Making sure

276
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,719
Direct routes to other fobs were

277
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,999
Securecrt

278
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,559
And kind of showing

279
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,351
Horse I guess Orwell

280
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:05,471
Making yourself known I guess to the townspeople for the first few months

281
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,007
That Zack borrow

282
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:10,847
Any uncertainty in his voice about what exactly they were doing

283
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,639
A lot of the soldiers felt that way

284
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:16,735
I got in contact with a lot of these guys through marks company page one by the way

285
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:17,759
Super helpful

286
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,063
Some of the coins stuff made shenzhen

287
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:20,831
The soldiers

288
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,647
They might backup Afghan police and submission

289
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,439
Are they help rebuild a hospital

290
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:27,743
But other stuff seems fuzzier

291
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:31,839
They're doing a lot of handing out bag of salt things of ghee

292
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:34,399
Bags of rice we would hand out crayons for

293
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,167
For the kids

294
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:35,935
Hey

295
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,727
Distinctly remember the

296
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:44,127
Map puzzles of Afghanistan with watercolor paint set we handed out quite a bit of those

297
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,663
Does John Thurman

298
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,199
There was a lot of confusion

299
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,527
You know cuz infantryman we

300
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:55,135
A Divine definition we're not supposed to be doing humanitarian things

301
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:56,927
And we've been

302
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,207
We've been trained

303
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:00,255
From the get-go in basic training you know

304
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:03,327
Your mission is to close with and destroy the enemy

305
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,119
Anywhere

306
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,399
Out there hanging out

307
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:11,263
In a watercolor maps of Afghanistan wondering how is this going to work

308
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:14,335
How do we beat the Taliban this way

309
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:18,175
Is Mark Krikorian Shane cross a lot of guys were a little bit

310
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,455
Weirded out by

311
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,991
Going out and shaking hands and

312
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:27,647
You know I figured it'd be a little bit more shooting involved you want to go meet the enemy of someone take there's a bag over there you go find them and kill them

313
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:31,231
Not go give his mother-in-law sunflower

314
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,047
To convince her to be join your side you know

315
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:39,167
About two months after Bose platoon deployed on May 13th 2009

316
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:41,471
Finally joined up with them at fob sharana

317
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,519
Chain cross brought him to the barracks

318
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,823
But I could definitely pick up on his disappointment

319
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:46,847
He realize

320
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,663
What we're doing where we're living Cafe

321
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,223
Why

322
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,503
What was he disappointed about

323
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,295
He wanted hardships I think

324
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,879
I would like like Serana was to

325
00:16:59,135 --> 00:16:59,647
Kakashi

326
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,439
Yeah we had a

327
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,743
Weird hardstand rooms

328
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:07,583
I want something to bambang can you put all your stuff on the top bunk

329
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,119
I think I will just want to have you wanted

330
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,911
I see what hardship you wanted more

331
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,959
What you been seen in the movies

332
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,495
I mean he

333
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,543
He wants he buys matching for his mattress

334
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,079
Danny stop on the springs

335
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,407
It was like a box spring was just the

336
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,711
Metal coils going across the

337
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:25,247
Wooden frame of the bed

338
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,783
Leslie on that

339
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,087
He was wearing a knives

340
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,623
She's big and not in the big Knife Guy

341
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:31,647
He slept

342
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,415
He hiked

343
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,183
Tomahawk

344
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:33,951
I slept with

345
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,999
When where's the tomahawk

346
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,791
Is challenge Jess holding it

347
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,143
I wanted to be a security contractor after

348
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:48,287
Special Forces

349
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:50,591
He didn't want that movie version of the military

350
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:56,735
Moment of adrenaline I wanted that moment

351
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:57,759
You know

352
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,343
Your contacts

353
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,647
I'm getting gun fights

354
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,095
Yeah

355
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:21,823
Less than a week after Bo arrived at his base his platoon did see action

356
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,639
Kona mountain plateau

357
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:31,039
And this incident and it's aftermath became the first solid building block in Buzz argument for triggering a dust one

358
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:33,087
They went on a mission to Amna

359
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:35,135
A district Center up in the mountains

360
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:40,767
I spoke to a bunch of the soldiers who were there and they all said it was the scariest thing that happened during their deployment

361
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:45,631
They've been caught up in the middle of the night to help out another Convoy that it hit an ID

362
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:49,983
That first time boy had been trying to help Afghan Security Forces up and Amna

363
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,775
Did recently come under Fire

364
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:56,895
But they had no idea up there and so now both Splatoon was going to recover the disabled vehicle

365
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:58,175
This was like our first

366
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:01,759
Mission like we're going somewhere we're doing something

367
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,039
Does Josh quarter

368
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:05,855
It was a mission that was supposed to take maybe eight hours

369
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,927
To get up to Amna that have to drive up to the plateau

370
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:11,231
Adjust the drive itself is heroin

371
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:13,791
The road isn't much bigger than a goat path

372
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:17,119
There's a steep drop off the side there's no room for error

373
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:21,471
And they're driving a huge trucks brand new mine-resistant trucks

374
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,775
Just a giant tank

375
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:30,175
Play the best description I could give but it was a really nice tank it had like leather seats and air conditioning

376
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:32,223
And since like all the

377
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:35,039
All the new stuff cuz we just literally got them

378
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:37,855
How does a dog sound like a goat path though

379
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:43,743
Well honestly a little bit better than you might expect we didn't know

380
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:48,607
Cuz we just we were brand-new to him cuz we were driving home these before that so

381
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:53,215
We're driving up this mountain and the truck right in front of me

382
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:56,031
On the last visit the second-to-last vehicle

383
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,567
Just explode

384
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:00,127
Austin Lanford was in the same truck as Josh

385
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:02,687
And then it just disappeared in the dust

386
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:07,551
Like I didn't see any more I was like did the truck just fall off the cliff like is it going like

387
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,575
We started

388
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,855
Trying to call

389
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:14,207
Them and be like hey are you okay are you there like where what's going on

390
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:17,535
And then like pieces of the truck fell on our truck

391
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,327
But they were okay

392
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:22,655
That's the beauty of these massive ungainly vehicles

393
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,447
The generic name is mrap

394
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,495
Mine-resistant ambush-protected

395
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:29,567
You can survive these IED explosion if you're inside

396
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:33,663
Now this mrap is severely damaged and axle is broken

397
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:36,735
Until they have to drag it the rest of the way up the mountain

398
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:40,831
Because you can't just ditch yet you never leave Army equipment in the battlefield if you can help it

399
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:41,855
Even if it's broken

400
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:45,951
An mrap has sophisticated systems in it you don't want the enemy to get those

401
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,999
Orgies the track for propaganda

402
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:51,839
Austin's driving the mrap behind the one that got blown up

403
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:58,495
They make everyone but him get out of his vehicle and it'll be ready to jump out in case your mrap goes over the cliff

404
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:01,311
Or if it disabled and rap falls back on you

405
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:02,847
Is terrified

406
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,383
But they managed it

407
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:06,687
If all the disabled and wrap the rest of the way up

408
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:07,967
District Center

409
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:12,575
What are the kind of Fort up on the plateau where some Afghan Security forces are stationed

410
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:15,647
They've been attacked by Taliban a couple of days earlier

411
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:16,928
Josh Gordon

412
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:21,280
This was like the first time that I saw something that I was like this place

413
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,328
It's f***** up

414
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:24,864
Bad

415
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,632
There's just

416
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:28,192
Bullet holes all through the walls there's

417
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:31,520
Kohl's from where RPGs hit

418
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,568
And like rockets were hitting them

419
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,872
Their towers were like worn down

420
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:40,480
Because they've been inspiring so many machine gun rounds that like the concrete was chipping away

421
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:43,296
And you just like oh my God this is

422
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,344
Serious

423
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:48,928
They came to rescue another vehicle and now they need rescuing

424
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:51,232
They spend the night in their trucks

425
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:54,048
They don't trust the Afghan Security Guys first of all

426
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:57,632
A second if a firefight starts they don't want to be trapped in a building

427
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,912
I want to be able to drive away

428
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,216
So they're nervous at first night

429
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:07,872
When they finally walk around they realize pretty quickly that the people up there done that don't want anything to do with them

430
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,664
Have no interest in interacting

431
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,200
It's tense

432
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,064
Pulling guard shifts in spending a ton of time crammed in their trucks

433
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:23,488
Yeah I can leave it to your imagination imagine guys with all full battle rattle on sitting in the extremely close

434
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:35,776
They're trying to sleep in contorted positions all your gear made it so you couldn't really fit in your seat if you were lucky enough to get

435
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:36,544
Odyssey

436
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:43,200
During the day they're so hot I'm bored so where they used in MRE box and caps from water bottles to play chess

437
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:49,600
Checkers undersupplied in every way it was just the most miserable place ever we

438
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:52,160
I had nothing and I I smoke so

439
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:58,560
We ran out of cigarettes we had like no chewing tobacco we had nothing they actually had to drop food and water

440
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:00,864
Water with airplanes because

441
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,656
They couldn't get to us

442
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:07,264
We didn't bring razors nobody had any changes of clothes

443
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,032
So

444
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:14,432
The first thing you said was we had no razors the last thing you would think about is like

445
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:20,832
Is that a thing it is a thing actually it's not okay

446
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:24,160
For the Army people to be growing a beard

447
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:30,560
You're aware all the time like yeah I got to shave I got to shave a goatee

448
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,840
Going to say like

449
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:38,240
Are they going to say I'm stupid because I didn't bring a razor or they can get pissed at us or thinking that like what's going to happen

450
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:44,640
Days are going by like nothing's happening the whole time they're trying to

451
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:49,248
Communicate with their commanders trying to figure out what they're supposed to do with these broken vehicles

452
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:52,832
Emacs in particular were valuable

453
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:58,464
Until they came along u.s. soldiers were getting killed and maimed by the hundreds because of IEDs in Iraq and Afghanistan

454
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,512
The arm wraps for the solution

455
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,816
I got you so much safer than a Humvee

456
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:05,376
By the time I got to Afghanistan

457
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:08,960
If soldiers were moving around on land they were pretty much in an mrap

458
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:11,264
But there weren't all that many of them yet

459
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,800
And they got blown up a lot

460
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:15,872
You could Frankenstein them back together if you had the right parts

461
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:20,992
But because they've been rushed into production by the dod and suppliers had scramble to get them to Market

462
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:24,832
Get something like four different models in circulation at any one time

463
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:27,136
All of which needed their own parts

464
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:28,928
You couldn't necessarily mix and match

465
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,280
So even a couple of blown-up ones on top of a plateau card value

466
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,632
Splatoon likely didn't know all the ins and outs of why they couldn't just

467
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:39,680
Explode the things on site and go home

468
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:45,568
All I knew was that they were waiting what seemed too preposterously long time for someone higher up to come up with a plan

469
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:51,456
Were they going to send a wrecker up there with a platoon going to have to drag these disabled monsters back down the mountain

470
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:54,528
They had a mechanic up there with them but he was stomped

471
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:57,344
I try to communicate the situation back to their Commanders

472
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,624
It's not going well

473
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:00,672
Sony we had the mechanic there

474
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,696
And they said

475
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:03,744
Send us a list of the parts

476
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,024
That you need to fix it

477
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:09,632
And so the mechanic gets on there and he says

478
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:10,400
Did

479
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:12,448
There's no it's not going to get fixed

480
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,472
The mechanics

481
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:14,752
Sergeant

482
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:17,312
Calling down the radio in town saying

483
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,080
The truck

484
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,104
Is blowing up

485
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,384
We can't fix it

486
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:21,920
And

487
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,456
And then command says why not

488
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,040
And in each other like what

489
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:29,344
We literally have the Jack the thing off

490
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:32,672
Try and change out a tire the mechanic sitting there

491
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:34,464
Amused look on his face

492
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,512
Going

493
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:38,816
You're not driving this thing off the mountain

494
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:40,352
It's been blown up

495
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,632
We

496
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:44,192
All felt like why are we up here

497
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,728
What is going on

498
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:49,312
They call the combat veterans the ones that have been there for

499
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:54,176
A lot longer in the Army we're all scratching their heads nobody understood why we were doing this

500
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:56,480
Eventually I'm about day 5

501
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,760
They told to head home

502
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:00,064
Another team will come and deal with the mrap

503
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:04,160
They're also instructed to take a different route back down the mountain

504
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:06,208
The pastor of Village

505
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:06,976
It's bad

506
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:09,792
Shane cross said it was military age men

507
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:10,560
No kids

508
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:13,120
I'll just stop and stare the Convoy

509
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:18,752
We passed some cattle by themselves and a burning like it was a smoldering campfire by self

510
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,872
I try not to sign also of welders unintended cattle unattended fire that was going

511
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:25,920
As in people booked and got out of there

512
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:28,992
I have this terrible feeling that we are about to get

513
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:31,808
Blown up or shot at Austin Lanford

514
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,368
Suddenly there's an IED explosion

515
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:36,416
Another truck hit and disabled

516
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:38,208
Well once again

517
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:39,488
That truck gets blown up

518
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,512
Right in front of me

519
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,560
We are like all right

520
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:45,120
Well we got to go assess the situation

521
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:48,448
So we get out an EOD guy gets out to

522
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:51,008
Explosive Ordnance disposal

523
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:51,776
Edamame

524
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:53,568
Is Josh

525
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:56,640
And so that you'll die without their sleeping with his little Minesweeper

526
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:58,176
And he comes across something

527
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,200
And

528
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,480
He picks it up

529
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,040
He starts pulling on it

530
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,064
And it's like

531
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,600
It's like a

532
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,136
A wire

533
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:10,464
I got buried wire and so you picking it up and sees it's like

534
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,000
String tied into the woods

535
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:15,328
And then he was going to drop it and goes oh s***

536
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:17,120
My first reaction was

537
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,936
That I cocked my machine gun

538
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:22,496
And I said out loud

539
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:24,288
I said let's do this

540
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:31,200
Great cliche I understand that but that was exactly what I did

541
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:32,736
That's exactly what I did I'm like

542
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,016
This is going down

543
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:37,088
There's not any way that we're not about to get attacked

544
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,624
It was so obvious

545
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,928
Okay let's do this

546
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:45,280
An RPG game like flying by us and

547
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:51,936
On the ground in front of us and right then like it scared the crap out of me because then

548
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,728
Gun started firing like

549
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:59,360
Immediately I get up and I freaking started sprinting towards the truck trying to find cover

550
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:05,504
This is what's called a complex attack they've been waiting for the Convoy to pass by this way

551
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,320
Now it's a mess of gunfire and explosions

552
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:11,392
Josh is a gunner so he's up in the chart of his truck

553
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,184
People below or calling out targets

554
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,024
13286

555
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,072
The attack is coming from everywhere

556
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:25,216
My platoon Sergeant gets in the truck and punching me on my ass and telling me to keep firing

557
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:27,008
So

558
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:33,408
You know I went through like 400 rounds initially and I keep firing keep firing keep firing and I don't I don't let up

559
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:36,480
Who was also a gunner but he wasn't in the turd of his truck

560
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:38,016
Zac farro was up there

561
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:42,880
Immediately Zack's gun jammed so bohan's his weapon up all the saw

562
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,160
Zach starts firing

563
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,864
Another guy no hands up his saw

564
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,912
The third weapon works

565
00:28:55,424 --> 00:29:01,568
Convoy needs to get out of this Ravine they're trapped in but now they've got this disabled truck which they need to tow out

566
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:07,968
So the platoon leader JP Billings jumps out of his truck to hook up a cable Shane was the gunner in that truck

567
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:10,016
He is he is y'all. Cover me

568
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:11,552
NEOS Adorn jumps out

569
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:12,320
It runs often

570
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:17,184
Macros are there really big heart also I can't see but here and

571
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:20,512
And here kid run off the truck behind us

572
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:22,560
Grab the cable hook to the hookah bar truck

573
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:23,328
And then rang

574
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,352
Climb back inside

575
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:28,192
I could see him if he would hit mud all over him

576
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,800
House Plaza mud from like Venom around hitting the dirt and slinging mud on to him

577
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,592
Oh my God

578
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:39,200
The inside he's TLC on go go for a hour drive

579
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:43,296
He yells office in Truckee says don't you ever let me do something like that again

580
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,856
It's our desire floor is it

581
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:46,624
And a cable snap

582
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:51,232
Intemperance calls out cover made out of vehicle again

583
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,536
Twice Billings goes out there

584
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,072
Second time to Cable holds

585
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:55,840
They move out

586
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:57,376
Air support Moves In

587
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:00,960
Incredibly no one from their unit got hurt during the firefight

588
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:05,824
One soldier who was there said that by the end he heard that up to 10 Taliban have been killed

589
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:09,408
Splatoon eventually limbs home back to the fob

590
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:12,224
The Emirates are all banged up flat tires in Vallejo

591
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:18,368
Here's my phone remembers about what happened when they pulled back into the wire after Amna

592
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:20,672
We get to the wire entrance

593
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,256
Commander standing there waiting for us

594
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,680
The grounds

595
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:38,080
Battalion Commander said something.

596
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:44,480
Did a good job out there I'm glad to see you back at congratulations anyone out there and proud of you

597
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:50,880
How are you feeling how's everything going he didn't say anything like that his concern was not anywhere close to

598
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:56,000
Hey how's the men's well-being doing how are my men were out there in a war zone

599
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,792
Didn't say anything like that

600
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:07,264
It's the ground in the first thing that comes out of our Battalion Commander whose mouth is what you couldn't shave

601
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:12,384
Who's usually pretty measure the way he talks to Mark in the phone calls

602
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:16,992
But whenever he talks about this incident whenever you talked at all about the Battalion Commander

603
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:18,528
Lieutenant Colonel Clint Baker

604
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:20,576
Spoken barely tapped out his anger

605
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:24,672
He goes on and on about the Shaving comment which he heard about second hand

606
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,976
Are you serious

607
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:34,144
We get back here and now we have to go shave

608
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,984
6 days movie

609
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,776
Because some jackass

610
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:49,760
Dave

611
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:53,344
Also but they shook it off

612
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:55,904
And then I allow guys carry to put a

613
00:31:56,672 --> 00:32:00,512
I like a disposable razor and just stuck it on their kit on their chest a thing

614
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:02,816
That's like a

615
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:05,120
Nothing where I can shave anytime I need to

616
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,656
So is like a little

617
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:07,424
Yeah

618
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:11,520
I was noticing the same thing as the other guys were

619
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:13,568
He's getting mad at the same things they were

620
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:17,152
Other guys might b**** about something and then flush it away

621
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:19,456
These things were sticking

622
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:22,784
Attaching two other incidents he'd already lodged in his memory

623
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,064
Starting in Alaska

624
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:27,136
Like pieces of a puzzle only he was putting together

625
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,232
In the phone calls Mark comes back again and again to Amna

626
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:34,048
Trying to fit correctly into bows overall argument

627
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:37,120
When you say the problem is you're talking specifically about

628
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:39,424
Putting people at risk

629
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:40,704
4

630
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:42,752
Things like retrieving

631
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:46,592
Broken equipment or are you talking about

632
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:49,152
Cuz I don't know I'm not sure

633
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:49,920
Yeah

634
00:32:56,064 --> 00:33:01,440
The most obvious complaint a soldier might have about Amna would be exactly what Mark is getting at

635
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:07,328
But it sounds like a wrongheaded Dangerous Mission and it's just luck that no one from his platoon. Hurt or killed

636
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:10,400
What would makes both Furious about the sauna incident

637
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:14,240
Wasn't so much the crappy communication between the mechanics of the Commanders

638
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:16,288
Or the being stranded for days

639
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:21,408
Or their unfortunate route home which clearly the enemy had had ample time to plan for

640
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,944
More than all that

641
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:24,480
It was a shaving thing

642
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,552
Yes and it was scary

643
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:31,904
When they come home the Battalion Commander doesn't acknowledge the scariness

644
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:36,512
Moreover to bow at least he seems unconcerned about the welfare of his men

645
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:39,072
That's what starts to feel scary

646
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:40,864
Maybe they're not in safe hands

647
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,192
An interesting Lee confusingly

648
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:47,520
But was also complaining at the time that they were playing it Tuesday

649
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:54,176
It was miserable but it was all so exciting especially for the new guys in the platoon who hadn't been in a wreck before

650
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:57,504
Something happened and they survived and bonded over it

651
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:59,552
Bodensteiner Sharon that

652
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,600
He hadn't fired his weapon

653
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:05,440
In an email to a friend who sent the day they got back from Mom. He wrote quote

654
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,976
I sat there and watched

655
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:13,376
There was nothing else I was allowed to do unquote he added but Afghanistan mountains are really beautiful

656
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,360
Josh Carter says he noticed something shift in bow after they got back from Moana

657
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:24,640
The tone change

658
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:28,480
I was in the truck with him a few of the missions after that

659
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:29,504
And

660
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:33,344
She was talking to one of the guys down below on the truck

661
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:39,488
And if they were to everybody's talking about the firefight and everything like that

662
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,512
Cuz that's like

663
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:46,144
The most significant thing that happened on deployment so of course everybody talks about it over and over again

664
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:48,960
And he

665
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:51,520
During the conversation

666
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:53,056
Said

667
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:55,360
All that stuff is just Bullshit

668
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:57,408
And like

669
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:59,968
What what's b******* about it

670
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,248
He's like

671
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,808
We should have gone out there and we should

672
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,856
Killed every single one of those guys

673
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:12,000
We shouldn't we should like he thought we were being cowards cuz we had no trucks and

674
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:15,328
We didn't go out there and do that and he's like well we go to these villages

675
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:17,120
And we hand out these

676
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:19,680
Blankets and all the stuff

677
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:21,984
We shouldn't be doing that we should be out there

678
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:25,056
Just killing these people who are shooting at us

679
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,848
Chinese people who are

680
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,688
Just don't care about Afghan people showing the bad guys

681
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,248
Then enemy he says at that point he's like

682
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:37,344
Our whole entire the whole entire Army is just

683
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,112
Pussies

684
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,648
Everyone's a pussy

685
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,696
Because we don't go out there and we don't

686
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:44,000
Kill the enemy

687
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,536
Like we're supposed to

688
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,120
I don't know if Josh's quotes are precisely accurate

689
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:51,936
But other guys have told me both sad versions of this sentiment

690
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,752
And it's true and understandable

691
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:58,592
The botox to Mark about a bunch of different feelings he had about the war

692
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:00,128
Wanting more action

693
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:02,944
But also feeling that they should be doing coin better

694
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,552
Should be working harder to engage with local Afghans taking every opportunity to talk to them

695
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:10,880
And he says he felt like and then a lot of guys felt like

696
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:13,184
Whatever it is we're doing over here

697
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,976
It's not helping regular Afghan

698
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,280
Everybody was saying

699
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:31,872
What we're doing here

700
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,992
All right

701
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:40,320
So I want to take a minute here just to stare at that notion

702
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:42,112
What is b*******

703
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:48,768
Respirometer for that is Jason Dempsey PhD he was in office

704
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:50,816
Easter at the Battalion and Brigade level

705
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:53,120
Any detours in both Iraq and Afghanistan

706
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:54,912
It was Irwin bullet missing

707
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,264
It was back in 2012 as a combat advisor to the Afghans

708
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,080
And then again in 2014 to see how that was going

709
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:04,384
So he's got a lot of perspective

710
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:07,712
I asked Jason was the mission b*******

711
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:15,648
The problem he said is that the Army said it was doing coin it planned its Mission and operations in Iraq and Afghanistan

712
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:17,440
As if it were doing coin

713
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:20,000
But it never fully committed to coin

714
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:24,352
Because we're going to work you've got to commit to a place for decades right

715
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:26,144
Probably 30-40 years

716
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:28,960
If you want to drive political change

717
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:33,056
You have to have people out there long enough to understand the politics of the place they're in

718
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:38,176
Jason said you can't rotate units in and out in 7 or 12 month increments

719
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:38,944
Unexpected

720
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:42,528
Are you really effective from

721
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:43,808
13259

722
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:48,416
Cuz you're just figuring it out but I prefer your rocking and rolling

723
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:50,208
You're really doing great things for 6

724
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:53,792
And then you're transitioning out for those last three months

725
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:55,328
And then whether or not

726
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:59,680
The lessons momentum you learned in those six months get carried on you might as well roll a dice

727
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:00,448
Really

728
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:02,496
I don't know that cuz another unit coming in

729
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:08,896
Play Mary not share your vision even if they do share your vision they spend the first three months confused themselves

730
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:12,992
The Army didn't really train units like bows for coin in Afghanistan

731
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:14,272
Jason said they couldn't

732
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:15,296
Not the time allowed

733
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,672
He said he and other soldiers were basically told if you make their lives better they'll support you

734
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:26,304
Sou nicastro Afghanistan but it doesn't really understand the society there who's who

735
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,400
What the power dynamics are the tribes the families the alliance's the ethnic groups

736
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:35,264
The whole root system of a country that's pretty much been at War on and off for 30 years

737
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:39,360
As you pump down and try to convey your message of Goodwill on the ground

738
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:40,640
It doesn't translate very well

739
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,176
If you're young

740
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:46,272
American freight company Commander or platoon leader you walk into

741
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:48,832
Your typical Afghan Village Circa 2009

742
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:50,624
And an elder approaches

743
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,440
What's up you guys doing here

744
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:56,512
Your average young lieutenant or captain

745
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:59,072
Where to make your life better

746
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:03,680
We want to build some roads you want to connect to the central government we want

747
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:07,776
And we just want to improve your life make sure your kids go to school

748
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,360
Camille

749
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:14,176
That is mine is like horseshit the Stooges lion

750
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:14,944
Jewish teeth

751
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,016
Who the f*** comes to Afghanistan to make my life better

752
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:20,320
It's an absurd notion

753
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,344
In the mind of this app

754
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:22,624
That

755
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,952
United States of America would send people around the world just a bill

756
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:26,720
Rhodes

757
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:27,744
Look like

758
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:33,376
Today at Kansas okay that's cool thanks guys going to meet you wash the way goes back to the Village

759
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,424
Say you should hear it

760
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,704
What does marigold mean

761
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:39,776
Glad to hear

762
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:42,080
In their communion sitting there and then

763
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:44,128
The hair cuz I hate Islam

764
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:47,968
Among those two messages for average Afghan

765
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:52,576
The idea that were there cuz I hate Islam is much more rational

766
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:55,392
Write for them it's just they're more prone to believe it

767
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:57,696
When we say we're here

768
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,512
We re saying to them

769
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:02,304
Without young Lieutenant going to say

770
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:07,680
We want to we want to get you on our side so that we together can

771
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:08,960
Get rid of

772
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:12,032
The Taliban in foreign fighters in the arms that are coming in

773
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:18,432
Or they just saying to know we just want to give you rice and gold Road

774
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:21,760
It's in our interest for you guys to be

775
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,320
Supporting our mission

776
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:25,856
It's a valid point

777
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:28,672
And a lot of times that would get lost though at the

778
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:29,952
Beijing level

779
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:36,864
Loss of the platoon level because if the soldiers don't know who's supporting them who's supporting the Taliban and why

780
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:39,424
Then of course the messaging is pretty crude

781
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:45,824
Is we never really understood all these overlapping power structures and incentives and relationships that

782
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:46,848
Pre-existed us

783
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:50,688
We never one that wanted to understand what the Afghan for actually

784
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:51,456
Doing

785
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:55,040
We just want to go to walk in and say Here's a template for how you should run an army

786
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:56,064
Go for it

787
00:40:56,576 --> 00:41:02,720
Getting hands dirty roses show you how we do

788
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:05,024
Great way to show you how much we do

789
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,816
And then if you don't end up doing that

790
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:10,912
It must not be because of Any structural issues underneath must be because you just don't care

791
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:17,568
And that's probably the most infuriating thing about all this is we have an entire generation of army folks

792
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:19,616
Marines Etc have gone through

793
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,432
And at the end of a deployment of

794
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:24,736
The Afghans just don't care about the

795
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:25,504
This fight as much as

796
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:28,320
Which is quite possibly the most

797
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:29,856
Preposterous thing you can say

798
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:31,136
The warning

799
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,672
They don't care about it

800
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:33,440
As much as we

801
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:35,232
Ground is

802
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,792
They're fighting their struggle

803
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:40,352
We're fighting hours

804
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:43,680
And we never bothered it's okay to these two things actually overlap

805
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:50,336
In November of 2009 then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton got a memo to the same effect

806
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:54,175
It's inside an email recently released by the state department

807
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:57,247
It's notes from a conversation and advisor clintons had

808
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:59,039
The guy named Bill Murray

809
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:03,903
He'd had a long and distinguished career at the CIA Heaven station Chief in Pakistan in the 90s

810
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:06,719
And all that apparently after starring in the movie Stripes

811
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:11,327
Anyway CIA Bill Murray said the same thing Jason is saying

812
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:14,399
There's a giant protracted misunderstanding going on

813
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:16,959
Teena Marie did not mince words

814
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:19,775
The memories almost like an urgent overseas Telegram

815
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:22,591
We are literally fighting the people

816
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:24,383
They think we are fighting Islam

817
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:26,431
The problem is not the number of troops

818
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,711
It's a failed mission

819
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:30,015
The Afghans believe we are there to stay

820
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:32,319
This is the thing they will never accept

821
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:36,927
They will allow armies to go through and even stay for a few years but not stay forever

822
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:38,719
I don't see how to make this work

823
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:41,791
Murray's overall advice

824
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:43,071
Bed and coin

825
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:49,983
Don't try to build the Afghan Nation or restructure society stop talking about democracy they don't care

826
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:53,055
Tell them you want to get Bin Laden and then get out

827
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:55,359
Inside the Army leadership though

828
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,639
Message was very different

829
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:58,687
It was we can do this

830
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:03,551
We keep trying we just need more time more money more men

831
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:12,255
Of course phone is platoon mates didn't have all this perspective

832
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:18,143
They might wonder whether what they were doing was worthwhile but mostly they were just doing their jobs doing what they were told

833
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:20,703
Knowing it was sometimes or often sucky

834
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:24,799
Right after I was sent with his platoon to mess

835
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:27,359
The little Outpost 20 miles south of Bob Serrano

836
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:29,407
Messed with deliver the rest of boast

837
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:30,175
Complaints

838
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:34,783
The messed Mission fit in exactly 2 Petraeus is coin idea

839
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:36,575
To get soldiers off the fob

840
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:39,391
Out into other more remote parts of Afghanistan

841
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:40,927
To work with and train local

842
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:41,695
Security Forces

843
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:43,999
When bo4 scotomas

844
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:45,791
In late May of 2009

845
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:48,351
There wasn't much of anything on top of the hill there

846
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:51,935
It was a cemetery and a tiny little bunker fortified with sandbag

847
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:54,495
So we're on this observation post

848
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:57,567
And they put pics of us up there the first night

849
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:59,359
Swell the first night

850
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:03,455
That Foxhole was big enough for two guys to be Undercover

851
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:05,503
So that's

852
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:06,527
Or guys

853
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:09,599
Sleeping out on a bare Hill

854
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:10,879
With a town

855
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:12,927
That is probably

856
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:15,743
Maybe 75 yards away

857
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:18,303
The bottom of this little Hill

858
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:20,351
Anybody could have

859
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:22,655
With that pillow

860
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:24,703
With an rpk

861
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:25,727
In

862
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:27,263
More than likely would have gotten

863
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:29,823
And this wasn't considered the

864
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:30,591
Security risk

865
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:32,895
This wasn't considered a safety

866
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:36,479
You know by the guys who put us up there

867
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:39,807
The sergeant that were up there made a call

868
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:41,599
Start digging a bigger hole

869
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:43,647
So that we can fortify the position

870
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:45,695
Here we are

871
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:49,279
Digging this hole in the middle of the Heat

872
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,303
Wave

873
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:51,327
The summer

874
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:54,399
And they called down

875
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:57,471
Staff score guidance on uniform

876
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:00,799
In other words are we allowed to take off some of our stuff

877
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:02,079
Best helmets

878
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:04,383
While we dig this hole in the punishing Heat

879
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:08,735
Members of getting a vague answer that amounted to yes

880
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:14,879
Greg weatherman who was in charge up there on the hill told doll that he did remember calling for instruction on uniform

881
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:17,951
We could see down below and they didn't have their gear on

882
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:21,791
Ask the commander when we are digging if we can take our gear off

883
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:25,887
He replied that as long as we were working on digging it should be fine I'm quote

884
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:30,751
Not all that uncommon for soldiers to do this by the way Ben the uniform rules a little

885
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:33,055
Austin Lanford wasn't messed to

886
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:37,407
He wasn't up above but he was doing similar work down below where the trucks were

887
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:39,455
Darrell Hanson was there as well

888
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:43,039
It was hot it was extremely extremely hot

889
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:46,879
And we're digging into a mountain full of rock so

890
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:50,719
You can either be in long sleeves pants and

891
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:53,023
Like the full kit

892
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:54,303
And die

893
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:56,863
Or you can drop load and

894
00:45:57,375 --> 00:46:01,983
Do it how you have to do it to get it done as fast as you can because time is of the essence

895
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:03,519
And so

896
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:04,799
You decide to

897
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:06,335
Put your sleeves up

898
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:11,711
You decide to take her helmet off and maybe put a bandana on to keep your sweat out of your face

899
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:14,783
And maybe you unblock your boots

900
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:15,807
Cuz

901
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:16,831
You're hot

902
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:21,439
So here we are trying to fortify this because the first night we slept out on

903
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:23,231
Open

904
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:29,375
And so Here Comes This BC

905
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:30,143
Clint Baker

906
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:31,679
Key of the Shaving remark

907
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:34,239
Of course Baker sees them out of uniform

908
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:36,799
And you come running up that hill by himself

909
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:39,871
With Afghan governor and his Entourage

910
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,663
He gets up to the hill

911
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:46,271
It doesn't stop to talk to anybody doesn't stop to ask what's going on

912
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:49,087
All he does is he gets in the face

913
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:51,647
Of the sergeant there doesn't give him a chance

914
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:55,487
To explain fully what's going on nothing but aggression

915
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:58,559
And he literally went up pesto

916
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:01,375
Priceless chestplate up against the other sergeant

917
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:03,935
Like trying to get into his face

918
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:07,007
And you can see nothing but

919
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:09,823
LED turns around and throw the floor shaking

920
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:10,847
Tantrum

921
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:17,503
Configure told General doll he remember the incident and said he was quote putting on a bit of an ax to drive a point home

922
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:18,271
Unquote

923
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:19,295
Tell

924
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:21,599
That reprimand might have been the end of it

925
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:25,183
Except there was a photographer hanging around the platoon at that time

926
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:27,487
Sean Smith of the Guardian newspaper

927
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:32,351
And he published a bunch of photos online above and the others not in their proper uniform

928
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:34,655
And that sent the commanders through the roof

929
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:48,223
Call

930
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:54,879
Will you guys you guys are as bad as child

931
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:56,927
If you'd murdered

932
00:47:57,183 --> 00:48:01,279
Village in Vietnam

933
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:04,351
Where is it why would you say that that's ridiculous

934
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:07,167
Because we

935
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:08,959
Yeah we we were

936
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:12,799
A little idea

937
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:24,831
When I first heard those account which again he was hearing second-hand since he wasn't in the room

938
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:26,367
I didn't quite believe it

939
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:28,927
I mean I believe they got chewed out but not to that.

940
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,463
I figured he was exaggerated

941
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:35,071
Carol Baker didn't respond to my request for an interview which I'm not surprised by

942
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:37,119
Until likely be involved in both court-martial

943
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:37,887
Proceeding

944
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:39,679
But I asked him about it

945
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:41,471
He was Colonel Baker's number two

946
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:44,031
It seems Kenny all the time about the photos to

947
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:46,079
Explain that yes indeed

948
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:47,615
This was a very big deal

949
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:51,199
Can you drop the guardian photographer at mess

950
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:52,991
And then kept driving further south

951
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:56,831
He was at another command center down there when someone showed him the photos

952
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:58,623
I interviewed Ken over the phone

953
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:01,439
If if we could ever find those photos

954
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:03,231
I'm pulling back up

955
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:06,303
Mishima shadam actually I just see like

956
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,071
Guys

957
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:13,215
Cheetah weapons at 1

958
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:16,031
Do you see by your body armor on

959
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:20,895
What does burning body armor look like except

960
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:25,247
Like if you see the video games

961
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:27,295
No I see guys

962
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:29,087
She guys with helmets on

963
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:35,231
Nobody knows a helmet on see a bunch of guys waiting to get f****** killed

964
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:36,767
That's what you see

965
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:39,839
The other thing that made Ken crazy

966
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:45,727
Was the way the weapons looked in the photos machine guns pointing up in the air not on tripods like they should be

967
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:51,359
I do look very hard at the photos even find the offending guns but Ken took it all in right away

968
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:53,151
Scarves on people's heads

969
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:56,223
And then there's Bergdahl standing off

970
00:49:56,479 --> 00:50:02,623
Toot to the right and go with the pipe with a pipe

971
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:03,903
This is the one where I said

972
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:08,511
I don't want to see more this f****** Lawrence of Arabia ship

973
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:14,911
Old points out to mark that pipes actually have a longer richer place in military history than cigarettes

974
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:16,191
General Patton

975
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:20,287
Anyway to can the whole scene screams lack of discipline

976
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,823
Alarm Bells went off

977
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:24,127
If you guys aren't following the basic rules

978
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:26,687
How can I be trusted when a bigger problem comes along

979
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:32,319
Prior to deployment Hannah sergeants had come up with uniform rules they all agreed to enforce

980
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:34,111
And now there were saying

981
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:36,671
I know it's against the rules but

982
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:37,951
But you know what

983
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:39,231
I think

984
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:40,511
I know better

985
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:42,047
I don't care

986
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:43,839
So do whatever the f*** you

987
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:47,423
I see and that's the breakdown in discipline in fact

988
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:49,727
Is it right thing whatever the f*** you want

989
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:52,543
Write 15 people in my life go ahead

990
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:56,127
Like if you go right there

991
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:57,663
You go you go there

992
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:58,687
In your head

993
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:05,855
Now do I think these guys are ever going to let you know

994
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:08,415
15 Afghans in a room and shoot him

995
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:10,207
No not at all

996
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:10,975
But

997
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:12,511
I surely didn't want to

998
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:17,119
To let it start and then this is early in the deployment I mean this is May

999
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:18,399
Yeah right

1000
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:19,935
Right

1001
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:21,983
Okay we've decided

1002
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:24,543
We're just going to do whatever we want

1003
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:27,871
So

1004
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:29,663
I'd wager bow heard what he heard

1005
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:30,687
Neligh

1006
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:33,247
And it was fun of you wasn't singular

1007
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:36,319
That leadership genuinely consider this worthy of punishment

1008
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:38,111
After the photo thing

1009
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:39,647
3 people got in big trouble

1010
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:41,695
Greg Leatherman was demoted

1011
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:44,767
And two other sergeants were moved sideways out of the platoon

1012
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:49,375
Tok Baker

1013
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:50,399
I turned against them

1014
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:52,447
He was going out of his way

1015
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:56,799
Everything is miserable as possible in an unnecessary way

1016
00:51:58,335 --> 00:51:59,615
What I thought

1017
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:03,199
And I saw the effect that had on the everybody

1018
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:08,063
I guess you weren't the only guy that felt that way obviously

1019
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:18,047
I was the one of many who thought it was a complete joke

1020
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:22,143
You were just going I can't believe this is happening

1021
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:23,679
I was mad about it I was

1022
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:26,495
So that was the stupidest thing I've ever heard like

1023
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,567
We're out here doing what you tell us to do like

1024
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:32,127
I didn't understand

1025
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:34,175
Why is Austin

1026
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:38,271
Can the other guys didn't like that they never got to explain why they were out of uniform

1027
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:42,367
Commanders reaction had less to do with the actual in fractions

1028
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:45,951
And more to do with the fact that photographic evidence of them was on a website

1029
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:47,231
Making the army look bad

1030
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:48,255
I can leadership

1031
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:52,095
Johansen said it felt like they were being judged unfairly

1032
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:53,631
Off of

1033
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:55,423
Picture

1034
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:57,727
You know they had no idea what we're about

1035
00:52:58,495 --> 00:53:00,799
And higher so worried about

1036
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:03,359
The way we look at our unprofessionalism

1037
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:04,895
Not knowing

1038
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:11,295
What the atmosphere is like what the actual Opie is like flies circularly constantly a hundred

1039
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:14,623
10 degrees no hot food no hot shower

1040
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:16,927
Getting shot at

1041
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:20,511
Kind of

1042
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:22,303
Ruined it

1043
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:25,631
Ruin the feeling Daryl had that they were really good platoon

1044
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:27,167
They were doing a good job

1045
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:29,215
The punishments messed with morale

1046
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:40,479
This is when those level of discontent boils over bodensee the commander

1047
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:41,503
Actions of corrective

1048
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:43,551
Is Autumn is punitive and where is

1049
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:44,319
Irrational

1050
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:46,111
Basically

1051
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:49,183
Things are falling apart

1052
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:52,255
You've been carrying around these worries for months he said

1053
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:54,303
The Omni mission of course

1054
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:56,351
Also talked to Mark and a doll

1055
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:59,935
About a couple of incidents where he felt like privates were being ganged up on

1056
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:02,239
Ncos raising them about their personal lives

1057
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:03,519
Who's offended by that

1058
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:07,359
But the uniform debacle and the photographs and Baker's freak out

1059
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:09,919
Turbo that was the last straw

1060
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:13,503
I ended up doing what I did

1061
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:15,039
Because

1062
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:17,087
He was out of control

1063
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:28,351
I wouldn't put it past

1064
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:31,423
Because the other person

1065
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:38,079
IDK yet

1066
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:43,967
He said his fear essentially was that Clint Baker would try to get rid of them

1067
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:46,271
Maybe by sending them on a suicide mission

1068
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:48,063
But they might get killed

1069
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:49,599
Simply because he didn't like them

1070
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:54,463
Botal General doll quote what could happen is this Battalion Commander

1071
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:55,999
CS my platoon

1072
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:58,047
As a stain on his reputation

1073
00:54:58,815 --> 00:55:02,143
Now sending us on a suicide mission wouldn't be the first in military history

1074
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:07,519
Somebody doing somebody giving out an order on personal agendas or off of personal grievances

1075
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:09,823
It is not going to be a first in military history

1076
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:12,383
So worst case scenario what happens

1077
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:14,687
Bizarre threat

1078
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:18,015
And I saw that somebody needed to do something about it

1079
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:21,599
Somebody had to do something that called the situation into check

1080
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:22,623
Unquote

1081
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:24,415
Go to sided

1082
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:26,463
He was the somebody who should do something

1083
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:27,743
He had to save them

1084
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:32,095
On June 7th to close friend back home

1085
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:33,375
Kim Harrison's daughter

1086
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:38,495
Bowser in case you guys get word of anything weird about me from the Red Cross in the military

1087
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:40,031
Please keep Kim calm

1088
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:42,079
He wrote quote no red flags

1089
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:42,847
I'm good

1090
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:44,383
But plans have begun to form

1091
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:45,663
No timeline yet

1092
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:47,199
Tourettes back

1093
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:49,247
Exactly what kind of plants are you thinking of

1094
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:54,111
About three weeks later it was when he walked off the opiate messed

1095
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:56,415
Hoping he says to cause a dust one

1096
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:58,719
Hoping to show up back at fob sharana

1097
00:55:58,975 --> 00:56:00,767
Hoping to tell his fears to a general

1098
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:02,047
Hoping to be listened to

1099
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:05,631
Thinking what

1100
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:07,679
Those are his reasons for leaving

1101
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:11,519
Because he decided his Battalion Commander was an incompetent a*******

1102
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:15,359
That's why he makes this nutty radical dangerous move

1103
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:16,639
What am I missing

1104
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:18,687
You Are Not Alone

1105
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:19,967
One thing Marcus

1106
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:22,527
We talked about this a bunch of times actually

1107
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:25,599
The first time he

1108
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:27,391
Kind of lay it out for me

1109
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:34,303
I don't think I said this on the tape but I was thinking like at the f*** out of here.

1110
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:36,607
Like what

1111
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:37,375
Okay

1112
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:43,519
There was no point in hearing that story that I thought oh great I have the answers cool

1113
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:48,895
Thanks it was more my reaction was more just like you've got to be kidding me

1114
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:52,735
All these years

1115
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:55,039
So many people around boat ride to figure out

1116
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:57,087
Is he selfish or selfless

1117
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:58,879
Is even telling the truth

1118
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:03,743
He was looking at the same set of circumstances as the other soldiers in his unit

1119
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:05,023
Why do you react so different

1120
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:06,815
Take such drastic steps

1121
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:08,863
How do you make sense of this guy

1122
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:10,911
Well

1123
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:12,191
We have to go deeper

1124
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:19,103

Coming up on the next episode of serial

1152
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:06,111
Here's a cute kid from Idaho

1153
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:08,415
Blonde hair and blue eyes

1154
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:11,999
First he's very quiet 19 year old kids

1155
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:17,375
Probably do something about that

1156
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:23,263
You are a lot of spandex in those days and then all the sudden he shows up in his uniform

1157
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:24,543
Kind of

1158
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:27,359
Wanting to serve and wanting to protect

1159
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:31,711
Were you trying to pass the time or did you literally lose your mind and now you just got it back

1160
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:35,039
They even when they hear the the tree story it's going to be

1161
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:37,087
There were two think it's crazy

1162
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:41,951
But will those people already filled with hate and filled with judgement

1163
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:43,487
Will they change their mind
