Back by 24/7 40

11
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:27,136
Before we get on with episode 2 some news

12
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:31,488
A few days ago the Army announced that it will take Bo Bergdahl charges to court-martial

13
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:32,768
The trial basically

14
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:34,816
He's charged with two crimes

15
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:37,888
Desertion and something called misbehavior before the enemy

16
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,704
That second one it's not used very often

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,008
They carries the possibility of a life sentence

18
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:45,056
Which doesn't seem likely that would happen

19
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:46,592
I be so extreme

20
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:50,176
What does mean both could face some amount of prison time if he's convicted

21
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:57,088
The Army's decision to go to court-martial It's not that it's so surprising I mean this is always a strong possibility

22
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:59,904
Interested for a lot of people watching those case

23
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,440
It's been hard to handicap

24
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:06,816
All outward signs of pointed to an army that is of two minds about how to deal with what bow did

25
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,352
Whether to throw the book at

26
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,448
Or whether to say okay yes he screwed up in a huge way

27
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:15,008
The Taliban enough is enough

28
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:19,360
On the one hand the Army level pretty severe charges against Bo

29
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:22,176
But that in a military Hearing in September

30
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:26,528
The two-star general in charge of investigating those case a man named Kenneth doll

31
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:32,928
Which of the 371 page statement from Beau who assemble the 22 person team who coordinated with twins

32
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:35,744
24 government agencies interview 56 people

33
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:40,096
He said he believed that boat told him the truth about why he did what he did

34
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,632
The boat was remorseful

35
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:43,168
Taobao recognizes quotes

36
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:46,240
That he was young and naive and inexperienced unquote

37
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:49,312
When asked on the stand where he thought they should go to jail

38
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:53,408
Major General doll said quote I think it would be inappropriate on quote

39
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:58,272
Likewise the officer in charge of that hearing Lieutenant Colonel mark visger

40
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,832
In his report on what to do about the charges

41
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:04,416
Apparently recommended a lesser proceeding called a special court-martial

42
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,952
More like a misdemeanor trial

43
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,488
He also recommended

44
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,512
No confinement

45
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,424
In response to which Senator John McCain arguably our country's most powerful former poww he was held for 5

46
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,704
Tigers during the Vietnam war

47
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:23,360
McCain told a Boston Globe reporter that if Beau got no punishment he told a congressional hearing to look into Bird dolls

48
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,128
Case

49
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:30,016
And then this week the announcement that the Army will pursue the charges in the most serious way possible

50
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,552
A general court-martial

51
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:36,416
It's almost as if those military officials who come into close contact with bow

52
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,696
Are ready to forgive him

53
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:41,280
Well the Army as an institution continues to be furious

54
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:45,888
Few months ago filmmaker Mark Ball was talking about on the phone

55
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:48,448
And they were discussing the possibility of a plea deal

56
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:50,240
The weather Bellwood taken offer

57
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:54,336
First one to three years in prison in exchange for pleading guilty

58
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,384
I didn't think you would

59
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,200
Even though the basic facts of the case aren't in dispute

60
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:02,272
Admits he walked away from his post of his own volition

61
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:07,392
I told Mark he wear that if he took some plea offer he'd never get to explain himself

62
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:09,184
And people would continue to hate him

63
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,976
And it's true a lot of people hate him

64
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:14,304
Without ever fully understanding his reasons for doing what he did

65
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,584
That was his fear

66
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,864
After all of this

67
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,656
It end up misunderstood

68
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,472
Exhausted as I am

69
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,824
Scary as it is going through all of it

70
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,384
I made it through last

71
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,152
Ears

72
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,504
Lose whatever it is

73
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:35,808
They keep me going

74
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:37,344
Yeah

75
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,416
I can respect that I mean I think that

76
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:43,488
Get that up now what I must be like

77
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,072
I'm almost make the whole thing playlist

78
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,424
Basically turn it on but really stupid

79
00:03:56,288 --> 00:04:01,408
From This American Life and WBEZ Chicago its serial one story told week by week

80
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,432
I'm Sarah Koenig

81
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:08,320
Good evening everyone or nearly the release of American servicemen after 5 years

82
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:14,720
Sources tell NBC that Bergdahl vanished under mysterious circumstances

83
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:21,119
Hero or deserter that the soldiers are engaging in political smear campaign by raising

84
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:27,519
Soldiers save our sons would be alive if Bergdahl had not gone missing from this post in the old days

85
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:38,527
Very last thing is

86
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,063
Just

87
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,623
I'm a prisoner

88
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,159
I want to go home

89
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:47,487
Bring me home

90
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,279
Please

91
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,119
Me home

92
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:00,287
I was talking on the phone recently to this Taliban fighter

93
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:03,103
I'm calling him we should keep her mind not his real name

94
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,383
You told me

95
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,247
But when they got Bowe Bergdahl when they caught him the Taliban knew they had scored

96
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,783
Mom said quotes

97
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,111
A Dead Soldier is worth nothing but he was captured alive

98
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,415
And he was like a Golden Chicken on quote

99
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:23,327
In the weeks and years really following both capture during the Tactical push and pull between the insurgents in the u.s. force

100
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:26,399
Each side would ask itself over and over

101
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,935
What is bow Worth to us

102
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,727
What is bulworth to our enemy

103
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,263
How much will we get

104
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,799
How much will you sacrifice

105
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:38,175
Remind describe one raid by US forces not long after bow disappeared

106
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,735
He said something like 15 Taliban were killed

107
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:44,831
American Special Operations Commander I spoke to describe the similar raid

108
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,367
15 enemy killed

109
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,695
I asked your mom through an interpreter who is sitting next to me

110
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,463
Was it worth it

111
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,023
15 of your guys in one raid

112
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:53,791
Virgo

113
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,327
Audio

114
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,775
Thousand individuals

115
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,543
Saying that

116
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:08,895
And he was work maybe more than 5000 individual

117
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:22,975
Exactly how did the Taliban get bow in the first place

118
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:25,535
And what did they do with him once they realized who he was

119
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:29,375
Merkel looked into this to knows his company page 1

120
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:32,191
I got in touch with a guy named Sammy yousufzai

121
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:38,591
Sammy's Afghan he's a reporter very brave reporter he's based in Islamabad but he travels around

122
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:43,455
For his work covering the war in Afghanistan. For Newsweek and other Publications

123
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:46,783
About a year-and-a-half ago page1 hired Sammy

124
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:53,183
Interview whomever he could and report back when he found and he did he didn't record these interviews on tape but Sammy fan

125
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:59,583
Found about a half-dozen people who said that either been part of the kidnapping or had interacted with bow while he was being held

126
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:03,935
What are the first people Sammy found was this guy named halal

127
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,727
Law is a Taliban fighter

128
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:10,335
Part of a group that was running missions in patica Province where most Battalion was based

129
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:16,991
All told Sammy is at the Taliban and gotten word from the local people in the area that sometimes a western or was coming

130
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,783
Close to the Village taking photos

131
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:22,879
And also that they'd seen a soldier sitting on top of a hill near us checkpoint

132
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:29,023
So alone if you guys had come to the Village to see if it was true and if it was to work out a plan to grab him

133
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:32,863
Kidnapping foreigners journalist Aid workers missionaries

134
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,167
This is big business for the Taliban at the time

135
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,191
And still is

136
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:39,263
I interviewed Sammy about what Halal told him

137
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,055
According to Halal

138
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:45,663
They just got into this Village to Mastin Factory Bose unit was Manning an outpost

139
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,455
They're taking a rest at the Moss

140
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:52,319
At that time so don't leave somebody shouted and said there is a

141
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,599
55 notice

142
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,903
And a coochie tents

143
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,207
Foreigner in a coochie tent

144
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:03,071
Coochie is a word for Nomads they keep flocks of animals and live in these big tents

145
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,375
In summer they open up the size of the tent

146
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,143
Fresh air

147
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,191
And

148
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,799
He's asking about Kabul or asking about please

149
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:17,663
And the Halal said you were an expected.

150
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,735
I know to what is this and then

151
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:23,551
He said okay let's go and find out

152
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:26,111
So how long is guys go to this coochie 10

153
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,927
They dropped on their motorbikes and see this Foreigner

154
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,719
Sammy tells it from hello

155
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,487
Perspective

156
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:35,071
And we told him that's we are please I mean

157
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:42,239
American normally working with the local militia which is not necessarily to be wear uniform

158
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,263
Right

159
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,895
And you told in police and he he look at us and then he jumped

160
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,175
Behind our bike

161
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:55,295
So is hello saying that we said oh we're local police

162
00:08:55,551 --> 00:09:01,695
Set it come with us or whatever and Bergdahl seem to believe that and think he was maybe in safe hands

163
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:08,095
Bakuchiol told him that this guy you don't understand his language versus asking about

164
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:14,495
Police in Kabul was asking for something else or something or

165
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:19,615
And that's why they came and he said he was

166
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:25,503
And now why dress and sandals and he had something in his

167
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:29,087
Pocket he said there was a pistol

168
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:32,159
Knife or something

169
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:34,463
I don't know really exactly okay

170
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:37,791
Does coochie tensing comes up in various ways

171
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:42,399
The Taliban say either but walked into a couch eaten or near a 10

172
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:45,471
The Americans got some Intel the time to the same effect

173
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:48,287
And that Nomads tipped off the Taliban

174
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,871
For his part Bo says he was never in a coochie time

175
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:55,967
He says he was out in the open when armed man wrote up on motorcycles and grabbed him

176
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:59,807
This is one of those discrepancies and there will be others

177
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,599
Where I feel like it's worth mentioning

178
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:05,695
Because if both did walk into a Gucci tennis Halala saying

179
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:08,767
Well that makes his own explanation sound less solid

180
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,631
Maybe he wasn't really trying to cause a dust one by running from Opie Mastiff ashiana

181
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,423
Maybe he was simply deserting

182
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:20,287
But I also can't tell how much weight I should really give this coochie tent story

183
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,311
Because

184
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,103
The Taliban bring up all kinds of her

185
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:26,431
Like the bow is in the village to meet up with a woman

186
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,967
He was looking for drugs

187
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:31,807
Rumors pretty much anyone who's ever met Beau can easily dismiss

188
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:34,367
And maybe the truth is somewhere in between

189
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:36,159
It's possible bow was near

190
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:36,927
Kuji cam

191
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,207
And just didn't know it

192
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:42,047
And that the Nomad saw him out in the open and alerted the Taliban

193
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,583
But was never the wiser

194
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,655
Probably we're not going to get to the bottom of it

195
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:52,543
Because we can't fact check the stories these guys told Sammy we can't be sure everything they told him is true

196
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,639
And the details of what happened do shift around depending on who Sammy's talking to

197
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:59,199
Which isn't unusual in any kind of reporting

198
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:02,271
What I can say is that the overall chain of events

199
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,831
The major plot points that the Taliban describe

200
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:07,135
Are pretty consistent person to person

201
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:14,047
And Sammy's interviews with these guys they don't seem that interested in pinning down exactly how both ended up in or near us

202
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,607
More what they want to talk about

203
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:19,167
Is how incredible it was that it happened at all

204
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:23,007
Doraemon and hello to everyone involved this is just

205
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,287
Kikuchi's

206
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,055
Nomad

207
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:28,383
People they consider unsophisticated and uneducated

208
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,663
Snag this Westerner

209
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:32,223
And not just any Westerner but an American

210
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:35,551
An enemy of the Koran of the pashtun people

211
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,087
And not just any American

212
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:37,855
Soldier

213
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:42,975
Reminder the whole thing the way they got him and just being up close with your adversary like that

214
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,791
It was one of those lifetime strange experiences

215
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,935
And it came to into a letter

216
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,983
Akai CD so easily

217
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,775
Time in Afghanistan

218
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,311
Amongst all the

219
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:00,639
Have provinces in the district

220
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,919
Review of blessed

221
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,319
We were blessed

222
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,391
Sammy's interviews they use his expression

223
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,439
They call BOA ready-made loaf

224
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,719
A gift from God

225
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,535
I felt so lucky that both came to them

226
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:21,887
Deval the desert joints in all the provinces in all of Afghanistan

227
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:22,911
He walked into their

228
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:28,287
LOL told Sammy that bow fought at first

229
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,567
But they subdued him

230
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,895
One of their bikes they took him back to the mosque

231
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:36,991
Boaz again resisting throwing punches

232
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,783
Or maybe his captors were beating him up

233
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,551
Clear

234
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,087
Is it doctor

235
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:44,927
Garlic butter jar was kind of resisting and start like a

236
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,975
Not giving up and he was a good

237
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:49,535
Punching Garcinia vs boxer kind of guy

238
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,607
N71 Pakistani Taliban

239
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:58,751
He came close to him and he sit down on his knees and

240
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:04,127
And suddenly you know Barbie doll kitchen with his repeater

241
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:10,527
Casa speech was open and we want to start joking with a real pain. Let's even this guy know you are

242
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,295
Pakistani

243
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,415
I'm laughing here is if I get the joke

244
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,183
I don't

245
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:23,071
And some of these conversations the Taliban describe Bo a strong and aggressive

246
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,863
Other times he's meat

247
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:25,631
Empathetic

248
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,679
The adjectives the apply to this method

249
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,447
Captive

250
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,471
Changing to suit the

251
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,239
Scene

252
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:37,151
I'll tell Sammy that for them for these coochies would maybe never been up close with a western before maybe not even with an n

253
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,431
Non-muslim

254
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,711
Exotic

255
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:43,039
Hello said he was like an animal captured by kids

256
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,831
His pale skin was weird

257
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,111
Spoke was weird

258
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:51,999
His eyes were blue which Sammy says it's somewhat suspicious in Afghanistan there's a saying that you should keep away from blue-eyed

259
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:52,767
People

260
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,119
Animas Colossus people had gathered to discuss what to do with them

261
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:59,167
I sent his notes from his interviews

262
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:03,519
Is one part Halal talks about how bow was sitting in a dark corner of the mosque

263
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:06,079
And another Taliban fighter said to him quote

264
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:09,919
You look like a small cat baby with shining blue eyes

265
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,271
I think this is something

266
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,551
Explaining somebody weakness

267
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,367
But I think

268
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,951
I think he said there was a he was very kind of weak

269
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:22,975
He was not like a

270
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,255
Big Americans

271
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:25,791
Ian Wallach

272
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,327
The big guy heavy Americans

273
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,119
They thought he was like a week Americans

274
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:33,983
Yeah I'm just looking in a note that you wrote that says Bergdahl was weak and I think brainless

275
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:40,895
Yeah yeah what does he mean by that was the stupid that's why he entertained their hands

276
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:50,879
Okay somebody coming and jumping anywhere bike

277
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,439
Was he scared I did he say

278
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:59,071
When he was crying sometime he was

279
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:05,727
Smiling and without what's happened to this guy but X he was fired into anybody giving water it was not.

280
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:06,495
Drinking

281
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:12,895
He said he was like a Buddha Buddha Buddha Afghanistan Bamiyan Buddha statue

282
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:17,247
So I guess at Sunoco

283
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:19,295
What's the weather's been going out on him

284
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,599
Are we thought he's drunk

285
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,927
Yeah apparently deep

286
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:30,047
I mean did you want me to watch or somewhere you know to release his

287
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,351
Drunk messaged Authority was John Cabot

288
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,375
She was not drunk

289
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:37,727
I'll also Sammy that to be fair he never actually seen a drunk person

290
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:40,031
Apparently they tend to think all westerners are drunk

291
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:54,111
Do I have to be extremely careful with my

292
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:58,719
Yeah

293
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:01,023
That's bow talking to Mark on the phone

294
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:01,791
Of course

295
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,327
Yes I was scared

296
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,351
Only rational

297
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,119
Be scared

298
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,959
When the Taliban guys explain to Sami how they kidnapped bow

299
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,775
It kind of wax romantic sometimes or crack jokes

300
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:15,103
There's a swashbuckling quality to Sammy's notes from his interviews

301
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:17,663
But then you remember Bo himself

302
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,455
Is completely at their Mercy

303
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,223
Terrified

304
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:22,015
For excellent reason

305
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:24,831
Is in the hands of people who conduct public executions

306
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,111
Mass beheadings

307
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,903
And often film them for propaganda

308
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:33,791
Movies you watched doesn't matter how long your Martial Art fighter whatever

309
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,583
You have to be realistic when your face

310
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,143
Shell

311
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,167
Yeah

312
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,775
They have no

313
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,567
Hesitation

314
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,383
Yeah

315
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,175
Kill you

316
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,759
Amusement of being

317
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:58,879
Ghostbuster was one guy in the Convoy who spoke a little English

318
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,159
And he has spoke questions

319
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:03,743
Was Bo a bit Commander with an intelligence officer

320
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:06,047
You said no

321
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,351
You said no I'm not

322
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,167
No I'm not

323
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,495
Did you tell did you explain to them while you were out there

324
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:19,615
Yeah

325
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:28,319
Is more suitable for the situation

326
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,623
And what did you say

327
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:39,327
Commando

328
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,143
Going through

329
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:52,383
I'm trying to get guys who barely speak English understand what I'm saying

330
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:59,551
Because they were

331
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:07,487
Disrespectful

332
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:12,607
So I came up with rude and they sing understand

333
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:16,703
Moses his memories from that time or sort of thin

334
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:19,007
In large part because he says he was blindfolded

335
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:22,591
It was focused on what was happening to him minute-to-minute

336
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,895
Trying to comprehend his circumstances

337
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,943
How you could possibly reverse them

338
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:29,503
They rode me around from a couple different places

339
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,271
Funny

340
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,319
It got me to

341
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,855
Small village

342
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,159
You pull me off this

343
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,695
Off the motorcycle

344
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,255
Stop being out on the ground then

345
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,535
Older guys

346
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,583
Came up I guess

347
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:48,447
She doesn't look like a younger brother is like younger buddy or something like that

348
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:52,799
Yeah it is cell phone on me like taking a video of me and

349
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:54,079
His body was like

350
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:57,151
Scary sitting off to sign you like you know

351
00:18:59,199 --> 00:18:59,967
American

352
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:02,015
And I just shook my head

353
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,319
And then he's fattening

354
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:09,695
And then I said that a few times all they wanted

355
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:13,791
Again

356
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:18,655
Well after they're done then they put the blindfold back on in a throw blanket over my head

357
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,191
And then

358
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:20,959
Safe

359
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:26,079
I don't know where that went but then like little kids started throwing rocks at me

360
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,615
Send up

361
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:31,711
Kind of pretended there like Flinch from

362
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:35,039
On the Rocks hitting head which kind of loud me to shift my weight

363
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,831
Sounds like trying to

364
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:40,671
Get my hands from behind my back and pull them around

365
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:44,511
It so I could get them in front of me

366
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:45,791
That didn't work

367
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:49,119
So then go try to lean forward so he could use his knee to move

368
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,399
The cloth off of his face

369
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:53,215
I kinda got it to point where

370
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:56,287
Seems like half off my left eye

371
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,055
Almost

372
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,847
May I start a blanket on my head

373
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:04,735
Nobody was really stopping and I didn't hear any voices I just like you

374
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,271
This is the best day

375
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,575
That is probably going to get so I just

376
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:09,599
Set up

377
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:10,367
Colton

378
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:14,719
I didn't get more than maybe 20 or 30 feet before he was tackled

379
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:16,767
I want felt like the entire Village

380
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,815
I was day one of his captivity

381
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:27,263
Buy 2009 and Afghanistan the US forces and the Taliban have been fighting for 7 years

382
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:30,847
In all that time there's never been a situation like this

383
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,895
American Soldier captured

384
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,431
It was a new kind of crisis

385
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:37,503
Eastside also knew who they were dealing with

386
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:40,063
They could anticipate what each other's moves would be

387
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:46,207
In his first few days bus knew that whoever had but would be moving him constantly

388
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:49,023
Cuz the longer you stay in one place the more likely you are to get caught

389
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:55,679
They also knew that the Taliban goal would be to get BO2 a hideout in the tribal region of Western Pakistan

390
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:57,983
Because Pakistan is like home base

391
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:00,543
Or to put it in Tom and Jerry terms

392
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:03,871
Pakistan is a hole in the baseboard where Tom cannot go

393
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:08,991
Pakistan is a Sovereign Nation are reported Ally we are not at war with Pakistan

394
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,807
Pakistan we can't do much about it

395
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:16,672
In Afghanistan US forces can go anywhere they want can do almost anything they want

396
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:21,024
Pakistan is much much harder for the US military to operate

397
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:24,608
Here's the other thing that happens once bogus to Pakistan

398
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:26,912
She becomes much more valuable

399
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:29,728
Because his captors don't have to get rid of him in a hurry

400
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,520
They can take their sweet time

401
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,056
Making the deal they want to make

402
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,176
Of course the Taliban knew that the US knew they had for Pakistan

403
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:40,480
The Taliban did the opposite

404
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:43,552
Instead of heading straight East to the Pakistan border

405
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,600
The Taliban guy Sammy talk to you said

406
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,136
They first took Bo West

407
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,416
The ghazni province

408
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:50,208
When was Akira mindless

409
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,144
Yeah, heading meal that should move in contact with Ramon

410
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,424
Earlier for page one

411
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:05,568
For this interview Sammy had a car pick Ramon up and they talk to me on a burner cell phone from inside the car

412
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,640
Which is parked in a residential neighborhood known to be fairly safe

413
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,040
Yeah

414
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:18,368
The call dropped about a half-dozen times during our interview

415
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:23,744
Michigan Rahman told me by the time bird dog came to him the plan was already set

416
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,072
Italian Commander named Kyrie Ismael sulaimon.

417
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,864
Taken charge of bow

418
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,448
And arrange to deliver him to a group known as a haqqani network

419
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,472
In Pakistan

420
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,800
In the meantime we should give her mom's orders were to

421
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:40,128
Keep both alive and out of sight for a couple of days and nights

422
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:43,968
Until the pressure on the border East a little and they could sneak bow across

423
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:49,344
By the time Ramon took charge of the motorcycle Convoy about eight people he said

424
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:54,976
Was obvious to the Taliban that US forces for pouring into Eastern Afghanistan to search for Bo

425
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:07,520
Endocrine surgeon else who that is playing today

426
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:13,920
And that's that was a reason you know we were moving around and I would buy hours

427
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:15,968
Changing location and we were left

428
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:18,272
Even though I'm never changing

429
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:22,880
Barbie dolls dress and maybe would have even if we were changing our address

430
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:23,904
FanDuel

431
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,720
At one point a we came

432
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:33,376
Hey Anna close contact with American Ground Forces by 500 while bulldog

433
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,912
Was with us

434
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:42,592
Halal told Sammy that at one point his Convoy had come within a kilometer of fob sharana or bozone.

435
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,872
Italian was based

436
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:47,968
But even if bowhead wanted to scream or make a commotion he couldn't have

437
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:49,504
His hands were tied

438
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,576
Add a large cloth wrapped around his head

439
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:55,904
Partly to disguise them but probably just to keep the dust off his face

440
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,440
They all wear them against the Dust

441
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:02,560
These were probably the most stressful two days of any Mission he'd ever done

442
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:07,680
Korea smile stayed in constant contact with his guy in Pakistan from the haqqani network

443
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:12,288
Mom said they used fake names and locations of the walkie talkies to confuse the Americans

444
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:14,336
That US forces tracked him anyway

445
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:16,128
Attleboro occasions

446
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:19,968
Accu we stayed in at my location

447
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:23,808
And then there were three hours later

448
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,344
American forces

449
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,696
Team and add to that place to that house and search that has

450
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:34,816
By this time of course word has spread all over the region that a US Soldier had gone missing

451
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:37,376
The military air drop leaflets saying quote

452
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:41,216
One of our American guests is missing and give a phone number to call

453
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:45,312
Another one handed out about two weeks after bow disappeared was less gentle

454
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,872
It should arm Western forces kicking in a door

455
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:53,248
News report translator the text as quote if you do not free the American Soldier you will be targeted

456
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,040
The Army claimed the leaflets

457
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,576
Hunted not targeted

458
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,624
Which actually sounds scarier to me

459
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:00,672
They also distributed chocolate

460
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:06,560
Sami Yusuf say interviewed some of the people who lived in or near mustache run at the time and they remember the Chaka

461
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:08,096
Wrapped in shiny paper

462
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,888
They also remember helicopter

463
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,168
There's all over the place

464
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:13,472
And that the Americans were saying bergdahl's name

465
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:16,032
Or at least a word that had a bee sound in it

466
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,360
Volkner Mobil

467
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:22,944
Yogakaraka

468
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:28,064
The people Sammy talk to you said they'd heard the missing Soldier had been wandering around drunk when the Taliban grab them

469
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,344
Just as hell all hits

470
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,904
Suspected does a common rumor that but was drunk

471
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:36,256
Or that he's gone to a holy site or that he tried to fight off the Taliban with karate

472
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:41,376
In classified US military Communications released to the public by WikiLeaks

473
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:45,216
There's all this chatter on the ground that first week after but went missing

474
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:48,544
On July 1st 2009 the day after Bo disappears

475
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,592
An llvi traffic report

476
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:53,664
Lvi stands for low-level voice intercept

477
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:57,504
Technology we use to eavesdrop on any voice or data Communications

478
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,040
Picks up this conversation

479
00:25:59,296 --> 00:25:59,808
Quote

480
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:02,368
Is that true that they captured an american guy

481
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,392
Yes they did

482
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,416
He's alive

483
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,696
There's no way he can go

484
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,720
LOL

485
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:10,304
After former soldier who regularly read such messages

486
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,608
What LOL means in this context

487
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:15,680
And he said the only meaning that seems plausible to him was

488
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:16,960
Laugh out loud

489
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:19,776
Then a few hours later there's this intercept

490
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,824
We were attacking a post

491
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,640
He was sitting taking expletive and had no gun with him

492
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:25,920
He was taking expletive

493
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,456
Is not clean his butt yet

494
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:28,992
I think he's a big shot

495
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:30,784
That's why they're looking for him on quote

496
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:35,904
Mujahid Rahman of course understood bow was a US Soldier

497
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,952
But he didn't know precisely what kind

498
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:41,536
He said the intensity of the surge did suggest bow with a big shot

499
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:45,376
Why would they put all that effort and money into looking for him if he wasn't important

500
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,472
Ramon said he'd heard foreign soldiers were sometimes trained in martial arts

501
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:52,800
At first he and his men were very careful around their prisoner

502
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:57,152
But pretty soon Ramon says his main impression of boat was that he was just really scared

503
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,064
Sleep

504
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,112
And then because

505
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:10,720
He was thinking that what type of people are

506
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,256
We might be

507
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:16,096
And now what are we going to do with him or we going to

508
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,888
Hannah Callahan

509
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:21,472
And then we'll be going to behead him

510
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:27,872
How what are we going to do with him so that was his situation he was very scared in that we

511
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:28,896
You can confuse

512
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:31,456
Ramon said he didn't feel sorry for bow

513
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,992
I didn't think of him as innocent

514
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:36,320
From his point of view but was like all US soldiers

515
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:39,136
He traveled Halfway Around the World voluntarily

516
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:41,184
Turn day their country and kill Muslims

517
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:46,048
Remind most of the guys Sandy interviewed they also talked about how bow is there gas

518
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:47,840
How Humane they were with him

519
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:49,632
Jarring to hear

520
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:54,240
Maintain your guest to the back of a motorcycle against his will doesn't sound like great host Behavior

521
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,800
Explain to me they're not being ironic

522
00:27:57,056 --> 00:28:01,152
Pashtun culture a guest is always treated with generosity and respect

523
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:04,736
And so the fact that Bo was labeled a guest in the situation

524
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:06,784
Made it clear to the lower down guys

525
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:10,112
Is under Korea Smiles command that they're not allowed to kill him

526
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,392
Or even beat the crap out of

527
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,744
Which reminds that was a real concern that some Al Qaeda or Taliban fighters

528
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,816
Especially if they had family members killed by Americans

529
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,096
Might try to kill Bo

530
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:21,888
Or the kidnapping for themselves

531
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:26,752
One of the lvi messages from July 1st the day after the last trades

532
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:28,544
Unidentified male says

533
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,824
Cut the head off

534
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:32,640
Remind himself

535
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:34,432
I've been a prisoner of The Americans

536
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:36,992
He said he was held at Bagram for about 2 years

537
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:40,064
And he said he made sure to treat bow better than he been treated

538
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:42,624
Quote someone who's in your custody he said

539
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,904
You treat him nicely

540
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,672
Unquote

541
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:49,792
I want Point Ramon says they stop the Convoy and what he calls a wine field

542
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:50,816
Like a grape Orchard

543
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:53,376
They gone there to hide from us helicopter

544
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,704
And while they were there they tried to help bow out

545
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,984
To make him feel better

546
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,080
I just threw boost his morale into

547
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,360
A cheating man

548
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:06,944
We stopped at this time

549
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,736
We did this

550
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:10,016
A little

551
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:13,600
Traditional dancing

552
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:14,880
Mohican

553
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,672
New start eating game

554
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:22,048
Benetton is an Afghan dance where typically there's a drum and you move in a circle and unison

555
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:27,680
So apparently they did one for this frightened American soldier in a grape Orchard

556
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:31,264
Did it work did it boost his morale and get him to eat

557
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:34,848
New singer that fight a wolf

558
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:40,224
Singapore dollar

559
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:47,136
No I did not have that did not help at all

560
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:49,440
Even

561
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:52,512
And have an adverse effect on him because

562
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:54,304
He did not know

563
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,840
Why we were doing that

564
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:01,472
Grape Orchard

565
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:02,496
That's bow

566
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:07,104
Who says he has no memory of this event

567
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,640
Please never seen an Italian

568
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:11,200
Set a video of the Taliban show too much later

569
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:19,648
Kenneth wolf was command sergeant major of the five-oh-first back window disappeared battalions highest-ranked

570
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,184
Commissioned officer

571
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:24,000
He said it first he thought they'd find bow

572
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:26,304
And I told the colonel I said you know what

573
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,352
I'm going to stick around here for a few days

574
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:29,376
Because

575
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:31,424
If we find him

576
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:33,216
I want to be on there

577
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:34,752
Helicopter that picks him up

578
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:37,824
And he was like why not

579
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:39,872
They're going to whip his ass

580
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:42,176
Meaning boughs fellow soldiers

581
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:42,944
I'm going to whip his ass

582
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:45,248
What was it wrong to worry about that

583
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,784
If we would have found them

584
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,576
I think a lot of us would have shot him

585
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:49,856
That tells you nothing

586
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:51,648
That's Darrell Hanson when a bone spur

587
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:52,416
14 minutes

588
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:54,208
I truly say that with

589
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:55,232
Sincerity that

590
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:57,280
I we had that much hate toward

591
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:58,304
We

592
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,328
Aided

593
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,912
Absolutely hated him

594
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,704
Does Mark McCrory

595
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,984
A specialist in the five-oh-first

596
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,520
But a different company from bow

597
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:11,360
Was like well we see him he's not going to last you know

598
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:14,176
Like seriously or just kind of blustery

599
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,200
Like I'm really pissed

600
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:17,504
Or oil you really think like

601
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,296
Yeah

602
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,064
You do

603
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:21,344
Yeah

604
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,160
Well

605
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:29,024
I mean I don't know what kind of light that shut does not like Jets on us but he was one of those things where

606
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,072
The conversation had come up

607
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:33,888
I found this shocking and disturbing

608
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,960
But some of these guys were saying they might have killed though if they'd found them

609
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:40,544
But now after interviewing more than a dozen soldiers

610
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,080
I still don't sympathize with running

611
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:42,848
Kill him

612
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,176
But I do understand why their anger was so extreme

613
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:46,944
I got it

614
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:51,552
The dust one search and Recovery operations lasted

615
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:53,344
Officially for 45 days

616
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:55,648
Some people can't and it went on even longer

617
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:59,744
Are the most frantic time the soldier said was those first few weeks

618
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:06,400
They told me to search for both started in the immediate vicinity of where he went missing from opms in eastern Afghanistan

619
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:10,240
Right away at 9 man foot patrol headed out from the Opie

620
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,776
For the boys school in Melaka

621
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:14,592
Lieutenant JP Billings bows with cheerleader

622
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:19,456
So they came across a boy who told Billings yes he had seen an American in a field that morning

623
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:22,272
And he gave a specific time 6:02 a.m.

624
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:24,576
Because of his sleeve to show is Casio watch

625
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:29,440
It's a boy saying that scene in American low crawling on the ground

626
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:31,744
Or nearly fainting from dehydration

627
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,072
Couple of ports noted that they were also giving out candy to the kids

628
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:37,376
In one instance the kid got some Pop-Tarts

629
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,424
Which is notable

630
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:46,336
An army report on beau's disappearance suggests maybe it was our initial search maybe even this first Patrol

631
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:47,872
But led t'beaux's capture

632
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:52,480
But the soldiers handing out candy and asking these questions tip the kids off

633
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:54,272
And ultimately the adults

634
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:55,808
And then the Taliban

635
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:57,344
An American was missing

636
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,392
And so they went out looking for him and grabbed him

637
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,488
Which supports what Beau says that the Taliban rode right up to him on motorbike

638
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,864
Who says he hadn't told anyone what he plan to do

639
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:10,400
So no one in his unit or is

640
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,704
Battalion has any idea why he left

641
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:13,728
How could they

642
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:17,824
Only have to go on is whatever early Intel is coming in

643
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:19,872
I remember where I heard it from but I

644
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:21,408
Remember hearing that

645
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:24,992
He was in the town asking if people

646
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:26,016
Spoke English

647
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,552
And then that's where he

648
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:28,320
Was now

649
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:31,648
That's Austin Lanford another of those which inmates

650
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:36,256
A bunch of people I spoke to remember a report like this coming over the transom

651
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:38,048
I think they probably got it

652
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:45,216
In the Wikileaks release from the day but went missing there's an entry saying they picked up lovi traffic indicating quote

653
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:49,312
Did an American Soldier is talking and is looking for someone who speaks English

654
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:51,616
American Soldier has camera unquote

655
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:55,712
Which country is an image of both seeking contact or maybe help

656
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:01,344
Several people who know how military Intel Works told me these llvi reports can be tricky

657
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,160
The quick translations of over her chatter

658
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,184
Nuance is lost

659
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,488
Mistranslations are not uncommon

660
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:08,512
So for what it's

661
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:13,120
The search for boat was enormous

662
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:17,472
By the late afternoon of June 30th 2009 and had ballooned

663
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:22,080
Weirdos out that quote all operations will cease until missing Soldier is found

664
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:27,456
All assets will be focused on the dust one situation and sustainment operations unquote

665
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,760
Search all of PepsiCo

666
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:32,064
Province and neighboring pitea Province to

667
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,088
I need to Cosmoprof

668
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:33,856
Suncoast

669
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:35,648
Thousands of square miles

670
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,464
Anything they needed to make it happen they got

671
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,048
Planes helicopters drones interpreters elite units

672
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,584
Special Forces

673
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,888
Hundreds of people stopped what they were doing

674
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:48,960
Even if your job was to look for Osama bin Laden

675
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:49,728
Now

676
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:51,264
You're going to look for the best one

677
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:56,896
There was snapping into action because of a basic ground-floor principle of the army

678
00:34:57,664 --> 00:35:00,224
You do not leave anyone out there in a war zone

679
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:06,112
The military knew that the

680
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:10,720
The first 24 to 48 hours would be the most critical. If they're going to find him

681
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:15,072
Based on some fancy until they understood pretty quickly that bow him and captured

682
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:21,728
And I knew whoever had him would be on the move and therefore talking on radios our phones the whole time trying to figure out their own

683
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:26,592
30 intercept that chatter you can maybe geolocate or bow might be

684
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:30,944
Battalion Commander Quest as much signals intelligence as it can get

685
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:34,016
Intercourse needs more soldiers to check out all that Intel

686
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:35,808
Five more platoons join this

687
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:38,880
An eight more platoons the entire Brigade gets pulled in

688
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:41,440
When Commander told me was like a mini surge

689
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:43,488
LIRR operation

690
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:44,256
Beltempo went

691
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,024
Some sort of

692
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,328
Casual

693
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,608
Presence Patrol

694
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:51,424
Driving around handing out stuff

695
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:56,032
Cordoning IDs Tilley OD came out

696
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,312
This is John Thurman

697
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:58,592
He was in Blackfoot company

698
00:35:58,848 --> 00:35:59,616
Bose company

699
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:00,640
Different at 10

700
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:01,664
2

701
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,944
I mean nonce

702
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,480
Stop it was Round the Clock

703
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:07,296
Webe

704
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:12,672
Chicken indoors 1 minute setting up a blocking position and searching every single car

705
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:13,696
An hour later

706
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:16,000
A blocking position was basically a roadblock

707
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:20,608
Official mission in Afghanistan in 2009 was counterinsurgency

708
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:21,888
Coin for short

709
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,496
American forces were supposed to be containing the insurgents but also training Atkins

710
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:27,520
Security Forces

711
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:29,568
There was supposed to be engaging the local

712
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:30,592
Getting their trust

713
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:31,872
Improving infrastructure

714
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:33,664
All that pretty much stopped now

715
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:34,944
Here's Mark McCrory

716
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:37,760
Sure there had been fights that have been going on but

717
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:40,064
They weren't fights that we were picking

718
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,392
The bad guys win

719
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,160
Would come to Austin

720
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,000
Where is this was us going out every night

721
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:50,048
Looking for a guy smashed down the door

722
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:52,096
We were just looking and looking and looking

723
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:53,632
Jon Foreman again

724
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:54,912
I mean towns

725
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,704
I don't even know if these towns

726
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,984
Scene Americans

727
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:58,752
Ever

728
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:04,640
Okay now we're going to fly you into this Bedouin Village and you're going to you're going to go check every single building a room and end

729
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:06,176
Check all the woman's face

730
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,200
Just to make sure

731
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:07,968
That they're not

732
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:09,248
Hiding him in women's clothes

733
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:12,320
That's been Evans a specialist from Charlie Company

734
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:15,392
He said there'd been in tell that they dress bow is a woman

735
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:17,184
Wichita imposes a did

736
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,488
And so we you know when into this house

737
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:22,304
And then whenever you go into a house to do a search

738
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:27,424
All the women would typically huddle into one corner together and normally we wouldn't pay them any mind

739
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:29,728
Does just leave them a B&O

740
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,848
But the but at that point we can had to walk over and I had to I mimic

741
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:36,640
You know removing your Veil

742
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:37,920
Remove your bail so we can

743
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:39,712
Can see this kind of stuff

744
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:42,528
Making women lift their veils are kicking in doors

745
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:45,088
Doesn't exactly endear you to local populace

746
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:47,392
But didn't have time to worry about that right now

747
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:50,464
Any little fragment of actionable intelligence

748
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,048
They're moving him in a white truck they're heading over to someone at this location

749
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:56,096
Didn't have the luxury to ignore any of it

750
00:37:56,864 --> 00:38:01,728
You can see on paper in those Wikileaks releases all the scrambling that was going on those first few days

751
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:04,544
June 30th 2009 the table left

752
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,896
Update 140 tab has Intel that Taliban is planning to move the u.s. pack

753
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:10,688
Paxton's personal passenger

754
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:11,456
Theguardian

755
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:13,504
Next day July 1st update

756
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:19,648
Delaware 36 reports they have received Intel that the body of the missing US soldier is due east of their current position

757
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:26,048
July 4th update spot report missing US soldier was last seen in a village at grid location VB 611

758
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:26,816
N818

759
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:30,400
A bag was covering his head and he was wearing dark khaki apparel

760
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,168
And so on

761
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:32,192
Day after day

762
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:33,728
Here's Mark McCoy

763
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,520
Apparently at one point

764
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:36,288
These guys

765
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:38,080
Said they intercepted a phone call

766
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:39,104
Where

767
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:43,200
Is one member of the Taliban speech to another and they said hey the Americans are right out

768
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:43,968
Side

769
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:49,856
And we've got this guy with us and so it like that goes all trickles all the way up and then all the way back down everybody freeze

770
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,904
Oh but you got you don't stay where you are

771
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:55,232
Set out an outer cordon and search wherever everybody is

772
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:56,512
But by the time

773
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:58,048
Information and traveled all the way up

774
00:38:59,072 --> 00:38:59,584
Back down it was already

775
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:06,240
Despite the massive resources at their disposal the Americans were at a certain disadvantage in that landscape

776
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:08,544
Because any movement of US forces

777
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,104
Giant armored trucks and helicopters whatever

778
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,384
Makes a lot of noise

779
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,408
Kicks up a lot of dust

780
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:15,712
Taliban could be more nimble

781
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:18,784
Screwing around on small roads or pass off and on motorcycles

782
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:24,416
As soon as they saw her that the enemy was coming their way like we were charging

783
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:25,184
Pounds

784
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:30,560
Running out of our trucks like he's in here we're running to this clot that's Darrell Hanson again

785
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:32,608
A clot is a kind of compound

786
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:36,192
Going in with Guns by the fact I'll never forget we ran into

787
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,800
And as we're running in this freaking cow has a baby like right next to me

788
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:44,640
Outcome you scared the hell out of the cow and I just had it

789
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:48,736
So yeah it was it was very intense yeah

790
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:53,856
Just you know we're always seemed like one one one day behind where is that

791
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:58,464
The Americans were certainly on the right track

792
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:01,536
The Battalion leadership met with a local Afghan leader

793
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:04,864
Reported that Bill had been turned over to the local Taliban leader

794
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,888
Qari Ismail

795
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,680
Just like a little Sammy

796
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:13,056
Pretty sure those Taliban guys would turnbow over to the haqqanis and pack

797
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:13,824
Stan

798
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,616
In North waziristan to be precise

799
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:18,688
It also got an Intel that Bo might be in ghazni

800
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:20,224
Just like mujahid Rahman said

801
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:25,344
In fact your mom told me that a few days after he returned from delivering go to Pakistan

802
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,136
He got rolled up by The Americans

803
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:27,904
Detained

804
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,440
Questions about Bo

805
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:34,816
Ramon said everyone's getting questioned about though people from down south in Kandahar in from out west in herat

806
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:39,936
I sure the US had in front of them the very man who had shepherded bow to the haqqanis

807
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:42,240
Is Ramon told them

808
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:50,432
I have not seen this person and I don't know who this person and I haven't heard

809
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:53,504
So that was a lie

810
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,576
Add apply all the time to the Americans

811
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,392
Pulling into towns you're unfamiliar with

812
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:02,720
Based on single Source intelligence or conflicting intelligence

813
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:06,048
Almost no time to prepare your team for what's awaiting them

814
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:07,072
It's risky

815
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:12,448
Any more typical operation you mitigate the danger maximize the chance for success

816
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:16,800
By doing everything you can in advance to do what's called shape the battlefield

817
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:19,360
He might take a few days to plan and prepare

818
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:22,176
Now commanders were lucky if they got a few hours

819
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:23,968
Sometimes they felt like they were winging it

820
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,088
Special Operations Commander told me his team when I'm more than 50 missions looking for Bo

821
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:33,696
How many of those were during the day rather than at night when his guys have the advantage

822
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:35,488
Quote we don't work in the day

823
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,512
He said

824
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,584
Major Mike Waltz

825
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,888
Was commander of a special forces company

826
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:44,704
He's in charge of 7 Green Beret and one Navy SEAL Team

827
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:47,008
He took over the command on June 30th

828
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:48,032
Same-day bow left

829
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,640
Well infantry soldiers were out searching cars are going house-to-house in villages

830
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:54,943
What's his teams were conducting raids

831
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:55,967
Usually at night

832
00:41:56,223 --> 00:42:01,087
Targeting specific compounds or houses where they hadn't elbow either was or had been

833
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,623
Any shred of evidence

834
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:04,671
That burger had been there with

835
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:05,951
We thought he was there

836
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:07,487
A sighting

837
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:09,023
It wasn't really vetted

838
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:14,911
It wasn't buttressed by other types of reporting there was there was just no time to check on it we just went

839
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:16,703
And I can't emphasize

840
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:19,775
I can't overemphasize how dangerous that is

841
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:22,847
1 sisters one mission that still freaks him out

842
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,639
His man went to ghazni

843
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:26,943
He says most of his missions were ordered in ghazni

844
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:33,343
And it had information that a young white male surrounded by Fighters have been seen in particular compound that day

845
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:37,183
So as fast as they could they got the helicopters together they heading out there

846
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:37,951
What time is it

847
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:39,231
Substantiate anything

848
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:41,791
They arrived and walk into the compound

849
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:43,583
Define the whole thing is booby trap

850
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:47,935
The team went in and looked up and saw the ceiling lined with C4

851
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:50,751
And then there was also a car bomb

852
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:52,031
With with the trunk

853
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:54,591
Packed with explosives sitting in the middle of the compound

854
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:56,127
Now by the grace of God

855
00:42:56,895 --> 00:43:02,271
They evacuated before the thing to go off and it never did but I would have easily lost 20 to 30

856
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:09,695
American Green Berets that night had that thing go off and it quickly became very apparent to us that the Taliban new

857
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:11,487
And our sources began telling us

858
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:15,839
That the Taliban and the haqqani network knew that we were pulling out all the stops

859
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:16,607
To find him

860
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:19,935
And we're feeding false information into our informant Networks

861
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:29,407
All right

862
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:31,967
You got the most advanced military in the world

863
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:36,831
All this effort all this expertise and Technology are trying to find one person

864
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:40,415
Did you pull out all the stops just to get one soldier back

865
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:41,695
That's really something

866
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:43,999
Then they can't find it

867
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:47,583
And I'd only that in some instances there being played by the enemy

868
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:48,607
Learning to trap

869
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:50,399
What is going on

870
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:54,495
I don't quite understand if he should be impressed by this operation or dismayed

871
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:58,591
Jason Dempsey to answer this question for me

872
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:02,687
At the time bow disappeared Jason was a major in the 10th Mountain division

873
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:03,967
An operations officer

874
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:06,271
He planned military operations

875
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:08,063
Battalion base in logar province

876
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:10,111
Just north of pek Tikka and bacteria

877
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:14,463
I've already Jason a couple of times now and what I've learned is that he's very smart

878
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:15,743
Mercante

879
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:17,023
Stop fidgeting

880
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,047
Can't sit still

881
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:21,375
Ostensibly conducting counterinsurgency

882
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:26,751
Forgot the washing dishes

883
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:30,335
Jason's got a PhD and is taught at West Point

884
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:32,895
Centaurs in both Iraq and Afghanistan

885
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:36,479
And it's not a lot about what we did and didn't accomplish and I've got us

886
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:37,759
His knots

887
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:39,039
Surprised we didn't find Bo

888
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:43,135
When I think about what was happening I just have this image of

889
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:44,927
Like this

890
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:45,951
This big

891
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,511
Machine

892
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:53,631
That's like moving around in this region in Afghanistan and there's just like a mouse

893
00:44:53,887 --> 00:45:00,031
Running through the legs on Star Wars

894
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:06,431
Comes with his little thing and he's just like type of the legs and falls over I mean I know that's not fair but but

895
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:08,735
True it's a great analogy right you got it

896
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:11,807
This big lumbering machine moving through

897
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:15,135
So I can destroy anything face on butt

898
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:19,231
It can't get it has no idea on a granular level

899
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:20,767
What's below it

900
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:25,887
Json says what's down there on the ground or towns we don't understand

901
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:31,007
Where regular people and government officials and the Taliban are impossibly in mashed

902
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:36,127
We're civilians might hate the Taliban but they might hit the Karzai government even more

903
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:39,199
So it's not clear at all that the u.s. is the team to root for

904
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:39,967
Help

905
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:44,831
It's not as simple as these people are loyal to our side and those people are loyal to their side

906
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:45,599
It's fluid

907
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:52,767
At that time and that part of Afghanistan we just didn't understand incredibly complicated politics of these town

908
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:55,583
Yeah we we pékin Target or track

909
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:02,495
Individual network but we never really wrabel the tie-in okay Which towns and Villages and

910
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:05,311
People who know their relatives who are

911
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:06,591
Happy to give them

912
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,383
Safe passage or

913
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:14,015
I can walk through usually even after even after 7 years

914
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,039
Of War at this

915
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:17,855
When we don't know we don't we don't know the networks

916
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:18,623
Well enough

917
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:20,159
No remember

918
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:22,463
When you say 7 years of war

919
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:24,767
It means we rotated

920
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:27,327
2000 dudes through the air

921
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,119
Every 7 to 12

922
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:32,447
Where there is no institutional knowledge

923
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:34,495
The US military in Afghanistan

924
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:36,287
Nearly nun

925
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:38,591
We never were there long enough

926
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:42,687
Actually get engaged within the supplies unfortunately after 2010 as well

927
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:44,479
We've never had anybody

928
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:47,807
Are we engaged

929
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:49,599
At all I was asking

930
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:54,719
Jason said that's the whole thing right there

931
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:57,791
The spider web of connections we never could untangle

932
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:02,143
We come into Afghanistan in 2001 and ousted the Taliban

933
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:05,215
We did a pretty good job of that through 2003

934
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:06,495
Then afterwards

935
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:08,543
Jason said our mission languished

936
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:12,127
And the Taliban use the intervening years to refresh and regroup

937
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:14,687
To learn how we operate how we track them

938
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:18,015
And now they were pushing back into the country in a big way

939
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:20,063
And exactly this region

940
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:22,623
Betty kapadia ghost

941
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:24,159
Right where bow goes missing

942
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:31,583
That's what the soldiers of the five-oh-first were up against

943
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:34,143
They were total Outsiders looking for their guy

944
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:37,983
And knowing their chances of finding him where diminishing everyday that passed

945
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:40,287
Clint Baker commander of the 1st

946
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:41,567
Italian of the five-oh-first

947
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:44,639
Said it was as high-risk in operation as he's ever had

948
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:47,199
In part because there was no clear endpoint

949
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:49,503
Any military hearing he testified

950
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:53,855
And I mean frankly I felt a bit of a loss on you know what to do

951
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:58,463
My entire time in the Army I can't think of a time where I felt that kind of adversity

952
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:00,511
Just. And really did not

953
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:03,071
You know I wasn't able to overcome it and quote

954
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:06,143
The relentlessness was what was so crushing

955
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:08,191
Is John Thurman

956
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:09,471
Darrell Hanson

957
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:11,007
They got to the point where

958
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:12,287
Sleep I mean

959
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:13,567
Sort of became

960
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:15,615
A distant reality

961
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:19,967
Twenty-four hours a day 7 days a week nose

962
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:21,247
Sleep no nothing

963
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:26,367
Ucae just ran out of juice who all the guys are just miserable and

964
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:29,439
It's just I like how on Earth you know

965
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:34,303
Of course Afghanistan was dangerous and conditions were rough before bowl last also

966
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:39,423
But now because operation Tempo was roughly doubled or even tripled in some cases

967
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:41,471
There's just more contact with the danger

968
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:46,079
Blackfoot 3rd platoon for instance hit 3 IEDs in one day

969
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:49,919
Major silvino silvino testified that the battalions mrap

970
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:53,503
Does huge armored trucks that are built to sustain IED explosion

971
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:56,831
But about 80% of them or damaged during the search.

972
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:59,647
A half a damage was caused by iuds

973
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:01,951
Therefore mine rollers all destroyed

974
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:06,815
Those numbers are one way to quantify the danger and the damage

975
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:13,471
Crystal Reckoning of the consequences including the enormous question of whether people were wounded or died looking for bow

976
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:16,287
Become publicly much later

977
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:18,079
After Bill came home

978
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:27,295
I saw some pictures Darryl Jansen took from that time

979
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:31,135
One shows him and another guy standing next to a carcass on a spit

980
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:32,671
Is that a goat

981
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:35,487
Yes that's a ghost

982
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:37,791
What was going on in that picture

983
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:41,375
What's going on is a retired of MREs

984
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:44,959
So they buy goat off of local farmer have some meat that wasn't Vacuum Pack

985
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:51,871
Some of these units couldn't go back to their fobs for what's called refit where you clean and resupply Equipment a shower you get a hot meal

986
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:55,967
4 weeks on end 2nd platoon Splatoon

987
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:58,271
They got sent out for 19 days straight

988
00:49:58,783 --> 00:50:00,831
That's outside the wire living in truck

989
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:02,111
Astana ground

990
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:03,391
For nearly three weeks

991
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:04,927
Doing non-stop missions

992
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:06,207
Another

993
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:09,279
Charlie Company listen out for 37 days straight

994
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:15,935
You got all your gear on full battle rattle that weighs between 60 and 100 pounds depending on what kind of weapon your

995
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:19,263
Carrying or whether your radio operator who has two extra batteries

996
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:22,335
Might be 90° during the day or a hundred degrees

997
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:25,151
Tonight the temperature might drop by such a 30°

998
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:27,711
Peter cedeno said in a military hearing

999
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:30,271
The men would huddle together at night to keep warm

1000
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:33,599
Quote it would literally I'll call it spoon on quote

1001
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:37,695
JT Billings was one of the people who was out for 19 days straight

1002
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:43,327
He testified that he gotten diarrhea early and quote you know I shipped my pants on quote

1003
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:44,607
He did have a next

1004
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:47,935
Repair ripped up the inside leg on some concertina wire

1005
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:53,055
Quotes annoying that I was going out and talking to locals potentially females and whatever and villages

1006
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:56,895
I couldn't necessarily have an exposed region like that on my pants on quote

1007
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:59,455
Civilians were the s*** pants for 19 days

1008
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:02,271
People's t-shirts got shredded their socks rotted

1009
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:04,063
People got sores on their skin

1010
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:05,599
They can only watch with baby wipe

1011
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:06,879
Baby bottled water

1012
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:08,159
Undergarments

1013
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:09,183
Falling off

1014
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:10,719
Oh really

1015
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:12,255
Yeah close

1016
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:14,559
You know like something you would you would think of

1017
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:16,607
Malaysia or Burma

1018
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:17,631
You know

1019
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:19,679
Close just falling apart

1020
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:21,215
That's Ken Wolfe

1021
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:22,495
The command sergeant major

1022
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:25,311
The hard part was they hadn't planned for this

1023
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:27,103
No one knew how long the search

1024
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:30,687
Just going to go on eventually we could we had to start figuring it out

1025
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:34,015
Are we going to rotate guys back in how do we resupply

1026
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:36,063
Is there every

1027
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:39,391
Ariana guys are everywhere

1028
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:40,671
They're spread out

1029
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:42,719
Everywhere I mean it was just complete

1030
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:45,279
GT Logistics nightmare

1031
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:48,607
And then also it wasn't just our battalion

1032
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:52,959
The other battalions within the organization or looking for him to

1033
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:54,239
And so what you know

1034
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:55,775
How does it make you feel

1035
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:56,799
When

1036
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:59,615
You walked for 15 days straight

1037
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:00,895
Looking for a guy

1038
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:01,919
Who walked off

1039
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:03,711
And he's not even in your unit

1040
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:06,015
Until you see somebody

1041
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:06,783
And you're like

1042
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:07,807
Hey man

1043
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:08,831
F*** you

1044
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:10,879
We're out here looking for this guy

1045
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:15,999
Maybe you're thinking all this complaining about how hard that time was Cry Me a River

1046
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:17,023
They're soldiers

1047
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:17,791
It's War

1048
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:19,327
And this is what they signed up for

1049
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,631
Well it's a no

1050
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:24,703
Their job was to go find and rescue one of their own

1051
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:26,495
They knew that and they accepted it

1052
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:28,799
Is the right thing to do to go look for him

1053
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:30,847
And I genuinely wanted to find him

1054
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:32,383
But they also knew

1055
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:34,175
Or we're at least pretty confident

1056
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:37,247
The bowhead left Mesto P voluntarily

1057
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:40,319
I know they felt like they were going through hell on his behalf

1058
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:43,391
And it wasn't just bozone platoon doing it but other

1059
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:44,927
Other battalions

1060
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:48,511
What's the people I talked to you about this time they said

1061
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:51,839
The search inflicted such major damage on morale

1062
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:54,399
It can be a delicate thing to maintain in The Best of Thai

1063
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:59,007
At the end of July about a month in major Larry glasscock

1064
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:00,799
The Battalion executive officer

1065
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:03,615
Went on leave back to Fort Richardson in Alaska

1066
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:04,895
Italian is based
