Dammit Sarah

3
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:20,992
Hello

4
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:22,016
Hello

5
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:23,296
Hi

6
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:24,064
Hi

7
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:26,880
It's Friday night you're in Baltimore

8
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,928
Friday night in Baltimore

9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,464
So okay so

10
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:37,376
Bu ended the day yesterday and there is this one big question which is was the phone in Lincoln Park

11
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:39,424
And I'm one very curious to know if

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,704
You got an answer to that question

13
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:43,776
So

14
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:46,336
I don't know

15
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,640
You texted me

16
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:51,968
You take me at lunch time and said you had an answer for me

17
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,832
What I have the answer to Is the thing you're dying to know is

18
00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:01,952
What does AT&T mean when it says you can't use incoming calls for

19
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:03,488
Shut up

20
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:07,584
So here's here's the answer that the state's expert said today

21
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,376
With that means is

22
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:14,240
It's it's referring not to cell towers

23
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,288
But it's referring to

24
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:20,128
The switch the Serta Grant the black the giant brain of all this

25
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:22,944
The cell towers in an area is the thing that decides

26
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,760
Like which Tower get switch handles with call

27
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:28,320
I believe so you probably know that better than I

28
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:29,344
Yeah

29
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:30,368
Okay

30
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,392
And so

31
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:32,416
He's saying

32
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:36,512
The best the best explanation he could oh by the way I forgot to tell you this

33
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:43,168
The switch that covers the dc-baltimore area or at least it the one that did in 1990

34
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:45,984
And I don't know if it's the same one but it's called the dawgbone

35
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,056
Which I thought was funny

36
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,336
Hi cuz

37
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:54,176
Because it's it covers to metropolitan areas so it's like

38
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:54,944
You know like a

39
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:58,272
A ball at what ended about the other

40
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:08,256
The dog house

41
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:10,816
Even though, at the dawgbone anyway

42
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,352
What do you say the best

43
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:15,936
The best explanation that this cell tower expert gave

44
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,264
He's like he's an FBI agent

45
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:22,592
And she is his specialty is cell tower now

46
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:26,176
What you saying is what that disclaimer mean

47
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,968
Is

48
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:29,248
For example

49
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:31,040
Say I live in Atlanta

50
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:35,904
That's in so that's my home switch is going to be Atlanta

51
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:41,024
Say I get on an airplane I turn my phone off I get an airplane I fly to Bali

52
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:41,792
Tomorrow

53
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:44,096
And I arrive in Baltimore

54
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46,144
I don't turn on my phone

55
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:50,752
Like I never I don't answer right away the Baltimore cellular network

56
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,568
But calls are coming into my phone

57
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,104
While it's off

58
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,408
Those calls

59
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:03,808
On a call log on a record of my activity will show the Atlanta switch for those calls

60
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:07,136
When I'm actually in Baltimore but my phone doesn't know yet

61
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:10,208
That I'm involved that is actually a question that I have had

62
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,512
For like 2 years

63
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:13,536
I know

64
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:16,864
But this FBI expert is saying

65
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,936
That doesn't apply to the Lincoln Park

66
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:25,056
Because the issue with those leakin Park calls was cell towers not switches

67
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,128
So he's saying this the cell testimony

68
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:28,896
Travis Fine

69
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:30,944
Yeah

70
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,296
Well he's saying there's one call actually that he disagrees with

71
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:37,856
Anyone

72
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:38,624
Who is Scott the

73
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,160
Call log in front of them

74
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,464
It's the 514 call which is a voicemail

75
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,232
Alcohol

76
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:47,840
But yeah basically other than that one call he's saying

77
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:48,864
He thought that

78
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,912
Cell tower expert to test

79
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,960
Defy data nuns original trial

80
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:55,520
Did a perfectly fine job in

81
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,544
He agreed with that test

82
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,360
But

83
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:04,992
The expert esl experts who testified for an onside who testified yesterday

84
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,272
Disagree

85
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:08,320
Completely and he is saying

86
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,088
That

87
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,624
That original

88
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,440
Cell testimony from anions trial

89
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:14,976
Doesn't hold up

90
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:20,351
Because the expert back then never saw that disclaimer and that this that disclaimer

91
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,655
Does apply to cell tower

92
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,703
So that's the problem

93
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,495
And they're going to continue to fight about that

94
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:30,335
It's going to be this is going to be a brawl over this thing

95
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,639
And it's still going with they they're not done

96
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,175
Cross-examining him

97
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,991
I say and they added another day to the hearing

98
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:40,319
On Monday and I could even see it going Pat be on Monday

99
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,855
Translate it a lot to cover

100
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,463
Okay so this is not this is not settled at all this is not tied up

101
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,255
All right no

102
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,047
So what else happened today

103
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:53,887
So the rest of the day was all about The Alibi issue

104
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,471
And two things happened in that

105
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:01,055
What is that an onside put on an investigator

106
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,639
And they had hired an investigator and they basically said look

107
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:07,967
They gave Christina Gutierrez is in tire

108
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:16,159
Alibi witness list that she had disclosed to the state back in the day before the first trial

109
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,695
Don's Original defense attorney

110
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:21,023
His original defense attorney the one who all this is about

111
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:27,167
And she had 80 some names on this list rise like a huge long last

112
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:31,263
So Justin Browns team had said to this investigator

113
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,567
Alright go find as many

114
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,103
People as you can off this list

115
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:37,151
And find out if they spoke to

116
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:40,223
Christina Gutierrez or her office back then

117
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,271
And what he said is

118
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,295
He

119
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,855
Was able to get in touch with 41 people

120
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,159
Of those

121
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,255
4 people said they had spoken to Christina

122
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:57,119
And none of them was spoken to about being an alibi

123
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,191
Only four people

124
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:00,959
Wow

125
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:03,775
And it was one of those things were like well that doesn't

126
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,055
Sound good you know

127
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:07,359
It was a little

128
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,383
Yeah

129
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,783
But then the state came back and sort of showed a bunch of documents from her files all of which Wii U

130
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,599
You and I've seen I mean they're all stuff we have as well

131
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:23,999
And I remember these two and you know it does show that they were doing some work to

132
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:27,583
Find witnesses to find Alibi witnesses to speak to

133
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,607
People to subpoena

134
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,375
People

135
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:33,471
So it was just it was a little bit mushy like the back

136
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,799
Can 4th of that it was kind of felt like sort of a draw or something

137
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:37,823
I don't know it's

138
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,359
Like really whatever she did

139
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,383
Wasn't

140
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:41,663
Drake

141
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,199
That wasn't her defense

142
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,735
It's like she just didn't go that route

143
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,831
Possibly for you no lack of trying

144
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,111
But

145
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,671
If she didn't do nothing

146
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:55,743
So it was a little hard to sounds inconclusive

147
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,303
It was inconclusive who won that round.

148
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,071
Have to say

149
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:03,679
It was there a superstar witnessed today or something like that yes it's the most

150
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,727
Drama probably that happened

151
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:08,287
Was that this guy Dave Irwin

152
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,823
Testified for the defense

153
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:15,199
As an expert witness on criminal defense criminal defense attorney

154
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:18,783
Yeah long-time attorney you know he's been been an attorney since

155
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,319
The early seventies and he's

156
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:24,415
I worked as a prosecutor aide worked as an assistant AG heatworks

157
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,951
The justice department

158
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:26,719
Has his own private

159
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,487
Practice

160
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:32,863
Says litigator key you know teaches how to do criminal defense work I mean he's just

161
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,167
Yeah Yeahs distinguished career

162
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:39,519
And she was just so unequivocal about

163
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,543
How

164
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:44,383
There's no excuse you can think of for why she didn't

165
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:48,223
Investigate at the minimum investigate

166
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:51,551
And he just put it in in such

167
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:57,951
In like just no uncertain terms like he said he basically said if you have a credible Alibi witness that is

168
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,719
Is the best

169
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,999
Possible defense

170
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,279
Can have right

171
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,583
And so he's like that's what you're always looking

172
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:10,495
And he told this Parable actually about a long time ago when he was I think it was he was saying he was a prosecutor at the time and he had this

173
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,263
This case

174
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:15,871
And the defense put up this Alibi witness you said you know actually at the time of the

175
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:16,639
Crime

176
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,175
I saw the defendant

177
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,479
On a bus traveling to Philadelphia

178
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,503
Summer like that

179
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,039
And

180
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:26,111
And he said he's her came back at this woman and he said she was

181
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:30,975
Lovely young woman and said like how do you know you had the right day

182
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:33,279
And she goes what was my birthday

183
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,303
And

184
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,607
So at your day really stuck out to me

185
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:41,727
Yeah he said it was a totally humbling to me and he said ever since I've been looking

186
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:42,751
Looking for Asia McClain

187
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,639
Cuz you were saying how that case really reminded him of this one

188
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,943
Because it was the same kind of witness

189
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:55,807
Right like that's who you want like that's in Asia McClain like that's the caliber that she was

190
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,855
That was that that cases Asia

191
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:58,879
McLane yeah

192
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:01,695
And it like a Glock case

193
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,231
And this woman who remembers

194
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,511
Specifically because of

195
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,279
It's her birthday

196
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,815
Exactly

197
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,607
Exactly very believable

198
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,887
Credible very likable

199
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:12,191
And then Justin Brown

200
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,215
Kind of ticks

201
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:16,543
Through all the things that

202
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,335
The states

203
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,895
Had criticized about her letters and

204
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,175
Her memories of like

205
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,455
You know this the

206
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:26,783
Inconsistency is willing consistencies or it seems like she's too

207
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,599
Too eager to help or put it have possibly contradicted

208
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,623
Uno estate

209
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,439
That Adnan had said

210
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,743
To the police about where he went he was just like no

211
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,023
No no

212
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,839
No he was like everything about her letters seemed

213
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,375
Like assets to her

214
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,911
He was like first of all

215
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:46,751
She's bringing up the surveillance stuff a possible surveillance cameras

216
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:47,775
In the library

217
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:54,175
And he's like regardless of whether it exists the fact that she wants it to exist mean she's so confident and what she remembers that she

218
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,711
He wants it corroborated

219
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:57,247
Right so that's good

220
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:04,159
That she's just very confident in what she remembers his chain saying she's not really good friends with an honours

221
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:04,927
Floor with hay

222
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,975
And he's like that's perfect

223
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:08,511
Because she knows them both

224
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,535
But she's not going to be

225
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,303
Be biased

226
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:14,399
Cuz she's not good friends with either one of them yeah

227
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:19,263
He said oh the fact that she's offering up her boyfriend and her

228
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,543
Her boyfriend's friend

229
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,847
You know who all he would come back and drop it.

230
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:26,431
Phuket bakeri sounds like she's giving you two more labs

231
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,711
He's like she's

232
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:28,991
Perfect

233
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:30,783
And he said

234
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:36,927
In a situation like that you immediately pounced you move as fast as possible and you go in person

235
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:37,951
Talk to that one

236
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,487
Always

237
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:40,511
You always

238
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,559
Very convincing

239
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,607
It was so he was just so

240
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,399
Categorical about it was like

241
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,423
Kiss and then

242
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,703
He said

243
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,775
In terms of what he thought he could have done for Adnan

244
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,543
Case

245
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,335
He said he called it a game changer

246
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:58,943
He said he said it would have changed the ball games results

247
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,735
And that's of course that they

248
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,503
Write that

249
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,527
That anions

250
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,295
Side needs

251
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,575
The show is that it would have changed

252
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:05,855
The trial if

253
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,391
Justified at the time

254
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,183
And so his upshot was just like

255
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,207
So

256
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,511
You know his analysis was

257
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,559
Christina's lawyer

258
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,327
Fell

259
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,887
Below the standard required by law

260
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:20,959
He sounds like a

261
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:21,727
Very good with

262
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,007
He was a

263
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:25,311
He was a great witness for the defense

264
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,847
I mean I feel convinced

265
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:31,455
Well that divide but you know hold off because they did not cross-examine him

266
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:35,039
So the state has had not had its crack at that guy okay

267
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,831
And like you said before this didn't turn out

268
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:37,855
Give me the last day of the year

269
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,903
They're going to continue on Monday

270
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,719
Yeah they're going to continue on Monday

271
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:45,791
Okay but I I can't be here Monday

272
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,839
I can't cover it Monday no

273
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:48,863
We need you to

274
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,399
Get we need you to go home

275
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:56,799
I know so I have to do our other are season 2 podcast I have to make the next episode or it won't

276
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:57,567
Happen

277
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,103
We know we needed

278
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:02,943
I think what we'll do is I'll cover it in some way

279
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:11,391
Definitely when the judge rules probably something on our website so when you write that will definitely let people know on the E

280
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,183
Email it'll be on the on the website

281
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,463
Okay yeah yeah that's

282
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:17,791
Sounds good do we know when we don't know when the judge will rule

283
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:20,863
No I mean he'll probably take some weeks and

284
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,143
Do it carefully in

285
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,935
And come up with his real name

286
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,775
He seems very deliver it and very

287
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:30,079
I know he seems to be listening very very careful

288
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:35,711
Can you can you just explain what the possible outcomes are like what are the possible things that

289
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,479
If he could

290
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:39,551
Decide so me all of this is about

291
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,575
Will he

292
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,367
He will this judge

293
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:45,695
Decide that he thinks Adnan should get a new trial

294
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:51,583
So if he decides to that he thinks at 9 could should get a new trial based on these issues

295
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:54,655
I mean I got to think the state will appeal that

296
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,727
So an appeal will happen

297
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:58,495
Okay if

298
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:03,615
If if he says no I don't think a Nan should get a new trial

299
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:06,175
Then it goes back

300
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:06,943
2

301
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:07,967
The court of Special Ops

302
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:08,735
Peels

303
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,271
For them to decide what

304
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,039
What to do

305
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,831
It's probably either way the outcome will be

306
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,623
It's going to go back to the

307
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:21,279
But that said it's like this does not feel like some sort of like technical

308
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:25,887
Bump along the way that like they're just sort of getting through to get things on the record

309
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,935
You know it feels like

310
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:32,287
It's a real sort of like fight for survival in there

311
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:37,919
It feels like a mini-trial really is what's happening even though it's not a trial that is how it feels

312
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:46,111
All right I should probably hang up item to let you go by Dana

313
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:53,023
Okay by the way I quit cuz I'm going to go join the FBI cell phone investigatory division

314
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:59,423
Oh no it's not called that what's it called it's called cast cellular analysis survey team

315
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,959
That's what you need to join

316
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:07,359
You could be a cast member
