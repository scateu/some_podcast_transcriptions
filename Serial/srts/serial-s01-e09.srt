1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:00,768
Previously

2
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:01,536
I'm cereal

3
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:06,144
Why would you admit to doing something that drastic if you hadn't done it

4
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:09,472
The mechanics the documentation the steps they took

5
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:13,312
They look good while eating not get up there and defend yourself

6
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:15,360
You know it's your face to face

7
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:17,920
He's right there he's a person

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:19,968
So

9
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:20,736
You know

10
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:24,576
Believable

11
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:32,512
Global Tel Link prepaid call from

12
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:40,704
Maryland Correctional Facility

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:47,104
From This American Life and WBEZ Chicago its serial

14
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,640
One story told week by week

15
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:55,040
I'm Sarah Koenig before we get to today's episode where I'm going to let an auntie

16
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:55,808
Talk for a while

17
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,136
I want to run by you some new information I've learned in the past week

18
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,416
Three things I've learned

19
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:01,696
First

20
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:04,512
Remember Laura the former Laura Estrada Sandoval

21
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:07,840
Well then who the f*** did it in the last episode

22
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:10,400
She was friends with Stephanie and with Jane with an on

23
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:15,008
I was talking to Laura on the phone the other day and she mentioned something about Best Buy

24
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:17,056
So I asked her if I could start taping

25
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:19,872
Tell me tell me again what you just told me

26
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,200
There's not there's never any phones at Best Buy

27
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:27,808
There were never any phones around the Best Buy no Payphone oatmeal phone this

28
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:29,088
No

29
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:30,368
No

30
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,648
Thanks

31
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:33,184
Bones bear

32
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:41,376
The Payphone in question is important because Jay tells the detectives that are non called him on January 13th 1999

33
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:43,424
And tell Jay he killed Hae

34
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,984
Come and get me I'm at Best Buy

35
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:50,848
When Jake gets there he says he sees Adnan standing by the phone booth wearing red gloves

36
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,152
Draw the map for the cops

37
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,944
Showing the location of the phone booth

38
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,784
If you're facing the front doors of the store his drawing shows the booth on the left

39
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,064
Outside on the sidewalk

40
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,624
We did a lot of research on this

41
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:06,976
Where it was whether it was and we could not account for this phone booth

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,792
That's because it never was

43
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,912
She said the only conceivable place for a phone at the Best Buy it would have been inside

44
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:15,936
In the foyer part of the

45
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:16,704
Play Store

46
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,240
But there was no phone they are either

47
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:22,592
Laura said she knows this because she's to go to that Best Buy a lot

48
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:25,664
From the time it open through 98 in 299

49
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:29,504
With her family and without her family

50
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:34,368
Yeah I don't know if deal CDs from there all the time so it's pretty aware

51
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,904
Like what was around

52
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:37,952
Shoplift

53
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,488
CDs

54
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,912
So you're saying you would have noticed

55
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,936
Thing like that

56
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:51,520
Cuz you were kind of because you're not paying attention

57
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:57,920
You go in and let you cut her more aware of your surroundings and just walking into the store at the time

58
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:00,736
I remember looking up in the ceiling and see if there was any

59
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,272
Eyes in the sky

60
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:05,600
Cameras you know and you know there's a whole message

61
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,160
You're very aware

62
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,720
Of like entering and who was like

63
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,536
I was there at the entrance and when you're leaving

64
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:16,096
You know cuz you already hardened steel in

65
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,912
Man there's a phone bear

66
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:25,568
Lauren i hypothesized y If there really wasn't a phone booth

67
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,104
When they have noted it

68
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,408
Laura thought maybe it wasn't a big deal to them

69
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,456
It's such a small D2

70
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:38,112
It's not a small detail

71
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:40,160
6 Cal comes from is that pay phone at best

72
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:45,792
Yeah I don't know why they went check it but there's no case on there man

73
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:48,096
You sure I'm positive

74
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:59,872
Testing one

75
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:02,944
I learned it also relates to this 236

76
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,712
Call

77
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,248
I talked to a woman named summer

78
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,808
She went to Woodlawn she's been listening to podcast

79
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,416
And she emailed me because when she heard this one part she said she starts shaking her head

80
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:17,024
She said if the state is saying Haley was dead by 2:36

81
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,815
It's impossible

82
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,863
Is impossible it I mean

83
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:23,167
Like I mean it's just impossible

84
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,191
It is not

85
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,751
There's no way that

86
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:29,055
He was at Best Buy 236

87
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,103
Summer was friends with hey

88
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:34,687
Not close friends but they have class together and they joke around and talked

89
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,831
I had a boyfriend who did Sports at Woodlawn and she wanted an excuse to stay after school to so she can hang around with them

90
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:46,207
He told her there was an opening for another manager of the boys wrestling team he was already doing that

91
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,487
Summer Joyner

92
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:52,095
The day he disappeared the wrestling team had a match at Randallstown High School

93
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:55,935
Summer remembers talking to her after school in the gym area there

94
00:04:56,191 --> 00:05:00,031
The wrestlers were Milling around summer Was preparing the equipment they had to load onto the bus

95
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:03,359
And he came in to say I'm not getting on the bus to the match

96
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,383
But I'll see you there

97
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,687
And that wasn't welcomed used to Summer

98
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,735
She needed her by her side at the match

99
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:11,039
Because he was more experienced at scoring

100
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:13,087
Which can be tricky in wrestling if you're new at

101
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:16,159
You know I was giving her hell because I'm telling her like

102
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,951
I don't know what I'm doing

103
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:21,023
You know I needed her because you know we had to take points in

104
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:24,863
Things like that and she's like no no no I just have to go and

105
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,655
You know pick my little cousin up

106
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,215
Summer says it wasn't a quick conversation either

107
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:34,847
You know we used to tease each other cuz she really was hilarious so we would tease each other and you know go back and forth and

108
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,151
We were at least talking for lease

109
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:37,919
10 minutes

110
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:42,783
You're sure that this is the day because it's the day she didn't show up

111
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,831
I am positive

112
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,135
Very positive

113
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:50,719
I look for her the whole time at the away game

114
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:54,303
You know I was really pissed because I thought that she you know stood me up

115
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:58,655
Rachel Summers she would make her own way to Randallstown high for the match

116
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:01,215
No one but me probably remembers this now

117
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:04,287
Inez Butler Hendrix who worked at the school

118
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:07,615
Said he had told her she was playing to catch the Randallstown bus

119
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,943
However Inez initially told the cops the opposite

120
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:14,783
So I trust Summers memory more and summer is clear

121
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,087
He told her she was going to drive herself there

122
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:24,511
Summer said this conversation about hey not getting on the bus happened after the last bell and also after the reggae

123
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:27,071
Dealer school buses had cleared the loop in front of the school

124
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:30,399
She said probably around 2:30 to 45

125
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,959
Summer says she has no dog in this fight

126
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,519
She's got no opinions on an unskilled or innocent

127
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,311
She just knows what she knows

128
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:41,663
All of the things that I'm you know unclear about or kind of shaky about or

129
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,431
I am

130
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,199
Clear

131
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:43,967
On that

132
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:48,063
236 would not have been possible for her to even

133
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,343
Have met him

134
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:53,695
Whatever because I know for a fact she was probably with me during that time

135
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,743
4 at the school during that time

136
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:09,311
Talk to the detectives there's no mention of her in their notes which is not the only person who said they saw her after school that day

137
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:13,663
Becky Star right after school Debbie Warren said she talked to hey to

138
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,527
Voice note say she saw her at approximately 3 p.m. inside the school near the gym

139
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,319
Which would match Summers memory

140
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,367
So

141
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:24,671
Laura says no phone booth at Best Buy

142
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:28,511
Summer says no way no how he was at Best Buy at 2:36

143
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:35,423
A mind that if you want withhold information from Asia McClain who says she saw Adnan around 2:30 to 45

144
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,959
Live at the Woodland Public Library

145
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:43,871
Can we all agree that whatever happened to hey probably didn't involve a 2:36 p.m. call from that phone booth saying come and

146
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,151
Get me I'm at Best Buy

147
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:49,759
I don't know about you but I'm done considering that it's true this 236 thing

148
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,575
If you want to speculate with me here for

149
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,343
4 seconds

150
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,415
If we suspect there wasn't a phone booth at Best Buy

151
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,975
That means the crime maybe didn't happen there

152
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:04,095
Jay's friend Chris said he heard the crime happened in the parking lot of the Woodlawn Public Library

153
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:09,727
But I got to say if you think the Best Buy is too public a place to commit a murder you should see the library after school

154
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,751
Swarming with kids

155
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:15,103
And if the she said come and get me call wasn't at 2:36

156
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,407
Maybe it's the next incoming call on the log

157
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,943
At 3:15 call

158
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:22,015
After all no one actually testifies to the 236

159
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,039
Six timing a trial

160
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,599
This comes from the prosecutor's narrative alone

161
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,391
The problem is

162
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:31,487
Is the 315 call that really messes with Jays testimony

163
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:34,303
About where they were and what they were doing that afternoon

164
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,519
Now information

165
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:48,383
It's about what happened at not her real name Kathy's apartment that evening of January 13th

166
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:53,247
Kathy remember Dan on getting a call and reacting in an agitated way

167
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,271
Saying things like

168
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:56,319
What am I going to do what am I going to

169
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:58,111
Say they're going to come talk to me

170
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,903
And what am I supposed to say

171
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:04,255
Kathy testified a trial. This call was acting panicked

172
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:10,143
I think it's possible that call Kathy overheard would not from a mystery Third Man or co-conspirator

173
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,935
But from wait for it

174
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:14,495
He's good friend Aisha Pittman

175
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:16,799
Interview for a sec

176
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:19,359
His brother called the cops that afternoon

177
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:22,431
Officer Scott Adcock arise from the Baltimore County PD

178
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:26,015
His initial report record the time as 5:12 p.m.

179
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:30,367
I cop calls Aisha and Adnan asking if they seen hey

180
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,903
Here's what's new

181
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,487
I got an email recently from another friend and that Woodland magnet group

182
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,511
Krista

183
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:39,327
Then she talked to Aisha that evening of the 13th

184
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:45,727
It was around 6 p.m. that night that I talk to Aisha and she was calling around to see if anyone had heard from her

185
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,775
Curb meaning hey

186
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:53,919
So I checked with Aisha and she does remember speaking to a non

187
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:54,943
Here's what she wrote To Me

188
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:59,551
I do remember speaking with an on that evening but I thought he called me

189
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:04,927
From what I recall it was a super short conversation and he was annoyed that I told the police to check in with him

190
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,999
I thought I spoke to him after the police called him

191
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:13,887
She said it's possible her memory of who called him could be mistaken maybe she did call

192
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,727
There's definitely no outgoing call to Aisha on an on cell that day

193
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,775
Maybe it was before he'd spoken to the

194
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:20,799
The cops not after

195
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:23,103
She can't be sure but that's what she remembers

196
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:26,943
Again you've heard this information before but I'm going to review it now

197
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:32,319
There are three calls on the call log around this time that all ping towers near Kathy's apartment

198
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:34,879
607 609 and 624

199
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,951
The first few calls are for a little less than a minute

200
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,487
The third call is the longest

201
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,255
4 minutes

202
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,023
15 seconds

203
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,071
That was likely officer Adcock

204
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:48,447
You should call at 6:09 says I just talked to the police

205
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,983
I'm not going to get in touch with you too

206
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,287
Aisha says Adnan was annoyed

207
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,079
Maybe that's what Kathy interpreted

208
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:54,847
Hispanic

209
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:57,663
I think we can all stipulate that Adnan was super stoned

210
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,711
He told me he had weed in the car

211
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:02,271
I was worried the cops are going to find it if they came to talk to him

212
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:07,903
Searching for a second and says something like

213
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:11,999
What am I going to do what am I going to say they're going to come talk to me

214
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,535
And what am I supposed to say

215
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:16,607
Obviously I can't say for sure this is what happened

216
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:20,191
But if that's strange call Kathy remember it was actually Aisha

217
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,287
Well then for me that rearranges all the pixels and Kathy's memory

218
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,591
From suspicious to inocuos

219
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,615
If it's true

220
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:40,671
Okay we're caught up let's go back to our regularly scheduled program

221
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,975
Second trial

222
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,023
Are you prepared to make your election

223
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,375
Testify if you remain silent

224
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:53,471
Remain silent

225
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,543
What's a non not testifying

226
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:59,871
But his attorney advised against it

227
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,151
Not uncommon

228
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:04,479
It's a huge risk to open your client after cross-examination and impeachment

229
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,527
So there he was mute

230
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,807
True to trials

231
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,343
About 5 weeks total

232
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,647
Which is really hard for anyone

233
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,911
More so sitting there for so long for so many days and weeks

234
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,215
You sitting there looking at me

235
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:42,111
I never sometimes where it was just going to leave what was being said

236
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:45,183
I was just literally just scribbling on a piece of paper

237
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,975
Acting like I was taking notes

238
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:50,047
I didn't know what else to do and it was going off so long

239
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,583
This is so frustrating

240
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,191
Cuz you want to keep interrupting to say hold him but that's not true that's not the reason why I got a phone

241
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:58,495
Make a phone call if that's not you know

242
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,287
Me telling my parents I'm going to

243
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:06,943
Somewhere but I'm going to the club that doesn't mean that you know

244
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,991
You never get a chance

245
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,295
You never get a chance to say anything

246
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,599
What is the most frustrating thing in the world

247
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,927
I want to let a non talk now

248
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,487
Not so much about what happened the day of the crime

249
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,279
I feel like we've been over that already

250
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,607
But just about what it was like to be him throughout this case

251
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:27,167
What it's like now to be locked up for so long

252
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:30,751
10th 1999

253
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,543
Are you sure I'd broken the terrible news

254
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,591
Krista about his body being found

255
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:37,919
Krista Dan call Dan on who ran over twice schs

256
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,455
To the very close to a non

257
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,991
And then Krista joint in there

258
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,527
Stephanie came over to

259
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:45,343
They all sat there at Alicia's kitchen table

260
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,111
Crying

261
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:52,767
No wait

262
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:56,351
You know did I not I'm pretty sure they didn't even imagine that you know that

263
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:59,679
Turn up

264
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,287
I never ever consider that

265
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:08,127
Something bad happened

266
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,919
Explanation

267
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,199
Somewhere

268
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:13,503
Father California

269
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,295
With her new boyfriend

270
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:20,159
Lots of people told the cops and also told me

271
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:23,487
Turn on appear to be in denial when they are first heard what happened

272
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,791
But he said things like it's not her

273
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:28,863
They got the wrong person all Asian women look alike

274
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,911
Arrested

275
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:34,495
Krista Rotana chronology of everything she remembered from the previous

276
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,263
6 weeks

277
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,567
Here's what she wrote about that night at Aisha

278
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:43,711
We went inside and Adnan was sitting at the kitchen table crying after while he said that there had to be a mistake

279
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:47,551
And then he was still alive because her name was written in ayesha's agenda book

280
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:52,671
He wanted to call the detective O'Shea but when he called the precinct he wasn't there

281
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:59,071
Alarm was upset so I took the phone and talk to the woman and explain that we just wanted to get some information and she's

282
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:01,631
He said we would have to wait and call homicide in the morning

283
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:04,703
Keanu on call detective O'Shea

284
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,263
The the night that

285
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,055
We found out that she had been murdered

286
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,359
That's right

287
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:15,711
Adam called the Baltimore County Police Department to talk to detective O'Shea

288
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:19,039
You tell him they miss identify this girl whoever she was

289
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,343
Has always stayed with me

290
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,903
Is that something a distraught teenager would do

291
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,695
Or is that something a killer would do

292
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:30,047
The next day we went to school and it was you.

293
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,583
And

294
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,911
Coming up to me

295
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,935
Hugging me

296
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:39,519
So much so many people are you okay

297
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,311
What happened

298
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,919
It was just too much

299
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:56,159
So many people.

300
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,951
Talked about an honest reaction to his death

301
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,487
But he was blank

302
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,279
Orca eating waves

303
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,303
Or not at all

304
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:06,143
Or that he seemed normal

305
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,959
We're staring at a picture of him and hand psychology class

306
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:12,799
One teacher said he was tense and unresponsive when she gave him a hug

307
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:15,103
The Tick he had became more pronounced

308
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,919
He was so sad he was barely functioning

309
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:23,295
The school nurse testified at Adnan first trial that she thought he faked a catatonic state

310
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,855
She wasn't allowed to testify in the second trial

311
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:30,463
Anything strange in his behavior

312
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:33,535
Besides they said it was a strange time for everyone

313
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,327
Was terrifying sad

314
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,607
They were all so young

315
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,143
How are you supposed to react

316
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:49,663
Interesting late Jim trainum the former homicide detective we hired to review the investigation

317
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:53,247
Immediately disregarded every single statement about an honest reaction

318
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,807
In terms of evaluating someone's guilty said

319
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,087
Stuff like that is worthless

320
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,415
He advised me to do the same just toss it all out he said

321
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:06,559
Because it's subjective it's hindsight and also people have been their memories to what they think police want to hear

322
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,143
Adan Health Plan a memorial for hay at school

323
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,679
They plant a tree for her

324
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,727
Still there in front of the school with a plaque

325
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,543
This time for Anon is a blur he says

326
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,591
Giant events kept coming

327
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,127
After the other

328
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:22,687
I didn't have time to wrestle them into comprehension

329
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:29,087
Stop

330
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:45,471
The cops came to announce house to speak to him on February 26 1999

331
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,263
2 days before they arrest him

332
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,311
I had an interview Jen RJ yet

333
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,871
There's reporting their files about that meeting

334
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:54,175
Which is dated September 14th

335
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,967
Almost 7 months after the fact

336
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:56,735
I don't know why

337
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:01,343
Detectives Ritz and mcgillivary come to announce house and ask about hey

338
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:06,975
Quote when asked if Syed had a relationship with Hae Min Lee Syed replied in a soft voice

339
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:07,743
Yes

340
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,047
However he didn't want his father to know

341
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:21,055
That's actually what I was worried about was upset again

342
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:24,639
What is the thing I was worried about the most

343
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:27,967
Olivia settings

344
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:31,039
I was like I'm worried about you may as well say

345
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:35,391
In the living room but there's a earthquake coming in the next

346
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,439
I'm worried about my father being upset

347
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:42,047
And my mother has told you I have no idea whatsoever that

348
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:48,959
Even ask women after that conversation with your dad was there

349
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,495
You didn't think like a

350
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,567
Not at all.

351
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:57,663
I actually thought that I killed her

352
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:00,223
I never not one time

353
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:02,783
Stop that they actually believe that I killed her

354
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,831
I think I need to go

355
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:17,375
Picture of ex boyfriend

356
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:23,007
Did you know they're going to come after you now unless they find who did it because you're the most recent ex-boyfriend

357
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:28,127
You would ask me that

358
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,919
No ill will towards her

359
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:30,943
Anyone

360
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:34,527
Put on

361
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:41,951
Early in the morning on February 28th after they've spoken to Jay after Jay has shown them where his car was parked of Edgewood

362
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:45,279
The detectives come into a nuns bedroom and wake him up

363
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,071
Time to put some clothes on

364
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:47,839
Time to go

365
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:51,423
He dresses sees his mother is watching his older brother

366
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,215
A little brother Yusuf is crying

367
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,519
To the city

368
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:57,311
Interrogation room in homicide

369
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:00,383
Describes as a little hook in the wall

370
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:07,039
Detective

371
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:10,367
You know I don't condone what you did but I have an ex-wife

372
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:14,719
You know I just went through a divorce or something I can understand how you can get mad

373
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:18,559
This by the way is what Jim trainum calls offering a theme

374
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:20,351
You give the suspect an explanation

375
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:22,143
When it minimizes the crime

376
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,167
As a starting point

377
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,727
Tequila very was being more so aggressive with

378
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,519
Okay

379
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,919
It would help out a lot of

380
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,199
Color switch

381
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,599
But he did mention that

382
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,695
Process your car

383
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:49,535
Images of red gloves

384
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,095
You looking to find those red gloves or something

385
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:55,679
Announce at the detectives left the room for a while then came back

386
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:57,471
When they came back they had to

387
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:01,311
Professional crimestopper it was a picture like a reward paper

388
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,591
A picture of hay

389
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:05,663
Will leave you alone with this

390
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:13,087
Looking at it

391
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,879
Jeremy 2culi

392
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,952
I know what am I going to say

393
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,768
This is over I'm going to leave

394
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:24,352
They both came it again

395
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:29,472
On top of the Metro

396
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,264
And that's why I said you know

397
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:34,848
Baltimore city in the top left-hand corner

398
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,408
Elasticsearch document

399
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,712
Statement of charges

400
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:43,296
Target wheel for me

401
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,368
Premeditated

402
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,904
Deliberately

403
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,240
You know and

404
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:05,824
So that's what he said you know you're being charged with Hailey's murder

405
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:10,176
At this point and not ask for a lawyer he said he was thinking of Matlock

406
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,248
He says the detective stop questioning him

407
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:15,040
They got ready to leave the room again

408
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:17,344
Keep in mind, 17 years old

409
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,512
I cannot going home

410
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,816
And I said to him I said hello

411
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:32,704
What's in my mind is like she got to finish this

412
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,032
Traffic report on

413
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:39,872
She had an annotated bibliography doing his English class

414
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:40,640
She said

415
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:43,456
Let's try to make a non situation plane to him

416
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:46,528
Not going home

417
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,320
And did you get it

418
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:52,416
You didn't cuz you're never going home

419
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,352
8 year old kids

420
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,632
Any situation

421
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:09,568
It's very difficult to believe in the early stages at this is actually what's happening

422
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:15,968
Away away my mind

423
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:22,112
Often when a Nan tells stories about this time

424
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:25,440
He zeros in on some small moment when someone was kind to him

425
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:30,816
Dorothy said hey babe just have faith

426
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:34,144
Communicate across is like a

427
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,456
That's it that's the whole story

428
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:50,528
Please mention the sky to me multiple times

429
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,368
Also the white lady who was driving the cruiser that took him downtown

430
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,392
She was polite

431
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:59,232
There's a sheriff's deputy who looks like Judd Hirsch who slipped him a candy bar

432
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,328
The 8th grade teacher whose name he can't remember who wrote him that nice letter

433
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:06,400
I can imagine how you'd CiCi's kindnesses

434
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:08,448
Nestle into your brain forever

435
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:20,224
Obviously I need to hold onto butt

436
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,248
This is

437
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,552
Junior prom pictures

438
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:26,112
Last spring date and I went to Chris's house

439
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:28,160
Christy was good friends with Hangin On

440
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,696
Just Kristin Myers back then

441
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,512
She dug out a trove of photos

442
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:34,048
Yearbook staff in letters

443
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,120
Christian wrote to each other during his first year in jail

444
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,144
Who is trial

445
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:43,520
She visited him frequently when he was in prison in Jessup Maryland much closer than where he is now in Cumberland

446
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,360
Krista is clear-eyed organized and thoughtful

447
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:49,920
His death was the defining event of her youth

448
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:51,200
Invest with her

449
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,480
Asda did not arrest

450
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:53,248
Conviction

451
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:58,112
She's not in the camp of 100% there's no way in the world that done did this

452
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,136
She's more

453
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:01,952
If you did it then I don't understand human beings

454
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:03,488
Because the guy I knew

455
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,512
Etcetera

456
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:05,536
So

457
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:06,304
It's just

458
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,352
She's a normal

459
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,632
Kind person

460
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,960
These are letters from somebody that

461
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:14,240
Militia sword

462
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:16,544
Just trying to sway you believe him it's

463
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:18,080
How many the General Lee

464
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,104
Am I even encouraged

465
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,176
Try to make the best of

466
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:22,944
The bad situation

467
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:25,760
Here's the guy she knew

468
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,808
June 2nd 1999

469
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,392
Did you get that really expensive prom dress you wanted and who'd you go with

470
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,672
If you don't mind me asking

471
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,696
:-)

472
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:36,256
Things are going with Andy

473
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,536
They've been having problems

474
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:39,328
He tells her stories about jail

475
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,352
June 8th

476
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:43,168
You should send me some pictures were allowed to get them

477
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:45,984
Some guys in here get some really dirty pictures

478
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:53,152
Do you like this I've seen more that I'd wanted to have a lot of people's wives or girlfriends the last a lifetime

479
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:58,272
I'm almost guys are really protective of their pictures someone's always pulling me aside to show me their latest

480
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,040
Flick

481
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,320
It's really kind of disgust

482
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:06,720
Has gotten letters from other kids from school Justin Asia Aaron

483
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,024
That's all he says about Asia by the way

484
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,328
He doesn't seem to attach any importance to her letters

485
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:13,120
Or note that she's a potential alibi

486
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:16,192
Because he doesn't know the state's timeline for the murder yet

487
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:21,056
With the juvenile population when he was first arrested in February

488
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:23,104
It makes you turn 18

489
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,896
And I moved over to be with the adults

490
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:28,480
I'd assume that would be awful in Myriad ways

491
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:30,528
Button on right sister Krista

492
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,368
It's weird when I first came here I didn't know what the heck was going on

493
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,160
Let me tell you it was pretty bad

494
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:39,232
Physically like no one was trying to beat me up

495
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,536
People didn't know what to think of me

496
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:46,144
I mean first of all everyone in here is black and always threatening to beat the hell out of someone else

497
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,704
Then you have me light-skinned and quiet

498
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,520
I didn't say much to anyone no one said much to me

499
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:55,616
4 months later I can be anywhere in the entire jail

500
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:57,664
Seminole call Syed

501
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:01,504
People say what's up to me ask how things are and I don't even know them

502
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:04,576
The strange thing is so many people come to me saying

503
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:06,368
If anyone bothers you let me know

504
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,160
But there's no one left to bother me

505
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:12,768
Some of that is due to the fact that I'm a Muslim to my personality

506
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:16,096
You know I've been blessed in that I can make friends almost anywhere I go

507
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:18,400
Now I can really say anywhere

508
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:21,472
He tells her he's gotten elected to inmate Council

509
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,336
You can see how it not initially thinks

510
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,616
This is all temporary

511
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:30,176
I'll be out by graduation Maybe by Summer

512
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,712
Maybe by whenever

513
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,528
A little more the closer he gets to trial

514
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:38,112
Crystal would testify for the state a trial

515
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:43,232
She's the one who talked about hearing him ask a for a ride that afternoon which add-on said he didn't do

516
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,280
But he doesn't hold it against her

517
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:47,584
He's so sweet to Christen these letters

518
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,888
Ask about the dental work she got done

519
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:52,448
Our little sister is doing her mother's doing with

520
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,472
Car got fixed

521
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:57,056
He talks about his feelings they discuss religion and God

522
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:59,360
Problems Christian parents are divorcing

523
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,664
Intimate friends who trust each other

524
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:08,064
The most striking letters to me we're the ones he wrote to her immediately before and after his sentencing

525
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:10,624
He didn't end up facing the death penalty by the way

526
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:12,160
The first one

527
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:15,232
He writes it while he's in What's called the bullpen waiting to be sentenced

528
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:17,536
It's going to cut out from a magazine

529
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,328
Photo of an Asian young woman

530
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,096
Smiling

531
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:22,144
What's this Crystal

532
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:23,936
That's actually not

533
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,728
Hey it looks like her

534
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,008
So

535
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:30,080
He found this in a magazine

536
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:33,408
And said that it does girl look

537
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:35,712
It's like he found this in a magazine and it looked

538
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:36,480
So much

539
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:37,760
Like hey

540
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:39,808
Yes

541
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:44,928
Weird

542
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:46,720
I was looking for this Jet Magazine

543
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:49,536
In case you didn't know it features African-American issues

544
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:50,560
:-)

545
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:51,328
Unquote

546
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:54,400
He tells Christy that had been appearing in his dreams

547
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:57,216
The dreams like this have a certain significance in Islam

548
00:28:57,728 --> 00:29:03,104
But he's looking for this Jet magazine and he does a double-take because the girl looks so much like hay

549
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,152
OverWatch looks like Haze watch

550
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,712
So take a look at it and tell me what you think

551
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:09,248
I hope I'm not going crazy

552
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,320
I found this perplexing

553
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,856
He seems relaxed in a letter

554
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:17,184
This is a kid who is about to be sentenced to life in prison

555
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,024
He knows that's what's about to happen it's the mandatory sentence for his conviction

556
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:24,096
Conviction of course was for killing

557
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:25,888
Hey Chris is good friend

558
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,472
And in this pregnant life-changing moment he's writing a letter to

559
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:33,056
To Krista about whether a photo be flipping through a magazine

560
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,080
Looks like hay

561
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:35,616
Is it to

562
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:37,152
Nonchalant or something

563
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,176
Is it creepy

564
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,992
Not explain several things about this

565
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:47,648
First he wasn't especially nervous right then that was about to change but at that point he says he was thinking of his sentencing at

566
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:49,440
The procedure he needed to get through

567
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:52,000
So he could immediately start the appeals process

568
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:55,072
It was a step toward the thing he wanted

569
00:29:56,096 --> 00:30:02,240
Second it's not like they transport you from yourself right to the courtroom door and you're just outside straightening your tie before your big

570
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,008
Big moment

571
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,288
The opposite

572
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,128
There's an enormous collection of utter boredom and exhaustion built in

573
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,920
So you do other things

574
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:12,224
Read write letters whatever you can

575
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:15,808
It would be hard to understand like you spent hours

576
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,600
Cigna bullpens waiting

577
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,648
You know so it's like

578
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:23,488
If you just said if you get up at 3 in the morning

579
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:27,584
Did you let go downstairs in like the basement of the jail he's just sitting in the bullpen

580
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:30,912
Square Room

581
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:37,312
It's like a concrete bench built into the wall that goes around

582
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:41,664
And you might sit there till like that for 4 hours and you go to the court

583
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:48,320
I used to collect another for 5 hours until you go to court and let maybe 10:11 in the morning so after like

584
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,648
After doing this for so long it's just like you

585
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:53,184
Just like it numbs the mind

586
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,464
So

587
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:59,072
I mean I know people who took a plea deal just to not have to go to court anymore

588
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:03,168
I really honestly like not even exaggerating

589
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:08,800
The third thing is that Kristen was the only person he was in regular touch with who knew hey

590
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:11,104
And Krista didn't think that inanna killed her

591
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:14,432
You know so I can talk to her about hey it's not going to be like

592
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,480
You know like

593
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:17,504
I mean

594
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:23,904
You know she's got to me like to talk to her about anything or writer about anything

595
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:26,208
A lot of times that's what it would be

596
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:30,560
8 Days Later post-sentencing

597
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:32,352
He writes Krista another letter

598
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:33,888
ISO change

599
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:36,704
By this time he fired Christina Gutierrez

600
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,984
Asia letters

601
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,056
Public defender he doesn't really know

602
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:47,200
To tell the court he did not kill hay and it's going to continue to fight this to the end

603
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,992
That's what he says in his letter to Krista

604
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,320
And the guy says no no no terrible idea

605
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:54,880
Don't say you're innocent it'll anger the judge

606
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:58,464
I don't argue with him and according to Adnan the lawyer says

607
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,536
Well you can do it if you want but you're just going to f*** yourself over

608
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:08,448
That his mother was going to speak

609
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:11,264
She's been to the trial everyday I say

610
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:13,568
Sometimes I glimpsed her in the videos

611
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:17,408
Keeping perfectly still or doubled over or holding on to someone

612
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:23,808
There's more than one bench Conference during the trial in which they talked about her mother's crying being a possible distraction to the jury

613
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,624
Her pain throughout must have been abject

614
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:30,464
Translator Hayes mother speak

615
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,768
She tells the court about her daughter

616
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,328
She tells the court about a Korean proverb

617
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,144
That says when parents die they're buried in the ground

618
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:41,216
But when a child dies you bury the child in your heart

619
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,264
When I die

620
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:45,568
When I die my daughter will die with me

621
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,640
As long as I live my daughter is buried in my heart

622
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:50,688
I don't know where to hear her voice

623
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:52,480
I don't know where to touch her hand

624
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:54,784
I would like to forgive Adnan Syed

625
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:57,344
But as of now I just don't know how to do that

626
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,392
And I just cannot do that right now

627
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,256
For many many months we tried to contact his family

628
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:06,048
To tell them we were doing the story

629
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:08,352
And it hopes they might want to talk to us about hey

630
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,960
In my 20-plus years of reporting I've never tried as hard to find anyone

631
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:15,776
Letters in English and in Korean

632
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:19,104
Phone calls social media Friends of Friends of Friends

633
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,640
Two private detectives

634
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:24,480
Korean speaking researchers people knocking on doors in three different states called

635
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:25,504
South Korea

636
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,040
We never heard back from them

637
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:30,880
I learned a few days ago that they know what we're doing

638
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:32,672
My best guess is they want no part of it

639
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:33,696
Which I respect

640
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:38,048
About hey I can tell you only what I've heard from non-family members

641
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,608
But she was cheerful and light and funny

642
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,656
But you love the movie Titanic

643
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:46,496
But she sometimes put nail polish on just so she could pick it off

644
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:49,312
She wasn't insecure seemingly ever

645
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:51,104
Sprite was her favorite soda

646
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:57,248
The Dallas Cowboys her favorite team not because she cared about football but because she like the colors blue and silver

647
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,552
That you could charm you without trying

648
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:01,856
That she was a good friend to her friend

649
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:05,952
She took in their problems and their pain and try to help them if she could

650
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:18,752
At the sentencing listening to his mother

651
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:23,360
That was the first time an understood how people on his side of the courtroom saw him

652
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:25,408
Keep never felt hated before

653
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:28,992
When is June 14th 2000 letter to Krista he writes

654
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:33,344
And I feel her pain cuz I cared about her and how sad she is

655
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:36,928
But on the other I'm thinking please believe me I didn't kill your daughter

656
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:43,840
She was sitting right next to me and it was really sad but I couldn't help thinking that my mom is going through the exact same thing she's going to

657
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:45,120
Lose her son forever

658
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:49,216
Afterwards I was thinking my God No One Believes In Me

659
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:52,032
Krista I could never explain how that felt

660
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:55,104
Attorney that addresses the court

661
00:34:55,616 --> 00:35:01,248
Put your honor I would ask that this honorable court if it would consider this case more crime of passion than of intent to

662
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,016
To kill

663
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,808
Permanent letter

664
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,928
That's all I heard him say and I turned and just stared at him wanting to hit him with a chair or something

665
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,024
I mean this jerk is going to get up and give away the only thing I have my innocence

666
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:18,912
When he suddenly realizes he has no idea what to say

667
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:24,800
He had his plan but now quote on the other hand I'm thinking about what the lawyer said about the judge getting upset

668
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:30,432
On a certain I'm thinking man I should just apologize for everything even though I didn't kill hay

669
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,992
Stupid me I end up doing a little of each

670
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:36,064
It's true when his moment comes

671
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,648
He maintains his innocence he asks for the mercy of the Court

672
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:43,488
He says quote I'm just sorry for all the pain that this is caused everyone

673
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:51,168
The judge

674
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:53,472
Disagreed with a nonce attorney at sentencing

675
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:56,800
We know this because she said quote I disagree with you Council

676
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:58,592
This wasn't a crime of passion

677
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:01,152
She said you planned it

678
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:03,200
Intellect

679
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:04,736
Physical strength

680
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:10,880
Use that charismatic ability of yours that made you the president or what was it the king or the prince of your prom

681
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:17,280
And even today I think you continue to manipulate even those that love you

682
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,816
As you did to the victim

683
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:22,144
You manipulated her to go with you to her death

684
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:33,920
Early on I asked Adnan

685
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,712
If you're saying you're innocent

686
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:37,248
Why aren't you bitter and angry

687
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,784
Why do you sound so calm

688
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,576
He said a lot of things

689
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:41,856
Then and since

690
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:43,392
Because there's no one answer

691
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,464
Realizes how lucky he is

692
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,512
Compared to so many other guys inside

693
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:52,096
His family visits he calls him all the time they send him money

694
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:54,656
He's got people like Robbie inside pulling for him

695
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:56,960
I refuse to be miserable

696
00:36:58,752 --> 00:36:59,520
Being religious help

697
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:03,360
What you hear all the time about people in prison but I never thought about it too much

698
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:04,640
Before I got to know at 9

699
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:07,456
We end up in prison he says he made a choice

700
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,736
To be a better Muslim

701
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:12,832
I can say that for nearly half his life he's live like he's supposed to

702
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:15,648
He knows it's a rationalization of a situation

703
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:17,440
But it's been the most helpful one

704
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:20,256
Finally he says he's got a clear conscience

705
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:21,792
Because you didn't kill Hae

706
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:25,632
I'm here because of my own stupid actions

707
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:27,168
I have some money man

708
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:33,056
I mean

709
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:38,176
I never should have let someone hold my car let someone hold my phone

710
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,968
I never should have been friends with you

711
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:44,576
I mean I don't feel myself

712
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:49,440
If you think he's lying

713
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:50,976
I mean

714
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:52,256
Damn the police

715
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,536
Prosecutors but

716
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:54,304
I mean

717
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:01,216
But at the end of the day I have to take some responsibility

718
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:04,288
You don't really know the things that my younger brother went to

719
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:12,736
At the end of the day if I have been

720
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:20,160
You know what I mean

721
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:38,336
You know it

722
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:39,616
I can't

723
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:55,744
I can't ever admit to this crime

724
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,096
After all his parents have been through the fear and the money and the anguish

725
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:02,912
How could he ever turn around and say to them

726
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,960
Atlantic issue with that

727
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:08,288
Two most important people in the world

728
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:13,920
I know the thing that bothers me the most is not necessarily me being in prison for this

729
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:28,000
I should be done this and I told him the reason why

730
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:35,424
We're still going to take care of them

731
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:39,776
But at least we don't have any more than somewhere

732
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:46,944
They don't necessarily worry about me being imprisoned because

733
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,624
I'm healthy you know whatever to come pick me up

734
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:06,912
I deserve to be here

735
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:11,776
I can't say what would truly be easier for his family

736
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:16,384
Knowing their son had murdered someone or feeling as if he's been taken from them unjustly

737
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:19,200
But it is true that is not has always been fine in

738
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:19,968
In prison

739
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:20,992
Is adoptable

740
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:23,808
People never been independent anyway

741
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:25,856
First word of his parents been awarded

742
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:26,624
State

743
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:30,464
He spent the initial part of his sentence at a prison in Jessup

744
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,512
About a 30-minute drive for his family

745
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:35,840
It was a loser place in where he is now at North Branch

746
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:36,608
Cumberland

747
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:39,936
A maximum-security prison more than 2 hours away from Baltimore

748
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:42,496
I didn't have been like

749
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:44,288
Shifferly like corrupt places

750
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,568
So they're not really strict

751
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:46,848
Senseware

752
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,944
You know it's like all you got to do this and this time you got to do this at that time

753
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:54,272
So maybe it actually is

754
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:59,136
In Jessup especially people got away with all kinds of craziness

755
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,928
That person's clothes now

756
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:06,048
Only had one infraction his entire time would you guide the DLC told me was impressive

757
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:06,816
For anyone

758
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:10,912
After I asked about his prison record and non set me a stack of copies

759
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:11,936
21 difference

760
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:16,032
Certificates and awards for completing this program or helping with that activity

761
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:19,872
In 2005 he got one called the distinguished gentleman's award

762
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:25,248
You're consistent display of character mannerism self-control and ability to manage adversity

763
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,272
Signed by the word

764
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:30,112
Announce what infraction was for having a cell phone when she had fur

765
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:30,880
For five years

766
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:33,184
Actually had a couple of different cell phones

767
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,488
I knew when you got he can figure out how to make it work

768
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:02,879
I just have not had a good job he was a clerk in the chaplain's office

769
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:06,207
Which gave him access to a computer and to a printer and copier

770
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:09,791
Being an entrepreneur and a couple of side businesses

771
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:12,095
Printing stuff and making copies for people

772
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:13,887
North Branch she's a cook

773
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:17,471
He told me the only jobs at northmantrader kitchen jobs are custodial jobs

774
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:22,335
Is that a group of friends he's close with guys who came into the system the same time he did

775
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:24,895
Have a little Breakfast Club when she's in charge of

776
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:26,175
Another guy does lunch

777
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:28,223
Membership has its privileges

778
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:28,991
Game

779
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:32,831
Looks like caramelized apples and onions

780
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,671
They were really good and she's on their side

781
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:41,791
Banana French toast also hot cereal with peaches and raisins for lunch cheesesteaks

Anon lives in a Cell by himself he's got TV

785
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:54,079
What is getting in fights or seeing horrible things

786
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:55,615
He's not telling me about it

787
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:57,407
All the stuff he tells me about

788
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:59,199
Is that worst PG-13

789
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:01,503
He told me I have a life

790
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:04,063
It's not the life I planned or imagined

791
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,855
I have a life

792
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:10,719
Despite the Nisha call

793
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:15,327
Despite the leakin park cell tower evidence despite J knowing where his car was

794
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:19,423
I confess to having Reasonable Doubt about whether Adnan killed Hae

795
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:23,775
I'm talking about the normal person kind

796
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:29,663
How do you say trial isn't built to hold the stories at 9 or anyone tells about his life

797
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:35,039
Does lawyer Christina Gutierrez had to figure out another way to encourage Reasonable Doubt

798
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:36,575
Why didn't it work

799
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:37,855
