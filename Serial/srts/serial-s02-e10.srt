One of those lawyers sent a letter to Donald Trump about a week and a half ago

12
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:35,072
Regarding a possible deposition of trump

13
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:38,400
We're possible appearance as a witness during Bose court-martial

14
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:39,936
Dear mr. Trump

15
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:42,496
A request to interview you as soon as possible

16
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:47,872
Trump's been doing this bit about Bo On The Campaign Trail I watch video of it

17
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:51,200
About how crappy the trade was how was a traitor

18
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:53,760
Are these Taliban terrorists or back in the fight

19
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:55,040
But how in the old days

20
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:57,088
We shot people like Bo on the battlefield

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,904
How many times has this stupid Ratatat thing with it

22
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,256
What Trump says about Bo is true not in the way Trump

23
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:08,096
But the audience always give the big meaty Roar when he does it

24
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:14,752
In the old days deserters Rashad

25
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,176
Ever since I've been reporting this story when I've asked people people on all sides of this thing

26
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:24,992
What bothers them the most about those case

27
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:26,016
Gosei

28
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:28,064
I wish it hadn't gotten so political

29
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:29,856
Sucks that I got so political

30
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,184
Usually I just know I'd like in politics

31
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:37,280
Strafer bows just one more thing for Democrats and Republicans to yell at each other about

32
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:41,888
Then when I really looked at it

33
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,680
I like wait a minute

34
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,472
Was it inevitable

35
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:47,264
I got this combative

36
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:48,544
Because

37
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,848
Maybe it could have gone another way

38
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,344
From This American Life and WBEZ Chicago its serial

39
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,880
One story told week by week

40
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:03,648
I'm Sarah Kane

41
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,768
David trade

42
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:10,816
President Obama makes this big announcement

43
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:13,120
Find my Bob and Jani Bergdahl

44
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,656
He hugs and kisses.

45
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:17,728
And even though the president never called bow a hero

46
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,312
The heft of announcing it at the White House in the Rose Garden

47
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,616
Pump of it has cameras

48
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:27,456
It felt like the president was communicating something heroic

49
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,224
Triumph

50
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,296
Which if you're someone who served in the military

51
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:33,856
Maybe someone who went looking for Bose

52
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,904
That message was bad enough

53
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:37,440
But then

54
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,208
Very next

55
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:38,976
Day

56
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,536
National Security advisor Susan Rice went on

57
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,304
TV

58
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,096
She was on one of the Sunday news shows

59
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46,144
The host George Stephanopoulos

60
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,424
Ask her about though

61
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:54,080
Finally on this point I start charging for a lot of questions about how we originally was capturing whether or not he had a deserted have left

62
00:02:54,336 --> 00:03:00,480
I his post is that going to be investigated and it was found that he did indeed I leave his post will he be discipline

63
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,016
Lindor's already paid the price

64
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:06,112
Certainly anybody who's been held

65
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:12,512
In those conditions in captivity for 5 years is paid and extraordinary price but that that is really

66
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,560
Not the point the point is that he's back

67
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:20,704
He's going to be safely reunited with his family he served the United States with honor and distinction

68
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,984
And we'll have a map

69
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,264
Wow

70
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,800
Honor and distinction

71
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:31,200
Talati military people it was like the administration had reached out of their televisions and giving them the finger

72
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,480
Right in our living room

73
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:38,880
And then it became this like oh he's a hero who served with honor and distinction it what what really made me angry

74
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:39,904
Facts about

75
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,208
Lester's Auto distinction

76
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,000
That I hit pretty hard

77
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,792
I was irate it's just like

78
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,328
Wait a minute

79
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:53,728
Some government officials were saying

80
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,008
At the circumstances

81
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:57,056
Sergeant Bergdahl capture weren't clear

82
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,848
And the soldiers were like

83
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:02,176
Oh the circumstances are clear he walked away

84
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,224
I feel so shity

85
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,528
We don't really know the truth

86
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,088
That's Mark McCrory who's in Bose battalion

87
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,880
It it took us

88
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:11,648
You know

89
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,256
Screaming into the internet to to be heard

90
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:20,095
Some of the guys from Bo's former unit got in touch with each other immediately

91
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:23,167
Someone started if he's not a hero Facebook group

92
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:27,519
People started tweeting one of them was Cody full who been in both Batoon

93
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:30,591
Actually rooms with bow back in training Alaska

94
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:33,151
He want to talk to me on the record for this story

95
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:39,551
What is Triscuit the attention of a media guy named Brad Chase and of a guy named Rick grenell a public relations strategy

96
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:42,879
Jessie's work for some big-name Republicans json Grinnell work together

97
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,695
And they said if you want to go on TV

98
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,999
Get a wider audience for what you want to say

99
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:51,071
Join me first tonight former Army specialist

100
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,607
Cody full and Gerald Sutton

101
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,911
First stop was Fox News

102
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:58,239
Cody let me start with you do you believe that Bowe Bergdahl

103
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,263
Deserted

104
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:00,287
Yes

105
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,591
I do believe he deserted without a doubt in my mind

106
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:06,175
The other guy on TV with Cody that day was Gerald Sutton

107
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,967
He was also in Bozeman

108
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:08,991
Is friends with bow

109
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:12,575
He told me Cody had contacted him and said we had to do something

110
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,599
We help me

111
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,695
Use before jail said he had tried to tell people would have gone down

112
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,975
About walked away

113
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,511
He wrote something on the Internet

114
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,791
Two others had to

115
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:24,351
He said nobody seem to pay much attention back then

116
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,655
And he worried the same thing would happen now

117
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:29,471
I didn't think anyone could take a seriously

118
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:35,871
I guess the reason why we had so many people behind us

119
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:38,943
Is that if one of us just came out and said it then

120
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:42,271
People just Glycol used to describe a person so maybe if

121
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:44,063
The entire platoon came out

122
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:48,159
And said they aren't that maybe it would be taken seriously for once

123
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:55,071
By 6 members of Bowe Bergdahl Splatoon guys thank you all so much for being here

124
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,167
2 Days Later Fox again

125
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,959
The timer panel of platoon mates

126
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,263
Soldiers made other TV appearances

127
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,287
CNN

128
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,079
ABC MSNBC

129
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,359
We're hearing a lot about him

130
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:09,919
From his fellow platoon members

131
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:13,247
Would you like to see a dishonorable discharge for him

132
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,295
Yes yes he needs to be held

133
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:21,695
100% accountable for what he did with him in Afghanistan

134
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,743
Is he deserted us

135
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:27,071
In the middle of Afghanistan Taliban

136
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,375
Among the latest they were a lot more

137
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,423
Like to say

138
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,703
Fitzgerald something again

139
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,007
And more precise and

140
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,543
They seem more entertaining to

141
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:40,127
With me I'm very Bland

142
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,687
Gerald didn't want to go on any more shows

143
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,711
Anyways limits

144
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:45,247
And he wanted to stick to the facts

145
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,295
No pinyin no speculation

146
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,831
And I don't want to

147
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:55,231
Even though it's like 30 seconds Snippets or whatever here in there like I don't want someone just to be like what the fuc

148
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:04,447
The problem was that maybe Gerald was like Bo a fact-based dude

149
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:07,519
But he was just no match for the Juggernaut that was now up and rolling

150
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,335
Fox News especially with all over it

151
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:13,663
In fact just before they had that panel of six guys from seconds

152
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:21,087
They dared an exclusive report breaking tonight we are learning exclusive and dramatic new details about sergeant

153
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:29,791
Including reports that he became a Muslim and declared himself a warrior for

154
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:30,559
For Islam

155
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:35,423
The story was based on frankly bulshit Intel from a discredited source

156
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,959
But now it was out there

157
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,239
Is repeated

158
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,007
Repeated

159
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,567
Next the politics of it all.

160
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,335
Became the story

161
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:45,663
The Obama Administration was using Bose trade

162
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,687
Political purposes

163
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,759
Note the right was using this for political

164
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,575
Using these former platoon mates for political

165
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:57,439
After all Ric grenell the media guy helping them he was a big Republican strategist

166
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,487
Again for guys like Gerald

167
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,767
None of that was the point

168
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,327
They weren't trying to attack the president

169
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,863
Weren't even trying to attack me

170
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:09,727
Even Cody full and often on the topic of bow

171
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,775
He testified at a congressional hearing

172
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:14,847
You want to make sure bow was held accountable for what he did

173
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:18,943
But even he resisted Obama bathing by Republican congressman

174
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:24,063
If you could say anything to President Obama regarding this trade what would you say

175
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:31,487
Fair enough mr. Wallace you're forewarned same question

176
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,815
You say that same hearing Mike Wallace also test

177
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:39,423
He told the committee he was there before them in part because of the Rose Garden

178
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:42,495
Mike's a lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserves

179
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,519
Former Green Beret

180
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:46,079
Cuban commander of army Special Forces

181
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:48,639
He said what I'm lots of missions looking for bow

182
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,943
For that he worked in the bush White House

183
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:54,271
The special advisor to Dick Cheney on South Asia and counterterrorism

184
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,599
What are red Mike's testimony and Cody

185
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:01,951
I like all this is because of a 5-minute ceremony in the Rose Garden

186
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,487
Because of how it looked

187
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,535
Ask Mike about that

188
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,815
And kind of schooled me

189
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,863
Are you saying like

190
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:12,447
But none of us would even be talking about this if

191
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,471
Basically

192
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,239
Do you know

193
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,775
The president hadn't

194
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:19,359
Done that Rose Garden thing and imma try to politicize it

195
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:25,247
I will answer I will yeah I mean I mean

196
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:28,063
It's all about the Optics

197
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:32,415
Another words or is this like what I mean are you just saying like I wouldn't even be

198
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,951
I wouldn't got in my legs

199
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,743
Feathers ruffled about this if

200
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:42,911
There had I don't think I can I don't want to speak for anyone else I don't believe that

201
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:43,935
I would have been

202
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:44,703
Asvogue

203
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,519
That was that was a

204
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:53,919
Justin a incredibly tone-deaf move on the part of the White House I think it shows at the it how disconnected they

205
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:54,687
They are from

206
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:59,807
Both the Pentagon and I think it is truly lacking understanding the military culture

207
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:02,111
When you have the National Security advisor

208
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:06,463
Yoanna civil-military system or them who the military has to listen to

209
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:09,279
Essentially knife handing on National Television

210
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:12,351
Sending the signal that this man was honorable

211
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:19,007
Yo I was afraid that it would all be forgotten in that this was going to be politically swept under the

212
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:19,775
Carpet

213
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:23,359
Mike and to a lot of people watching and listening to the president that

214
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,407
It wasn't just what he said

215
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,943
I'm glad those back

216
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,479
We're committed to ending this war

217
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,527
We support reconciliation

218
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:32,319
We're committed to closing gitmo

219
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:34,367
It's not just that he said all that

220
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,415
It's what the president didn't say

221
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,463
That's what was glaring

222
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:42,047
No recognition or even mention of

223
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:47,679
We understand there were some irregularities or some question about his disappearance

224
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:50,495
And I want to assure all veterans

225
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:57,151
All former pows and everyone involved with a search that we will objectively in Fairly get to the bottom of

226
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,431
What happened at a time

227
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:02,271
Daylight I felt that Justice

228
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,807
Was not going to even be a

229
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:04,575
Attempted

230
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:15,839
I've asked many people Lo these many months in other parts of government

231
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,631
What was the White House thank you

232
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,167
Why they do it

233
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,959
And everyone I've asked

234
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:24,799
I don't know what happened over there that day but

235
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,335
I'm sure they regret it now

236
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,127
I do regret it

237
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:30,687
Because this Rose Garden event

238
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,991
Picked up so much anger and resentment

239
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:36,063
Apparently it was put together kind of spur-of-the-moment

240
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:39,391
What are those things where you like I know let's have a party at the Great

241
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,183
Except big

242
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,207
That mistake

243
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,487
None of it

244
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,767
President speech

245
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,303
The podium the Rose Garden

246
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:49,375
None of it was the original plan for how to announce his trade

247
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,447
The original plan was a much quieter affair

248
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:59,359
Don't we talk to me on tape about this but off tape I talked to several people who worked in the White House at the

249
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:02,687
Time they also very similar stories about what happened that day

250
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,479
So this is their version

251
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,503
Haircuts

252
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:09,599
Rose rescue operation was touch-and-go for several days

253
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:12,927
Amber the C-17 sitting and sitting at Guantanamo

254
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:15,231
It was high wire the whole thing

255
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,767
It all went smoothly in the end

256
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:20,095
But leading up to it you don't know if the Special Operations guys

257
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:23,423
Are helicopters going to crash if they're going to get into a firefight

258
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:26,239
Turn off Bose going to get hurt or killed during the rescue

259
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:29,055
How to be Stone secret the whole time

260
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:32,639
The qataris have made it clear that even a word of this gets out beforehand

261
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,919
The deal is off

262
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:38,271
People in the White House said this might be the last real chance to get bow back

263
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,367
How much of the week before the trade inside the White House

264
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,903
What's the national security offices

265
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,695
They've been working around the clock

266
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,279
If I see the scene in the movie what is it like

267
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:53,119
Mostly I was sleeping under my desk for 4 days

268
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,655
Chicken curry

269
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,191
That's Jeff Eggers

270
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,471
He was a special assistant

271
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,519
The president for National Security affairs

272
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:03,871
He's also a retired Navy SEAL he deployed to Iraq he works in Afghanistan

273
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:07,711
Even helping coordinate those recovery with the dod and the state of

274
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,015
Cuz it started to gain

275
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:16,927
Momentum that week and it was your are you are you being euphemistic you're sleeping under your desk or you're actually sitting on

276
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:17,695
On your desk

277
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:21,023
No I was actually sleeping under my desk will actually is next to my desk

278
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,327
For 4 days

279
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,351
I think

280
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:27,167
That was also the week that the president made some

281
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,191
Significant

282
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:31,775
Announcements about trip decisions in Afghanistan that was actually a big week

283
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,591
It was a timing of that just coincidental

284
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,639
Those two really Continental

285
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:41,503
President Obama had already done a more solemn Rose Garden event that we

286
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,807
May 27th 2014

287
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:50,463
Announce the big drawdown of troops by the end of the year and a plan to get out of Afghanistan fully by the end of 26

288
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:51,999
Quotes

289
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:55,839
Americans have learned it is harder to end Wars than it is to begin them

290
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,679
And now a few days later May 31st

291
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:03,519
They just gotten word the operation to rescue bowhead work

292
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,567
He was alive he was safe

293
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,895
The National Security folks and the White House Press folks

294
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,687
Knew it was going to be

295
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,711
Lumpy

296
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,479
The snooze

297
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,527
A trading 5 Taliban

298
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,807
It's going to be controversial

299
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:19,391
But the circumstances of both capture we're going to be a topic

300
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:20,927
A nail

301
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:25,023
The people I talk to you in the White House weren't strangers to military culture

302
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,095
How many people who worked on this exchange had been in the military

303
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,375
Carry such as Jeff Eggers

304
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:32,703
Or had worked closely with military force in war zones

305
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:37,055
They thought it was important that the president own the decision to make this trade

306
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,103
That explain the policy behind it

307
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:42,175
So the original plan for how to announce it

308
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:45,503
Release a written statement from the president

309
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,551
The Pentagon would also release written

310
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:48,831
At the same time

311
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,111
Done

312
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:55,231
Well Bob and Jani Bergdahl happened to be in town

313
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:59,839
They come to DC for some meetings have been scheduled long before with the administration

314
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:05,727
No one told them this is about to take place their visit to DC was not planned to coincide with those return

315
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:09,567
Urbana Park playing with some friends little children when they got the call

316
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,871
And it seemed to make sense

317
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,663
They're in town already

318
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:16,991
Instead of just a phone call the president will see them in person

319
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:23,135
And now here's where I'd argue there was a blind spot about how all this would look

320
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,671
And that no one in the White House

321
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,439
Catch it

322
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:29,023
I've been working on this for years

323
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,839
First the talks with the Taliban then the operation.

324
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:32,607
Well

325
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,911
They met with both parents before some of them

326
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:38,751
And so what people told me is that for them it's not that they were oblivious

327
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,103
It's just that that day that moment they felt so

328
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,127
Happy

329
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:50,271
They've been on tenterhooks for days weeks even and now this horrible Saga had come to an unknown and gotten hurt

330
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:54,111
And you got both parents right there you can see their faces crying

331
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:54,879
Defecting

332
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:59,231
Meanwhile there are some very good reporters in Washington

333
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,279
And it Guantanamo as I mentioned

334
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,839
If you have them had known this was going to go down

335
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:04,863
Butthead held off

336
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:05,631
Reporting it

337
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:08,191
Turn out the White House Press people thought

338
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,727
Well we need to placate them

339
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:10,751
Please.

340
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,567
Because if we have the bergdahl's here with the president

341
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:16,127
We don't let some photographers catch that scene

342
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,431
Give them was called camera spray

343
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,455
I'm going to be pissed

344
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,759
Terminate let's arrange at least for that

345
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:24,831
Maybe a shot of President walking and talking with the bird dolls

346
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:26,879
Man

347
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:29,183
It was such a sunny day

348
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,719
Such good news for once

349
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:31,999
Why not

350
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:34,047
Do the whole thing in the Rose Garden

351
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,119
So in the space of a few hours

352
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,911
It went from a simple statement

353
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,447
To a Rose Garden ceremony

354
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:44,031
Nedrebo's parents talking at all from the podium

355
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,847
How much was Bob speaking some words in Pashto in Arabic

356
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,383
Does utterly impromptu

357
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,711
As for the Susan Rice thing

358
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:55,039
Ambassador rice politely decline to talk to me for this story

359
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:57,599
People I talked to told me

360
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,135
A cringed when she said it

361
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:03,231
This is talking to the Press is not her forte she got a little defensive

362
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,279
And this cliche tumbledown

363
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,815
Honor and distinction

364
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,631
2 Days Later rice explain herself

365
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:15,007
Thanks you just meant that volunteering to serve his country in a time of war was an honorable thing to do

366
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,287
By then

367
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:19,103
Honor and distinction was already caught in Amber

368
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:21,407
It was going to be any shaking it loose

369
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,831
You're pretty isolated when you work in The West Wing

370
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:31,135
The one person used to work there told me

371
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:33,439
You're pretty cut off from the normal workaday world

372
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,999
It's easy to forget how iconic it all is

373
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,023
Columns

374
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,071
Podium with presidential seal

375
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:43,167
They told me there wasn't a concerted effort to make Bowe Bergdahl into a hero

376
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,215
To whitewash what happened in Afghanistan

377
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:48,031
I know it looks that way but there really wasn't

378
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,567
Grand political calculus

379
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,639
They were just tired and abuzz with relief

380
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:53,407
And I thought

381
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:55,455
Everyone will feel This Joy right

382
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:56,735
I got carried away

383
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,807
In hindsight one former staffer told me

384
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,087
We should have thought about it more

385
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,879
But there were other audiences

386
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:03,647
What's worth watching

387
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:04,671
People who suffer

388
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:07,743
The Rose Garden put a Target on her back

389
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:11,327
And this is me talking

390
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,887
I think it also put a Target on Bose back

391
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,055
Just walk with me now

392
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,847
Along this path from the White House

393
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,383
Up the street a ways

394
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,151
Capitol Hill

395
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:27,199
I swear we won't stay there too long

396
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:30,783
But this is the next place where the politics of this trade Harden

397
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,551
An intense

398
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,319
Certified

399
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,623
I get it it's Congress

400
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:38,719
They're in a constant state of Readiness to hate anything President Obama comes up with

401
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,511
But this time

402
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:46,655
First off no one from the White House or DOD or the state department no one

403
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,959
Told Congress this trade was about to go down

404
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:51,775
So members heard about it on the news Bass

405
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:52,799
Basically like everyone else

406
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:56,895
By law the administration was supposed to notify Congress

407
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:57,663
30 days

408
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,223
Before any detainee was transferred out of Guantanamo

409
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,271
This time they didn't

410
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:03,807
And that was on purpose

411
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,367
The White House didn't want members to get mad

412
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:08,159
And to try to stop the deal from taking place

413
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,695
I hope we can get to the Press

414
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:12,767
Why did they think Congress would get mad

415
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:17,119
Well because the administration already knew that Congress. It stunk this

416
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,935
Back in 2012

417
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,215
When the trade was still linked

418
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:21,983
Peace talks

419
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:24,543
The Taliban and it really seems like it might go forward

420
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:27,103
The White House and arrange some classified briefings in

421
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:29,151
Special rooms on Capitol Hill

422
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,943
Stuff happens barely

423
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:33,759
And members had made themselves pretty clear at the time

424
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:37,087
The reactions to a proposed trade 5 Taliban guys

425
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,135
Range from skeptical

426
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:39,903
Horrified

427
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:43,231
Princeton's then Senator Saxby chambliss

428
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:49,631
Republican from Georgia and a briefing of the Senate intelligence committee on January of 2012 almost two-and-a-half

429
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,679
Years before it actually took place

430
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,727
Talking about trading the stylebender

431
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:57,823
I want to State publicly as strongly as I can

432
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:02,943
That we should not transfer these detainees from Guantanamo

433
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:05,759
Sobe ministration worried understandably

434
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:08,063
That if they brought it up again it'll get crushed

435
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:10,879
We might not be able to get bow back at all

436
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:11,903
Decision was made

437
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,695
Don't say anything

438
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:20,351
So by 2014 a lot of people in Congress assume the deal was dead which was a reasonable thing to think

439
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:22,655
Is that more or less what they've been told over the years

440
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,703
You can see in

441
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,983
State Department memos

442
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:31,359
In January and February of 2014 even as a ministration was working to revive the deal

443
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:36,479
Officials called around a certain offices on Capitol Hill to update certain members of Congress

444
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,271
About the Bergdahl situation

445
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,551
The calls ended with

446
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:44,415
Quote we told them we would keep them updated and continue to consult before taking any action

447
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:47,231
But they didn't consult Congress

448
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:49,791
Cuz your Converse was hearing it on the news

449
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,863
All of that was it was a surprise

450
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,143
Giselle blatant

451
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:59,007
A blatant and intentional

452
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:02,591
That's Mac Thornberry Texas Republican

453
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:05,919
The time of the trade he was a member of the House armed services committee

454
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:06,943
Notus High School

455
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,223
Now he's the chairman

456
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:15,135
Ask oversees the Department of Defense and has staffers in the Republican side told me that that relationship with

457
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:15,903
Tod

458
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,696
Has traditionally been pretty solid

459
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,464
Cooperative

460
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,488
Straightforward

461
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,144
Now they realized. She had been the lead on hammering out this final Bergdahl deal and had told them nothing

462
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,448
For instance

463
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,008
Three and a half months before the trade happened

464
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:34,336
The Washington Post publish the story quoting unnamed sources

465
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:37,408
Talk about the five Taliban going to Doha

466
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,432
Was pretty detailed

467
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,528
Ask stuff they said they asked the dod about it

468
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,320
Hey is there anything to this

469
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,600
And they said they were told

470
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:46,624
Nope

471
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,672
It's possible

472
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,440
Probable

473
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:52,256
Actually that the person they called wasn't lying

474
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,792
They weren't in the know

475
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:59,424
Meanwhile emails are singing among all these other government officials who are in the know

476
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:02,496
Quote who's leaking this very accurate info

477
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:04,288
These leaks are killing us

478
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:06,592
We need to talk about getting control back

479
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:13,504
Tony blinken at the White House sent one around about his dismay and disgust over the week since it could derail the deal quote

480
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,856
Simply put whoever is responsible should look him or herself in the mirror and ask

481
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:20,928
By what right did I jeopardize the life of a fellow American

482
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,232
Here's Thornberry again

483
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:27,840
We had specific questions you know why these press reports right

484
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,632
They denied

485
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,656
Denied it

486
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,448
In looking back

487
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,752
Now we know that in

488
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:38,848
Some instances they were too cute by half

489
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,688
By saying well we're not in negotiations today

490
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:49,088
When the guy was about to get on a plane and go to the Mideast to have negotiations tomorrow

491
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:54,208
What he's talking about is a congressional Hearing in late April just a month before the trade

492
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,536
State Department official was asked about efforts to recover bow

493
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:59,840
And he gives his kind of cryptic update

494
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:00,864
He says

495
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,680
Agencies across the government we're striving

496
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:07,776
In the most quote energetic and creative ways we can devise unquote

497
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,056
To secure Bose release

498
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:15,200
Unfortunately the Taliban broke off direct contact with us in January of 2012

499
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:21,344
We would very much like to return to direct contact with them and if we do at the top of our agenda will be Sergeant Bergdahl

500
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,184
It is certainly not the case as was reported that somehow

501
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,512
It's how that my Connie Network are seeking to release him and and that

502
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:31,840
Interagency squabbles within the United States government are

503
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:32,864
Preventing or delaying

504
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,656
Thank you very much

505
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,216
That same guy

506
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,264
Weather in Doha by the next day

507
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,544
From eating

508
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,824
About the Bergdahl trade

509
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:46,688
The administration wasn't exactly forthcoming with Congress

510
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,248
On the other hand it was an open hearing

511
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,064
And he's talking about a deal so fragile

512
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:55,392
He doesn't know if it's going to fall apart like the others before it

513
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,928
Regardless

514
00:23:57,184 --> 00:24:02,816
Once Hask staffers on the Republican side went back and traced exactly what they were and weren't told

515
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:05,120
What's a investigated the whole trade

516
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:07,424
Issued a strongly-worded report about it

517
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:10,496
That report then entered the political Fray

518
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:14,336
Democrats called it an expression of shrill demagoguery

519
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:18,432
Accused the Republicans of using the tray to push their National Security agenda

520
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:21,248
Republicans accuse Democrats of exactly the same thing

521
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:24,064
I talked to some Hask staffers

522
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,368
Again on the Republican side about this whole thing

523
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:29,440
And they sounded to me surprisingly

524
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:33,536
Genuinely upset by what had happened to their ones collegial relationship

525
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:34,304
What's Tod

526
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:37,888
If that's going to be the relationship going forward

527
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,168
Then

528
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,984
There is nothing but can we rely upon

529
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,568
But they are telling us about any given issue

530
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,128
Like you just feel like you don't trust those guys anymore

531
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:49,920
Yes

532
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:55,808
Is this a big like I says the Big E that you've seen where you're just like I cannot believe

533
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,648
How this went down or is this just like oh my God there's like

534
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,208
This happens 3 times a year on different things

535
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,256
We view this is unprecedented

536
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,560
The staffer said

537
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:09,632
We're not just foot-stomping here that you guys didn't tell us

538
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:15,008
Actually a profound concern about

539
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,544
National Security risk

540
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,848
And the risk to

541
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:25,248
Particular our forces deployed overseas in Afghanistan

542
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:26,528
So

543
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:28,832
We're worried

544
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:31,904
She's talking about the Taliban five

545
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:36,512
They felt like the president and the dod had done an end-run around the approval process

546
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,536
Just forget Mo transfer

547
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,072
Encino

548
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:40,864
Who are these 5 Taliban guys anyway

549
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:43,168
How can we trust you that they're safe to release

550
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,216
But they won't rejoin the battle

551
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:46,240
Who signed off on this

552
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:50,592
This part of the fight over Bose trade

553
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:55,200
I want to talk about it for a minute because it mirrors a deeper bare-knuckled fight

554
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,736
Over Guantanamo

555
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:00,064
President wants to close Guantanamo

556
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:02,112
Most republicans in Congress

557
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,648
Even though President Bush wanted to

558
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:04,416
2

559
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:06,976
They've opposed the idea since Obama took office

560
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:09,024
And what are the arguments they make

561
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:12,864
Is that some of the prisoners we released from gitmo have rejoined the fight

562
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,144
Industrial

563
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:15,680
Most heaven

564
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:20,288
So it's a fair question right what about these five Taliban guys

565
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,592
Were they safe to release from Guantanamo

566
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:31,040
There's probably nobody including the military who knows the ins and outs of gitmo better than Carol Rosenberg from them

567
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:31,808
Miami Herald

568
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,648
I'm actually asked military people questions about Guantanamo

569
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,184
And they referred me

570
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,464
Carol Rosenberg

571
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:43,584
Explain that these five guys were what's known down there as forever prisoners

572
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,376
They hadn't been cleared for release

573
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:48,704
And I hadn't been and wouldn't be charged with crimes

574
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:52,544
But they also weren't going through the administration's new review

575
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:57,152
An interagency board meant to assess each detainee who is still down there

576
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:01,504
And figure out whether they could be cleared for transfer or should still be held

577
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:07,904
By all accounts this review process is a much more rigorous and we're rational look at the intelligence that has been done in the past

578
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:10,208
Again these Five Guys

579
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,232
Weren't on the list

580
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,000
Review

581
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,024
There's Carol

582
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:17,632
Three of these guys got there on the first day you would have thought that they'd get the first reviews

583
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,168
But they didn't

584
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:23,776
And I'm watching through the years why aren't they reviewing these guys why aren't these reviewing the

585
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:24,544
Disguise

586
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:31,200
When I started asking questions really early why are

587
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:31,968
Betrayed

588
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:35,296
What do you think they're trying to push them through the board to get him in position

589
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:40,160
And then they're not they're not and I'm like

590
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:45,024
I wonder if they think that they intelligent people won't clear them

591
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:46,816
Right

592
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:48,864
Got it

593
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:51,424
Right if you have it on paper

594
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,984
That it would look even worse for the President right

595
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,032
Yeah

596
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:58,592
Imagine if they been rejected for released by the board

597
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:00,384
And the USA traded them anyway

598
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:08,064
Since there wasn't a review we don't have in any public way at least

599
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:11,136
A recent intelligent assessment on these Five Guys

600
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,464
However I talked to someone who should know

601
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:17,024
That guy Nathan not his real name

602
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,816
You heard him back in episode 5

603
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:22,912
He's a guy who is close to the recovery effort for bow and it worked with both parents

604
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,472
Nathan is not a lefty

605
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:29,568
He's former military and he was an Intel Analyst at gitmo

606
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:31,872
The specialty was afghanistan-pakistan

607
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:35,456
He did two stints in Guantanamo for a total of 3 years

608
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,992
Ending in 2013

609
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:39,808
So he knew all about these Taliban guys

610
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,880
Is office equipment was a stone's throw from where they were being held

611
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:49,536
Nathan Radley admits that he's biased and surprised you wanted to come home and he was working for that very goal

612
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:52,352
But he was not happy about this trade

613
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:57,472
He doesn't hate it like a lot of his peers in the MLS world you just wishes it hadn't come to that

614
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:01,312
The only option left for the president was this getmoe option

615
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,872
It wasn't the political will to do anything else

616
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,664
He also thinks

617
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,944
These Five Guys

618
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,480
They're okay to release

619
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:14,624
They're being watched closely in Qatar their high-profile so they can't hide everyone knows who they are and what they look

620
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:19,232
Nathan says there's just not much they be able to pull off even if they want it

621
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,304
The value to the Taliban in Afghanistan he said

622
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,608
Is pretty much limited to a rallying cry

623
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:28,704
You know was very familiar with them and honestly

624
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:33,312
I didn't feel that it was that big of a danger to relieve so I really didn't

625
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:36,128
No not even that sort of guys

626
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,200
Nori and and Fazal who were the

627
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:39,968
Kind of

628
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:41,248
Biggest fish it seems like

629
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:43,808
Yeah yeah definitely

630
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:48,160
They're not going to be that they're not going to trouble trouble it's

631
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:48,928
Because

632
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:49,696
You know

633
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:54,048
We let them be trouble cuz we drop the ball on you know keep an eye on them

634
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:56,096
Do you feel like you guys had

635
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:57,632
Clear door

636
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:02,240
I know it's not your job to clear someone for release but had recommended release

637
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:04,544
Forehead seeing people released

638
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:07,360
Hoover on par with these guys

639
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:11,200
Sure sure yeah and you know we've released

640
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,600
But yeah I definitely would definitely release them

641
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,392
Not so good guys that were

642
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,416
Supposed to be

643
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,952
I'm in love with you guys

644
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,304
Right so it's like you didn't see the names and just like

645
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,840
Freak out like I

646
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:35,776
And there's only like one or two people that get mailed it would freak me out if we

647
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:42,176
That's going to be a problem going to be a problem

648
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:46,528
But it's but you're being serious like they're really only a few who

649
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,320
You know and

650
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:49,600
And frankly

651
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:53,440
We got it we got to do something when you get mold I'm leaving gitmo

652
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:56,512
They would have laughed anyway if you know at least we

653
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:57,792
Made use of them

654
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:58,816
Yasso

655
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,144
The heart reaction to this trade

656
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,936
Nathan says he understands it

657
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,472
But he also says

658
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:07,264
It's not exactly based on the fact

659
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:14,176
Leave the anger over releasing those guys comes down to a lot of the same reasons why people are

660
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:20,064
You know it's still mad at bo4 walk out the basic it's it's it's very personal thing like you don't

661
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,392
I think they feel very strongly about what these guys have done

662
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:26,464
And we know what kind of people they are and

663
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,280
You don't negotiate you don't make trades

664
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:32,608
You know so they're wrapped up in a larger moral question

665
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:38,496
Obama releases Five Guys

666
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:39,520
Congress didn't like

667
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:44,128
To be clear Congress doesn't get a vote on individual get mode transfers like this

668
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,664
They're just supposed to be notified

669
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:50,016
Right after the trade the White House explained that the Secretary of Defense

670
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:52,064
Had followed all the requirements

671
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,856
For the detainee transfers

672
00:31:54,112 --> 00:32:00,256
Got the 30-day notice could have endangered bows life and that they believe the president had the Constitutional thought

673
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,536
Authority to make this decision

674
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,632
But disagreed all around Republicans and Democrats

675
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:08,960
Administration I pulled a fast one by not giving the 30 day notice

676
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:13,056
And the government accountability office which is non-partisan

677
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:16,640
Found that the dod broke the law by doing the transfer the way it did

678
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,456
Which that happens sometimes

679
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:24,576
President Obama's definitely not the first to claim executive power in order to make a move like this

680
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:30,720
But when a president does that rankles Congress tends to push back with whatever power it has

681
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,000
In this case

682
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:34,816
One way to do that get no legislation

683
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:38,400
So here's a fairly tangible effect of the trade for bow

684
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:41,472
There's this massive annual defense bill

685
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:46,848
Put together by the House and Senate armed services committee has decided for the past 5 years

686
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:53,504
Is language specifying what the Secretary of Defense has to do before he can sign off on any foreign Tran

687
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,552
Answers of gitmo detainees

688
00:32:55,808 --> 00:33:01,952
After the trade Republicans decided to change that language to make it harder to transfer

689
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:05,792
Anyone Adam Smith Democrat from Washington State

690
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:10,400
Was one of four lawmakers trying to come to final agreement on that bill last year

691
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:15,520
I talked to him over the summer when he was still in the thick of arguing with Republicans over the harsher transfer

692
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,360
Smith has been a big proponent of shutting down gitmo

693
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:24,992
Can I were both on the phone when I asked him about it both of us traveling in cars actually so the tape isn't great

694
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:29,600
How much is the the Bergdahl trade for the Taliban

695
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:31,392
Does 5 Taliban guys

696
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:37,280
It is that a shadow over what you guys are doing right now and how big is shadow

697
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:39,328
It's a pretty darn big shadow

698
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:47,264
I don't think we would be having the discussion of further foreign transfer restriction

699
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:50,592
Really well

700
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:00,832
Republican Mac Thornberry

701
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:05,184
It was also one of the four lawmakers negotiating that Bill said it's true

702
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,464
Bergdorf thing

703
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:07,488
Corrosive

704
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,840
They were not going to budge on that stricter standard for letting people out of gitmo

705
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,376
No there's no question

706
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:15,168
I mean it was a direct result

707
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:18,240
The Bergdahl trade

708
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:19,520
And

709
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:23,104
The not telling Congress the truth

710
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:28,736
Another result less tangible Maybe

711
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:32,064
Is it outrage and suspicion over the trade

712
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,856
Spilled over onto Bo himself

713
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:36,672
June 11

714
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:37,696
2014

715
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:41,280
The house armed services committee held up at hearing on the bird.

716
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:47,936
At the start of this hearing I'm pleased to welcome members of the public who have such an interest in these

717
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:48,704
Proceedings

718
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:53,312
Chairman open by saying we are not going to talk about Bergdahl personally

719
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:56,896
Let me be clear up front on the focus of today's hearing

720
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:59,200
It is not my intention

721
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,992
The dive into the circumstances

722
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,272
The parents of

723
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:04,320
Horse it came up

724
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:08,160
Testifying before the committee with defense secretary Chuck Hagel

725
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:12,512
He had to answer all the who knew what when questions that were pissing Congress off

726
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:15,840
Representative Jeff Miller Republican took a turn at the mic

727
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:21,216
Did you or did you not notify Congress within the 30-day time frame yes or no

728
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:22,496
No

729
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:27,360
Okay yes or no

730
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:33,760
Mac miller started asking questions about Bo

731
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:36,064
Stoughton American Military Hospital in Germany

732
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:42,464
And what we are doing is we are allowed

733
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:43,488
Wait a minute

734
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:47,072
Why hasn't even returned to the United States we have

735
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:49,120
Seriously wounded soldiers

736
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:51,168
Better return to the United States

737
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:53,984
Almost immediately after they are stabilized

738
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,776
How long did Jessica Lynch

739
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:04,736
Wait before she was returned to the United States you're trying to tell me that he's being held at Landstuhl Germany

740
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:07,040
Because of his medical condition

741
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:11,136
Cars but I hope you're not implying anything other than that

742
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:17,536
The question Mister secretary

743
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:18,304
Answer it

744
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,120
The implication

745
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:21,888
I think

746
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:24,448
Was it maybe something fishy was going on with bow

747
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,496
Something embarrassing to the Army

748
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:28,288
The baby this Bergdahl fellow

749
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:31,872
An American soldier who made just brought home at enormous cost

750
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:33,920
I walked off to join the Taliban

751
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:36,480
And now they were hiding him away in Germany

752
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:38,784
Hegel fended all of this off

753
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:44,672
This isn't just about a physical situation Congressman this guy was held for almost 5 years

754
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:48,768
And God knows what kind of conditions we do know some

755
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:52,608
Other conditions from our intelligence Community not from by-the-way Bergdahl

756
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:59,264
This is not just about Kenny get on his feet and walk and get to a plane so you're telling me she cannot be questioned because of

757
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,872
His condition I'm telling you is that the the medical professionals

758
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:08,992
So what was going on in Germany

759
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:15,648
An Army hospital in Landstuhl was undergoing this really pretty profound transition

760
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,208
The official word for it is reintegration

761
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:23,072
First imagine every single thing is weird for him

762
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:24,864
You can't talk really

763
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,656
He's blinking and squinting

764
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:29,216
For five years he had only a few things

765
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:30,496
A bowl

766
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:32,032
A blanket a water bottle

767
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:35,360
He says his mind adapted to the Simplicity of that

768
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:39,456
Now all the sudden they're all these people he's got to interact with them

769
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:40,992
It's all the stuff around

770
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:43,040
Furniture he's not used to

771
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,856
Princess one of the first things that happen

772
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:47,904
Is a bring him into this room

773
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,696
PenAir chairs sofa

774
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:52,256
And I tell him wherever you want to sit down is fine

775
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:04,032
Squatted down and talk down in the Indians

776
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,104
Until all these commanders they follow suit

777
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:13,760
Everybody was sitting down on the floor and were talking like Captain

778
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:21,440
For the senior community

779
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,464
That's the military

780
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,280
Survival evasion resistance and Escape training

781
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:27,328
This moment

782
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:28,096
Getting back

783
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:29,632
Gow who been held

784
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:31,168
That long alone

785
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,192
Survive

786
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,728
Who is huge

787
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:35,520
Hadn't happened since Vietnam

788
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:39,104
Military I've been practicing for Bose return for months

789
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:39,872
4 years real

790
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,200
They cleared out to entire wings of lunch till 4

791
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:46,016
And One Wing would be bo in a few CFO

792
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:50,624
Any other weighing all the Intel administrative people the Commanders

793
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,392
Computers

794
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:53,952
Who is interacting with just a small team

795
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:56,000
But everyone involved is so

796
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:57,024
Over-excited

797
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:01,888
All these commanders and Sykes her supposed to take over when Beau gets to San Antonio

798
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,424
They all showed up in Germany

799
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,216
Hangout

800
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:07,520
Sit around in the hospital Wing nothing to do

801
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:11,616
Apparently one psychologist from Europe arrived on his own dime

802
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:13,152
Offering his services

803
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,432
They said the poor guy away

804
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,272
One person who was on the Germany team told me that all these people

805
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:21,600
It was like they wanted to behold bow to meet him

806
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:23,392
But they wanted to touch the stone

807
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:29,280
I spoken to several people who are involved with bows reintegration and debriefing

808
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:32,864
They told me it was all planned down to the smallest detail

809
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:36,704
How to walk boat from the plane to the bus that would take him to the hospital

810
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:40,288
How to speak to him explain exactly how the day was going to go

811
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,896
Google, 10 there's a strategic debriefing at 1 is that okay

812
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:51,296
It's not okay we don't have to do it you want your food at 11 that's okay too

813
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:57,696
By giving me complete control over everything asking me everything even if

814
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:03,072
Are you comfortable sleeping in

815
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:05,632
Couldn't really talk yet

816
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:06,912
But you had to let them know

817
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:09,728
He was not comfortable sleeping on the bed

818
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,312
His body was in pain especially the spots that have been in contact

819
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:14,848
With the floor for so long

820
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:17,920
But somehow he couldn't deal with the softness of the bed either

821
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:20,480
Pause the hospital bed was out in the open

822
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:22,272
Open on all sides in a row

823
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:24,320
Somebody

824
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:27,392
Get ready to get to me

825
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:33,792
Uneasy feeling so what I had to do with that the move over by the bathroom where there was like a little hallway

826
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:39,680
First night I slept in the bathroom because there's a door

827
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:45,824
Also distance between

828
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,896
Room and the bathroom so I knew that there is

829
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,432
That allowed me to

830
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,968
Hear footsteps coming

831
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:55,296
You didn't end up being a model Soldier

832
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:58,368
But he been by all accounts a model p o w

833
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:00,672
And now a model returning

834
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:01,952
Cooperative

835
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:03,232
Eager to be helpful

836
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:05,536
To see her team to the until the briefers

837
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:07,328
He participated in debrief

838
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:08,096
4 weeks

839
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,448
His progress was being watched very very closely by lost

840
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:13,216
People

841
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:14,496
Especially at the Pentagon

842
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,544
Everyday all the questions

843
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,824
All the follow-up question

844
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,360
The until people were asking him

845
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,640
They had to clear them

846
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:23,968
All the way up to the Joint Chiefs and then all the way back down again

847
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:26,272
Team is updating all these muckety-muck

848
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:30,368
Socom centcom jpra video Everyday

849
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:31,904
And the muckety-mucks are asking

850
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:36,768
Is Bode telling the truth does he have Stockholm syndrome and he really trying to help us

851
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:39,328
All reasonable questions

852
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:44,448
Again it seemed as if the people dealing with bow in a daily way had such a different

853
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:46,752
Softer view of him than the higher-ups.

854
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:49,056
One-point Princeton

855
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,336
Someone gave him a compass

856
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:51,872
Illinois septic pump

857
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:52,640
Before

858
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:55,967
One person told me that when the Army Chief of Staff found out

859
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:57,503
He went quote f****** Ballista

860
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:00,063
I would you give a deserter a compass

861
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:01,855
I had to take it away

862
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,143
About a week and a half after Bill came to Germany

863
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:17,727
The same time that members of Congress made it clear publicly

864
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:19,263
Not hearing with Chuck Hagel

865
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:22,335
But they're also watching this process very closely

866
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:23,103
Wait a minute

867
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:25,919
Why hasn't even returned to the United States

868
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:29,759
Where comes down at launch Tool they got to speed it up

869
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:35,903
Food along to San Antonio the Army wanted him back wanted more command-and-control over there soldier

870
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:42,303
The still unknown entity who is an ocean away

00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:46,911
Next Spartan launch Tool where like wait a second

872
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:53,311
Is a former Air Force sere psychologist who's in charge of the site team for part of bows reintegration

873
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:59,711
It really started feeling like it wasn't about the reintegration Persei anymore you know it wasn't about his overall

874
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:05,343
All well-being it was much more to start becoming really political and administrative

875
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:10,975
I just felt like wrong you know and we would have liked to have

876
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:16,351
Maybe had him stay a little bit longer but there were other competing

877
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:17,887
Pinterest

878
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:24,287
Who is there in Germany told me they start seeing these charts about bow with categories for medical side

879
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:30,687
Like an Intel colors red yellow or green green not cleared they got the picture

880
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:37,087
I had to show progress they're supposed to set specific goals for BO2 jazz is Bergdahl able to deal

881
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:38,623
Show with negative media attention

882
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:40,159
Navigate for

883
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:46,559
They need to brief the commanders to report whether they were meeting their targets every day more and more green box

884
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:47,583
Has turned up on the charts

885
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:53,983
Chris Carter bringing bo back to the modern world was letting him know

886
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:56,543
Gently and he become popular

887
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:59,359
Baldinos has been in contact with no reason

888
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:00,895
I talked about this

889
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:03,455
She didn't know that he was on TV

890
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:05,247
He didn't know that this was

891
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:07,551
That he was the subject of

892
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:10,623
National-interest he didn't know

893
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:12,159
At his parents

894
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:13,439
Had been on

895
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:14,719
Met the president

896
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:18,047
So weird to know not only like

897
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:21,375
Does the whole country know about you

898
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:23,679
But then yeah

899
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:25,215
Like it's it's not

900
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:27,775
Are there aren't having parades

901
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:29,055
Yeah I know he

902
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:32,639
It was it was really hard it was really hard because there was so much of it coming

903
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:33,663
So fast

904
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:35,199
And it was all bad

905
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:39,295
Like telling somebody that and just

906
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:41,087
So how do you prepare somebody

907
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:45,439
It's gone through something like he did and let them in and by the way let him know hey dude your home

908
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:46,975
You can relax now

909
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:50,303
As soon as you walk out that door get ready cuz there is a

910
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:51,583
There's a shitstorm

911
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:54,143
You know and it's not going away anytime soon

912
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:57,983
Back to the Congressional hearing with Chuck Hagel

913
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:58,751
One last time

914
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:01,055
Representative Jim langevin

915
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:01,823
A Democrat

916
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:05,919
Agreed that questions about Sergeant murdo's conduct should be addressed

917
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:07,967
The due process at the appropriate time

918
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:10,015
But he asked Hagel

919
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:12,319
Could you at least answer this one thing

920
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:14,111
But could you settle one

921
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:18,463
Booking report at least in terms of regarding

922
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:24,095
The number of the loss of soldiers who may have been involved in searches for

923
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:25,119
Sergeant Bergdahl

924
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:32,031
Riddle started by noting that any soldier who dies is a terrible loss to their family into their country

925
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:33,823
Mini got down to business

926
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:35,359
I knew this was coming

927
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:37,407
I personally gone back

928
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:40,479
Can ask that question inside the Pentagon

929
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:42,271
In the army

930
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:43,807
In all of our reports

931
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,855
I have seen no evidence

932
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:48,671
That directly links any

933
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:50,463
American combat

934
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:51,231
Death

935
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:52,767
2

936
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:53,791
The

937
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:57,119
Rescue or finding or shirts

938
00:45:58,143 --> 00:45:59,167
I'm Sergeant Bergdahl

939
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:00,703
Hagel said it once

940
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:01,983
Right away

941
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:02,751
He said it again

942
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:04,287
. ask a question

943
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:05,567
We will ask the

944
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:08,127
I have seen no evidence

945
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:10,943
No facts presented to me

946
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:12,991
I want I asked that question

947
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:16,831
Hegel had to know that question

948
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:18,623
Was the consequential heart

949
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:19,391
Apus story

950
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:21,183
Did anyone die looking

951
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:26,303
And I have to think he also knew that his answer would not settle this

952
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:27,839
Nobody Longshot

953
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,399
Soldiers were talking about it

954
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:31,935
Commanders like Mike Waltrip

955
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:33,471
Testifying

956
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:35,519
The people did die looking

957
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:39,871
That's part of what was so going to them about the Rose Garden in the first place

958
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:42,431
Weren't those families being recognized by the

959
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:44,991
I asked Mike Walton

960
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:47,295
Why is the Army saying the opposite

961
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:48,575
What you're saying

962
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:50,879
Why are they saying nobody died in the search

963
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:54,975
I'm not sure who did the investigation I'm not I haven't seen

964
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:58,815
From you or any other journalist a real dig into

965
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:01,119
How the Army came to that conclusion

966
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:02,399
What did they look at

967
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:04,959
What was the basis of that statement

968
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:08,543
I don't know I can only speak to my own experience

969
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:10,591
Okay then

970
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:11,871
What's find a journalist

971
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:13,151
Kuwait

972
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:14,175
We're journalists

973
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:17,759
One of our staff Whitney Dangerfield on this question

974
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:22,623
Has there been an official investigation into whether people died looking for Bo

975
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:25,439
Is there a record of people who got injuries looking for Bo

976
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:28,511
She started with army public affairs

977
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:32,351
And they told her to ask forscom US Army Force

978
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:33,119
Command

979
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:38,239
A guy there appointed her to the investigation by Army Major General Kenneth Dahl

980
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:43,103
The general doll he didn't look into this question whether people died or got hurt in the search

981
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:44,639
That wasn't his mission

982
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:48,735
Adhering on Bose case in September Rose Attorney asked all about

983
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:53,855
I don't said he'd heard a lot of discussion about it and his own interviews and just in a press

984
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:55,391
Allegations one way or another

985
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:56,927
But he didn't pursue it

986
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:58,463
He said he was told quote

987
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:00,255
No you don't need to do that

988
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:01,791
Because Central Command is going to

989
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:06,399
Okay interesting

990
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:10,239
So Whitney went to Central Command centcom

991
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:12,543
In sent cam wrote back to her

992
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:18,943
There is no official report or investigation that we are aware of directed or conducted by us

993
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:23,295
I would direct you to the US Army for any records they may have

994
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:26,879
So Army to forscom

995
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:28,671
Which sent her back

996
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:29,695
The army

997
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:31,743
Also known as Square One

998
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:35,327
Unless we're missing something the US Military

999
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:38,911
Hasn't done an official investigation into whether any soldiers died

1000
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:40,191
Because they were looking for both

1001
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:44,799
Here's the other thing General doll said about this question

1002
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:46,847
When he was on the stand back in September

1003
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:48,383
He said quote

1004
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:51,711
I had asked the appointing authority you know should I invest

1005
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:54,271
To get this because really this is something that

1006
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:55,295
At the end of the day

1007
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:56,575
It's going to have to be answered

1008
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:59,903
I mean if I was a parent I would want to know

1009
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:01,439
Everybody should want to know

1010
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:03,743
We really ought to close that out

1011
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,071
Yeah

1012
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:07,839

Coming up on the next episode of serial

1038
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:40,767
It's certain there is no doubt in my mind

1039
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:44,607
That you are soldiers died looking for Bowe Bergdahl

1040
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:51,775
I want to let you know we're fixing to break this story people are going to get hurt people are going to get killed
