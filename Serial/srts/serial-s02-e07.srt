We

15
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:40,192
All felt like why are we up here

16
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:46,080
I can't do anything but just keep going going out and shaking hands and I love it

17
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:52,480
And this is the one where I said I don't want to see more this f****** Lawrence of Arabia s*** I said out loud

18
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:54,528
Let's do this

Talk to somebody I need to report a missing person

25
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:28,064
From This American Life and WBEZ Chicago its serial one story told week by week

26
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,088
I'm Sarah Koenig

27
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:35,744
If I were a soldier with some pride

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,512
With principal

29
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:40,096
And I had to come up with a reason for walking off into Afghanistan

30
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:42,656
Causing a crisis on so many levels

31
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:45,728
I might engineer something like those explanation

32
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,288
That I was sacrificing myself for the team

33
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,824
Because I thought they were in danger

34
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,872
It's a way to save face

35
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:54,432
To say my intentions were Noble and good

36
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,760
Over the months of reporting the story I have wondered about this

37
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:01,088
Weather bow was really telling the truth about why he left his Platoon

38
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,648
Or if he was telling the version he could live with

39
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,696
Mark and I've also debated this

40
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:06,464
Of course

41
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,048
Once when we were talking Mark took the microphone and started to interview me

42
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,888
Well I guess I'm interested in more narrow stance do you think he's lying

43
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:23,360
I mean I'm just asking

44
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,504
Because you 10 still bothers me

45
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,552
Remember the coochie

46
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:36,160
The Taliban said they first captured by when he wandered into a coochie 10 or near coochie tent

47
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:41,024
Which wasn't part of those telling it all it made me think if Bo had walked into a coochie tent

48
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,864
Maybe he wasn't really headed to fob sharana to tell someone about leadership problem

49
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,912
Maybe you should try to run away

50
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,680
Looking for help

51
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:52,544
Mark and I had that conversation back in September I've since moved on from the coochie

52
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:57,152
I don't think it's verifiable or that much of a discrepancy with those version of what happened actually

53
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:03,808
Promises to say I can understand why some other people both served with when I first talked to them

54
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,344
Hidden Bible story

55
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,648
I thought maybe he concocted it in hindsight

56
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,184
But I put a 20

57
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,232
Inmates chain cross he said quote

58
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,024
She had some years to work on that

59
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:23,520
There's a Litany of reasons why someone could be skeptical of both explanation

60
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:27,360
First his premise that leadership was dangerously bad

61
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:30,176
For the most part the soldiers we talked to didn't agree

62
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:33,248
That was some said they actually loved some of their leaders thought they were great

63
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,112
And Lieutenant Colonel Clint Baker the Battalion Commander Bauer responded to so negatively

64
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:43,232
Getting overall they didn't think he was putting them in situations that were crazy risky or that they couldn't handle

65
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:48,096
Then the notion that both would have to do something so dramatic to be listened to

66
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,376
Also not true

67
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,680
Which is so

68
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,216
Orderly outlandish

69
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,776
I mean it doesn't pass

70
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:58,336
Oh man because of where they were

71
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:01,920
A couple of days prior they were on fob sharana which is

72
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:02,688
Huge

73
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:03,968
And has

74
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,248
All sorts of off

75
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,064
Any any one of them could have gone and talk to you

76
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,600
That's Mark McCrory

77
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:16,256
Is an open door policy that allows you to approach any officer at all with a problem doesn't have to be in your chain of command

78
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:20,351
But whether an officer would have taken both seriously I have to say is doubtful

79
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,375
About knew that

80
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:27,263
Big one I heard from quite a few people was it Bowie either was in cahoots with local afghans

81
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,567
Or even wanting to contact the Taliban

82
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:32,127
Here's Darrell Hanson John Thurman

83
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:37,247
I mean for him just to like walk out where he did like he wasn't afraid of them

84
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,783
He will be he had to

85
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,855
Had some kind of compassion for him

86
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:47,487
And didn't like us for him to walk away and I like

87
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:51,327
I know where again I have to go back to the question where are you going to go

88
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:56,959
Cuz if there's no other option you've either got our side or the Taliban side

89
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:03,103
A lot of people pointed out that Bo hung out with the Afghan police who were also stationed at The Outpost at mess

90
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,407
Etsy with them eat meals with them

91
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,687
Other people did too

92
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,735
It was great it was great food

93
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:11,295
But some people said boat was there more often

94
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:14,111
Seems more interested in them than other people did

95
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:20,511
Josh quarter said that bull was once late for a guard shift and had to go looking for him and found him having tea with the Afghan

96
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:26,911
Stand the table went missing Josh says he heard that to the A&P guys were also unaccounted for

97
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,471
Two Afghan police were missing as well

98
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:30,239
So

99
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:34,079
That seemed very logical to me that all seemed to make sense cuz

100
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,383
Okay well now he may have to

101
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:40,223
Guides or he has two people he

102
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,271
Is looking to meet up with

103
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:46,879
Maybe Bo had made a deal with these guys someone betrayed him or sold them out to the Taliban

104
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,463
I tried to check this Intel

105
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:56,607
I called the former Governor of Pacheco province in Afghanistan the guy who'd worked pretty closely with the leaders and Bows battalion

106
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,399
But he wouldn't talk to me on a cell phone

107
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:02,751
I did invite me to visit in person which is very nice but not immediately helpful

108
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:08,895
I did not say anything about the missing cops in the Wikileaks reports or in general dolls investigation

109
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:15,551
Executive officer above Battalion told me he'd heard this rumor to about some missing Afghans but he did not

110
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,831
Know if anything came of it

111
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:23,743
Sami Yusuf side the Afghan reporter asked around about it as well he told us there was a report of some missing Afghan

112
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:24,511
And please

113
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,791
It was later discredited

114
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,095
Market

115
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,375
Fiasco about it

116
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:33,727
Lenny idea was you had some A&P guys who were going to help you out or no

117
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:36,799
Local police

118
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,807
I was right

119
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,855
The guys were

120
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:54,207
I have every reason to

121
00:06:56,255 --> 00:07:00,863
Who said the reason he hung out with the A&P sometimes was because that was part of the mission

122
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:04,191
Build a rapport in case they ever ended up in a firefight together

123
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,471
Who's trying to do coin

124
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:08,287
He says that's also why he tried to learn a little patch though

125
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,591
Which some soldiers also said made them suspicious

126
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:14,175
The evidence people point to most often though

127
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:16,735
To support the idea that Bo was simply deserting

128
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,015
React no higher purpose

129
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:21,343
Was that he had talked about doing exactly that

130
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,623
Taking off

131
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:27,231
Several people told General doll they'd heard both say things about walking into the mount

132
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,279
Pakistan are heading to India

133
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:33,375
It's a one-person something like this even before he deployed while he was still in Alaska

134
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:34,911
Christmas angles

135
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,215
Probably about his closest friend in the platoon

136
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,775
Imma make him talking about

137
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:43,615
You know the mountains and how great it look and you know imagine

138
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:48,479
Just walking out there remember all that stuff I mean I always right there when you was talking about it

139
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:53,855
Chain cross if you'd had a conversation with bow the night before he left the Opie

140
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:57,183
Was evening and the guys were sitting around in the shade of a truck.

141
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:57,951
Talking

142
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,975
And the topic came up

143
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,255
How would you fake your death

144
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,535
I don't know

145
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,071
Papa cliff

146
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:07,935
They told me that he faked his death Afghanistan war

147
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:08,959
You just disappear

148
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,751
I want to see your casualty

149
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:13,823
Annie sez

150
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,359
That is goal

151
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,407
That he was to fake his death

152
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,967
Did they even get to Pakistan

153
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:22,783
And the Indians went up with a gang over there

154
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,831
Austin Lanford was there too

155
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,135
This is the first time he'd ever talked about

156
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,159
The night before you left the old

157
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:31,743
An Austin remembers the conversation about the same way Shane.

158
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,047
Wanting to be a

159
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,863
Mercenary

160
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,143
Of sorts

161
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:42,495
And it was something along the lines of

162
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,567
He was going to join a group

163
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,615
I go up in their ranks

164
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,639
And then

165
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:52,223
Shobaleader and then

166
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,783
And then he'd be known

167
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,087
For being a mercenary or something like that

168
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,671
That's what you remember that's what the gist I got

169
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,719
He said no Russian

170
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,535
Restaurant that big influence in India with games

171
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:09,119
I mean he told me about Russian that he work is left in the game

172
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,911
Heading into Russian mob

173
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,447
Hitman

174
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,239
Will also ask about a weapon

175
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:17,311
He was issued a saw big heavy machine gun

176
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:19,615
Chain her to Pistol and M9

177
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,151
He tells me I hate

178
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,431
What would happen if your

179
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,223
Dyno near disappeared

180
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,295
I told Mike in trouble

181
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,855
We are like that's a stupid question like yeah

182
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:30,623
Of course

183
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:35,743
And then

184
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,023
Someone took it from you

185
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,815
I said I'd get in trouble

186
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,887
Okay

187
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,447
Oh didn't take a gun with him when he left

188
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:50,079
Looking back on it now. Shane says it's like if an ice cream truck drove by

189
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:52,127
And somebody said hey I think I might scream

190
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,687
And then the next thing you know the person is gone

191
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,735
You going to figure they went after the ice cream truck

192
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:02,367
For his part Austin was reluctant to tell me about the conversation

193
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,927
Because obviously he knows how it sounds

194
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,207
It's a little

195
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,231
Extreme

196
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:11,327
And I kind of don't want to make him seem like she was

197
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,631
Crazy or organelle

198
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,959
Not in his right mind cuz we all had

199
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:20,543
Weird thoughts while we're over there isolated from anybody

200
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,079
Another words

201
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,127
Wanderlust E comments like this

202
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,919
All that strange

203
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,967
So many people told me

204
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,503
Fear + stress

205
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,063
Boredom plus Warzone means

206
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:34,367
You say some really off-the-wall stuff

207
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:41,535
Another platoon mate Jason Frye told me he wrote letters to a friend when he was in Afghanistan and got them back years later

208
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,815
Read through them he thought

209
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:45,119
What was I thinking who was I

210
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,911
Is Mark McCurry

211
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,983
Things that we get away with saying to each other

212
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,007
Completely Ludacris

213
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:54,079
Give me an example of Fort Hood shooting was when on

214
00:10:54,335 --> 00:11:00,479
While we were there and I remember that we were watching it on some grainy television in the armed forces

215
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:03,551
Dish Network in the chow hall on my buddies for sale for Migos

216
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:06,879
We have to go back out again tonight I want to make Fort Hood look like church

217
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:13,023
Dark and creepy

218
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:18,399
You know the only kind of humor we understand I mean we're wound up pretty tight yeah yeah

219
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,775
General dog considered all the evidence

220
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,823
Pointing to the idea that Bo was deserting

221
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,591
Permanently

222
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:29,663
He heard about the weird comments about the Intel

223
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,967
And he concluded Beau was telling the truth

224
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:36,319
Bose quote stated motive was well-meaning in his mind.

225
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,599
Ironically

226
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:40,159
The basis for his stated motive was incorrect

227
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:44,255
Mark spent about a year thinking it through

228
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:46,303
And he also ended up believing though

229
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,327
Philosophy

230
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,863
Probably just for practical reason

231
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,679
Princess Belle with such a careful planner

232
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,727
He was an outdoor kid who grown up in the mountains

233
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:58,079
The intended to just disappear permanently desert why wouldn't he bring more food

234
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:58,847
More water

235
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:02,175
Beside his computer and some other stuff home in a box

236
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,199
Before you left the Okie

237
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:06,015
Some people see is evidence he was leaving for good

238
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,807
Mark sees it as the opposite

239
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:11,135
And take it with you if you're going to India

240
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,207
Throw it in a backpack and a charger

241
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:14,975
You know

242
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:20,095
Eight you know he sent the form yet cuz he thought he was going Stateside cuz he thought he was going to

243
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:24,191
She was going to have an audience with the general and then they're going to throne in Leavenworth

244
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:29,567
It's probably true that he that he anticipated getting his computer back

245
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,223
That's why there's nothing really at the end of data points to the idea

246
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:38,271
If this was a permanent departure

247
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,831
Shijiazhuang

248
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,647
Justin pack for that

249
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:50,303
Kiddo

250
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:52,607
It's just it's that simple

251
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,423
But details like this

252
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,215
Definitely not what convinced me

253
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:01,311
He's logged something like 25 hours of taped conversations with bow

254
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,615
And many more hours of conversation

255
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,383
Not on tape

256
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:08,735
The more I learn about the and the more I learn about how his mind worked

257
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:13,855
And the more I talk to him about natural history the other subjects

258
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,159
And realizing that

259
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:21,535
Of course I would never walk off of Base you know and yeah most of his platoon never would so

260
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,071
If that makes sense it is

261
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,863
It is a totally

262
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,399
Wackadoodle

263
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,935
Inclusion to make

264
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:28,959
But

265
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,543
Good night if your Bo Bergdahl

266
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,615
That makes perfect sense

267
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,735
How does it make sense to go

268
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:46,111
When I finally sat down for an interview with General doll

269
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:50,719
He didn't just go back pre-deployment to explain what happened once he got to Afghanistan

270
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,999
Do it all the way back

271
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,023
To home

272
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,047
Idaho

273
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,071
To Childhood there

274
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:58,911
He done a lot of thinking while he was locked up in that cage with the Taliban

275
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:03,519
Guy looking at myself I looking at the situation going how did I get here

276
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:08,383
And that question is put me back into my childhood

277
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:12,223
I got here because I made a choice

278
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:17,599
But that choice was bald

279
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,863
I'll give you a bit of a backstory I literally grew up by myself

280
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:34,495
Homeschooling

281
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,687
Completely isolated

282
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:48,063
So you just screw up like f****** around in the woods in like

283
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,599
Stuff like that

284
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,975
Usually likes

285
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,783
The Grove on 40 acres

286
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,319
Down a dirt road in a valley

287
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,855
Outside the small town of Haley

288
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:25,951
His father worked at UPS his mother homeschooled him and his older sister

289
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:33,119
I had a hard time with the school work he couldn't read very well then

290
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,911
He wasn't good at his work or you wouldn't do it

291
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:40,031
And he says you get punished for that and for other things in a way that he says felt unpredictable

292
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,871
But says he was scared all the time getting in trouble

293
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,663
They didn't have the greatest relationship with a

294
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:52,063
His parents his dad is a strong personality

295
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:55,903
He's pretty cool person

296
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,183
What is this

297
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,463
It's just

298
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,231
Complicated

299
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:03,327
Solution with the same one teenagers have used for centuries

300
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,863
Get out of the house

301
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:09,727
I started working efficiently when I turned 13 cuz I was illegal ish

302
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:12,031
So I started

303
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,823
Are spending more time at work

304
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:17,919
Turned into my

305
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:24,319
Saving Grace basically cuz it got me out of the house for the official reason at 8:30

306
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:33,023
Maybe dinner breakfast

307
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,071
Back to work

308
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,375
When he was about 15

309
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:40,703
Both fell in with a family those pretty different from the one he grown up with

310
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,775
How many Metro his job convinced him to take fencing

311
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,335
National performing arts school in Ketchum

312
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,103
Next town over

313
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:47,871
Haley

314
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,151
Kim Harrison

315
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:52,479
She's the one from episode 5 who told the story about contacting Interpol

316
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,783
Kim was helping run the school

317
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,063
Her son also took fencing

318
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,111
And her daughter Kayla

319
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:58,879
Ballet

320
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,671
What was around all the time

321
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:03,743
He ended up becoming attached to our family

322
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:04,511
That's Kayla

323
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,303
A few people told me

324
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,607
Do you want to know about Bo talk to Kayla

325
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:09,631
She understands

326
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:13,983
He was with her it was watchful and serious

327
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,007
And very sweet

328
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,799
Like one birthday

329
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,335
For my birthday card

330
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,895
He went around our small little town

331
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:24,479
And with the card and just ask random people to sign it for me

332
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:27,807
Oh really little message yeah it was the coolest idea and and

333
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,391
Knowing Bo and how shy he is and how little he wants to

334
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:34,207
You'll be noticed and have strangers know who he is

335
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:37,535
Yeah that was an even bigger gesture than it seems like because

336
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:41,631
You know that's hard for him he doesn't want to do that I know he doesn't like that

337
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:47,519
Write this is like teenager about like teenager but is super quiet

338
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:55,967
He would blush very easily he's getting very mad at me for saying that he brushes really easily and so

339
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:58,015
Eva's really easy to embarrass and

340
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,039
And

341
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:01,599
You just he didn't he he wanted

342
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:02,879
I know

343
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:07,487
Gentlemanly is a good where he is very much a gentleman

344
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,791
And very very conscious about

345
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:13,631
Saying the wrong thing right of being inappropriate or anything like that

346
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:16,703
The Harrisons open up a tea place in Ketchum

347
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:17,727
Skeetown

348
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,775
T Bar was called Strega

He do his mate help me make crepes sometime

Or

354
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:37,439
Mostly he would hide weapons everywhere in like

355
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,743
Sit in the corner and watch people

356
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:43,583
Helix security

357

Play I remember we had we just had like random weapons like hidden everywhere that give his like a

358
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,799
Felt like a flail like

359
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:53,823
Spikeball

360
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:58,687
Amanda chain I think was like underneath the cabinet somewhere

361
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,223
I would like a nice pic

362
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:06,623
Hidden exit

363
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,415
Him it was like how you need weapons

364
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,951
Available when you need them

365
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:12,767
I never had to use them

366
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,559
Obviously but you know

367
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,351
He was in charge of being

368
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:19,423
The safety guys knowing that everything's cool

369
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,471
He wanted to be

370
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:26,335
I'm sure you've heard my mom say this but he's the protector

371
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,871
I have heard her mom say this

372
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:31,711
All the friends I spoke to from that Circle say the same thing

373
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,991
He wanted to protect me

374
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:38,879
Kitchen was kind of far from Bo's house Sobo begin staying at the Harrisons for stretches

375
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,671
Strega

376
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:45,279
Especially when he was younger it was like I was studying there family

377
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,303
See how they operated

378
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,583
How they got along

379
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:50,399
They argued what action would lead to reaction

380
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,703
Other people wandered into Strega

381
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,519
Begin working there and also became part of the family

382
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,799
Is Chad and Nick

383
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,847
All these people love Bo

384
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,895
They talked about how unusual he is

385
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:01,663
How smart

386
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,199
Play full how creative

387
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:05,247
How totally annoying he could be

388
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,807
You might argue with you unrelentingly

389
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:09,343
Just to see how far he can push

390
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,623
Tape his mouth shut

391
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,415
She will happen

392
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:15,231
What was a teenager who never been to school

393
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:17,279
And now with the Strega crowd

394
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,815
He was testing out ideas

395
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:19,839
Setting up Behavior

396
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,887
And maybe more than most people

397
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,167
He worked on improving his

398
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,703
As if you were in training

399
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:27,519
His friend said it was sometimes a little overboard

400
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,311
He might punch trees or bricks

401
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,335
His hands

402
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,127
He wanted to get better at things

403
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:34,431
Reading or dancing or writing

404
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,455
Read stories

405
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,783
Mostly though he was trying to figure himself out

406
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,087
It really matter to him

407
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,159
The seeking and knowing what kind of man

408
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,183
He was going to be

409
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,487
Nicholas about 5 years older than Bo

410
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,511
He also worked at

411
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,559
Watauga

412
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,839
And talk for hours sometimes

413
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:55,679
Nick says it wasn't so much the bow was searching for something concrete

414
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:56,703
Profession

415
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:59,519
He was wrestling with the big existential question

416
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:03,103
I know I really think so much of it had to do with

417
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,151
Questions of

418
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,943
Virtue what was right

419
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:09,759
More than anything I think that's what he

420
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,807
What is really working on it

421
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,343
Focused on all the time with

422
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,879
Coming up with this

423
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,672
Values from cell

424
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:20,512
And he just did a lot of watching to see what everyone else did

425
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,560
And reflected against it

426
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:23,840
And

427
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,632
If you don't want it to be anyone else's

428
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:28,960
Isn't going to take anyone else's word for it

429
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:30,240
About what was right

430
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,008
What was moral

431
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,312
Who's going to forge his own code

432
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,640
Taylor says the one he ended up adopting from self

433
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:37,664
Restrict

434
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,944
Uncompromising

435
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,992
I've had arguments about

436
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:43,040
What's this with him about this

437
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,576
Many times and he gets

438
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,856
Really you know

439
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:47,648
Passionate about it like

440
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,232
You know there's a problem in the world

441
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:55,840
But what kind of human are you unless you're doing something about it

442
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,632
Like you're not

443
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:03,264
You're not a good person if you know that there's something wrong and you're not doing everything in your power to fix it

444
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,288
Really

445
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,360
He holds

446
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:10,688
The world and everybody in it too unrealistic

447
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:12,224
Sickly high expectations

448
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:18,624
And if you don't live by those Expectations by those morals in that honor

449
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,672
That he thinks you should

450
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:21,696
And he tries to live

451
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:23,744
Stella said he has no respect for you

452
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:26,560
Yanny just said

453
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:27,840
He doesn't understand

454
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,960
It just sounds of impossibly idealistic

455
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:39,360
Yeah point where it kind of is strangles how you move through the world or something

456
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:41,152
It's really handicapping

457
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,944
Can I get the handicap

458
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:45,504
He's constantly struggling

459
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,296
2

460
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:56,000
Understand how people are okay with everything you know what I mean

461
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,632
He doesn't have an understanding of how differently they view the world

462
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:02,400
Yeah

463
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:04,960
I think he's fully understanding

464
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:08,288
That not everybody can accept the way he thinks

465
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:11,616
But that's never going to change the way he thinks

466
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:14,688
I got it yeah like his his

467
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:17,760
He has the least flexible

468
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:24,416
System ever

469
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:28,256
During his late teens or early twenties

470
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:34,144
Would work for a while in Idaho and then take off somewhere for a job or trip then come back and go off

471
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:34,912
Again

472
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:36,192
Kim Kayla's mom

473
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:38,496
Both had a hunger and an urgency about

474
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,032
See the world

475
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:40,800
Can experience

476
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,592
You wanted Adventure

477
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,616
Caleb boats

478
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,384
Field water

479
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:45,920
Salmon fishing in

480
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:46,688
In Alaska

481
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,784
He went down south to work at a military training camp

482
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,320
A place where Special Forces

483
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,088
Guys are gopher

484
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:56,672
Experience a topo he'd rather be doing what they were doing

485
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,912
The week is up they disappear to go off in

486
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:14,848
So we left

487
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,408
He went to Florida to complete a charter boat

488
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,968
At some point he left for France

489
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:21,504
To join the French Foreign Legion

490
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:24,576
Which Kim says she knows he did arrive in France

491
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,136
She's just not completely sure what happened after that

492
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,928
I didn't really talk much about it

493
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:33,792
They probably thought he was out of his mind for going there and what and this

494
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:37,632
Here's a Killer Blonde hair this young cute kid from Idaho

495
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:41,728
Blonde hair and blue eyes I'm going to join the Foreign Legion hey sign me up

496
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:43,264
They probably thought he was

497
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,544
Completely

498
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,896
Bunkers for doing that because he was ordered that was just a really bad choice

499
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:53,248
And of course when he tells me about I think part of the reason he did it was

500
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,272
See my face

501
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,040
Like

502
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:59,136
Because he didn't tell you about it beforehand though he did and was like are you kidding me

503
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:01,440
That is the dumbest thing I've ever

504
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:05,536
You know there was a beginning of me getting incredulos at his choices that was the first

505
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:07,328
No maybe at the first

506
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:09,376
The first of many or one of many

507
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:14,240
He trained on his bike Nick Sabor a lot of spandex in those days

508
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:16,288
Recycling trip down the West Coast

509
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:19,104
Which like the Foreign Legion didn't pan out

510
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,224
Few days and he got hit by an RV and he was okay but his bike was ruined

511
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:27,552
Who came back to catch him and started in on the next idea

512
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:33,184
Eventually the next idea became the military surprise to his friends

513
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,488
Does brother-in-law was in the Navy

514
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:37,792
And both had that strong protector quality

515
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,840
Romantic version of it to be sure

516
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:41,888
You wanted to be invisible Kayla said

517
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:44,192
Someone who'd be unnoticed in the shadows

518
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,728
Looking out for the innocent

519
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:47,264
Shooting in when they needed him

520
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:52,896
And they knew who wanted to put himself in situations that would require courage and Grit

521
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:58,016
That would test his mettle so that he could come out the other side and know what kind of man he was

522
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:02,624
So they understood it which is not the same as thinking it was a good idea

523
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,464
Please don't do that

524
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:12,864
Who it should be noted is a pacifist to begin with and he knew how I'd react is probably predictable and I'm going to ask

525
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,960
Are you sure this is something you want to do I think it's a horrible horrible idea

526
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:18,496
Not just

527
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:20,800
For you know not not for everyone

528
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:27,200
You know for you for all the above reasons is romantic expectations his rigid could have

529
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:33,600
Contact his judgmentalness it up join the crowd follow orders

530
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:40,000
I said look I know if you want to do that and we not going to listen to me of course you're over 18 do whatever you want

531
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:46,400
But if you're going to look into the Coast Guard because at least then you'll be helping people you'll be like

532
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:49,216
Saving people's lives sitting vessels

533
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:54,080
Are patrolling Waters being on the ocean those are all things that you like so he must

534
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:55,872
You absolutely must

535
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:58,432
Then you know that's probably a good option

536
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:00,480
Have you thought of that already know

537
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:01,760
Sweden

538
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,040
He join the Coast Guard

539
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:05,344
January of 2006

540
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,160
To Cape May New Jersey and started Trading

541
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,184
Is 19

542
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,976
It lasted only a few weeks

543
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:34,528
He didn't want to be weak

544
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,064
You didn't want to

545
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:39,904
Not be able to participate in that system to achieve those goals but

546
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:42,208
His sensitivities

547
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,232
And

548
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,584
It is way of pondering and overthinking things made it

549
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,656
Highly difficult in that environment to survive

550
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:54,496
I never actually

551
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:14,976
And being yelled and screamed at

552
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:17,792
It didn't take him long to realize he wanted to get out of there

553
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,328
Basic made a mistake

554
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:25,472
And in the communications that I had from him at the time they were becoming increasingly more worrisome

555
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,008
I was just

556
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:28,032
In pain

557
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,568
For him you know I breathe

558
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,592
These little notes

559
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:38,016
They're only like that in the spiral notebooks you flip 3 and 1/2

560
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:40,064
The four by five for 6

561
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:45,184
With the ripped off spiral at the top and just running really small and

562
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,792
The riding with change to you know and I didn't as well as stress level increased

563
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:59,776
People are out there

564
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:17,952
The town was changing is my rambling as more desperate it was just rapidly

565
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:18,720
Yeah

566
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:20,768
At me now eroding

567
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,560
I think I wrote a couple letters back like

568
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:26,912
You know are you okay I'm getting really worried this needs to end you know what

569
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,448
What can I do

570
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,224
One day out of the blue boat shows up at Strega

571
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:40,992
The t-bar

572
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:41,760
He's back

573
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,552
They're all thrilled to see him

574
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:44,320
And also

575
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,088
Confused

576
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,880
What happened where are you back

577
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:49,184
He told him something about a psychtest

578
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:51,232
Which he said he pretty much fake

579
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,768
Kevin the others

580
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:53,792
Didn't really believe them

581
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,984
According to General dolls investigation

582
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,544
What happened is that on third week of training

583
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:08,128
He was found on the floor with blood on his hands and face

584
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,408
Twin series

585
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,432
Nosebleed

586
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:14,016
Who says now he doesn't remember how he ended up on the floor

587
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:20,416
I thought he was told later he was in a fetal position and shaking crying he was taken to the hospital

588
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:26,816
He told the intake people there he felt overwhelmed he said the next day there were a psychiatrist assess him

589
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:33,216
And according to dolls report quote observe that PFC bergdahl's mental status is significant for situation

590
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:33,984
Anxiety

591
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:39,872
Any recommended discharging him knowing he would need to receive Stress Management counseling

592
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:46,272
And have quote clearance by a psychiatrist prior to reenlistment

593
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:51,392
Tide for continued service in the Coast Guard because of a diagnosis of adjustment disorder with depression

594
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:11,104
Brother sister in law

595
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:23,136
Black sheep of the family

596
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:25,952
And I figured I could do the Army because

597
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:27,744
The Army was more

598
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:39,008
Military

599
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:43,104
Yeah

600
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:58,208
Do that too when I join the Army at

601
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:03,072
I thought I was in a much better position

602
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:09,728
Because of the way that Bo had been was called separated from the Coast Guard

603
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:14,848
There was a code in his military record indicating he'd need a waiver if he ever wanted to re-enlist

604
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,688
In other words the Army would have to waive its usual standards to let bow in

605
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:21,760
May 2008 when both signed up

606
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:24,064
Happened to be a good time to get a waiver

607
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,600
There's been a surge in Iraq

608
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:27,392
Maybe another one coming in Afghanistan

609
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,696
The Army was hurting for recruits

610
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:31,488
Easing up on restrictions

611
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,256
Is criminal record

612
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:34,560
That might have disqualified people in the past

613
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:39,424
Give me a sentence in 2001 about 4% of army recruits got waivers

614
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:41,984
By 2007 it was 20%

615
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:45,312
2008 that your bow enlisted it was about Seventeen percent

616
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:49,664
Because it's Coast Guard discharge was labeled uncharacterized

617
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:52,480
It seems pretty much although had to do to get a waiver

618
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:57,088
Was write a paragraph explaining to the Boise recruiter why he been separated from the coast

619
00:32:58,112 --> 00:33:02,464
Hard time adapting to change didn't feel prepared to be on his own

620
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,232
Adam family

621
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:05,024
Going on Altru

622
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:09,120
The statement which was typed up by the recruiter as he was speaking with bow

623
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:11,936
Says quote I have matured and know that I am her

624
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:13,216
Prepare to go into the army

625
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:16,800
Please do not allow my past records prevent me from coming into

626
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:17,568
The army

627
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:22,432
A week later about also showed the recruiter his DOD medical history form

628
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:25,248
But apparently it didn't include any mention of

629
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:31,648
His panic attack or his hospitalization or the doctor's note saying he needed clearance by a psychiatrist prior to

630
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:32,416
Reenlistment

631
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:35,232
Baoding mention this note to the Army recruiter either

632
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,024
He says he didn't even know about

633
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:40,864
So evidently that note was never seen by the army

634
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:43,936
It's not clear in fact if anyone ever took notice of it

635
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,472
Apart from the doctor who wrote it

636
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:48,032
Spring of 2008

637
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:49,568
But was accepted into the army

638
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,128
This time he hadn't told anyone in advance

639
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:53,920
He

640
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:55,712
Was being very evasive and I just

641
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:57,504
Was getting really annoyed

642
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,296
Alright what's going on

643
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:02,368
You're lying I can tell you're lying to me you're not telling what's going on

644
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,160
This went on for a couple months

645
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:06,976
And then all the sudden he shows up in his urine

646
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:12,352
I launched

647
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:18,496
Literally lunch myself I'm like literally grabbed his shoulders and I shaking at all you doing

648
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:22,080
Did you sign the thing already is this just a done deal

649
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:23,360
And he's

650
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:29,760
Acting really quiet and kind of a smirk smile on his face like I knew you would react like this is why I didn't tell you

651
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:32,064
And I was just out of my mind

652
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:33,088
I just

653
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:34,368
Freaked out

654
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:37,184
And this is because again

655
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:39,488
You'd had this

656
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:44,608
Fears about his suitability before he went to the Coast Guard those fears were worn out

657
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:46,656
Yes and now he was doing it I guess

658
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:50,240
And you just knew this is not this is a really bad idea

659
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:53,056
This is just the worst idea ever

660
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:54,592
It was the army

661
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:04,832
Setting aside the question of whether it was a good idea for bow to join the Army

662
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,880
The Army have let bow in

663
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:09,952

Coming up on the next episode of serial

693
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:48,512
I wanted to be a soldier but I wanted to be a soldier

694
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:53,120
And he's writing these things is not sending emails

695
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:57,472
In the State of Mind was obvious mean it was

696
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:58,752
Stretched

697
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:06,944
Stop Believin so special powers

698
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:13,344
Big decision that I feel like you don't want to have to be God to make that kind of that's not something you can ever come

699
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,392
I don't care where your head was

700
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,952
But you still f****** did it

701
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:20,512
I really just tell the story of Bo

702
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:25,888
Unfortunately you now
