19
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:47,104
Year-and-a-half ago clips from this video appeared on every major news broadcast

20
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:51,968
Show the rescue of a guy named Bo Bergdahl

21
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:57,088
He was a US Soldier who was captured by the Taliban and held captive for just shy of 5 years

22
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:59,648
Taliban made the video

23
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:03,488
The first thing you see is a couple of guys in traditional Afghan clothes

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,560
I got scars on their heads or covering their faces

25
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,840
Enter holding machine guns

26
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:11,424
They're standing next to a silver pickup truck

27
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:12,960
Different hoodies

28
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:15,776
In the back seat of the truck the door is open

29
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:19,872
Bareheaded figure is sitting with his knees up against the seat in front of them

30
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:23,456
The camera closes in and you see this pale young man

31
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:24,736
And that's for a doll

32
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:26,016
His head is shaved

33
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:29,088
He looks sort of like a cult leader from a 70s movie

34
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:32,928
He can't keep his eyes open properly they're bothering him

35
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:34,720
He keeps blinking and rubbing them

36
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:39,840
Watershot shows that the scrubby Rocky Hills all around the truck are dotted with other guys

37
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:40,608
Taliban

38
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:47,008
Holding rifles are rocket-propelled grenades

39
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:50,080
The guys lean into a bird I was sitting there talking to him

40
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,872
He's looking at their faces

41
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:55,712
One guy says something in Pashto which is translated on screen as

42
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:59,296
Don't come back to Afghanistan

43
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,344
Clifford since is that the guy said

44
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,392
Do not come back to Afghanistan

45
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,928
You will not get out alive

46
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,072
Black spots appear in the Cloudy sky and you see that their planes or helicopters

47
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:13,120
One gets closer and closer

48
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,144
Is a Blackhawk

49
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:18,240
Then you see Bergdahl again he's out of the truck now looking up at the sky

50
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:19,776
His clothes are too big

51
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:20,544
Billowy

52
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:23,360
Then at about 6 minutes in

53
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:28,736
Right after some cows wander onto the scene the helicopter lands

54
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,016
Dust flies

55
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:33,088
Birdsall walks forward science by two men

56
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:37,696
While three men from the helicopter US Special Operations team dog warden

57
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:41,280
The two sides meet in the middle of the clearing shake hands

58
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,584
What team captains right before the starting whistle

59
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,192
Berdoll steps forward the Americans put their hands on him

60
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:51,008
Poem towards the Blackhawk while they're walking backwards

61
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,824
Didn't want to turn their backs on the Taliban just yet

62
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,872
Bergdahl is walking stiffly

63
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,408
Lumbering almost

64
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:03,040
The helicopter they pat him down one more time and then he's onboard there Up and Away

65
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,832
Text less than 2 minutes

66
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:09,952
And it's done

67
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:13,792
The video cuts off

68
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:25,824
From This American Life and WBEZ Chicago its serial

69
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,616
One story told week by week

70
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,640
I'm Sarah Koenig

71
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:35,552
Good evening everyone or nearly the release of American servicemen after 5 years

72
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:38,368
Vibration Joy plants Temple

73
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:44,768
Pentagon sources tell NBC that Bergdahl vanished under mysterious

74
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:51,168
Circumstances has he left his base unarmed after turning against the war start

75
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:57,568
Hero or deserter that the soldiers are engaged in political smear campaign by raising

76
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:02,944
Fallen Soldiers say their sons would be alive if Bergdahl had not gone missing from this post

77
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,320
In the old days deserters Rashad

78
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,280
Very last thing is

79
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:23,935
I'm a prisoner I want to go home

80
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,519
Bring me home

81
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,823
Please

82
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:32,895
Me home

83
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:41,087
Bowe Bergdahl was rescued on May 31st 2014

84
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:45,439
Have you followed the story in the news may be expected the usual things would follow

85
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:48,255
A big welcome home and then a story would come out

86
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:51,327
Then what happened to him how we ended up with the Taliban

87
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,143
And it did start out that way

88
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:58,495
President Obama announced birdsall's return in the Rose Garden of the White House

89
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:01,567
Roberto's parents Bob and Jani by his side

90
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,127
This morning I called Bob

91
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,407
And Jani Bergdahl

92
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:08,223
And told them that after nearly five years

93
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,503
In captivity

94
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,039
There's sunbow

95
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:11,807
Is coming home

96
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:18,463
Birddogs hometown of Hailey Idaho which for five years had bring Bowe home posters and yellow ribbons all over the place

97
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:21,023
They playing this big celebration for him

98
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:24,351
Then so suddenly the whole story flipped

99
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,959
Within days within hours of his rescue in fact

100
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:32,287
People began saying that we shouldn't be celebrating him

101
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:36,895
Because Wilbur don't deliberately walked off his post into hostile territory

102
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,943
That's how we got captured

103
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,759
Some of his former platoon mates called him a deserter

104
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:45,855
Others were saying he was a traitor even who might have collaborated with the Taliban

105
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:52,255
Some people take offense that in the Rose Garden event Bob Bergdahl who drone a long beard and his son's absence

106
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,559
I'd spoken some phrases in Arabic and Pashto

107
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:57,375
The celebration and Haley was canceled

108
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:01,215
Congressional leaders condemned the tray the president made to get Birdo back

109
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:04,543
The release of 5 Taliban detainees from Guantanamo Bay

110
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:08,127
Sing the trade was not only ill-conceived but illegal

111
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:13,247
The Army launched a big investigation into what exactly happened why did Bergdahl leave his post

112
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,087
Even now other soldiers are so enraged by what Bergdahl did

113
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:22,463
For his own protection is going to have a security detail with him when he leaves his base in San Antonio

114
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,815
Finally the Army charge for adult with two crimes

115
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:29,631
One of which carries the possibility of a life sentence

116
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:33,471
Through all of this on himself

117
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,751
Was like a ghost

118
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:35,519
A blank

119
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:39,871
We never heard from him he wasn't talking on TV he wasn't quoting a newspaper

120
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,175
Don't seem like that was that

121
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:46,271
His story was only going to live in that kind of antiseptic upstairs Realm

122
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:50,367
Pissed off politicians and Military experts and cable TV commentators

123
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,903
The last spring

124
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,975
I found out the bo Bergdahl had been talking to someone

125
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:55,999
Promise to hear

126
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,047
Even talking to a filmmaker

127
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,327
Remarkable

128
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:02,911
Naturally I have a very large sense of humor

129
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:03,679
That's about

130
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,055
Write your pretty careful with it

131
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:14,687
Exactly like I've noticed him with me like you don't you don't crack many jokes

132
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,063
But you can you know I mean I might not laugh but you can try

133
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:29,279
Yeah give it a try if you see an opening let's see what you got

134
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:36,191
Purple is a screen writer and producer you've probably heard of his movies The Hurt Locker

135
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,727
Zero Dark Thirty

136
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,799
Mark wanted to make a movie about Beau story

137
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:43,615
A couple of months after Bo came back to the US

138
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:46,687
Mark managed to contact him and they started talking

139
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,455
About everything

140
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:53,343
About the Taliban and motorcycles and existence of God and how good spicy salsa is

141
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:59,743
How memory works and what a soldier should and shouldn't be Mark recorded the calls not for broadcast or any

142
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:06,143
Which is why you sometimes hear Mark making himself a snack

143
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:10,239
Were the Sioux Chef Mark sending email

144
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:13,311
Ardagh scuffling around

145
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:21,247
It's roughly 25 hours of recording conversations a lot of it Rain G and raw

146
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:27,903
They were poor assertive unexpected Mark swears a lot he can be blunt while both a soldier comes off as a soft

147
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,975
After 1 his go-to expletive is good grief

148
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:36,607
These tapes are not like regular interviews because Mark isn't so much after the fact of what he

149
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,143
Until he wants those two

150
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,447
Amore's after the why of what happened

151
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:44,543
Trying to get inside bows head to understand how BOCES the world

152
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:48,895
Always never monosyllabic or recalcitrant in these conversations

153
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:51,455
He's trying hard to explain himself

154
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:54,271
You can hear the bow is thinking through something

155
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,831
Has so far extraordinary life basically

156
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:57,855
And what's become of that

157
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:03,999
Which is understandable considering that any one piece of the story could keep a person's mind turning

158
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:10,655
Right now Bo is waiting to see if the Army is going to drop the charges against him or take them all the way to court-martial trial

159
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,447
Or something in between

160
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:17,823
And then there's the stunning fact the bow was held by the Taliban for almost 5 years

161
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,871
Pause on that for a second

162
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,663
5 years

163
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,687
Alone

164
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:29,343
That's longer than any American has ever been held by the Taliban longer than any American has survived being held by the Taliban

165
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,391
You can't speak Pashto

166
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:34,207
The people handling him for the most part didn't speak English

167
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:37,279
So for five years but can really talk to anyone

168
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,839
And then here he is and he's calls with Mark

169
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:42,143
Annies describing things vividly

170
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,679
Indescribable

171
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:49,567
Square one point they told me that they kind of had you in a really dark room almost sound like a basement like

172
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,847
Where there is no light

173
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,199
There's a few rooms like that

174
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:55,967
Yeah

175
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:02,111
How do I explain to a person

176
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,951
Standing in an empty

177
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:26,943
Remembering

178
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:32,831
I get that feeling that word is on the tip of your tongue

179
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:41,791
And I couldn't do anything

180
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,703
Yeah

181
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,519
To the point where you just want to scream

182
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:15,839
Is the entire world out there

183
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:19,167
That you're trying to breathe

184
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:23,775
Release that you're trying to get everything is beyond that door

185
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,479
On the other side of the door was relief

186
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,247
Course

187
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:38,879
But also all the various people and systems that have kicked into action after but went missing

188
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,695
Both parents and his friends back in Idaho

189
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,999
Military Intelligence analyst

190
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:44,767
Diplomat

191
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,815
Secret meetings with the Taliban

192
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:50,911
The briefers at Guantanamo Bay State Department the White House

193
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:55,775
At some point after I've been reporting out all these various threads of both story

194
00:11:56,287 --> 00:12:01,919
Interviewing lots of people at length about low and about what he did in the consequences of what he did

195
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,991
This children's book I used to read my kids popped into my head

196
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,271
It's called Zoom

197
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,575
There are no words it's just pictures

198
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,879
It starts with these pointy red shapes

199
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:14,975
The next page you realize those shapes are Rooster's comb

200
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:18,559
Next page zoom out you see the rooster is standing on a fence

201
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,095
Two little kids watching him

202
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:23,167
Next page to Matt again they're in a farmhouse

203
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:27,519
And then Zoom further you realize that all of it the rooster the kids The Farmhouse

204
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:30,335
Toys being played with by another child

205
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:36,479
And at that whole scene is actually an ad in a magazine in the magazine is in the lap of someone napping on a deck chair

206
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,247
And so on

207
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:41,855
Out-and-out exhumes the aperture of the thing getting wider and wider

208
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:45,183
Until the original image is so far away it's unseeable

209
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:47,743
That's what the story of Bowe Bergdahl is like

210
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:50,047
This one idiosyncratic guy

211
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,607
Make a radical decision at the age of 23

212
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,631
To walk away

213
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,911
Into Afghanistan

214
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:57,215
And the consequences of that decision

215
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,239
They spin out

216
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,519
Wider and wider

217
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,055
And it'll return your surprise

218
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,335
Picture changes

219
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,127
To get the full picture

220
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,431
You need to go very very small

221
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,967
Is one person's life

222
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,015
And also very very big

223
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,551
The war in Afghanistan

224
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,855
Don't even really knows who he has

225
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,903
And nobody knows why he did it

226
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:19,999
Who's filmmaker Mark boal and his tape that got me interested in all this

227
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,791
We were talking the other day on the phone

228
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,839
About what got him interested in BO

229
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,119
Heyser cycle

230
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:31,007
Mysterious

231
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:36,127
Military perspective from the people's perspective is

232
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:39,967
Unforgettable walking

233
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,015
Blocking off and leaving his post

234
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,855
It's not that simple because she

235
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,903
Guys that you did for a lily

236
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,695
That's really good reason

237
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,999
Psych the most important for Foundry

238
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,863
So how do you judge something like that how do you judge him

239
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:07,871
For this story we've teamed up with Mark and his production company page 1

240
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:12,479
They come to us saying all this reporting on the story and we also got this tape

241
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,759
Do you think you might want to listen

242
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,575
And yes we did and we are kind of Blown Away

243
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,111
Until we begin working with them

244
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:23,743
They share their research with us and also put us in touch with many of their sources especially soldiers

245
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,791
We don't have anything to do with their movie

246
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:28,863
Mark and Paige 1rr partners for season 2

247
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:33,471
You might hear Mark and me talking from time to time during the course of the season so we can compare notes

248
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:40,127
Bo Bergdahl is currently an active-duty Soldier he's got a clerical job at his base in San Antonio Texas

249
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,175
Were you waiting on his legal situation

250
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:44,735
Again isn't talking to the Press

251
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:48,319
But he did give us permission to use the taped phone calls with Mark

252
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,903
So let's start at the beginning

253
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,439
Why do you do it

254
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:55,231
Why believe his Platoon

255
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,279
That's where Mark started to

256
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:01,887
Story

257
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,239
Well give me give me the give me the 30 second version First

258
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,311
This is for Mark's first tape phone call with bow

259
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,103
30 second version

260
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,687
Now you know what this one is right

261
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,479
But what is

262
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,135
Dustwun stands for Duty status

263
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,415
Whereabouts unknown

264
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,719
Is the Army's version of Man Overboard

265
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:30,815
This one is the radio signal that put out over the radio when they

266
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:33,631
Okay

267
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:37,983
Right

268
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:41,823
Who says what he was trying to do was to cause a dust one

269
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:44,127
Which already set them apart

270
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,759
Because it means Bo doesn't fit into any of the AWOL or desertion scenarios were used to hearing

271
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,039
He wasn't cavorting

272
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,831
Wasn't drunk or goofing off

273
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:55,903
Drop his weapon and flee in the middle of a firefight

274
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:59,743
You didn't decide in a burst of Panic or confusion to go Walkabout

275
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,535
Instead

276
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,583
Slow simmering and methodical

277
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,375
Oh formulated a plan

278
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,423
He would create a crisis

279
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,447
A dust one

280
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:11,007
In order to call attention to another crisis

281
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:14,079
Bo says he had serious concerns

282
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:18,943
Concerns that began back in basic training in which persisted throughout his deployment in Afghanistan

283
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:21,759
Regarding bad leadership within his unit

284
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:26,879
Call my first unit all the way up

285
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,415
Understand

286
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,279
Basically

287
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,167
Next to me

288
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,215
Literally

289
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:45,823
Something seriously going wrong

290
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,991
This is a big point of conflict may be b-big point of conflict in both story

291
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:56,831
The question generally of Bose true motives for leaving his post

292
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:02,463
I specifically whether his description of what was happening around him is accurate or believable

293
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:05,791
Because of course this explanation could be a story he invent it

294
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:08,607
You could argue that he did have five years to come up with it

295
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:12,447
Or he could be expressing the genuine beliefs of a whistleblower

296
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:19,103
Or the truth could be something else entirely and I'm definitely going to get into that precisely what Beau says he was

297
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,919
Seen during his deployment and how he reacted to it

298
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:25,503
Throw that will make more sense once you know more about Bo himself

299
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:30,367
So for now I'm going to jump over that and just give you the Bare Bones of what Beau says

300
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:32,159
And that is

301
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:36,767
He was so alarmed by what he considered crappy and potentially dangerous leadership

302
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:37,791
3 needed to ask

303
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:40,863
He needed to let his command know at the highest level

304
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,495
Course

305
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:50,335
Going to take me serious

306
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:54,687
Right

307
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,991
Those solution is the best one

308
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:01,343
At the time that a tiny Outpost known as Opie mask

309
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:04,415
Masters in human the town right across the road from the Opie

310
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:06,207
2000 people live there

311
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:09,791
Message impact chica province in eastern Afghanistan

312
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,327
Right near the Pakistan border

313
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:14,655
Next to the town the soldiers set up a Sur campsite

314
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:18,239
A scrubby Rocky clearing about the size of a football field

315
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:21,055
A couple of Supply roads come together right there

316
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:25,151
One of the roads leads back to the battalion's big forward operating base at Toronto

317
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,175
Fob sharana

318
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,711
Where there's relative comfort

319
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:30,783
Beds internet Burger King basketball courts

320
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:33,087
The other Road leads to the Pakistan border

321
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:36,159
The Earth there is a spine finder

322
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,207
Soldiers I talked to call it moondust

323
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:40,511
The one time I saw mess

324
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,047
And this would have been

325
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,327
A couple days before

326
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,607
Birdo disappeared

327
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:48,191
I looked at and I got chills that wow that that place sucks

328
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:50,239
That's a guy named Ben Evans

329
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,775
You never even went to Okemos

330
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:54,591
The driving by it was enough to take in the bleakness

331
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:57,151
It was for truck surrounded by C wire

332
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:59,455
Crammed up in a little of runoff ditch

333
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:02,271
So gave me the willies just seeing the place

334
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:03,551
Opie mast

335
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,599
Probably the worst place

336
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:07,391
Humanly imaginable

337
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,927
That's John Thurman

338
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,719
Job within the same company is Bo

339
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:12,255
News Blackfoot company

340
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,279
Different Catan

341
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:17,631
Like other soldiers I talked to John remembered most mostly for what it lacked

342
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:18,655
Trees

343
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:21,215
Plumbing electricity water shade

344
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,519
But Opie mastersbilt

345
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:27,103
On the side of a hill and on top of the hill there was a cemetery

346
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:28,639
And

347
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:31,455
Instagram this place is spooky from the get-go

348
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:32,991
And

349
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,527
The quality of life was

350
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,807
Extremely low

351
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:43,743
Everybody pretty much got some sort of GI illness while we were out there just because we couldn't keep things clean enough we did

352
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:44,767
Didn't have the resources

353
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,327
But what was the

354
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:50,399
Dirty just just just dust and

355
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,727
Dust flies the

356
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:57,311
Flies definitely the open toilets d

357
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,335
Burn pit

358
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,383
I burnt it would be called the pit of Hell

359
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:03,967
This is Shane cross who's a friend of both at the time same Platoon

360
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:08,575
The pit of Hell was his large hole they dug and they throw the trash in there and Burnet

361
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:10,367
Call the pit of Hell because

362
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:12,159
We started it and it never went out

363
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:14,719
Banded burn continuously all through the night and days

364
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:17,791
Different from the gym to burn your

365
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,119
Dumb s*** for lack of a better word

366
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:21,887
Bring It On

367
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:29,311
That seems like that would be the pit of Hell more than this thick the regular garbage

368
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:32,895
We think we took that they can empty Hesco

369
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:36,479
Which high school is like a large basket you fill dirt

370
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:39,039
Eight feet tall Cafe

371
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,831
TNT one of those

372
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,111
And I made a little

373
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,391
Hello room

374
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:44,927
And you had to go

375
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:45,695
Bucket

376
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,999
There went everyone should and then

377
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:52,351
What makes out with some fuel and summer jobs dinner with stick and stir it as it burned

378
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:58,495
No registering it sometimes smell Rowdy I wouldn't be a large wooden stick I got one by one

379
00:20:58,751 --> 00:20:59,263
1 enough

380
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:00,543
It would

381
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,127
Givenchy burns down to Insurgent closer and closer as she's driving

382
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,943
Who was job whatever

383
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:10,271
To do a starring like did you have to draw straws for the stirring

384
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:15,903
What you just text her privates ncos at always pick one of us in

385
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:19,488
Usually you can rely on them taking the private they don't like

386
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:22,304
Bose company Blackfoot company

387
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,352
Add set up the Opie in the first place

388
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:27,424
They're supposed to help the Afghans keep the insurgents in check

389
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,960
Because the two roads there

390
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:31,776
The US called one of the root Audi the other route Dodge

391
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:34,592
Were used as supply routes for Taliban fighters

392
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:38,176
Their weapons and IEDs improvised explosive devices

393
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,480
They were the big threat in Afghanistan

394
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:45,600
1st platoon leader said there was an ID hotspot about a thousand out along Route Audi

395
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:49,696
The Afghan National Police had their own little Outpost further up the hill there as well

396
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:53,536
American soldiers headstrong all this concertina wire around the place

397
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,840
And their job was really just to be there

398
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:58,400
In the middle of nowhere making their presence felt

399
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:01,216
Keeping a lookout for suspicious vehicles

400
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:03,776
Watching the rooftops of Mast for snipers

401
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:08,128
Some of the guys I talked to said that occasionally someone would shoot at them and they shoot back

402
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:10,176
But now them said there was much action there

403
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:12,992
They didn't discover anyone transporting weapons or bombs

404
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:16,832
Mostly it was just fruit vendors are farmers or families passing through

405
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,952
Splatoon would go to the Opie for three or four or five days at a stretch

406
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:25,536
Sometimes doing patrols into Mast or the other nearby town malach

407
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,840
Or pulling around-the-clock guard Duty

408
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:28,864
Either from the trucks

409
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,168
Or from the hilltop up here the cemetery

410
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:33,472
Where they dug out of small Foxhole bunker

411
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,544
Everlong long stretches of boring

412
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,848
I was wondering what the hell they were doing there

413
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:42,944
All the soldiers I talked to said they just hated being a mess

414
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:50,880
He was about 20 miles Southwest of fob sharana idea was that he'd sneak away from mast

415
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:54,976
Which power refers to as a TCP for traffic control points

416
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:57,280
And run all the way back to the fob

417
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:01,376
He says he figured he could make it to sharana and maybe 24 hours or so

418
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:02,656
You spell again

419
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:09,312
PCP on a few days later after this one is called out.

420
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,968
CIA is alerted

421
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:18,528
Alerted the Marines are alerted

422
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:28,256
Which means it when he reappears It'll be such a big deal I'll be such a commotion everyone will want to know why he left

423
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,536
Why he's back

424
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:32,352
And so he'll be able to get an audience with whomever he wants

425
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,376
General event

426
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:35,680
And they won't be able to ignore his complaints

427
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:38,752
Weren't you afraid they were like throw you in

428
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,800
Widow jail or whatever

429
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,872
Actually what I

430
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:50,272
And how long do you figure you'd stay in there

431
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:54,624
I figured I'd stay in there until people

432
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:57,952
Situation cleared up

433
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:04,352
Somebody actually took a look at the situation and when people started

434
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:09,216
People would understand that I was right

435
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:14,848
Danger to the company

436
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:30,720
Understanding that if somebody had done something

437
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:35,584
Nascimento in Cobourg Eisenberg Splatoon

438
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,120
Some gutsy move dude

439
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:40,704
It's still stupid

440
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:42,752
Well

441
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:43,520
Yeah

442
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,568
They're not that's not mutually exclusive

443
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:54,528
Who makes preparation

444
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:58,624
Back at the farm for a spell he goes to the shrine at post office

445
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,928
And send some of his things back to Idaho

446
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:02,720
Some books is new laptop

447
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:04,256
Kindle Journal

448
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:09,120
In the likely event that he gets in trouble he doesn't want his personal stuff seized by the army

449
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:12,960
Does a shop run by the locals at the fob they got the hobby shop

450
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:15,008
Esl DVDs and clothes

451
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,800
Who buys a local outfit

452
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:17,824
Assertive robe

453
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,360
Because I knew

454
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,152
There's a possibility of

455
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:28,576
Obviously a big white guy

456
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:36,768
Yeah

457
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:44,448
He also took out $300 from his bank account

458
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:46,240
And us and Afghani money

459
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:48,288
Just in case you need to bribe someone

460
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:55,456
The end of June 2009 Splatoon was on his very last rotation at Okemos

461
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:58,784
The company was getting ready to hand the place over to the Afghans

462
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,088
Which really just means they're going to take their trucks and leave

463
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:05,440
In any case this would be Bose last chance to execute his plan

464
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:10,048
And this plan is risky obviously it's difficult and it's dangerous

465
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:13,120
But technically it's not impossible to do it

466
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,912
Physically but was capable

467
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:15,936
Who's a good runner

468
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:21,056
He runs similar distances before plus he was used to running at high altitudes and Idaho

469
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:22,080
He did well in the heat

470
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:26,944
Money talks about it now he'll sometimes acknowledge the wrongheadedness of it

471
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,992
Eddie overestimated his ability

472
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:33,088
He wasn't aware of the other ways he could have registered concerns about leadership

473
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:36,416
But there was this other idea but was testing out

474
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:40,256
Yes he says he wanted to bring attention to the plight of his platoon

475
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:43,328
He also admits that his plan was part Crucible

476
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,168
Trying to prove to myself I was trying to prove to the world

477
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,984
Anybody who used to know me

478
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,848
Being that person

479
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:57,664
Like a super soldier even

480
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:00,480
OK Google

481
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:10,208
Right

482
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:15,584
The character of death in whatever a character

483
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:20,960
I was going to prove to the world

484
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,336
Yeah

485
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:31,200
What it is

486
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:32,480
Movies

487
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:39,136
They all want to be that but I wanted to prove why don't you just wait and see if

488
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:41,696
You got the opportunity to prove that like on a mission

489
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,744
You know cuz you haven't even been there that long

490
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:50,912
Iguana when I wait a couple months and see if you get a chance to prove yourself in a

491
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:51,680
You know

492
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,728
Some kind of tactical engagement

493
00:27:54,752 --> 00:28:00,896
Because it was a combination of situation

494
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:04,480
Right right right

495
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,744
Right into it

496
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,816
Right

497
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:22,400
Tutoring

498
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:25,472
On the morning of June 30th 2009

499
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:27,776
Open schedule to take over guard Duty

500
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:30,848
The soldiers would keep watch from the turd of one of the mrap

501
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:32,384
Switch the big armored truck

502
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:35,456
Who is supposed to take over from Austin Lanford

503
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:37,504
Atlantic comes the end of his shift

504
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:38,528
Nobo

505
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:43,904
So we gets down from the big truck which is not technically supposed to do until he's relieved but whatever

506
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,488
He steps down and shakes Bose little tent which is right near the mrap

507
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:48,768
To wake him up for Duty

508
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,816
Inline 4 goes back up in the truck

509
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,352
Stilnovo

510
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,656
So I went back down

511
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:56,448
And then opened is 10

512
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:58,752
And he wasn't in there so I was like okay well

513
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:01,312
He probably went to the bathroom or something

514
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:04,896
Sanford House to a guy headed to the toilet says see if bergdahl's in there

515
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,432
Guy comes back

516
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:07,200
Nope

517
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:13,856
Ben Lanford remembers that Bo had a reputation for sometimes hanging out with the Afghan National Police guys who also had an

518
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,904
Outpost up on the hill so

519
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,184
That that was my neck

520
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:20,512
Thought was he might be up there

521
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:24,096
So I radioed up to the opiates that has Bergdahl there

522
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:26,144
They said no poor does not appear

523
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:31,264
Set an alert Shane cross since he's buddies with bow and now Shane starts looking

524
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,056
So I got up and I said yeah I'll get him

525
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,592
I looked around and

526
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:37,408
Program from a little bit inside of their trucks

527
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,432
A few

528
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:39,200
Sportway Canton

529
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:41,760
But I said hey words with bow

530
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,552
I don't know I don't know

531
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:47,392
After taking too much traffic I started to get concerned

532
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,672
And

533
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,208
That's what I

534
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:52,512
Outback I woke her PL

535
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,328
I told him what

536
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,864
But what happened

537
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,400
Then it was gone

538
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,448
Who was the piano

539
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:01,984
Lieutenant Billings

540
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:06,080
John Billings was the pl the platoon leader

541
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:11,200
He testified at a military hearing that he thought Shane and Austin and the other guys were just messing with him

542
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,736
He said he thought quote

543
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:16,832
They just want to see me get all spazzed out freaked out you know call her headquarters

544
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:21,696
Instead Billings realizes with horror that it's real

545
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:23,744
Freaks out and calls her headquarters

546
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:28,864
He told an army prosecutor that he felt a quote internal franticness unquote

547
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,144
I can't find this guy

548
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:34,240
It types out a message to his company Commander back of Toronto to the effect of

549
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,264
We're not up

550
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,568
Meaning not 100% accounted for

551
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,360
I have a missing Soldier

552
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,920
At the other end of that message

553
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,712
Is Captain silvino s silvino

554
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:46,784
Look again there's got to be a mistake

555
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,320
Billings right back

556
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:49,856
Not a mistake

557
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:52,416
Sophie knows that's the best one in motion

558
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,952
Justin Theroux had planned

559
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:58,816
The new start circulating at the opp obviously then back up

560
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:02,144
Five of the chain of command and then all over Afghanistan

561
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:06,240
Those fellow soldiers immediately try to piece together what it happened

562
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:07,776
Here's Austin Lanford

563
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,080
The guy who bow is supposed to relieve from guard Duty

564
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:12,640
I knew in my mind

565
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:13,664
That

566
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,456
He had nobody came in until

567
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:21,088
Cuz it ain't they would have either been seeing they would have been able to get through the concertina wire

568
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:23,648
She would have fought back

569
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,416
Like

570
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,280
I didn't imagine him being taken as an option

571
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:36,704
And he left behind all his sensitive items in a nice neat little items meaning that's Mark McCrory serial number

572
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,984
Gear that would be a problem

573
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:38,752
His weapon

574
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,288
The laser for his weapon

575
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,312
Optic

576
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,592
Is night update

577
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:44,384
Stuff like that

578
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,480
A big problem if it went missing you left it in a nice neat little pile with a note

579
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:51,552
Of course mixed in with the facts there's just a ton of conjecture

580
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:56,416
Princeton's there's actually no evidence but left a note and Bone self says he didn't leave one

581
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:58,976
It's not clear to me where that detail came from

582
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:03,072
Other people said but I've been acting too cozy with the Afghan National Police guys

583
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:07,424
The way that he been talking to the locals in the way that he been

584
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,728
You know he's been showing up late to guard shift

585
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:13,312
Because he was busy talking to the locals

586
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,592
Does Josh quarter

587
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:15,872
Here's Darrell Hanson

588
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:17,664
Is guesses were expensive

589
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:21,248
We're like Manatee like CIA or what I mean does he like this

590
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:27,648
Crazy like mole was the discussion yeah like what were you guys thinking

591
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:28,928
What were you thinking that I've

592
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,744
I mean those are the things I like

593
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,536
Schedule complete lunatic

594
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:35,584
Or is he like CIA

595
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:38,656
Like we're trying to like we can figure it out you know

596
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:44,288
Some of these guys they'd seen so many strange and terrible things on deployments

597
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,592
But this was unheard of

598
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:53,760
I talked to Josh and Ben and another bandag I'm calling Scott's not his real name and Ken and John and Jace

599
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:56,832
Jason and Mark and Zach and Austin and Shane and Daryl

600
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,440
They remember bow differently they remember what happened after he left

601
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,208
Differently

602
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,000
The different feelings about it

603
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:06,304
They do not speak with one voice

604
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:10,912
A to a man they said they were gobsmacked when they heard someone was missing

605
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:12,448
And now it's like

606
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:14,496
This is got to be a drill

607
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:16,800
Holy crap like this is a

608
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:18,592
Drink like a I like what

609
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:20,128
You know

610
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:23,456
What is the craziest thing I could ever happen

611
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:25,248
Because it was so ludicrous

612
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:28,320
Set the time to think about it like what do you mean cuz nobody walks off

613
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:30,624
Nobody walks off of Bob

614
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,416
R&R a

615
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:34,464
Not even a Bobby

616
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,536
A combat Outpost where you going to go

617
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:44,704
I mean it's not like you can go hide out you know what the mall or something I mean that there is nowhere but Taliban

618
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:51,360
One of those friends told me that he was always a meticulous packer

619
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:54,688
This trip from Mass to sharana was no exception

620
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:58,528
Who's got his wallet and his camera he always had his camera on him

621
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,368
Two small knives that clip onto his belt vs utility knife

622
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,392
Go to notebook

623
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:05,952
Inside a few palms and journal entries

624
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:10,048
Plus a newspaper clipping about a guy who set a record for sailing

625
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:12,864
1000 days or something but loves boats

626
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:16,192
Water heats up the bladder from his Camelback

627
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,728
3 liters

628
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:24,128
Forgot to pack a nuts from his trail mix and some vacuum packed chicken meat from an MRE stands for meal ready to eat

629
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:25,920
Soldiers Field ration

630
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:32,320
And he had his Compass is Afghan clothing he shoved into his pocket he figured he wouldn't eat it until the sun rose

631
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:36,416
Sometime after midnight on June 30th

632
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:40,000
Boax about halfway up the hill toward that II Lookout

633
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:45,376
X over The concertina wire in a spot where someone had thrown a plastic crate down on top of it

634
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:49,472
He skirts past the Afghan and US post on top of the hill

635
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:51,264
Knowing it's a blind spot for them

636
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,336
Blade for one thing so people are probably tired

637
00:34:54,848 --> 00:35:00,992
And if they're looking at it all they're looking into the distance not directly below them plus the Afghans don't have night vision gear

638
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:01,760
There anyway

639
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:08,160
Once he clears. He'll he heads Northwest toward the town of Malak passes to school there

640
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:10,464
Until finally he's out in open desert

641
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,256
And that's when it hit some

642
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:15,328
He suddenly feels the magnitude of what he's done

643
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:19,424
Basically what I decided to do about first plane was

644
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,728
Go from point A to point B

645
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,312
However 20 minutes out

646
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:35,552
When I get back to the everything

647
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:40,672
Can I use that was going to happen what time

648
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:42,464
Yeah

649
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:47,584
Not bad but I did not really do something.

650
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:50,912
Also he's profoundly scared

651
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:55,520
He's a world away from anything he knows in a country whose culture is

652
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:58,336
Is alien to him or people want to kill him

653
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:01,408
And he's outside the wire in the dark

654
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:06,016
When I picture him standing there I imagine a free-floating astronaut

655
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:08,576
No comforting tether attaching him to the Mothership

656
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:13,184
The thought crosses Bo's mind to just go back to the Opie

657
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:15,744
But he's not at all sure he could sneak back in

658
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:19,584
After all the guys there are watching for people coming toward them

659
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,632
And they're Manning big machine gun

660
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:22,912
He might get shot

661
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:27,520
Instead both figures he's just got to clench his jaw and go for it

662
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:32,896
Here again he makes a decision that is not the one you expect or at least not the one I would have

663
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:36,992
Because not only does he keep going but he Alters his plan

664
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,272
Complicated

665
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:40,832
Makes it a little grander and more ambitious

666
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:45,952
In hopes of mitigating the momentous trouble he now realizes he's in

667
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:49,792
Go figure is I'll try to arrive back at the fob with some extra thing

668
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:50,560
I guess

669
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:52,864
In the form of valuable Intel

670
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:57,728
He knew that on the road from five strata to Okemos there sometimes IDs

671
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,824
It heard someplace that the guys were planting ideas we're doing it at night

672
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:05,152
So he decides he'll make like a special forces guy

673
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:09,248
And try to catch someone planting an ID you're about to plant ID

674
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:13,344
I look for flashlights bobbing up and down listen for the crackle of radios

675
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:20,000
I would have been if I had seen somebody in the Darkness

676
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,584
Call Lake Wylie

677
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:26,144
In the morning

678
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:44,320
You left your position but I also got this information so

679
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:49,184
What are you going to do I have this information of this person who was book

680
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:54,304
Would be like justifiable like

681
00:37:55,072 --> 00:38:00,192
He left his phone

682
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:08,896
Deal with

683
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:11,200
Basically hurricane

684
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:20,928
Up until this point both has he been walking in open Terrain

685
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:23,232
Between the road and a swell of hills

686
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,048
His idea was to make a slight detour

687
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,096
To shift a bit more toward the Hills

688
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:29,120
For some houses were

689
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:33,984
Thinking he'd have a better chance they're catching someone moving around in the dark unawares

690
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:36,544
Before he knows it he's in the house

691
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:39,360
He says he got completely Tangled in there

692
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:40,896
Forgot to check his compass

693
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:41,920
For 2 hours

694
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:43,200
Which is a rookie move

695
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:47,552
And so what was meant to be a slight detour turn into a major detour

696
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,136
By the time in straighten himself out and gotten out of the Hills

697
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:53,184
It's lost valuable time

698
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,208
The next morning

699
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:56,768
Workouts

700
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:01,888
By the time the sun was up bow is an open desert

701
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:02,912
Tonneau cover

702
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:15,200
And what happened some dudes drove up and just nag you or what

703
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:23,904
Baby

704
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:30,304
White motorcycles

705
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,824
Was a bigger one that was

706
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:46,688
7.62 7.62 x 41

707
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:49,760
I get one of those

708
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:52,832
They were driving along the road and I have

709
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:57,952
I'm off I can't tell you how they started

710
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:00,000
I don't I don't know they just

711
