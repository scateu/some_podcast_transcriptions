I know what this one is right

12
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:30,720
Previously

13
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:31,744
I'm cereal

14
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:36,608
I wanted to be a soldier but I wanted to be

15
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:41,472
And they were out out there handing out watercolor maps of Afghanistan

16
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:43,520
All felt like why are we up

17
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,336
This is f****** b*******

18
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:48,896
He's in Pakistan

19
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:55,296
I serve the United States with honor and distinction

20
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:58,368
That's not something you can never come back I haven't seen

21
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:04,768
From you or any other journalists a real dig into how the Army came to that conclusion

22
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:06,560
That door get ready cuz there's a

23
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:10,656
There's a shitstorm you know and it's not going away anytime soon

24
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:17,568
From This American Life and WBEZ Chicago is cereal

25
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:19,360
One story told week by week

26
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:20,384
I'm Sarah Koenig

27
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:27,808
I'm driving to go pick up

28
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,344
My dry cleaning

29
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,928
And I must things have said 7 or whatever it was and I was like

30
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,208
Wait a second

31
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,256
Doing the Coast Guard

32
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:40,352
I had a couple of conversations recently that I just want to tell you about

33
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:42,400
When was with this guy Justin

34
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,680
Kid email.

35
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,704
So I gave him a call

36
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,776
Boom boom boom January 2006 I like

37
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,056
IPods

38
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,080
The show

39
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:54,688
And I called my sister and I like gel you are not going to believe this

40
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:58,784
Overdose season 2 and she's like yeah

41
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,320
I want to be with this guy

42
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,368
Coast Guard boot camp

43
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:05,184
And he remembers the night Bo broke down

44
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,280
Remember standing outside on a freezing February night in Cape May New Jersey

45
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:11,584
Well something strange happened inside

46
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:15,168
Remember seeing blood and broken glass in the bathroom

47
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,448
And yellow caution tape

48
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:21,312
Justin was seventeen at the time and there's some details he couldn't recall

49
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:25,408
But he let me to another guy also from that boot camp class

50
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,432
John Ross

51
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,248
John was an older recruits 26

52
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,784
He remembered though do you like them

53
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,064
I thought he was a nice guy

54
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:37,184
One night a couple of weeks in John says there was a fire drill

55
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,488
They did that a lot these wee hours fire drills

56
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,632
I'm Commander would bang on the top of a garbage can and wake everybody up and they'd all have to rush outside and muster up

57
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,472
Each person had a number and they called out in order

58
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:52,544
01003 cetera

59
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:55,104
It became clear there was a number missing

60
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,128
Also clear

61
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,408
That number was Bo

62
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,456
John was at the edge of the group

63
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:03,296
So his commanders sends him and another guy back inside to find bow

64
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,856
We go running back and

65
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:08,416
The running into the head

66
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:11,232
And there he was he

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,048
Get blood even felt pretty good

68
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:18,656
We were never sure exactly how he did it

69
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,216
But there was

70
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,496
Quite a bit of blood

71
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,800
There was some blood on the wall

72
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:27,104
Vladimir's what are those

73
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,664
The sink

74
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:32,480
The countertop area

75
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:36,064
And he was bleeding from a space there was

76
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,600
No blood on his hands

77
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,184
Blake he had

78
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:45,280
Cam smashes face into the mirror

79
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:46,816
And he was

80
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,096
Huddled up crying

81
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,376
Hi yuan

82
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:52,192
Balled up

83
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:56,544
One of those moments you run into you like oh s***

84
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,128
What if I could I just like step into

85
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,176
Did you try to talk to him

86
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:05,248
I did and he was just sleeping

87
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,832
I was just and it was shocking

88
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,112
Bedtime

89
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:16,000
I like the guy so I was trying to find out what happened I remember just

90
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:22,655
Connect coaching down next to him like I do what's going on are you okay and you was sleeping like go away leave me alone

91
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:29,567
This version is more alarming than the one I'd heard previously from bow or from the Army investigation

92
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,127
It's why Justin emailed us in the first place

93
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,967
To say sure didn't look like a garden-variety panic attack to him

94
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,015
And it wasn't

95
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:44,159
A military psychologist I talk to you said you don't usually hospitalize someone much less eject them from the military

96
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,695
Based on a single panic attack

97
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,999
So whatever was going on with bow

98
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,535
Must have been more serious than that

99
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,351
Sobo got sent home

100
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,911
Dejana Justin no big surprise there

101
00:04:55,167 --> 00:05:00,031
They said Coast Guard training was very demanding psychologically and it was clear bow couldn't hack it

102
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,823
The big surprise

103
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:02,847
Came much later

104
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:06,431
When Bill was rescued a friend of John Rolfe is called him and said

105
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,479
Can you believe that p o w

106
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,015
From bootcamp

107
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,087
John said it took him awhile to put it together

108
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,879
Techno music

109
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:18,719
Who captured by the Taliban I'm like who

110
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,023
Like what the hell is he doing

111
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:25,375
You are like

112
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:28,959
How do you survive five years of the Taliban you're like how that guy and lives

113
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:32,031
Exactly

114
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,055
Yeah

115
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:37,663
Didn't make any sense to me

116
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,431
That just

117
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,967
Blew my mind away

118
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:43,551
I guess it was a really nice guy but

119
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,087
If you couldn't handle

120
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,111
The Coast Guard

121
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:51,231
And the comfort is stressful

122
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,767
Make it sound like it

123
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,559
A cakewalk

124
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:59,167
But he should not have gone to another

125
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,191
French

126
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:07,615
Again in his investigation General Kenneth Dahl found the Army recruiter followed all the regulations when he signed blow up

127
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:12,223
I also wrote that he thought those regulations were inadequate in those case

128
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:16,063
His Coast Guard separation should have been looked at more carefully than it was

129
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,647
John spent eight years in the Coast Guard Reserves

130
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,951
Justin became a rescue swimmer

131
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,999
Like a special forces the Coast Guard

132
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,303
I got you drop out of helicopters into the ocean

133
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:30,399
Presumably they both know a thing or two about the military mindset

134
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,215
Justin had the same question as John

135
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,263
Why they let that guy into the army

136
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:39,871
They saw what I saw this on what happened during Coast Guard boot camp

137
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,663
Not at all. There's no

138
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,735
No reason why they should ever let him in

139
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,503
At all

140
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:54,463
Sometimes bouquets is summed up like this

141
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,255
What book did was wrong

142
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,303
Walking off his post was wrong

143
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,863
But the Army shouldn't have let him enlist in the first place

144
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,167
+ 5 years captivity

145
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,703
5 years

146
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,007
Scales balance

147
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,311
The Army messed up messed up

148
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,335
Let's move on

149
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,895
That leaves out a reckoning

150
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:15,967
And a reckoning is what the military wants understandably

151
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:19,807
Afghanistan into their families

152
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,671
If you don't consider the consequences of bows decision to walk off opms

153
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:28,767
Eye feels as if something important and painful has been papered over

154
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,815
And that doesn't feel like justice

155
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,351
I want an accounting

156
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:37,471
This is our last episode this season and so I want to try to answer this now

157
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:40,287
What exactly should we blame bo4

158
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,335
What's his fault and what is a

159
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:45,151
And the heaviest moral charge against him

160
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:51,039
The elephant in so many discussions about Bo and about the trade and about the military proceedings against him

161
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:54,879
Did any American soldiers died looking for him

162
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:59,231
Some people very high up in the military world are saying yes

163
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,767
People did die looking for Bowe

164
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:04,351
Michael Flynn is the highest-ranking person I've interviewed so far

165
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:09,215
He's a retired lieutenant general who is head of Dia the defense intelligence agency

166
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:13,311
Back in 2009 when both went missing Flynn was in Afghanistan

167
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:16,383
He was General Stanley McChrystal director of intelligence

168
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:22,015
What crystal in case you've forgotten was commander of us and Coalition forces for all of Afghanistan

169
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:25,855
So when just under McChrystal is a big deal

170
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:30,463
Explain to him that this was one of my outstanding questions about both story

171
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:34,815
This very thing of like will wait did people die

172
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:41,471
During this search for Bergdahl as a unit

173
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:44,543
Okay if somebody was on a mission to go

174
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,335
Find an American

175
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,615
Now there's

176
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:52,223
What did the guy did a soldier walk down a road

177
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,271
And in an IED blew up

178
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:58,879
And if the soldier was walking down that road in an area where

179
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:03,487
He would not have have been had it not been for the search for Bergdahl

180
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:07,071
And in fact his mission there their tactical mission was to

181
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,375
You know conduct a patrol

182
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,911
And and

183
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:13,983
Try to find intelligence or try to find

184
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:20,383
Any indications of where the soldier might be and then and in fact was blown up by that IAD or others wounded

185
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:27,551
That's a no-brainer I agree that does that.

186
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,319
Connect

187
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,903
Here's the problem now

188
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:36,767
General Flynn's no-brainer scenario I haven't found one like that

189
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:39,071
When he said those are dots he connected

190
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:42,399
He wasn't thinking of any particular cases of soldiers who died

191
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:46,239
He was there he says he knows it to be true

192
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:49,823
Durbin lots of media stories

193
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:54,943
Declarative stories citing specific cases of soldiers who died because of the search

194
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:58,015
Usually there are six names all from Bo's battalion

195
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,295
The first of the five-oh-first

196
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:03,135
We know for sure there was a massive search for bow

197
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:07,231
She walked off Opie Mast on June 30th 2009

198
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:12,095
For the month of July people were sent out all over praktika Province and Beyond

199
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,655
Doing nothing but missions to find the dust one

200
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:19,263
But brother miraculously no one died on those missions

201
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,567
The six names of soldiers who died

202
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:24,127
They were all on missions that happened later

203
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:26,431
7 to 10 weeks after bow disappeared

204
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:29,503
And none of those missions was a search and rescue mission

205
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:33,855
We looked into all these incidents there are four of them

206
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,647
Talk to soldiers who are there

207
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:38,463
And two people higher up who planned and organized them

208
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:41,535
Official information on these missions is thin

209
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:45,119
We've seen Army investigations on only two of the four cases

210
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:51,263
One of those was just a summary they were both redacted so we can't tell what the precise Mission orders and objectives were

211
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:56,895
We put in for your request with the Army long ago on all these cases but haven't gotten anything back

212
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:02,527
Again the Army itself hasn't formally investigated the question of whether people died looking for Bo

213
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,551
That we know of

214
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,087
But somehow

215
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:08,159
This idea that people died looking for Bo

216
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,975
To a lot of people it's not a question

217
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:16,863
It has traveled out of the realm of the murky and has solidified into concrete information

218
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:21,983
Point where a clothing company made a f*** Bergdahl T-shirt with 6 Stars underneath

219
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:26,079
To represent quote the 6 honorable soldiers from the first of the five-oh-first

220
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:28,639
That lost their lives all because of Bergdahl

221
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:35,039
Why are some people so sure about this

222
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,575
Where did it come from

223
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:44,255
On September 4th 2009

224
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:47,071
One of those six soldiers Darren Andrews

225
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:51,679
Was killed in Pacheco province in a village called Palau right near Okemos

226
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:54,239
Who's the second lieutenant in later

227
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,519
His parents

228
00:11:55,775 --> 00:12:01,919
Sandra and Andy Andrews I've been told by the army that Darren was killed in an RPG attack on a mission to rest

229
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:04,479
Target Topanga

230
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:10,623
When they attack happened apparently pushed aside other men he was awarded the Silver Star posthumously

231
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:18,303
About five years later his parents were on a long drive to the hospital for Andy's cancer

232
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:21,631
When President Obama announced Bose return

233
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:28,031
Eddie says the way he remembers at the Rose Garden ceremony hadn't even finished before someone contacted them

234
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:34,431
I don't find him Saundra got a call and this gas is I want to let you know where

235
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:40,831
Fixing to break this story and tell the truth of what really happened this phone call with someone in

236
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:47,231
Aaron's unit this was the first Andy and Sandra were hearing that Darren was actually killed on a mission related to Bo

237
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:51,839
And then we were on the phone literally she was on the phone literally

238
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:58,239
From the time we left Cameron till we got to MD Anderson 3 hours later with NBC CBS

239
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,799
ABC and I don't everybody know

240
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:05,151
When it broke it broke hard

241
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:10,271
Started texting and sending messages on Facebook and calling and telling me

242
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:15,135
You know we're not going to stand by and let them say

243
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,415
He is a hero

244
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,279
Is your son in the other guys were a hero

245
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,327
And we're not going to stand for this

246
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:27,167
That same day the six names were put out there

247
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:27,935
Online

248
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:31,519
My day 3 destroy had anchored in the mainstream press

249
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:36,639
Cassandra and Andy it was such a jolt that first call

250
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:42,015
Because after 5 years they'd come to accept the original army issue version of what happened to Darren

251
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:44,831
That he been killed on a mission to rest a Taliban guy

252
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,647
They weren't looking for someone else to blame

253
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,207
They were doing okay with what they thought they knew

254
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,743
Uniwigs tala

255
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:55,071
Fit the story into our life

256
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,119
We have done

257
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,911
Talked about it

258
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,703
And now all of that

259
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,495
Was gone

260
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:05,055
We had a whole new story to get used to

261
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,615
Anna

262
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,407
A lot more anger

263
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:13,247
Sandra said they felt angry at Beaufort one thing

264
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,295
And they felt they been lied to

265
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,319
Are the army

266
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,599
I'd Aaron's Commander

267
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:20,671
Because no one had ever mentioned berdosa them before

268
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,951
Which goldfish eat

269
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,487
Like there was a cover-up

270
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:29,631
Two and a half weeks later at the andrews's went to Washington DC to testify before a congressional committee

271
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,751
Andy Andrews told the committee that six different soldiers who served with their son

272
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:38,591
I told him and his wife that Darren was killed while searching for Bo

273
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,407
Founder says at the very least

274
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,967
Bo was a contributing factor in his death

275
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,015
It may not have been directly

276
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,063
But indirectly

277
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,599
He was responsible

278
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:57,791
So this story the six names the lineup of photos in the Press

279
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:01,887
As far as I can tell it originated at the ground level from Bo's platoon mates

280
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:07,775
Documentation to back up what they were saying the defense department wasn't seconding these claims

281
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,567
These guys did have reasons

282
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,615
They were just making it up

283
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:15,455
Take Palau the tour Darren Andrews died on September 4th

284
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:19,039
I wasn't clear what exactly that mission was about

285
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:21,599
And I didn't understand what the connection to Bo was

286
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:26,207
So I asked John Thurman to explain it to me because he was on that plow mission

287
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:31,583
And I also knew John was in the camp of soldiers who thought bill was responsible for the people who died

288
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:34,143
They said we're going out for

289
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,447
You know up to 10 10 days

290
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,239
And that's

291
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,287
Basically all I remember

292
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,823
But what was your mission

293
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,383
But I don't actually know

294
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:50,015
That was definitely way above my paygrade we were going to be going into Palau

295
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:54,111
And we were going to be looking around and going house-to-house we had

296
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:58,207
Quite a few attachments that I'd never seen before we had a female engagement team

297
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:01,791
And we also had a combat camera team that was with us

298
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,839
So I don't actually know

299
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,631
This is an unusual actually

300
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:08,703
Trello level Soldier doesn't know the overall mission

301
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,495
What's communicated to Jimenez

302
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,287
Pac4x many days

303
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,335
And then before they go out each day

304
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,127
Every spider immediate leader

305
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,663
In this case Erin Andrews

306
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:24,063
We're going to go to this location or going to knock on doors or head out stuff or meet with Afghan Security Forces

307
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:24,831
Whatever

308
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:30,719
I've asked a lot of people not just John but Battalion officers people doing Intel

309
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:33,023
What was the purpose of the Palau mission

310
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,583
Here's what I've gathered big picture

311
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:39,935
The trip to Palau was part of a larger roughly 10-day operation

312
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,727
Push into the yackle district

313
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:46,335
US forces have been pretty successful in other towns but farther north

314
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:48,895
They're working up there with local leaders doing

315
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:53,247
Coin essentially making friends helping build local government and security

316
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,039
But not so much in my account

317
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,575
Which is right near Okemos

318
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:02,463
The Villages around there had quite a bit of Taliban activity they were not friendly to US forces

319
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:05,791
I said the Battalion had planned this mission to try to push back in there

320
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:11,423
That area was strategic it was between the Pakistan border and a main Highway in Afghanistan

321
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,239
That goes up to Kabul and then all through the country

322
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:17,823
The weight of Italian plan these larger operations

323
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,127
They weren't just about one objective

324
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,431
You try to accomplish a bunch of things at once

325
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:25,759
Get all kinds of US government agencies doing their stuff

326
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:32,671
State Department or the Department of Agriculture they might be assessing which little grapes are best to grow in whatever Valley

327
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,463
So you might have them along

328
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:38,303
Honest pulao Mission John remembers a female engagement team

329
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,863
That likely would have been headed up by a social scientist

330
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:45,727
His job is to help the US military understand Afghan culture

331
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:52,383
John doesn't remember looking for a specific high-value Taliban guy on that mission but other people I spoke to her

332
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:58,015
Who are there do remember that but they infected detain someone zip tied his hands guarded him

333
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:01,087
But then were told by higher-ups to let him go which they did

334
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:06,719
Again I haven't seen the mission order or the after-action report so I can't be sure

335
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:08,511
Adheres with John remembers

336
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,047
From his vantage point

337
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:13,119
In the driver's seat behind the wheel of an mrap

338
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,447
He remembers they had a lot of trucks that day maybe seven

339
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:18,239
Take me to court on in the village

340
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:24,383
And John in the Gunner waiting in the truck while the other guys went door-to-door about 45 minutes passed on to us

341
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:28,223
So my Gunner and I were sitting in the truck

342
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:31,039
And we just we had this Eerie feeling we were talking about

343
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:33,343
You know over some cigarettes like this

344
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:36,671
The sound is doesn't feel right it didn't give us a good vibe

345
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:40,255
And I remember a bunch of kids

346
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:43,583
Were congregating under the gigantic tree there

347
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:46,399
And then they all started to filter back into their houses

348
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:49,471
And I'm a gunner had actually been in Iraq

349
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:51,519
On the deployment prior to ours

350
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:54,079
And he said you know

351
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,871
I got a bad feeling we're about to go

352
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:56,639
Get f***** up

353
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:58,431
Because when the town clears out

354
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:04,575
Usually it means that the Taliban is going to stand something up there bringing the civilians back in so that they don't get hurt

355
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:08,415
I'm going to put the word out you know we're going to attack the Americans today

356
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,743
So we radio up

357
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,767
And

358
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,815
Everybody kind of knows what's going on

359
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,863
They all get ready to leave

360
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:21,471
And then someone comes out from behind a wall and shoot an RPG at one of their trucks

361
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:22,751
They shoot back

362
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,031
Hainan aerospace

363
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:26,335
I was Truck 3

364
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:28,639
And I just see the first truck just

365
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:29,407
Explode

366
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:31,711
Not the whole thing obviously but I see

367
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:33,759
The mine roller in the hood

368
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,551
Separate from the vehicle and

369
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,111
They rolled over pressure plate ID

370
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,927
And then from then on

371
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:44,511
You know it was RPG Valley so it was Small Arms fire

372
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:47,327
Recoilless rifles mortars

373
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:51,679
Everything because once they took out that first truck we were stuck

374
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,983
Because you're all behind that truck

375
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:54,751
Correct

376
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,031
Yeah that's

377
00:19:56,287 --> 00:20:00,895
That's a technique that the Taliban had sort of adopted when the Soviets had invaded

378
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:03,455
Is Hino take out the first truck

379
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,991
Shoot up the last truck

380
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,295
And then everybody in The Middle's completely fuk

381
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:10,879
Darren Andrews had been in John's truck

382
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:11,903
The third track

383
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:14,719
John says Darren ran out to the first track

384
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:16,255
The one that just gotten blown up

385
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,791
To help the guys there

386
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:21,887
They set up what's called a casualty collection Point Littlefield trauma area

387
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:25,215
So many RPG started coming in

388
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:28,031
John says he watched Erin Andrews get killed

389
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:31,615
He watched Matt Martinez John's good friend who'd also been in his truck

390
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:35,455
That would die in a hospital in Germany a week later

391
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:39,551
John in the Gunner are inside the truck during the Ambush stuck there

392
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,855
Is Gunner is firing at whatever he can

393
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:46,463
And how about it like how long are you sitting there just like

394
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:49,023
Taking this attack

395
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,303
I think

396
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,607
I think the initial attack

397
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:54,655
Kick-off somewhere around 1500

398
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:59,263
And we didn't get back to mess till 0506

399
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:02,079
Oh my God you're out there all night

400
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:02,847
Yeah

401
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:03,871
Terrible

402
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,919
Oh man

403
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:08,735
I mean my Gunner and I just accepted it

404
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:12,831
I said am I sick and I think we're probably going to die tonight BC I think we are

405
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:16,672
So it was horrible the whole thing

406
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:17,952
People died

407
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,232
People were injured

408
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,536
Brass John again

409
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,840
How is any of this connected to Bo

410
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:27,424
And he said what we were always supposed to be looking

411
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:29,728
He said his platoon leader Darren Andrews

412
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:33,056
Didn't mention bow before they set off for pulao that day

413
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:35,616
But he did mention go back at 5 Sharona

414
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:38,176
A few days before they set off on the whole operation

415
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:43,552
I remember the 10 and Andrew saying you know if you hear or see

416
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:44,832
Any signs

417
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:45,856
A Bergdahl

418
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,904
We need to know about it

419
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:51,488
I mean and that was just the amendment to everything

420
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,792
They don't before any big push

421
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:59,680
And it wasn't it does also sounds like it wasn't terribly specific to any one mission

422
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,448
No

423
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:07,872
Got it okay now I'm beginning to understand why you could have a mission that is simultaneously not specific to birds

424
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,152
Doll and

425
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:11,456
Also involving Bergdahl

426
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,248
IC

427
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:19,648
It's hard it's hard cuz it's like an umbrella over everything you're doing exactly

428
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,440
It's the perfect way to describe it

429
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:25,280
So if you close the umbrella

430
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,560
Then

431
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:29,888
You can't make the argument it was looking for Bergdahl

432
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:30,656
Right

433
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,192
But if you open it you can

434
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:35,520
So it's just

435
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:41,664
Depends on who's living under the umbrella from my

436
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,248
From my small scope is specialist Thurmond III

437
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,040
I don't know

438
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,320
Who knows what

439
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,088
Above me

440
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:51,648
Right now I only know what I know

441
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:57,024
John told me it's totally possible this was a specific mission to look for bow

442
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,584
But that information just never filter down to him

443
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:04,192
John's Battalion Commander Lieutenant Colonel Clint Baker would probably know

444
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,728
I haven't been able to talk to him

445
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,544
But I did talk to his number two

446
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,592
Command sergeant major Ken Wolfe

447
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,200
He's out of the military now but at the time he was the highest NCO in the battalion

448
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:17,248
Who do the commanders in the privates

449
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,272
Cared about them

450
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:21,344
It took me quite a long time to persuade Ken to talk to

451
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:23,648
He has no love lost for bow

452
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:25,696
He thinks he's selfish plain and simple

453
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:26,720
Traitor to his unit

454
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:30,560
Finally after many emails and negotiations

455
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,608
Kant agreed on one condition

456
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,656
He wanted to be able to say this

457
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:37,984
The families who lost

458
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,032
Chun's

459
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,568
During this deployment

460
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:43,360
To let them know that

461
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,128
There

462
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,688
Their sons

463
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:48,224
Did not die

464
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,504
Looking

465
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:51,296
For PFC Bergdahl

466
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:54,624
Their son didn't die looking for him

467
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,928
Explain why

468
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:00,768
Why you're saying like why you know this to be true

469
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,072
Because

470
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,096
All you

471
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,888
All you got to do

472
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,424
Is look at a map

473
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,472
And look at a time frame

474
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:12,032
Okay I'm so time frame

475
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:18,688
Again the incidents that resulted in the six deaths in a battalion happened between August 18th and September

476
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:21,248
4/5 about two months after Bo left

477
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:24,064
We we we looked and we looked

478
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:24,832
And we look

479
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,392
And

480
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:30,720
But you can't

481
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:33,280
And this is where this is where it gets very difficult

482
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,840
For people to understand

483
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:43,520
Because you can never a new one in the army

484
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,544
Is ever going to say

485
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,080
We stopped looking for you

486
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:49,152
Right right

487
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,968
But

488
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:54,272
Here's a deal

489
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:58,880
You know it's it's been 45 + base

490
00:24:59,136 --> 00:24:59,904
At this point

491
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:04,256
We know where he's at In-N-Out is in Pakistan

492
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,536
All right

493
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:11,936
A vanilla unit like a five-oh-first is not leaving its battle space and going into Pakistan

494
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,472
Define vim

495
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,800
By look at a map

496
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:21,408
Because if anyone is going after bow in Pakistan will be a special forces team

497
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,200
Not an infantry unit

498
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:27,296
Of course they were going to keep their eyes and ears open

499
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:30,880
But if your commander you're balancing no man left behind

500
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:32,928
With some very practical matters

501
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:36,512
Your Intel regarding the dust one is drying up

502
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:39,072
You're unlikely to find him in Afghanistan anyway

503
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:41,376
There's an Afghan presidential election

504
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,144
Prepare for

505
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,168
Award win

506
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:46,496
So you're not sending your guys on search missions anymore

507
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:49,568
In terms of operations they needed to get back to work

508
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:53,920
Cancers that Palau Mission had nothing to do with bow

509
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:56,224
What some of the soldiers will say is

510
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,552
Okay maybe not directly but it's still connected to

511
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:02,368
Because the search for bow affected everything

512
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,184
They talk a lot about second and third order effects

513
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:07,488
A concept that's drilled into soldiers

514
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:09,792
But everything they do has consequences

515
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:11,072
Once or twice removed

516
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,144
Search change the course of their deployment

517
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,984
Change the landscape of their overall mission in a bunch of detrimental ways

518
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:20,032
Led to people dying

519
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,080
I put their argument to Ken

520
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:29,248
Well sure you know the September 4th Mission wasn't expressly only to go look for birds

521
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,016
Doll say

522
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:34,112
But because we had been out looking for him for the past 2 months

523
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:40,512
We had been making inroads in certain places and because we had to kind of pull away from that and focus on

524
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:46,144
Looking for him and we became much more kinetic we became more aggressive we are going into places we hadn't been before

525
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,680
We were stretched thin

526
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:50,752
That that it gave the insurgents a foothold

527
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:52,032
In places

528
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:58,432
You know where we are kind of kept them at Bay and now those places were more dangerous like that's one of the argument still make

529
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:01,760
Minnesota fair argument

530
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:04,320
It doesn't hold water because

531
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:07,648
You you you are in a very

532
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:08,928
Bad neighborhood

533
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,232
Regardless

534
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:13,024
You can get killed any day

535
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:13,792
I mean

536
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:15,840
If you

537
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:18,912
You could have you could have been on it on a random patrol

538
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:21,984
In Palau on the 29th

539
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:23,264
Of

540
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,288
June

541
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,568
And hit

542
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:28,896
Shania t as well so I mean I get it

543
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:33,248
However it you know it's just purely speculation

544
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,528
And hypothetical

545
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:41,184
Speculation and hypothetical toucan are Far Cry from say knowledge and understanding

546
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:47,072
Ken says there were so many factors factors beyond bow these soldiers are not taking into account

547
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:48,864
70 factors they aren't aware of

548
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:51,168
I'll give you a perfect example he said

549
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:55,520
And yet you told me this whole story about Yaya cow and the surrounding villages

550
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:59,616
Different factions have been in Conflict there since the early 1970s

551
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:03,456
Playlist in the Monarch kicking around the Communist sympathizers

552
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:07,040
Well and then when the communists come in

553
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,832
They check the Loyalists around

554
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:10,880
Well and then

555
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:13,696
When the Taliban comes in

556
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:17,024
They took the Communists around

557
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,816
And then when we come in

558
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,864
We took the Taliban out

559
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,168
So now they retaliate

560
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,960
Well some of these folks

561
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:28,032
They went across the border into Pakistan

562
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,592
Because they want to get kicked around

563
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:33,152
And then when they came back

564
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,944
They found that their houses

565
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,224
We're occupied

566
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:39,296
By the people who were kicking around right

567
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:41,088
Pirate show

568
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:43,392
They're they're angry

569
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:48,768
I just come back from Pakistan and when I left her 10 years ago this was my house and now you're living in it

570
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,072
Well there is no

571
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:53,632
You can't go down to the county courthouse

572
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:59,008
I'm sure Anna and pull up the deed that says this house belongs to me

573
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:01,312
So what are you do

574
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,104
You fight over it

575
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:04,384
Chode

576
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,176
It doesn't it didn't matter

577
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:08,736
That PFC Bergdahl

578
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:10,016
Walked off

579
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:13,856
There was a conflict that was so much deeper

580
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,136
Bergdahl

581
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:20,512
NM quite frankly so much more important than Bergdahl just to solve

582
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,816
Dev the problem

583
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,096
Impact eco

584
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:26,400
That these guys

585
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,680
They don't understand

586
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:33,312
The guys are making these arguments and it's not because you're bad guys

587
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:35,104
It's not MacArthur ill-informed

588
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,640
It's because

589
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,968
They aren't pretty

590
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:42,016
Did the same information

591
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,296
That I am

592
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,856
And here's the deal

593
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:50,208
The story I just told you you know how long it took me to learn that

594
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:51,744
Took me 9 months

595
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:54,560
Took me 9 months rolling in there

596
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:56,096
All the time

597
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:57,120
And Hawking

598
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:57,888
The people

599
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,168
Before

600
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:01,728
They laid that whole story out for me

601
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:05,824
Their mission is different than mine mission

602
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:10,432
My mission was to go out there and figure out what the problem is

603
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:13,760
Why Why everytime we roll through

604
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:15,552
This one place

605
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:16,832
We got blown up

606
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:20,672
Are the soldiers who see all of this differently

607
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:22,720
Ken doesn't begrudge them their perspective

608
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,792
He just wishes they hadn't been so public about it

609
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:31,936
Did these young men that are that are saying these things I love every one of them and every one of those guys know

610
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:32,704
I think him

611
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,800
Make him get ahold of me in and I'll do anything in the world for those guys they know that

612
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:39,616
What they're doing

613
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,664
I just don't think that

614
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:44,480
They thought it through

615
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,272
And

616
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:49,856
By not thinking it through they didn't understand the ramifications

617
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:52,160
Of their verbalization

618
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,952
What that was going to have

619
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:55,744
On on the families

620
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:59,328
Again Ken's not being protective of Bo here

621
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:01,632
He just thinks the record. To be set straight

622
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:04,448
He doesn't want the memories of the guys who died

623
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:06,496
To be dragged into the bergdoll morass

624
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:08,032
Three Sally buy it

625
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,312
Are the politics of it

626
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,872
I think it's not fair to those men

627
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:13,152
Or their families

628
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,088
Are you sure something else I've heard along the way

629
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:24,672
Maybe some of these guys think they were looking for Bo

630
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:28,768
But really their commanders were only using bow as an excuse

631
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:29,792
Top cover

632
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:33,632
To get extra assets to go kick in doors and RC East

633
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:39,008
We were actually looking for him there didn't come a point where he did just become an excuse to go out

634
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,592
And do things but

635
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:47,968
This is a guy I'm calling Scott he arrived in Afghanistan in ghazni in mid-july

636
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,552
His job was classified which is why he doesn't want to use his name

637
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:56,416
All I could say was that he was attached to an elite unit he said before about left

638
00:31:56,672 --> 00:32:00,512
In order for unit to leave the wire you had to have good actionable intelligence

639
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:07,680
But when when he disappeared. Does limits those thresholds for going

640
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:11,264
Hangout became much much lower so if you had

641
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:15,616
Very unreliable information about Bowe bergdahl's whereabouts

642
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:16,896
You can go anywhere

643
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:21,760
Just use him as an excuse to go wherever we wanted to go

644
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:24,832
How do you know that I mean you weren't there before

645
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:28,160
China Wok. So how do you know the threshold got lower

646
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:32,768
Because every other mission that we try to go on

647
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:34,816
That he

648
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:36,352
That didn't involve him

649
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,656
Was much more difficult to get out of

650
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:39,936
Get outside the wire on

651
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:42,496
So someone would say I think we need to go do ax

652
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:45,056
Forget it unless it involves

653
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:47,616
Yes

654
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:49,408
I mean I I sat through

655
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,200
Why briefings were

656
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,992
Missions were turned down

657
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,040
And I sat through

658
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:58,624
Live briefings were missions were accepted that probably shouldn't have been

659
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,648
Warfarin

660
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:01,952
So is this true

661
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:05,792
Were people just using the search as a way to get unrelated missions okayed

662
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:07,328
Or the way to scam assets

663
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:12,704
I asked and I asked and finally I found Lieutenant Colonel Paul Edgar

664
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:18,080
He was a guy in charge of managing the search for Belle he was operations officer for the Brigade

665
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:21,664
You're planning a mission for the five-oh-first and you wanted special assets

666
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,456
Usually aircraft or drones

667
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:24,992
You had to go through Paul

668
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,296
Around mid-august

669
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:31,392
I thought that there were a couple of requests from subordinate units that

670
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,440
That were

671
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:37,792
Taking advantage or attempting to take advantage a little bit of

672
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,584
Doing something else

673
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:42,656
In the name of looking for for Bowe Bergdahl

674
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,240
And when his team saw that they disapproved those missions

675
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:49,312
Also she didn't see rampant abuse or anything

676
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:51,872
He said it was more like a natural inclination

677
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:55,200
To try to sell your own mission spin your objectives

678
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:57,760
In a way that was going to be most persuasive to your bosses

679
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:03,904
For instance a couple of the people who helped plan missions lower down the company and Battalion level

680
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:08,512
Tell me that if you wanted extra support for operation in August or September say

681
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:10,560
You might sandwich bow in there

682
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:12,352
So the operation paperwork

683
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:15,168
Might well have included among other objectives

684
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:21,312
Language saying they were facilitating recovery of dust one or in support of dust One recovery operations

685
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,848
That's one meaning bow

686
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:26,688
If you had that you were more likely to get additional assets

687
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:27,712
The helicopter

688
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:29,504
On the other hand

689
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,856
To get approved in the first place you had to have actual Intel backing it up

690
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:38,720
Maybe it wasn't the strongest Intel but still it had to be legitimately connected to those whereabouts

691
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:43,328
And then on your mission you were actually question people about Beau

692
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:45,632
You can just invent something and get assets

693
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:48,192
Because first off that's just wrong

694
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:53,056
Resources are scarce and so you're very aware that if your getting use of an aircraft

695
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:55,104
Someone else who needs it just got denied

696
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:56,384
And second

697
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,432
If you try to manufacture a reason

698
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:00,992
Someone like Paul was going to catch it

699
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:07,904
A little cheating maybe little massaging

700
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,184
But not a scandal

701
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:14,560
But all this leads to another big question hovering over the search for Bo

702
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:19,168
By mid-july common sense told you what was probably in Pakistan

703
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:25,568
So why through August and into September are US soldiers still looking for a man Afghanistan at all

704
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,640
Why might an operation plan for September

705
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:32,992
Include a legitimate objective of facilitating recovery of the Dust one

706
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:34,784
When the dust one is long gone

707
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,576
Cross the border America Shah

708
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:44,512
Within two or three days of beau's disappearance news outlets were quoting Taliban sources saying those kidnapping was directed by

709
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:45,792
By Melissa Jean

710
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:48,608
Rose case would be referred to sirajudeen haqqani

711
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:50,400
Does guys operate in Pakistan

712
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:57,568
On July 20th right after the Taliban released the first Proof of Life video of bo ABC ran a story with the

713
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:01,408
Headline exclusive missing US soldier maybe in Pakistan

714
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:08,320
So then why were they still looking in Afghanistan 30 days later 60 days later and Beyond

715
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:12,160
Well first off Afghanistan's the only place they really can look

716
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:16,768
Since I can't go tromping into Pakistan Sovereign Nation Ally Etc

717
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,560
And Paul told me

718
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:24,192
Sure they sell those new stories in Pakistan and they had their own until that bow is in Pakistan

719
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:30,848
But they also had until just as persuasive that bow is in Afghanistan

720
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:34,176
Strong as a news report

721
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,200
Yes

722
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:37,248
Right okay

723
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:39,552
And I'm not and I'm not dissing news reports

724
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:43,136
Because sometimes sneezes

725
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:48,512
But if you see something on you know if I see something on on CNN International

726
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:50,304
And then

727
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:54,912
I go across the hallway to our Brigade intelligence cell

728
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:57,728
I ain't talked to a number of folks and

729
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:59,776
Overlay some different information

730
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:02,336
Am I suppose standing there

731
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:05,408
In front of an unknown land marker in

732
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,432
Pakistan

733
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:09,760
With today's newspaper or something like that

734
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:14,112
I'm going to looks very seriously and consider very seriously The credibility of

735
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:18,720
Of our information versus what what I read on CNN

736
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:22,816
Probability that Bo was in Pakistan wasn't enough

737
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:28,448
In fact Paul said his best guess was that boy was initially captured by some JV Taliban

738
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:31,776
And that rather than spiriting him across the border into Pakistan

739
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:37,664
The Taliban had sent a big cheese from Pakistan back into Afghanistan to handle the situation

740
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,480
DePaul wasn't at all convinced but wasn't still in Afghanistan

741
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,600
Army commanders are literal when they say they needed to know for a fact

742
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:48,672
That ball was in Pakistan before they would change course

743
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,768
General Flynn the guy who is mcchrystal's intelligence Chief at the time

744
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:54,048
Made this clear to me

745
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,656
If you're if you think probably a few weeks after like yeah he's probably empaques

746
00:37:58,912 --> 00:37:59,424
Stan

747
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:03,264
So what do you want me to say sorry you want me to say that we're going to give up on him

748
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:07,872
No I'm not going to say that I can sit here and we will never give up

749
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:11,200
You know you don't I mean you know something American

750
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:14,016
You know I'm going to hold out hope until

751
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:17,856
Until the last possible thing that we can

752
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:19,136
Potentially doing even

753
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:20,672
And we would even pull

754
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:23,232
Intelligence threads even after

755
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,256
Months

756
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:28,608
I mean I'm not I'm not a satisfied person

757
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:32,192
Even if you ever talked to an intelligence officer who says they're satisfied

758
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:33,472
There's

759
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:39,360
There's something we call bulletproof intelligence and and when you get bulletproof intelligence

760
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:41,920
That's rare that is rare

761
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:44,480
And even when you think your Intel is Bulletproof

762
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:45,504
You double check

763
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:50,112
Flynn says we've consistently underestimated our enemy in these wars

764
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:52,928
I use deception a lie effectively

765
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,512
We never got to 100% on his location

766
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:59,840
So the search for Bowen Afghanistan was never called off

767
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:02,912
Cuz again it's an army value and American value

768
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:06,496
But you don't give up on a Conrad who's falling into enemy hands

769
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:08,800
As one battalion officer said to me

770
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:10,080
Even if they're a dick head

771
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:11,616
You will do everything you can

772
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,432
But

773
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,712
One last word on this

774
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:19,040
Zoom out one level to the US Central Command

775
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:21,600
Because it wasn't just the Army calling the shots here

776
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:26,208
Centcom ultimately control defense department Assets in Afghanistan at the time

777
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,256
Planes helicopters drones

778
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:30,304
Predators with and without weapons attached

779
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:34,656
About two weeks after Bo was captured so mid-july

780
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:37,728
A ground-level analysts at centcom inform the boss

781
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,520
We think he's in Pakistan

782
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,824
But this analyst

783
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,872
You can't write that in your assessment

784
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:46,176
Not unless you have bomb-proof evidence

785
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:48,992
Meaning to Independent corroborated sources

786
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:52,320
Which is not the normal standard for an Intel assessment

787
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:58,720
Rather that's the standard usually reserved for Recovery Mission say when you're actually sending people into Harm's Way

788
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:01,024
Not for an Intel assessment

789
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:04,864
But in this case they weren't allowed to put it in a report so they didn't

790
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,656
They waited another thirty

791
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:10,496
40 days or so till sometime in late August early September

792
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:17,152
Which meant the intensity of the search for bow remain high in Afghanistan for several more weeks rather than

793
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:18,432
Tapering off in mid July

794
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,528
My source wasn't sure why they weren't allowed to call it earlier

795
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:28,928
Maybe because this was an unprecedented situation nobody exactly knew the implications tactic

796
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:30,976
Play strategically politically

797
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:36,608
A saying a US Soldier was being held in Pakistan for the dod had no Authority

798
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:41,984
Lieutenant Colonel Mike Waltz

799
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,520
The Special Forces Commander

800
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:46,592
Was one of the people who went on TV very early on

801
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:48,640
And said people died looking for Bo

802
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:51,712
Men died searching for

803
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:55,040
Sergeant Bergdahl and when we believed at the time

804
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:56,320
It's the short-handed

805
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:58,624
Is stating it as a nuanced fact

806
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,904
But I have trouble with

807
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:03,744
It seems Reckless to throw around something like that without solid cause

808
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:05,792
If you press for the evidence

809
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:09,376
Mike and others will argue on the basis of second and third order effects

810
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:13,728
So many resources were diverted to look for bow

811
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:16,544
Depriving other units resulting in fatality

812
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:19,872
On July 4th just a few days after Bo walked

813
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:23,200
There's a big attack in an outpost in Peck Tikka called Ciroc

814
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:24,736
Which two mortar men died

815
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,296
Maybe it would have gone down the way it did

816
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:29,600
They had the Intel aircraft a task for

817
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:30,880
Intel aircraft

818
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:32,416
Tied up in the search for Bo

819
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:38,048
In early October another big attack on a nopi located hundreds of miles north of Pact

820
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:40,096
8 Americans were killed

821
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:44,448
It happened three months after Bo left but is also been linked to him

822
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:49,056
Plans to shut down that Opie which is considered vulnerable I've been delayed

823
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,848
Partly because of starch

824
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:54,687
When I interviewed Mike Waltz I pushed him on this

825
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,991
The causality here is tenuous

826
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:58,783
So why are people saying it

827
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:03,647
And he said look directly or indirectly killed or almost killed

828
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:04,927
Why are we parsing this

829
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:09,023
There were real consequences to what bow did why can't we talk about that

830
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:13,375
Which made me realize this is the root of what these guys are saying

831
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:15,935
What they've been saying since the day bow got traded

832
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:16,959
And that is

833
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:19,007
Don't tell me it's over his back

834
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:20,287
No harm no foul

835
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:27,199
You can spend I think the rest of Eternity parsing well it was a supply run to the base at Salerno I'm was

836
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:30,527
That indirectly yeah that was ICD-10 was that related or not

837
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:33,343
But like I mean for that period of time

838
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,135
That's all we were doing

839
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:36,927
And it if you were hurt

840
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:40,767
Injured I listen to it on the radio people being met of act

841
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:42,047
During ambushes

842
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:44,351
From tcp's that they had set up

843
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:46,911
Trying to find Bergdahl

844
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:53,311
My own soldiers barely escaped death from from essentially an ambush

845
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:59,199
Based on it that was set up based on information looking for Bergdahl I'm absolutely adamant my mind

846
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:03,039
That soldiers were either put In Harm's Way or were harmed looking for him

847
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:04,575
And

848
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:07,391
Thought I'd sorry I'm a I do get a bit

849
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:11,999
Not emotional but I I

850
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:14,047
Couldn't push back more forcefully

851
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:14,815
That

852
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:17,631
That his actions just had no effect

853
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:23,263
And so the notion that it didn't really affect the election there didn't really do that much

854
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:25,567
I think it's just a

855
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:27,359
It's just absolutely untrue

856
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:33,503
I think it's a stretch too far to say people were killed looking for bow or because of bow

857
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:37,087
But that's not to say there weren't major consequences

858
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:42,719
Per month or six weeks the shape and mood of the war end of the US mission in Regional command East

859
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:43,743
Changed

860
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:45,535
Resources were diverted

861
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:50,655
People stop doing some of the arguably constructive things they were doing to look for bow

862
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:53,215
And people suffered looking for Bo

863
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:55,775
They suffered psychologically and physically

864
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:57,567
A couple of cases severely

865
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:02,943
In September a Navy SEAL named Jimmy hatch went on CNN and talk to Anderson Cooper

866
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:07,551
Hatch said he was part of the team that flew to helicopters into a compound

867
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:09,087
On the night of July 9th

868
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:13,695
Qasidah immediately deal with a pre-major gunfight

869
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:16,767
And at that point what's the what's the goal

870
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,815
Goes to get that kid

871
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,607
Find GoPro.

872
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:22,911
Fast and we were close

873
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,703
Cuz things started right away

874
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:29,567
Hatch didn't want to talk to me but I spoke to another person who was on the mission

875
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:31,103
Do backed up hatches story

876
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:33,663
That they had information but was there

877
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:34,687
And that's why they went

878
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:36,991
It turned out but wasn't there

879
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:39,295
A lot of Taliban were killed in the fighting

880
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:42,623
Hatch was shot just above the right knee is bone was shattered

881
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:45,951
In the CNN story he talks about how he became depressed

882
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:46,975
Suicidal

883
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:50,303
One day earlier on July 8th

884
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:56,191
Sergeant First Class Mark Allen was with the National Guard team going door-to-door in a village Indila District

885
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:57,215
South of mass

886
00:44:57,471 --> 00:45:02,335
There were a handful of Americans who happen to go along with a platoon of Afghan National army soldiers

887
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:04,127
Their Commander had offered them up

888
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:08,735
We spoke to the commander as well as one of the other guys on that mission

889
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:11,039
And they both said yeah it was clear

890
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:13,087
The mission was to look for bow

891
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,647
Which considering the date just a week out

892
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:16,671
It makes sense

893
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:18,207
They got attacked

894
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:21,023
One soldier his right hand was badly wounded

895
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:23,583
Emetic took shrapnel shot in the hip

896
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:25,887
Mark Allen was shot in the head

897
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:28,447
He survived but he's in a wheelchair

898
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,727
He can't walk or talk

899
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:31,519
He's got a wife and two kids

900
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:33,567
It's been awful for all of them

901
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:34,335
Obviously

902
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:39,967
So yes during the search for Bo people were very seriously injured

903
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:43,551
In ways that permanently mess with their lives mess with their families

904
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:49,951
What are the charges against Bo is that he endanger the safety of other soldiers and rawnsley cause search and Recovery

905
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:50,719
Operations

906
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:52,511
Be convicted of that

907
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:53,535
He'll be punished

908
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:57,631
Punishment is very different from blame

909
00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:59,423
Flame is more delicate

910
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:01,471
It comes up almost always

911
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:03,775
In my conversations about bow with

912
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:07,359
Soldiers commanders civilians diplomats everybody really

913
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:08,895
And it can be slippery

914
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:10,943
Pecan Lodge where it shouldn't

915
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:12,991
And it can skirt where not to stay

916
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:17,855
When I was talking to Ken wolfos former command sergeant major

917
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:22,463
Going to the list of names of men from the five-oh-first who died during that deployment

918
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:26,303
Ken was explaining no BS or not to do with bow

919
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:29,119
But he stopped short when we got to the name Kurt Curtis

920
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:32,191
Cancel that one he partly blames himself

921
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:34,495
Was a firefight in a medical clinic

922
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:38,591
They're going after a Taliban guy who committed some really brutal crimes apparently

923
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:41,663
Staff sergeant Kurt Curtis was shot and killed

924
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:45,503
Curtis was supposed to work from the base in Alaska

925
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:49,599
But Ken told him our numbers are low I need you to deploy to Afghanistan

926
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:53,439
Curtis is married he been on something like for deployments already

927
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:54,463
Where the most guys

928
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:56,255
Prasad okay

929
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:57,279
I'll do it

930
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:58,815
In late August

931
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:02,655
Curtis was on the quick reaction team that was called out to the medical clinic

932
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:04,447
And a town called star hausa

933
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:08,031
Can wolves have been to that clinic many times he toured it

934
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:10,335
He said the people in the town had a lot of pride in it

935
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:13,151
So he knew the layout better than anyone

936
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:16,479
And Ken said before Curtis and the other guys went out there

937
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:17,503
They were briefed

938
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:20,063
On how the road was where the trouble spots were

939
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:22,623
I did not tell them

940
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:25,695
And this is what haunts me to this day cuz

941
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:28,255
I just didn't think about it

942
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,863
There's this Clinic is two parts

943
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:37,983
What's inside a wall compound like most places in that part of the world

944
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:39,775
In

945
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:43,615
So you had, like the inpatient outpatient side

946
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:45,151
And I never

947
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:46,943
Hold these guys

948
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:50,015
That it was really two different buildings

949
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:51,551
And

950
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:54,879
Today they went in with the Afghan

951
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:55,903
Police

952
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:58,463
Give me a went to the first one

953
00:47:58,719 --> 00:47:59,999
No issues

954
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:01,791
And they went in a second one

955
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:03,583
End

956
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:06,655
Church rummage

957
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:07,935
Was ambushed

958
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:09,471
When he went in that building

959
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:11,775
The second building with it along with the squad

960
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:13,311
Panda

961
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:15,871
And was killed there that day

962
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:24,063
But why would it have mattered if they had known they were two buildings like why does that part on you

963
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:26,879
Their tactical plan would have changed

964
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:29,951
And maybe Kurt wouldn't have died

965
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:30,719
Is what he saying

966
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:33,023
That's why Ken's haunted by it

967
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:34,815
And John Thurman

968
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:37,119
He feels guilt about what happened in Palau

969
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:39,679
It's hard for him to talk about the guys who got killed there

970
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:42,239
One of them Matthew Martinez

971
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:44,799
Was a radiotelephone operator like John

972
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:47,871
But that day John was the driver instead

973
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:49,407
Which means you stay in the truck

974
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:51,455
Darren Andrews their platoon leader

975
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:54,783
I called Martinez out of the truck to help when the attack happened

976
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:57,599
Because Matt was RTO that day not John

977
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:59,391
And that was just by chance

978
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:04,511
Yeah and it was actually we were drawing straws and I had drawn the longest straw on that one

979
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:09,119
Are you literally Drew star-like not metaphorically like you actually Drew straws

980
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:10,399
Oh

981
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:13,215
Yeah so that's why that one's been

982
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:13,983
Pretty hard

983
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:15,775
For really long time

984
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:22,175
John is the son of Air Force veterans who grew up in Texas and Washington State

985
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:25,759
Dance Cotillion and was a competitive figure skater as a tiger

986
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:27,551
In 2007

987
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:29,343
When he was a fresh 21 years old

988
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,135
If something is up to no good or anything

989
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:32,671
You're selling shoes at Nordstrom

990
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:34,975
And he learned a lot about shoes

991
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:37,791
But that was not the direction he wanted his life to take

992
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:38,815
So we join the Army

993
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:41,119
I'm not even sure why I'm telling you this

994
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:43,679
Except to remind you to remind me

995
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:47,775
That these guys who deployed to war zones are so young

996
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:49,311
And then they're traumatized

997
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:51,103
All of them pretty much

998
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,127
It sucks

999
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:56,223
It's not John's fault that Matt Martinez died

1000
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:58,783
It's not kids fault that Kurt Curtis died

1001
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:01,343
In the five-oh-first

1002
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:03,391
Clay Bowen and Maurice Walker

1003
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:09,279
They were doing election crap on August 18th 2009 when their vehicle ran over an ID

1004
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:10,303
They were both killed

1005
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:12,351
They were in an armored Humvee

1006
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:13,887
Not an mrap

1007
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:15,167
Which writer protected them

1008
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:19,007
Who's to blame for that every time Commander

1009
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:21,055
Then-defense secretary Robert Gates

1010
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:22,335
President Obama

1011
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:26,687
You just want to blame something or somebody

1012
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:30,271
I blame the Taliban

1013
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:31,807
You know

1014
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,087
Yeah

1015
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:35,647
That's Risa joglar

1016
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:36,927
Claiborne's mother

1017
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:40,767
When I first talked to John Thurman

1018
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:41,791
Last August

1019
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:44,351
He blamed for the deaths in the five-oh-first

1020
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:48,191
About the time we had this conversation 5 6 months later

1021
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:49,215
Kid movies off of that

1022
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:51,519
Not toward Clarity exactly

1023
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:53,311
And I blame

1024
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:54,591
I blame

1025
00:50:58,687 --> 00:51:00,223
I mean you can point the blame on anybody

1026
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:01,503
Sometimes I

1027
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:03,551
I don't know

1028
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:07,135
Sorry

1029
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:08,415
Sometimes I just think

1030
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:12,255
Where's one of those things that

1031
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,535
It's hard to pin down

1032
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:14,815
Who's responsible

1033
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:21,215
I know and I feel like that seat that sounds like a cop-out

1034
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:23,007
But now it now it's not

1035
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:26,591
And I've done a ton of therapy on it and I still haven't

1036
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:27,359
Yeah

1037
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:28,127
I meant like

1038
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:30,943
75% sense of it but

1039
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:34,015
I still can't get that last 25

1040
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:36,063
Cuz it's you know you start playing with variables

1041
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:37,087
You know what else

1042
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:39,647
And that's where you can drive yourself insane

1043
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:42,719
These things happen in war

1044
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:43,743
It's normal

1045
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:50,143
I was talking to retired lieutenant colonel Paul Edgar former brigade-level officer who managed the search for Bo

1046
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:51,935
And he said something that surprised me

1047
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:55,263
He said oh is also normal in war

1048
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:57,823
As a society we treat bow

1049
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:02,943
Yeah it's some aberration when really he's

1050
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:03,711
He is

1051
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:05,759
His case is simply

1052
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:07,551
A very normal parts

1053
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:09,343
Of War

1054
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:12,159
Paul said we signed up for Afghanistan

1055
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:17,279
Not every single citizen obviously but as a country reeling from the September 11th attacks

1056
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:20,863
Nobody put up too much of a fuss about going after Osama bin Laden

1057
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:27,519
But when we signed up we were also signing up for all the things we tend to forget but that nevertheless attend

1058
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:28,287
War

1059
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:29,311
Mistakes

1060
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:30,079
Accidents

1061
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:33,151
People dying for a voidable or even ridiculous reasons

1062
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:37,247
An Army Recruiting system that lowers its standards when it needs more bodies

1063
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:39,039
20-something year olds

1064
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:40,831
Who quickly become disillusioned

1065
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:42,879
And do something rash or Criminal

1066
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:44,415
It's all

1067
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:46,207
Unfortunately normal

1068
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:53,119
So there's a level of responsibility here whether it's you know whether it's Bo and his particulars or the things the back

1069
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:56,703
That goes along with every single one

1070
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:59,519
That we signed up for society

1071
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:02,335
Going to take all of that independent

1072
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:04,383
Politically and otherwise

1073
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:08,223
On you know this 20 year old

1074
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:10,783
Is in my opinion

1075
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:13,599
Very very wrong

1076
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:26,399
Movie first teamed up with Mark Bowl for the story Mark had just come to the end of his own X

1077
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:27,935
Extensive reporting on bow

1078
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:31,263
And I wanted to know if there was anything Mark still wondered about

1079
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:33,311
Any outstanding questions he had

1080
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:35,615
And he said yeah he did have one

1081
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:39,455
I think the biggest question I have is what the

1082
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:41,247
Appropriate

1083
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:43,039
Punishment for what he did

1084
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:45,343
And like how do you treat

1085
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:46,623
How do you treat this

1086
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:49,439
This guy who after all it was

1087
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:52,255
Put through the wringer by the Taliban because he was

1088
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:53,535
An American Soldier

1089
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:57,887
Is there some recognition that

1090
00:53:58,143 --> 00:54:00,703
That he was coming from a from a place which is

1091
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:02,495
Basically altruistic

1092
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:05,055
Maybe self-serving to but

1093
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:06,335
Certainly not

1094
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:09,407
You know intending to cause harm

1095
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:13,759
So I don't know I guess the question about how the country ultimately views him

1096
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:17,855
Is interesting to me because it it speaks to

1097
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:22,463
I think our in our capacity for forgiveness in some ways and also

1098
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:23,999
The other kind of

1099
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:26,559
I think the ambivalence about bow

1100
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:29,887
Somewhat reflects the another larger confusion about

1101
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:30,655
War

1102
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:33,215
The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan

1103
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:38,079
Because we don't think of them like World War II the quote-unquote good War

1104
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:41,151
Or like Vietnam a lot of circles a bad War

1105
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:43,199
So what are these worth

1106
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:46,527
Because there's just like this incredible

1107
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:52,159
Like Haze over our thinking about the war on terror and because these were 16th

1108
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:53,695
Biso

1109
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:54,463
You know

1110
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:55,743
Hard to Define

1111
00:54:57,791 --> 00:55:00,351
It seems like as a country we don't know what to do with this guy

1112
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:05,727
A few weeks ago Zach borrow one of those between mates got in touch with us

1113
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:08,031
I also interviewed Zach back in the summer

1114
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:10,335
But now she wanted to say something else

1115
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:13,663
He been listening to the podcast and it was bothering him

1116
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:15,455
The bone might be listening to

1117
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:17,759
Getting the idea that everyone was mad at him

1118
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:19,551
Zach was mad at first

1119
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:21,599
You said it was kinda easier to be mad

1120
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:25,439
You going to any military website everyone's angry with bow

1121
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:29,023
You see your friends on TV talking about all the bad stuff Bo did

1122
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:30,815
Can you get it why they're mad

1123
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:34,655
But after he thought it through Zack said he realized

1124
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:37,215
I was not what he was mad about

1125
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:40,031
I just become a kind of Repository

1126
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:41,823
Maybe like we're

1127
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:46,687
Holding on to all this stuff and wanting to punish this kid for stuff that

1128
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:48,479
Yeah

1129
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:51,551
We are all the bad situation bad stuff happens

1130
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:53,855
Yes

1131
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:56,927
Added to

1132
00:55:57,695 --> 00:56:00,767
The bad situation but I don't think maybe

1133
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:03,327
As much as

1134
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:04,863
People blame

1135
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:05,887
Sometimes

1136
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:09,471
I mean it was going to suck no matter what

1137
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:12,543
I feel like he's a young guy

1138
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:14,591
It was in a really stressful place

1139
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:16,639
And he made a terrible mistake

1140
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:18,687
And

1141
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:21,247
I don't know maybe we just

1142
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:25,599
For myself I guess maybe I can accept that

1143
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:28,671
I can understand that

1144
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:30,463
When you're young

1145
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:32,767
And you're dumb obviously I didn't make that

1146
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:35,071
But I can see how it happened

1147
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:36,095
People

1148
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:41,983
Another platoon made Austin Lanford told me he decided not to blame go anymore either

1149
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:46,335
He said when he was in Afghanistan he had crazy thoughts sometimes too

1150
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:48,383
He said I hated it over there

1151
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:51,199
I wanted to leave extremely bad sometimes

1152
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:53,247
He said that could have been me

1153
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:59,135
The Army gave us some numbers

1154
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:05,791
From 2001 to 2014 more than 3500 people were convicted of being a wall

1155
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:07,327
980 of those

1156
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:08,863
Were convicted of desertion

1157
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:13,215
Most of those happened here in the US people not showing up their bases for example

1158
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:16,287
But there have been cases not unlike bows

1159
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:21,407
Military therapist told us about a guy who left his fob in Kandahar in 2012

1160
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:23,711
Apparently trying to walk to an outpost

1161
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:25,247
Rejoin his platoon

1162
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:27,807
Turn the reverse of what Bo said he was planning

1163
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:30,623
He was quickly picked up by asking please

1164
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:32,159
Wasn't charged with anything

1165
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:36,255
And in 2010 8 months after Bo disappeared

1166
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:38,815
A young Soldier sneaked off fob sharana

1167
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:39,839
At 3 a.m.

1168
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:43,423
About 7 hours later Afghan police found him wandering around

1169
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:45,215
They handed him back over to the Army

1170
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:49,311
When is kid was questioned evidently he said he planned to walk to Eastern Europe

1171
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:52,895
Get a sleeping bag first aid kit food and water sunscreen

1172
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:58,783
An ornamental sword and ornamental battle-axe his journal and an English to Pashto translation guide

1173
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:03,647
According to an army report he quote plan to make it look like you have been kidnapped on quote

1174
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:05,183
Kid cut his left hand

1175
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:09,791
And left a trail of blood from his bunk to the fence line of the fob then cut his way through the fence

1176
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:14,655
You haven't heard of him because he didn't get kidnapped by Taliban

1177
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:18,239
Because he wasn't declared us one because there was no search

1178
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:22,591
You haven't heard of him because no one noticed he was even gone until the Afghan police called

1179
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:26,943
You haven't heard of him because we didn't trade Five Guys out of Guantanamo Bay

1180
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:27,711
To get them back

1181
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:30,783
We talked to someone in this guy's command group

1182
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:35,647
You told us as a group they sat down and they talked about what to do about the soldier

1183
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:40,511
Which gained a lot of publicity this is very low key

1184
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:43,839
Didn't make the news so there was no pressure from anybody hire

1185
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:47,423
The kid wasn't charged with any crimes

1186
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:48,959
The guy from the command told us

1187
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:51,263
He was sent home to get the help he needed

1188
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:54,591
About a year later he was medically retired from the Army

1189
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:59,455
Military therapist we talked you said these soldiers who walk off

1190
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:00,735
Into Afghanistan

1191
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:02,783
The Army treats them as headcases

1192
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:05,855
It's so dangerous you kind of have to be crazy to do it

1193
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:07,135
Art suicidal

1194
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:09,183
He compared them to astronauts

1195
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:10,975
Taking off their helmets in space

1196
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:23,007
Bose court-martial is scheduled to start in August but right now the proceedings are stayed

1197
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:29,407
Because the defense in the government are fighting over this massive Trove of classified documents more than 300,000 page

1198
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:30,175
Because apparently

1199
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:31,711
Who knows what's in there

1200
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:35,551
So it seems very unlikely to me that anything's going to start this summer

1201
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:40,159
I want to recordings of Mark and there's this part where Beau explains

1202
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:45,791
The most the time he was a prisoner just dealing with the day-to-day his mind felt kind of numb

1203
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:48,607
But then he said there were a couple of times

1204
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:49,631
Brief moments

1205
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:51,679
When he got this surge

1206
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:53,215
I can't breathe for a second

1207
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:56,799
One of those times he said was during his first year

1208
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:58,591
He was being held in a mud compound

1209
00:59:58,847 --> 01:00:00,127
The one where he said he made friends with

1210
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:02,687
The dog and had tried to Tunnel himself out

1211
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:05,247
When I managed to slip outside

1212
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:06,527
Into the courtyard

1213
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:07,807
And he looked up

1214
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:15,999
Anything like that

1215
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:36,479
Things went so far beyond me

1216
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:38,015
Yeah

1217
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:44,415
It is just that relief of knowing that the stupidity doesn't go any further than that

1218
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:58,751
Then it's almost like you don't have to be scared

1219
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:08,479
Mark still talks about occasionally not as much as he used to

1220
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:12,575
Mark says there isn't much more to say until the military settles Bose case

1221
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:16,671
When the Army are adversaries legally speaking

1222
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:18,463
Still a soldier

1223
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:20,511
As soon as he was rescued

1224
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:22,303
Somewhere in a government office

1225
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:25,887
Someone filled out a department of the army form for 187

1226
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:27,935
Play Change post status

1227
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:29,215
I'm missing captured

1228
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:30,495
Present for Duty

1229
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:37,663
After knocking down this huge long Serpentine geopolitical Dominos

1230
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:41,247
What was assigned to an office job on his base in San Antonio

1231
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:46,879
He's fighting the charges against him which means he waits a lot longer than he thought he'd have to

1232
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:47,647
But

1233
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:50,463
Waiting is something Bo knows how to do

1234
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:05,567
Cereals produced by Julie Schneider

1235
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:11,967
Saturday night trivia send me in partnership with Mark Bowl Megan Ellison Hugo Lindgren Jessica Weisberg page one and a predicate

1236
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:19,135
Alright every episode for the past ten weeks I've spun through the credits pretty fast because none of you really good to him

1237
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:20,927
Credits my wrong

1238
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:27,327
But I do I care so much and if you listen to this whole story I'm telling you you do care

1239
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:33,727
I just don't know it this reporting project was enormous but it's always me talking so what you don't know is

1240
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:40,127
Entire sections of the story or doggedly and expertly reported by Dana Chavez

1241
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:46,527
And then Kevin Garnett and Whitney Dangerfield they also hunted down so much information really interesting stuff

1242
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:52,927
The I don't even know to look for Ira Glass sat in on endless edits no matter when they fell even if he was in

1243
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:59,327
