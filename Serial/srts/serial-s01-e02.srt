Debbie Milligan I can say is just a normal day

8
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:16,640
Nothing abnormal.

9
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:19,200
She was concerned

10
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:25,600
Questions about an affidavit

11
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:31,232

Stop

22
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:07,584
Go back to the beginning we're telling this story in order the story of Haman Lee

23
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,168
An 18 year old girl who was killed in Baltimore in 1999

24
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,216
In the story of Adnan Syed

25
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:15,008
Her ex-boyfriend who is convicted of

26
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:15,776
Crime

27
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:18,080
Pick up where we left off

28
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:23,456
Last episode you heard how the prosecution told the story of this murder at a nun's trial

29
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:27,040
The motive the state supplied the basis for the whole thing

30
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:29,344
Was it after he broke up with a nun

31
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,624
She couldn't accept it

32
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,440
He was so wounded by her and so Furious

33
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,720
That he decided to kill her

34
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:39,328
Prosecutor Kevin urick told the jury in his opening statement

35
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:41,120
He became enraged

36
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:43,680
He felt betrayed that his honor has been besmirched

37
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,216
I became very angry

38
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,264
And he set out to kill Hae Min Lee

39
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:51,616
Or this is from closing quote it was humiliating what she did to him

40
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,920
Make no mistake about it ladies and gentlemen

41
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,712
This is not a crime about love

42
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:57,248
This is a crime about Pride

43
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:02,368
Is that what their relationship and breakup were really like

44
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,024
Was he so hurt that he decided to kill her that's what I'm trying to find out in today's episode by talking to lots of people

45
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,424
Close knit group known each other since elementary

46
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,984
High school and even though they went to a big house

47
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,008
High School

48
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:23,872
And their friends were come together in a magnet program of about 30 kids

49
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:30,272
High School within the school and they all took classes together and hang out together and they dated each other so we knew each other well

50
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:37,440
Any other information I have to go on our Hayes own words about their relationship because I have a copy of her diary

51
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:41,536
It was entered into evidence at trial cops prosecutors

52
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:42,816
Even at 9

53
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:49,728
What's remarkable about the diary and what makes it so helpful is that it's essentially a Chronicle of the oven on era of his life

54
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,592
The first entry is April 1st 1998 when they started going out

55
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:59,200
And the last entry is dated January 12th the day before she went missing

56
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:02,784
Is it not

57
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:09,952
And then another one right at the end

58
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,512
The first dance was junior prom

59
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:16,096
Anonymous best friend had a little competition going about who could get

60
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,632
Prettiest prom date that year

61
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:19,936
K2 go

62
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:23,264
After Sports practice on the little hill behind the school

63
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,056
He asked her to prom and she said yes

64
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,408
On April 27th she wrote a long entry in her diary about prom night

65
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,760
Her diary by the way I'm not exactly sure what I expected her diary to be like

66
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:36,320
It's such a teenage girl's diary

67
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,880
She jumps from her boyfriend to driver's ed

68
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:39,904
The field hockey game

69
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,720
She probably one minute and the next she's upset with her mother

70
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,512
Protecting her friend are complaining about homework

71
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,120
Prom night

72
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,656
She writes about Adnan

73
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:53,216
I swear he's the sweetest guy

74
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,240
Let me tell you why

75
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,520
She was prompt

76
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,568
Stephanie was prom princess

77
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,360
A traditionally they're supposed to dance

78
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,896
Together to my song

79
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,688
KC and JoJo All My Life

80
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,992
I tried to act natural and I'm jealous

81
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,856
10 seconds later guess who danced with me and not was

82
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,136
Anon

83
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,184
How can I not fall in love with

84
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,232
Of course I gave him his first

85
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,000
Kiss on the lips

86
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,791
And I totally fell in love with her

87
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:21,119
Since then I keep on falling deeper and deeper into him

88
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,679
The bad thing is that we have to keep things secret

89
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:24,703
Psy

90
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,727
But it's okay

91
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:26,751
Love conquers all

92
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:37,247
For a while I would like to know today were flaring and I will like make fun of her about it

93
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,295
Does Aisha Pittman

94
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,087
She was in the magnet program to

95
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,623
He was her best friend

96
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,951
You look show me nudes that they share it and then it just

97
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,719
Progressed from

98
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,999
From there

99
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:52,095
And but it was it was a relationship that sconce

100
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,631
Bentley secret because neither there

101
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,167
Families knew about it so that

102
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,007
Created much more of a lake

103
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:02,079
Her saying I'm going to be at your house but really I'm going out with him

104
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,615
Kind of thing

105
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:06,175
Oh she would she would tell her parents you that your play

106
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:07,967
Or others

107
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,271
Primarily mine

108
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:14,111
Just a lot of that sort of secrecy around

109
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:15,903
We had a lot of

110
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:16,671
I guess

111
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,463
A lot of real similar

112
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:21,279
Similar type of situations with our families

113
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:26,143
Since he and I both had immigrant parents they understood the expectations

114
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,423
And the constraints

115
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:30,751
Go to college take care of your younger brother

116
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,799
And Ferdinand no girls

117
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:37,919
If a female friend run his car for instance you have to make sure not to leave any longhairs behind

118
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,223
Where's a girl gave Adnan a ride home

119
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,015
You have to drop him off down the block

120
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:44,319
So his parents wouldn't see who is at the wheel

121
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,111
You know it was really easy

122
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,647
To date someone

123
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:51,999
That kind of living in the same parameters that I did with regards to you though

124
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,279
Speed in a vacuum

125
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,839
Location of me coming to her house for dinner with her family

126
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,887
You know she understood that

127
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,423
You know that

128
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,215
Call the house

129
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,775
My mother and father I would get in trouble

130
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,799
Vice versa

131
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:07,359
You know so we would have to come and set up our

132
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,199
Well Repair in your sleep

133
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,759
They had a whole system for this

134
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,575
Clear

135
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:19,391
Remember it's 1998 so not many cell phones around

136
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:22,207
Then that person would call someone 800 service

137
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:28,607
What's the weather or the time and the other one would call in so that the phone wouldn't actually rang it would come in through call waiting

138
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,911
And the dosing parents would never be the wiser

139
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:40,127
At the trial the state tried to paint a picture of an odd as possessive of hay

140
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,407
Controlling

141
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:47,807
When I spoke to his closest friends about that a couple of them did say that he over involved

142
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:48,831
Somehow

143
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,135
But I couldn't come up with many examples

144
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:58,303
Do people remember the time when it done showed up uninvited to a girls trip to an amusement park Aisha Pittman was one of them

145
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:01,887
She remembers nothing positive about their relationship anymore

146
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:05,727
Go by your own admission she doesn't know whether her memories are colored by what came later

147
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:09,567
I think it was probably mostly normal but things that

148
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:12,895
He kind of just always generally annoyed me because

149
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:13,663
Just

150
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,431
The constant

151
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,199
Paging

152
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,735
If you was out

153
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,807
He's like what I just wanted to know where you were in

154
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:20,831
I told you

155
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,367
Clear Eyes going to be

156
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,695
She was at my house and we were having a girl's night he

157
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,999
Would stop by like it would walk over and try to

158
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:28,767
Come hang out

159
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,327
Have some space

160
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:37,983
And it's one of those things at first it's like oh it's so cute your boyfriend is dropping by

161
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,519
The temp time it's like

162
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,287
Really

163
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,359
Did he ever did hey ever seen freaked out by it

164
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:47,967
No but I don't think I was ever freaked out by it in the moment

165
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:52,319
Impromptu visits I was talking about

166
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,367
On July 16th she writes

167
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:57,183
Carrot cake

168
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:00,767
So yeah he does not describe a nun as overbearing

169
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,047
Are possessive in her diary

170
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:04,607
Though she does mention a couple of moments when she's mad at

171
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,911
How dare you get mad at me

172
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,191
Replying to hang with Keisha

173
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,287
The time when he was nasty to her because she didn't respond to his messages

174
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,615
Mostly these incidents seem to be

175
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,383
Frittata

176
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,455
Attitude is not helping

177
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,223
Wright's engine

178
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:24,831
He hasn't called me since 12:30 this afternoon and it's definitely pushing me to the edge

179
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,111
I think I'm going to pick up

180
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,207
His friends say she had a strong personality

181
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,231
Strong opinions

182
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,255
She's no pushover

183
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,303
She's pissing on she let him know

184
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:38,655
But by far the majority of her diary entries are about how much she likes

185
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,423
And loves him

186
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,983
I stopped counting there was so many wonderful things

187
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:44,031
Sweetest sin best boyfriend in the world

188
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,079
Stuff like this from their fur

189
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,615
Here's Becky Klein

190
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,151
Back then she was Becky Walker

191
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:53,247
This is silly teenage High School relationship I remember

192
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,527
A lot of

193
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,831
Teasing and a lot of

194
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,623
You know

195
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,927
Hand holding arms around each other

196
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,743
I don't really remember any

197
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,791
Anything weirder

198
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,327
Anything that stands out

199
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,143
Around all that summer before senior year

200
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,191
After work and drive around

201
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:14,495
They were 17 they're in love

202
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,775
They were active

203
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,335
They have sex whenever and wherever possible

204
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,639
Sometimes at motels are in the car

205
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,687
Parker other people's houses are part

206
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:25,503
Sometimes they fight quickly makeup

207
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:28,063
A couple of times he called it off

208
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,599
But then would ask for a

209
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,367
Saturday

210
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:37,791
Remember this NF

211
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,327
Crimes that the state light out

212
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,399
Was it a non was betraying everything he held dear for this

213
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:45,471
Is it good Muslim he was not supposed to be dating

214
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:49,311
Until he was sacrificing his religion and lying to his family

215
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,103
All just so he could be with her

216
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,639
Twisted up inside

217
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:56,991
And his diary seems to be where they found some evidence for that

218
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,783
In fact they had a friend of his

219
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,807
Debbie Warren

220
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,855
Read excerpts from it on the witness stand

221
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,927
I like him know I love him

222
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:05,951
Shred-it trial

223
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,231
Dated May 15th

224
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,791
It's just all the things that stand in the middle

225
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:12,351
His religion and Muslim Customs are the main thing

226
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,167
It hurts me to know that I'm against his religion

227
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,959
He called me a double few times

228
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:18,495
I know I was only joking

229
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,519
Somewhat true

230
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:26,687
And then there's this which wasn't right at trial but is from July when Adnan went to an Islamic conference in Texas with

231
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,455
What is Dad

232
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,503
This is the most distressed he gets on the

233
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,551
When I read it I thought

234
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,855
Does not look so good for Adnan

235
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,951
I keep crying over the phone because I miss him so much

236
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:38,719
She writes

237
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:41,279
He told me that his religion means life to him

238
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,839
He tried to remain a faithful Muslim all his life

239
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:46,399
He fell in love with me which is a great sin

240
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,215
But you told me there is no way he'll ever leave me

241
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,007
If you can't imagine a life without me

242
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,847
Have to choose between me and his religion

243
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,895
I love him so much

244
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:59,455
And when it comes to choosing I'm going to let him go his way

245
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:02,271
I hate the fact that I'm the cause of his sin

246
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:07,391
He said that I shouldn't feel like I'm pulling him away from his religion but hello that's exactly what I'm doing

247
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:11,231
Anytime someone's writing stuff down like

248
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:15,327
CNN devil and religion means life in reference to their secret relationship

249
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,607
That's not good

250
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:19,679
Ask the muscle in question about it

251
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,727
It all sounds so much smaller

252
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,775
I'm going to put it as a joke

253
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:29,663
Why can't you I'm going to hell because I'm dating you were something but I never mentioned in type of way

254
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:33,759
Anon claims he just wasn't that religious

255
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:37,343
I was going to clubs and having sex with girls and smoking weed

256
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,647
The time he was 14 or 15

257
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,439
Culturally yes I'm a

258
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,487
But the rest he says not so much

259
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,535
So passages like this

260
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,839
He says he doesn't really recognize himself in them

261
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:48,607
I never

262
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:51,167
I never really felt as if you know

263
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:54,239
Now you know hate is tearing me away from my lips

264
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,543
I never

265
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,919
Does she kind of has

266
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,967
Just like the gravity

267
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,271
And the magnitude with which she took these things

268
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,599
I didn't really feel that way about these

269
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:14,719
It seems convenient

270
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:22,143
My behavior didn't change what's up

271
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:33,663
You know I just continue with the same type of behavior different people

272
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:39,295
Religious stepaside the States was guilt-ridden over line to his family. Hey

273
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,111
He says he wasn't all that bothered by that

274
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:44,159
He was a pretty good kid

275
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:47,487
Is doing well in school job he was volunteering at the mosque

276
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,023
Why should we have some fun

277
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:54,399
In the pantheon of ways a teenager could have been disrespectful or deceitful to his parents

278
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:56,191
He thought this rated pretty low

279
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,751
My name is shamim Rahman

280
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:01,311
And I'm the mother of Adnan Syed

281
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,127
When did most of his lying to his mother

282
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,431
She figured out something was up pretty early on

283
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:09,247
She found a nun's crown from prom in the basement where he tried

284
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,039
Stocks

285
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:14,111
Shamim came to the United States in 1976

286
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:17,183
Her husband is already here working as an engineer for the state of Maryland

287
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,487
She's from Peshawar in package

288
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,279
Stan were you do not date

289
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,327
You are either married or unmarried

290
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,607
How much of a middle ground

291
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:28,447
Sonance girl contact put shamim in a state of high alert

292
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:32,543
She would check the mileage on his car to see if you driven farther than he said

293
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,823
Eavesdrop 20

294
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:34,847
Girls on the phone

295
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:38,943
I know this makes you meme sound terrifying but she's not at all

296
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,479
She adores at 9

297
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,783
Her middle son

298
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,575
I'll pick up the phone or LG

299
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:47,135
You know what you say like Mom hang up the phone

300
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,695
You know I know you listening to me

301
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:55,583
PS I said none I'm here you said Mom stop. You know listening to us

302
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,631
An end

303
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:00,191
Was that conflict mean

304
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,495
It must have been

305
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:03,775
Set of const

306
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,847
Find me it was unacceptable

307
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:10,431
Solis two Advil and you know I say no you cannot do that you can.

308
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:15,039
If you like somebody you know it's alright you can get married but not without marriage you cannot

309
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,087
Excuse me in Italian

310
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:24,511
Anton's father was a little more loose about it

311
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,791
Everybody's doing it

312
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,583
Even my husband say you know.

313
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,607
Are the boys are

314
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,399
My children

315
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,959
I don't wasn't getting punished for any of the

316
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,495
Wasn't as if you were about to go

317
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,263
Kicked out of the house

318
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:38,847
He was being reminded of his responsibilities

319
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:41,663
Both at home and at his mother's request

320
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,455
By his youth leader at the mosque

321
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,015
Venting the homecoming dance

322
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,551
The fall of senior year

323
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:50,111
Anon and hay been together for about 7 months by then

324
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,927
Justanswer become a big deal a trial

325
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,743
Proof of just how fraught their whole relationship was

326
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:58,815
And how tormented Anon was about his double life

327
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,095
What happened

328
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:02,911
Anon parents got wind that very night

329
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,703
It had taken hey to homecoming

330
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:08,287
I know this is kind of thing happens in their Community all the time

331
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,311
Someone see someone else

332
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:15,455
For aunties are on the phone to the kids mother

333
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:19,807
Anyway this time Adnan parents did not wait to deal with it at home

334
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,623
They showed up at the dance and chastised him

335
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,647
Made a scene

336
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:29,279
The prosecutors argued that this scene would come to haunt him until the day he killed her

337
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:34,911
Is a prosecutor Casey Murphy told the jury about the moment when she says Adnan strangled

338
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:40,287
What is it that this defendant saw on January 13th when he looked down at Hailey

339
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,591
Angeles a couple things and says this

340
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:46,175
He saw his parents standing at the window of the homecoming dance

341
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,223
He saw his mother raised her voice

342
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,015
Sahalie in front of his classmates

343
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:52,063
Look what you're doing to our family

344
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,367
He saw the pain in his mother's face

345
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,903
Because she knew there were together

346
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,951
He saw himself in the end

347
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,023
Standing there with nothing to show for it but a guilty conscience

348
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,303
Pack of lies in which

349
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,071
He called himself

350
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,887
Compare that

351
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:09,215
With how adnan's best friend Saad remembers the homecoming debacle

352
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:11,519
11 p.m.

353
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:15,103
12:00 midnight

354
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:20,991
And he's like you're not going to believe this but he's like my mom my dad showed up and I'm like what

355
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,807
We're dying laughing on the phone about the xenos

356
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,599
This is our world

357
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:29,183
What happened at Laguna Bay showed up they made me leave

358
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,207
And everyone

359
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:32,511
Solid halide literally

360
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:35,071
My parents pulled me out of this relationship

361
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:41,727
Across dozens of us

362
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:48,127
Information that can either mean one thing or perhaps it's opposite depending on who's talking

363
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:51,967
Cell phone for example he bought it just two days before he disappeared

364
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:58,367
The state tried to show that that was all part of his plan that he needed the phone to carry out the murder

365
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:05,023
Pronounce says he wanted the phone so he could call girls unfettered

366
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,815
Is an EMT to pay for it

367
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:13,215
The job the state would argue that because he was an EMT at someone

368
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:19,615
I had the training to revive last he says he was proud of me

369
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:26,015
Score on the qualifying test if anyone in his class

370
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:29,343
Ride in the back of the ambulance with old people make sure they were okay

371
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:36,255
In the detectives notes they interview Adnan English teacher Jane Efron apparently tells them

372
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:39,071
Which is in his poetry

373
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,863
The words dark side

374
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,887
Are underlined

375
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,423
Saffron

376
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,775
Because everything in my life

377
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:50,591
I don't remember any of them having any

378
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:51,615
Upbeat to say

379
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:52,895
Shawty was just

380
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:53,919
Another one

381
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,455
That makes you think

382
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,991
But you're living on another planet

383
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:00,575
Can you look after them and they're all healthy and Hearty and playing

384
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,111
Cats being stupid

385
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,927
So you didn't stick out in

386
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:07,999
Somebody was just like all teenagers write dramatic Pro

387
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,023
Absolute

388
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:16,959
All this information every scrap its currency for whatever side you're on its spin

389
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:23,103
And the trouble with spin is that you can't totally disregard it because swirling around somewhere inside

390
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,383
Some tender love it

391
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,407
Is true

392
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:28,479
Innocent

393
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,527
Homecoming story

394
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,807
Is also an assassin

395
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:35,391
They didn't write about Homecoming in her diary

396
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,207
Tricia says it wasn't funny to her was a big deal

397
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:42,815
Are you sure members of non-parents wanting to find hey so they could talk to her

398
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,863
Which of course he wanted nothing to do with

399
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,167
So that we could leave the dance and not

400
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,447
Be harassed by

401
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:52,799
His parents like she walked out holding hands with my friend Sean to get away from it and she

402
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:53,567
You just felt like that

403
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,591
Completely

404
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,127
Ridiculous thing

405
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,663
LSU super pissed

406
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,687
Wanting to have

407
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:02,271
I think that for her was a I absolutely do

408
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,831
But this person at all because

409
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,159
This is what happens

410
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,999
On November 3rd he wrote in her diary

411
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:13,791
Who would have thought we would end like

412
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,375
Who would have imagined the amount of pain that comes with a broken heart

413
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,935
I know I'm doing the right thing

414
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:24,031
Call me selfish but this pain is way less than what it would be if we stayed together

415
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:29,663
Apparently they reunited because exactly a month later on December 3rd

416
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,711
She's full of love for an on-again

417
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:33,503
This feels so real

418
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,551
So loving and ever so amazing

419
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:39,135
I can't be any happier but yet I keep on being happier

420
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:43,487
Then just three days later there's this on December 6th

421
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,047
But what's the matter with me

422
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:48,351
Everytime I close my eyes I see my baby

423
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,911
But I keep on thinking about someone else

424
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,263
He's got a crush on Don

425
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,287
An older guy

426
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,055
Is 20

427
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,847
She works with at LensCrafters

428
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,383
The Owings Mills Mall

429
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:05,503
John has blue eyes and blond hair and a Camaro and she really really likes him

430
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:10,623
For the next couple of weeks she's racked with guilt and confusion over what to do

431
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:15,743
At one point she writes anions name in giant block letters made out of tiny little Adnan

432
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:20,863
And underneath that does the same thing with John in giant letters made up of tiny dots

433
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:25,215
127 *

434
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,007
127 Dons

435
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:30,591
Is that clear from the diary when she finally tells Adnan

436
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:31,615
It's over over

437
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,919
But certainly by Christmas they were split

438
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:38,783
On New Year's Day has her first official date with Don and they start going out

439
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,319
Hey is Head Over Heels

440
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,367
Are you sure remembers meeting him

441
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,391
On a double date

442
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:46,463
Friday's restaurant and then to see the movie Shakespeare in Love

443
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:48,255
What's the most awkward double date

444
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:51,839
Because he was older

445
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:55,167
I forget how old he was but he was significantly older than

446
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,727
And my boyfriend was

447
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,519
2 years younger

448
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,543
Fetishist

449
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,823
Horrible

450
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:04,383
With one man and one boy

451
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,919
Yeah

452
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:15,135
This is where the real questions begin

453
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:18,208
Important questions about Adnan

454
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,560
About how he responded to this break up into the fact of his new boyfriend

455
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:25,632
Because the whole premise of the state's case against Adnan

456
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:29,984
Is Eddie felt betrayed and humiliated and angry and that's why he killed her

457
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:33,056
This idea came from Jay their main Witness

458
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:35,360
It was Jane who supplied the motive to please

459
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:46,112
What did he tell you he told me that she broke his heart during extremely wrong

460
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:48,160
Granny want to treat him that way

461
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:55,328
Believe how she stays in looking face to face and told him she didn't love on me

462
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,864
Could be that heartless

463
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:00,192
He told me he said

464
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:03,520
Almost joking I think I'm going to kill him yeah

465
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:08,640
He didn't know how he was going

466
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:11,200
Because she approached

467
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,808
But nearly everyone I spoke with his friends and teachers

468
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:23,488
Announcer in Mac Francis boyfriend

469
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:26,816
But he grumbled about it in a typical guy weigh nothing strange

470
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,400
Everyone I talked to said some version of this

471
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:32,960
But he wasn't rage-filled or vindictive

472
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:34,496
He was just sad

473
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:38,080
It really did seem like run-of-the-mill mundane teenage

474
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:38,848
Angst

475
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:41,664
Pestana paoletti Phillips

476
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:44,480
She taught at 9 and hey AP psychology

477
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,272
Sentara freshman

478
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,088
At her job she seen a lot of high school break up

479
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:53,184
The level of frustration he must have fell

480
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,720
If he killed her

481
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,280
Doesn't register with me

482
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:00,608
I don't remember getting that vibe from

483
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:01,888
It was just

484
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,680
He was just another kid

485
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:05,472
Whose heart was broken

486
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:08,544
And

487
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,848
Goodness if I thought that the kids I teach

488
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:12,384
Today we're going to resort to

489
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,408
Some kind of

490
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:16,992
Horrific crime based on that kind of saying I would have stopped teaching

491
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:19,808
Because I have every other day it would be

492
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:24,416
Announce France odds that Adnan definitely wasn't mooning over hey

493
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:27,488
When they had broke up and then and had broke up

494
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,512
It's been like a month

495
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:32,096
Maybe more she already started dating another guy and I was like

496
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:38,752
Announce dating multiple girls I was like I can tell you some of the girls that he's dating I'd like he is not upset about him

497
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:39,776
I hate breaking up

498
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:43,104
I was like he's dating this girl honestly in Philly that he's been going to see

499
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:49,504
This girl and I know it wasn't like grapefruit but it was still proof that he wasn't obsessed with that he wasn't

500
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,576
I'll try to explain on 17 like he's a player

501
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:56,416
He has a lot of girls I was like he's talking about the island I am too

502
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:59,232
Miss cute and Charming

503
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,000
He's just a

504
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,024
Free

505
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:02,048
Guy

506
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:08,960
Sorry sad she's not talking about you this is Anjali the girl in Philly

507
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:13,056
And she confirmed yep couple of visits they made out nothing too serious

508
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:17,152
New Year's Eve and I'm in another girl Nisha from Silver Spring Maryland

509
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:19,200
He started calling her a lot too

Announce redneck Remember To None making out with another friend of theirs at a party that January

511
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:25,344
So yeah

512
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:26,368
The player

513
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:34,816
Describes

514
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:37,120
Breakups with us

515
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:41,216
Peach time that we broke up with each other

516
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:42,752
Relationship or take a break

517
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:45,568
It was never a thing where I was like pestering her like

518
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:47,872
Going to your house knocking on the door

519
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:51,200
We're chasing her down the Bell when I get back with you when I get back to me cuz

520
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,600
So

521
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:00,416
Pretty much

522
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:04,256
We we talked about things like she would tell me about

523
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:07,072
Someone is she a manager job

524
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:09,120

And she was like so she really like them

526
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:12,960
And

527
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:15,008
You have 30 seconds remaining

528
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:18,336
Yeah, call me back

529
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,664
That's the prison phone system telling us our time is up

530
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,944
Happens every half hour

531
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:26,016
Surprise me every time cuz I forget where he is

532
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:28,576
But so you're you're making the breakups

533
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:30,880
Sound very

534
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:32,416
Kind of

535
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:36,768
Tom and mutual and like nobody got upset

536
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:37,536
But

537
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:39,584
I mean is that true or was there like

538
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:43,936
Crying and the usual teenage angst

539
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,264
15 years later I mean

540
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,360
She was upset I was upset you know what times I was very sad

541
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:57,504
Maybe I was trying to be like a little stubborn about it

542
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,784
But on the other hand

543
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,880
It was everything where I was like you know screaming and yelling at her why you leaving me or

544
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:04,928
So

545
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:09,024
Spell that that that that that that that was never my behavior

546
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:10,048
You know at all

547
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:15,680
It is true that no one at the time described as acting obsessed or menacing and anyway

548
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:16,960
Venetia

549
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:21,568
Never expresses any concerns about Adnan post-breakup Behavior

550
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,920
She writes about a time just before Christmas so after they broken up

551
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:27,712
When she gets into a little car accident

552
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:30,016
And calls up at 9 to come get her from work

553
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:33,088
Bust on her new crush and Adnan

554
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:37,184
Look at the car together and decide it's unsafe to drive so Adnan takes her home

555
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:39,232
Apparently was all very cordial

556
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,512
Even Don said so

557
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,328
You wouldn't talk to me for the story but he testified at the

558
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,096
Trial

559
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:49,984
At this point I'm going to say flat out that I don't buy the motive for this murder

560
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,776
At least I have a state explain.

561
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:53,056
I just don't see it

562
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:56,896
That one person says he was acting strangely after they broke up

563
00:26:57,408 --> 00:27:00,224
By all accounts we're still friends

564
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,576
He was interested in other girls he was working at his job he was headed to college

565
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:07,392
About two weeks after his arrest he gets an orientation packet

566
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:08,672
University of Maryland

567
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:16,096
I don't think he was some empty shell of a kid who betrayed his family and his religion it was now left with nothing and conjured up a murderer

568
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,632
Age for girl who broke his heart

569
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,680
I simply don't buy it

570
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:24,032
And the reason I don't buy it is because no one who knew him then or now

571
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,312
Says that's how it was

572
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:28,128
I want to be clear though

573
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,920
But that doesn't mean he didn't do it

574
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:34,784
It just means that so far I think the state story about why he killed her doesn't hold up

575
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:38,112
Maybe it was more of a spur-of-the-moment thing

576
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:42,976
Maybe despite the other girls he was running after he was privately stewing about hey

577
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:46,304
After all she was apparently still flirting with them after they broke up

578
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,352
Stop aging him with loving messages

579
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:50,912
Spider-Man expensive jacket that Christmas

580
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:52,960
Maybe sorry start a chance with her

581
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:55,008
What their friend Debbie told me

582
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:57,312
Maybe once Don came on the scene he thought

583
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:58,848
That's a slap in the face

584
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:01,408
How dare you continue to leave me on like this

585
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:10,368
The night before he disappeared on call her from a cell phone three times

586
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:16,256
The first two calls at 11:27 p.m. and 12:01 a.m. for only 2 seconds each

587
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:19,072
The third call at 12:35 a.m.

588
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:21,376
Lasted a minute and 24 seconds

589
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:26,240
Announce that he was probably calling to give his new cell phone number he just got in the phone the day before

590
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:30,592
Kennedy in the top left corner of her diary she'd written down the number

591
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:37,504
According to Downs testimony she been at his house that night which is probably why Adnan first two calls ended so fast probably

592
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,272
I wasn't home yet

593
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,624
Her very last diary entry January 12th is brief

594
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:44,672
I love you.

595
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:46,464
I think I found my soulmate

596
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,744
I love you so much

597
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,304
I fell in love with you the moment I open my eyes

598
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,864
To see you in the break room for the first time

599
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:05,408
There is one detail about the missing but I need to tell you about

600
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:07,456
I detailed it doesn't look good for Adnan

601
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:13,344
And that detail has to do with whether or non tried to get in Hayes car right after school

602
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:15,392
Because that is what the state would allege

603
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:18,976
Button on fabricated a reason to get in your car that afternoon

604
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:20,000
So you could kill her

605
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:23,328
Jay had told police that was a nun's plan

606
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:25,888
Did she tell you how he's going to do it that day

607
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,424
No but

608
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:29,728
He tells me that

609
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:32,288
He's going to do it in her car

610
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,360
He said to me that

611
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:37,152
He was going to

612
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,968
Colors car was broken down

613
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:42,016
And I asked her for a ride

614
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:46,112
So what do we know about the end of that day

615
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:46,880
Wednesday

616
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:47,648
Generator

617
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:51,232
Shannon had a couple classes together

618
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:55,328
First. And also last. AP Psychology with Miss paoletti

619
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,632
That's when I usually saw hey

620
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:00,448
The end of psychology she was talking to an on

621
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:05,056
Remember seeing her on her way to her car

622
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:09,920
She told Debbie she had to get her cousin from school and then was going to see. At the mall

623
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:14,016
The very last person to see hey it's cool that day we think

624
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:15,552
Is Inez Butler Henry

625
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:19,392
Inez rental concession stand right at the gym entrance

626
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:21,952
And he would come by every day and get the same thing

627
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:24,000
Veryfine apple juice and hot fries

628
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:28,352
She drove up in front of the gym where the concession stand was

629
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:29,632
Electric car running

630
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:32,960
So she came around the circle park the car right there

631
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:33,984
Jumptown

632
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:36,544
And ran in to get something to drink

633
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,312
And to tell me

634
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,848
None of us not to leave him

635
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:40,896
The bus was for the boys wrestling team

636
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:44,480
Haywood manager and had a match later that afternoon that he was supposed to go to

637
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:45,760
And

638
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:46,528
You didn't see ref

639
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:47,296
After that

640
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:52,160
It's not anywhere near her car

641
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:53,696
No

642
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:55,488
I didn't see him there to come

643
00:30:56,256 --> 00:31:00,864
Okay so no one actually testified at trial that they saw Hannah Donnelly school together

644
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:03,424
Aside from

645
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:07,008
Says they spotted a nun in her car at anytime that afternoon

646
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:11,360
Adnan has no recollection of having a stay for a ride anywhere

647
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:13,152
We talked about it many times

648
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,224
Here's what he said the very first time I asked him

649
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:34,144
McDonald's

650
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:38,752
The trouble for Adnan

651
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:41,312
Is it a couple of their friends say he did ask

652
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:42,336
4 ride

653
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:43,872
What are the different Crystal

654
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,432
If I remember correctly

655
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:48,224
I think Adnan and I worked

656
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,760
Class

657
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:50,784
Together

658
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,112
And

659
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:56,160
They pass each other in

660
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:56,928
In the hallway

661
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:57,696
And I was with him

662
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:01,024
I remember somebody saying or him things

663
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:01,792
Something about

664
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:03,584
Can you give me a ride after

665
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:04,864
After school

666
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,656
Different Becky told police

667
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:08,192
She heard something about a ride as well

668
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:12,032
I do remember that there was talk about it I remember I felt like

669
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:14,336
He asked her to give him a

670
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:16,128
Give him a ride somewhere

671
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,152
Okay

672
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:19,200
Can I just read to you what

673
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:24,320
The police notes a April 9th 99 the interview Geo

674
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,136
Sometime earlier that day

675
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:30,208
Apparently he asked her to take him possibly to get

676
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:30,976
Car

677
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:31,744
Before lunch

678
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,792
Because it was in the shop

679
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,584
Heard about it at lunch

680
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:38,400
I think you heard about it at lunch

681
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,168
Right

682
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,960
He said she could

683
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:42,496
There would be no problem

684
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:46,848
At end of school I saw them she said oh no I can't take you I something else

685
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:47,616
To do

686
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:48,896
She didn't say what else

687
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:52,992
Approximately 220 so that happened at approximately 2:20

688
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:55,296
He said okay I'll just ask someone else

689
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:56,576
He told her goodbye

690
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:59,392
Energy says did not see her after that

691
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,720
Yeah that sounds right

692
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:06,304
Kind of all comes back a little bit

693
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,632
Christian Becky both remembered

694
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:12,448
I'll bet he's our collection maybe Works in a nun's favor

695
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,496
But they turned him down for a ride he's

696
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:15,264
Cool with that

697
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,056
The question is still there

698
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:19,616
Was he trying to get in her car

699
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,408
Did she ask for a ride

700
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,176
Json

701
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:26,272
Evidence in support of a statement

702
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:28,064
Does even come from Crystal

703
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:30,368
Comes directly from

704
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,952
Because he himself told the cops the same thing that day

705
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,560
Who sang the state record police officer Scott Adcock to the stand

706
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:41,888
Around 6:30 p.m. after heading on missing

707
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:44,960
A Baltimore County police officer named Scott Adcock

708
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:46,496
Call Dad on cell phone

709
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:49,824
His family was worried that she hadn't turned up her cousin School

710
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:53,664
And the officer was calling around to some of her friends to see if they knew where she was

711
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:58,272
Here's Adcock testifying at trial

712
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,576
And he advised me that

713
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:02,624
He did see the victim in school that day

714
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:04,160
And that dumb

715
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:05,952
He was supposed to get a ride home

716
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,744
From the victim but he

717
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,280
Got detained at school when

718
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:11,584
He just got tired of waiting and left

719
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:19,008
Been a little more than two weeks after the call with officer Adcock on February 1st

720
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,312
But it's time to search for Jesus ramped-up

721
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:23,104
A different detective calls

722
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:25,152
Astronaut about the ride thing

723
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:28,736
Awesome did you tell officer Adcock you. Stay for a ride

724
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,784
According to the police report

725
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,344
Anan said this was incorrect

726
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,880
Because he drives his own car.

727
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,208
So

728
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,744
He reverses himself

729
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,536
Why would he do that

730
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:48,448
Why would you tell the first cop who's expecting a ride and then once it's clear Hayes missing change his story

731
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:53,312
Maybe the girls were thinking of a different day or maybe when you talk to that first guy

732
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:56,640
Maybe he did ask a for right at some point that day but he's forgotten

733
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:04,064
Or maybe he's lying I'm not a detective but I consider this a red flag

734
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:10,464
Is this a teeny tiny

735
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:16,864
The great big flapping in the breeze red flag

736
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,888
Next week

737
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:30,688
