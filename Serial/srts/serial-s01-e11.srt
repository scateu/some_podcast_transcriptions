1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:02,048
Previously on serial

2
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:03,328
What did he tell you

3
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:08,192
He told me that she broke his heart extremely wrong

4
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:09,984
Granny want to treat him that way

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:16,384
He was like The community's Golden Child I think like the odds of you getting the Charming sociopath you're just not that lucky

6
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:19,200
You don't think that I know you at all

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,648
Only talk to you on the phone

8
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:34,048
Global Tel Link prepaid call from

9
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:40,448
An inmate at a Maryland Correctional Facility

10
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:53,248
From This American Life and WBEZ Chicago

11
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:56,832
Chicago its serial one story told me five week I'm Sarah Koenig

12
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,232
For two months now I've been grappling with rumors about Adnan

13
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:06,304
People telling me there's stuff you don't know about Adnan

14
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,328
Stuff you need to know

15
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,864
Understand who you're dealing with

16
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:13,216
These communications came in the form of phone calls many phone calls

17
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:16,032
Sometimes one-on-one sometimes conference calls

18
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:17,056
Also text

19
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,336
And nervous emails

20
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:23,456
I can't tell this one I've spoken to that one and then that one gets worried that a broken my word which I

21
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:24,736
Promise I haven't

22
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:30,112
One person two doesn't confirm the thing person one told me and I report that back to person one

23
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,904
Person one often tells me

24
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,440
Person to is lying to me

25
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:39,584
All these rumors are coming from people and non knew growing up in the mosque community

26
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:43,168
The Salvation family is to attend Islamic Society of Baltimore

27
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:48,032
Some of these people I've already talked to during my first round of reporting for the story

28
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:52,896
But then once the series started and they heard how I'd known as being portrayed a new round of phone calls began

29
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,784
The Rumours themselves are nothing to dastardly nobody is saying I saw him do it or I

30
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,552
Proof

31
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:02,112
What is directly connected to the crime

32
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,952
There are a great many things I don't know about a non

33
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,512
And some of the things I was hearing we're giving me pause

34
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,072
Check them out as best I could

35
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:16,192
Every single one and some of them are so small that I initially was confused by the telling

36
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:18,496
Waiting for the punchline that it already slid by

37
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,032
Such as

38
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,568
He took a piece of my clothing

39
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,360
Piece of designer sportswear

40
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:28,480
Over explained climbing a wall

41
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,272
And then apologize profusely

42
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:34,624
Hi Sarah Koenig I'm going to confess something right now

43
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,928
I have done exactly the same thing

44
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,464
More than one side wager

45
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:43,328
On the other end of the scale was a story so incriminating

46
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,656
Well this one is true then we're done

47
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,936
Our story is over

48
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:48,960
Mini alcohol

49
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:52,800
This was the biggie and I work every angle I could discuss it out

50
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,336
I heard it second hand

51
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:58,432
That someone said something about at 9 at a party 15 years

52
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,040
I spent weeks trying to learn first the name and the location of that someone

53
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:08,928
Done trying to contact at someone and then finally driving several hours to question that someone in person

54
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:13,280
I nervously knock at the door nice guy comes out WeChat

55
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:16,864
He tells me what I've spent all these weeks and hours waiting for

56
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:19,424
He says I remember at 9

57
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,192
Nice kid

58
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:23,008
Remember he seemed sad when his girlfriend broke up

59
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,824
And so I promised him

60
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,104
I heard this

61
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:31,456
Is that true that anything else you want to tell me

62
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,992
The Galaxy

63
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,528
That's all you had for me

64
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:40,928
Can I have a file on my desk about this rumor and I just stamped it with my big cartoon stamp

65
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,464
Unsubstantiated

66
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,000
I cross it off the list

67
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:54,240
This one more rumor I'll tell you about in a minute

68
00:03:54,752 --> 00:04:00,128
But first I want to talk about why relatively few people from the musk Community are willing to talk on tape

69
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:02,176
Or on the record about a 9

70
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,224
What I'm talking about

71
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,504
Here's a lie

72
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,320
Not his real name and this is also not his real voice

73
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,856
Why the secrecy

74
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,256
Play it on

75
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:29,055
He probably knows something how do we know he's not involved

76
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:49,535
Talking like that you're one of them I mean your supplier you're basically saying I'm sick coming to this

77
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,071
Irrational

78
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,375
I'm under 500

79
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:00,543
Ali another is told me that their Community is judgemental

80
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:03,615
Right and wrong is drummed into early and often

81
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:07,711
Adults judge kids Behavior which then gets reflected back onto their parents

82
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:13,087
This is certainly not unique to their community and the other thing that isn't unique is how close-knit it is

83
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:18,463
Information and gossip travels swiftly and you don't want to be the one who goes against the grain

84
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:21,023
Or said something that could hurt at 9 or his parents

85
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,583
No one wants to end up in hot water

86
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:26,399
I live in a small town I understand that

87
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:32,799
But what I haven't totally understood I think is how scared people were arrested

88
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:35,871
I got an anonymous text recently that said

89
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,431
Who attends the Baltimore

90
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,527
My father and I are good friends and have known each other for years

91
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:46,879
Anon story has always been an urban legend to us kids growing up in the Muslim Community

92
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:49,695
Clouded in mystery and used as a cautionary Tale

93
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,023
Some people did speak out on tape

94
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:56,863
I mean Robbie inside Chaudhary obviously dead and there are others too

95
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:01,471
A significant fraction of people including all who are scared

96
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:06,335
Police said his parents were especially protective like a 10 on the protective scale

97
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:10,175
After done was arrested they were frantic about his safety

98
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,223
His own life changed because of it

99
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:18,367
Are you serious that really happened

100
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:24,767
Cuz your mailbox was like at the end of the driveway or at the end

101
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,047
Attached to the wall of my

102
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,983
Really

103
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,311
McDonald's

104
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,671
It everyone just gets quiet

105
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:41,823
A bunch of people I talked to told me they feel guilty towards Adnan

106
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,103
They let him down

107
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,895
Because they let him astray

108
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:50,527
Or didn't protect him or didn't Mentor him or didn't show up enough a trial or didn't visit him in jail

109
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,343
Even when you're on the fence about as innocent said

110
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,927
Please tell him that I love him or please tell him I'm sorry

111
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:00,255
You should tell him yourself you can write to him you know

112
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:03,071
And then sometimes comes a pause

113
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,143
The reason

114
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,935
Said he wanted me to know this

115
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:08,703
About Anan

116
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:21,503
Atlanta

117
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:55,551
The name of the kind of kid who'd stand up when your parents came into the room at least said

118
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:58,367
At parties or events he be the first one to ask

119
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,647
How can I help you Auntie

120
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,951
I need help setting up those tables uncle

121
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,255
This was what I like

122
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,791
Disguise an anonymous

123
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:12,447
How to say

124
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:18,847
Normally I probably would enforce that on their face aren't connected to the crime at hand

125
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:23,199
But in this case I decided it was worthwhile because of where these rumors

126
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:23,967
Come from

127
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:30,879
I think these rumors are coming from a feeling that a handful of people have I've heard this turnabout for people people who knew it.

128
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:31,647
Growing up

129
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,231
Capable of committing this crime

130
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:40,095
I think they believed they saw things in his personality that they think I am not seeing

131
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,143
Namely that he's duplicitous

132
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,679
The term psychopath

133
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,959
Custodian sometimes

134
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:51,103
People told me he used his charm and his smarts to deflect suspicion or weasel out of things when he got caught

135
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:53,663
Pretty much what the judge said to him at a sentencing

136
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:58,527
Which brings me to the only rumor I heard that at least partly checked out

137
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,551
It was this

138
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,855
Adnan stole money

139
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:02,623
From the mosque

140
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:03,903
Donation money

141
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:07,231
Various versions of how this happened or could have happened

142
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:13,375
But from what I can tell the basic story is people who come to pray on Fridays and it's a lot of people many hundreds

143
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:15,679
Some of them put donation boxes

144
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,215
And that's what it done scam

145
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,031
Two people told me they saw him do it

146
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,335
One person told me he'd seen it several times

147
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,615
He wouldn't go on tape

148
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,407
But the other guy did

149
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,271
Every Friday

150
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:33,599
This is a guy I can't name whose voice was also changed

151
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,879
The explanation above

152
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,671
Because he was

153
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:40,511
Look upon like The Golden Child

154
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,471
Android

155
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,495
Collecting money

156
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:54,079
Organ donation boxes available around on Friday after prayer

157
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,127
You know he does

158
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,927
And nobody questions

159
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,975
You know good little Muslim kids

160
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,631
You you saw him actually take money

161
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:22,495
Noriel absolutely song empty

162
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:28,127
This guy is estimated that Adnan had stolen many thousands of dollars over time

163
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:30,943
Tens of thousands maybe $100,000

164
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:35,551
This sounded Fantastical to me so I checked with multiple Patel

165
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,879
He was president of the Islamic Society of Baltimore at the time

166
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:44,767
He said he's never heard of Adnan taking donation money but that it does happen from time to time

167
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,559
Someone stealing or trying to

168
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,863
There are people who take shoes yet it

169
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,911
My own brand new shoes were stolen

170
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,983
Twice he said that happened once in New York and once in Baltimore

171
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:58,335
But if it did take money he said there's no way it was a big amount

172
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:02,943
He's an average people donated about $2,500 at Friday prayers

173
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:06,015
Thousand dollars if it was a special occasion

174
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,879
He said keep the electricity and heat on

175
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:14,975
If they were even $100 short on any given week that have noticed

176
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:19,327
So sure maybe 20 bucks for 40 bucks here there but not hundreds

177
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,631
Out of the question

178
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,959
Anon says it's true

179
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:26,495
He did take donation money

180
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,799
21st ask him about it

181
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:29,823
He was unhappy

182
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:33,919
I'd ask him so many frankly insulting things

183
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:38,015
So many nosey and inappropriate questions and he's never given me push back

184
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,063
But this was the last straw

185
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,879
What does it have to do with the case you wanted to know

186
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:47,231
He's ever claimed that he's innocent of killing her because he's a perfect or even a good person

187
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:50,559
He said so why talk about this and why the double standard

188
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:54,911
I wasn't going to everyone else's closet and pulling out skeletons that made them look fat

189
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:58,239
What do I protect other people and call him out on everything

190
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:02,079
He's endured other stuff in my reporting that he didn't think was fair to him

191
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:05,407
You go for my savior to my executioner on it you know it just

192
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,759
But now he was sticking up from selfie set

193
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,295
You seem pissed

194
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,087
And hurt and I understood it

195
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:18,463
I'm innocent very uncomfortable thing for me to talk about something that I did

196
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:24,095
I've never denied it I've never I don't see I don't understand I just think it's really unfair to me

197
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:30,495
If this. If you don't want to talk about this that's your prerogative like I'm not going to force you to talk about if you don't want to talk about it

198
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:36,639
And this is the only thing I don't talk about

199
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,783
It has nothing to do with the case

200
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:49,695
Chicken called out on my stuff

201
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,511
Well I mean

202
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:02,751
Zen phone calls later and he told me his stealing story

203
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:06,335
It was during the summer maybe this summer before eighth grade he said

204
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,639
Joy like the Friday prayers

205
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:13,759
A lot of times it'll be one adult and he would get like four or five kids together

206
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,831
Hey look I want you guys to go around and collect

207
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:21,439
You know money from people Horst and Erica have a different days it was different ways

208
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:25,791
Who's usually anywhere from like four to five of us we don't have little boxes or something

209
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:28,607
And people would come and able to Bonnie and

210
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:33,727
Usually like it was

211
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:36,031
It was like thousands of dollars in cash

212
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:36,799
Like one

213
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:39,103
5 * 20

214
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:43,199
$1,500 in cash

215
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:47,039
I don't really remember who I'm not saying it wasn't saying it wasn't me

216
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:51,135
Yeah I just idea came up like a man we could take like 60 or $80

217
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,415
Go to the movies

218
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,695
Go to the mall

219
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,231
Airplane arcade

220
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:57,279
You like eating stuff like that

221
00:14:57,535 --> 00:15:00,095
Eventually but you think we're like one or two of us

222
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:06,751
Would like pocket a $20 bill and another $20

223
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:13,151
And I mean

224
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:16,223
You know I mean it is nothing but I'm proud of it

225
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,783
You know I'm very ashamed of it you know I don't

226
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:21,855
I don't I don't say that we were kids to try to put it in contacts

227
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,903
How to make an excuse

228
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:26,207
Maybe I am right but it's just you know

229
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:31,583
What made you look made you realize what made you stop and what made you realize it was wrong

230
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:38,495
I mean I wish I could say that it was like you know some feeling over there or something or feeling them wrong but it wasn't me

231
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,175
Anon says he was caught red-handed by shamim

232
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,199
His mother

233
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:52,063
She said she found some money in his pants pocket and ask him where it came from and the truth came out

234
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,855
He said she was horrified

235
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:56,671
It was the classic I'm not angry I'm disappointed

236
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,975
More disappointed than she's ever been in him

237
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:03,071
Annonces back then he didn't think he was hurting anyone

238
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,375
They spent so much time at the mosque

239
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,703
Can I shovel snow and they help set up events and clean up

240
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:13,055
I told him it was akin to taking 20 bucks from the tale of the family store at the end of the night

241
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:16,383
He said the course as an adult he knows how wrong that is

242
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:19,199
Get it

243
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:26,367
Announce telling of the stealing episode is a much more boys-will-be-boys version than what I'd heard from other people

244
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:30,207
Who told me they saw in his actions something more malignant

245
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:33,791
I talked to from the mosque Community said

246
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,327
This was so low

247
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:38,143
To take the hard earned cache of hard-working people

248
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,191
At the mosque of all places

249
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,727
This is a terrible thing

250
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,519
Other people said

251
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:49,151
Mr Patel then president of the mosque was thoroughly unruffled by the whole thing

252
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,943
Dunkin Donuts

253
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:51,967
3 more or less

254
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:55,039
It certainly does not a murderer make

255
00:16:55,807 --> 00:17:00,671
Person does something like this it's not even necessarily a sign of bad character

256
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:05,023
Didn't see how is connected to the crime

257
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:09,375
And also some people told me they'd shoplifted before they broken the rules

258
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,679
So people in Glass Houses man

259
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,543
And in the end these guys all set with most of an Old Friends Day

260
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,847
He didn't have it in him to kill someone

261
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,639
It wasn't in his DNA

262
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:24,735
To me this question is the hard center of a nonce case

263
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,039
Can you tell really

264
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:29,599
Can you tell if someone has a crime like this in him

265
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:33,695
I think most of us think if we know someone well we can tell

266
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:36,767
React as detectives all the time Gathering evidence

267
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:42,143
Certain scenes we remember or the look on someone's face or that thing he said when he got mad

268
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,935
And then we act as a judge

269
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:44,703
Character

270
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:46,495
It's just a human thing

271
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,335
Of course it's slippery because it's so subjective

272
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:55,455
One person's evidence of good character is another person's evidence of questionable character

273
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,247
Case in point

274
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:00,831
I heard from many people that Adnan was the opposite of violent

275
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:03,903
But he was someone who would take the heat out of 10 situations

276
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:06,975
I've never even seen him in a fight

277
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,535
I don't even see him mad at anybody

278
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:12,863
This is Atif Iqbal from the mosque

279
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,911
That's his real name and his real voice

280
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,959
Exactly

281
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:19,263
Anybody like me

282
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:24,127
And here like somebody told me that you said something about me and some other person

283
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:30,015
Or something and I went up there to confront him and he was like I don't know what you heard I didn't say anything like that

284
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:35,135
But you haven't said something like that ball blouses you know getting all Rowdy up and he just came and kissed me on my cheek

285
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,159
The Dodgers play

286
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,719
Diffuse me like completely like

287
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:43,071
I miss that he kissed you on your cheek

288
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:49,215
Beatrice Vio veggie like it just like completely like diffuse me like I couldn't even be angry anymore

289
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:54,591
So I mean that's why I like I just couldn't even fathom the thought of him

290
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:55,615
Kelly

291
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,383
I mean

292
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:58,175
Joe Somebody

293
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,991
Like I don't even know how to

294
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:05,343
Say it's just like you don't like his personality

295
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:09,183
Separatists that kiss on the cheek is a towel

296
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,463
It's the real at 9

297
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:15,839
Prefer that other guy who said Adnan stolen who thinks I might be guilty of a crime is in prison for

298
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:19,935
That same piece maker quality was something he brought up to me

299
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:22,239
As evidence that Adnan was full of s***

300
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,799
Halo taking out the tension out of a situation

301
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:31,199
It was ice breaker

302
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:38,623
Majority

303
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:46,303
Here's the Curious Thing though

304
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,399
The same people who tell me they think Adnan was capable of killing hey

305
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:54,751
Stealing from the moth with a great evil or that Adnan with a pathological liar

306
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:58,847
They also tell me to a man that Adnan was a great guy

307
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,383
Such a good guy

308
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:05,247
This is the same Anonymous person who thought Adana taken many thousands from the donation boxes

309
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:10,111
Dog friendly info

310
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,647
Going Father's Day

311
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:18,047
Spheal fake to you

312
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:27,775
You think a person can start of contain both those things inside their personality

313
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,823
I think it's

314
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:34,175
If you Corner anybody into a corner

315
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:40,063
And I don't know

316
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,855
Omostoday

317
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:42,879
Hundreds of

318
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:46,975
Killers I've evaluated

319
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:49,279
I've been pretty Ordinary People

320
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,583
This is Charles Ewing

321
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:54,143
He's a forensic psychologist and a lawyer

322
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:56,447
He teaches at the SUNY Buffalo Law School

323
00:20:56,959 --> 00:21:00,031
He told me he's evaluated several thousand criminal defendant

324
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:03,871
And testified more than 700 trials as an expert witness

325
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:08,735
Mostly lately homicides committed by people in Intimate Relationships

326
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,783
And homicides committed by young people

327
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:14,623
You and your listen to about half the episodes of the show

328
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:19,232
Obviously he can't weigh in on a non psychological Health I'd be ridiculous

329
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:25,888
But I want him to find out what's a valid way to try to understand what's going on when someone kill someone else

330
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:27,680
What's the range of options here

331
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,776
He said most of the time he's doing Insanity evaluations

332
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:34,848
Evaluations for extreme emotional disturbance

333
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:38,944
Usually in cases where there's not a question of whether the defendant did it

334
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,480
More question of why

335
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:44,320
And again most of people he's evaluating a pretty ordinary

336
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,344
Some

337
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,112
AR

338
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:47,392
Extraordinary

339
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:49,184
Some serial killers some

340
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,208
Retailers

341
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:51,744
Some really awful

342
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,536
Psychopathic individuals

343
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,816
For the most part

344
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,608
People kill

345
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,912
Not in a premeditated way

346
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:01,472
They're not evil they're not sociopathic

347
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:02,752
Psychopathic

348
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,544
They killed

349
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:05,568
Because

350
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,128
Something happens

351
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,408
Pushes them over the edge

352
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:14,784
In other words murder isn't usually strictly speaking planned event

353
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:17,088
A lot of people who know it

354
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,440
They can't get their heads around the idea that an unplanned to kill hay

355
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,720
I hear it all the time

356
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:25,792
Here's his old Woodlawn classmate Peter Billingsley

357
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:28,864
I still I still the whole idea premeditation just doesn't fit

358
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,656
Trodden

359
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,960
No it doesn't fit it all

360
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:33,728
But

361
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:34,496
I don't know

362
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:37,568
The first one

363
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,360
Coasterra some plant

364
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:42,432
Matt is but I'm sure this was not a planned murder

365
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:46,016
That's Jane Efron who taught Hannah Dunne English at Woodlawn

366
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,296
Her father was a cop

367
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,320
Icon

368
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:51,904
By that because that destroys everything

369
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:55,744
That I feel about these kids so I absolutely

370
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,024
I think it was

371
00:22:57,536 --> 00:23:00,096
Passion overdose of emotion

372
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:02,400
Of Love jealousy

373
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,680
Resentment

374
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:04,960
All of those things

375
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,264
It sneaks in on you

376
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,824
Dominate your thinking and you can't get away from it

377
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:11,872
But that's

378
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:13,664
Uncomfortable thinking

379
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:17,504
Premeditated murder

380
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:25,952
Can otherwise seemingly normal kid

381
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,232
Up and do something like this

382
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,024
Play something like this

383
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,560
Or even do it impulsively

384
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:35,680
Is snapping a thing people say that all the time also

385
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:36,960
Snap

386
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:37,984
People

387
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,264
Sometimes we lose

388
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,800
And when they lose it

389
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:42,080
It's not always

390
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,104
01

391
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,664
I've seen a lot of cases in which

392
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,944
People have

393
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,968
Over

394
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:50,272
A relatively short period

395
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,040
Time

396
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:52,832
Nurse

397
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,368
Feelings of

398
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,160
Rejection

399
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,184
Or

400
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:58,720
Anger

401
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,000
Or hostility

402
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,792
And they slowly

403
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:02,560
Risen

404
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:03,328
To the point

405
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,864
At which individual

406
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,144
Decides to kill somebody

407
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:08,192
Those feelings Zimmer

408
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,216
For a while

409
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,240
And

410
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,776
What is a thot

411
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,312
Maybe I should

412
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,080
Children's purse

413
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,896
I'm not going to kill this person

414
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,688
I want to kill this person

415
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,480
What if I did

416
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:24,320
And the person thinks about it

417
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:26,880
And then maybe confronts the other

418
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,416
The person who

419
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,976
Frustration V anger

420
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,000
And then

421
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:34,816
The victim

422
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,352
Her would-be victim

423
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,144
Says or does something

424
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,168
The triggers

425
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:40,704
Provokes

426
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,984
The ultimate killing

427
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:44,032
Looks looks

428
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:46,336
Premeditated

429
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:49,664
I'm not sure that really is premeditated in the sense that

430
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,944
We normally think of it

431
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:51,968
It doesn't have to

432
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:52,992
To be like

433
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:55,808
Sudden impulse to violence

434
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,112
So that was news to me

435
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:59,904
But there's a sort of liminal phase

436
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,952
A simmering contemplation

437
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:03,744
What if I kill this person

438
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:09,120
And that can take the place of actual cognizant planning that end up in the same result

439
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,960
Considered in my morici moments

440
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,752
Is weather

441
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:16,032
But doesn't know he did it

442
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,592
I'm not the only person is entertain that one

443
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,384
Here's an honest friend Laura

444
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,968
I mean I remember the cops on me sometimes they have murderers

445
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:29,856
Standing with a knife in their hand next to the body saying to them that they didn't do it because you're

446
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,904
Brain goes into the shock

447
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,184
And it shuts down

448
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:35,488
That's like what maybe

449
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,512
That happened

450
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:39,072
Maybe it was an accident maybe you got mad

451
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:41,120
7 to get mad

452
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:41,888
Maybe

453
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:45,728
Maybe he lost it for a moment

454
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,520
Yeah and it was an act

455
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,616
Apparently this is not as outlandish as it might sound

456
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:55,200
People can go into a dissociative state

457
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,224
Where

458
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,504
They're really

459
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,296
Psychologically not

460
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,600
Where they are physical

461
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:04,160
Probably half of the people

462
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:06,464
Have evaluated who killed

463
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:07,488
Other

464
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:08,768
Human beings

465
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,840
Have some degree of amnesia

466
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:13,120
For what they've done

467
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,912
Did you say have

468
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,960
Half the people

469
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:17,984
And it's

470
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,312
It's not total Amnesia usually although I've seen some people

471
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,592
Whoever completes

472
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,616
Amnesia

473
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:24,896
For killing

474
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:25,920
But

475
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:28,224
You can be partly

476
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,320
I don't really recall the details I don't recall doing this

477
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:35,904
Because literally like the memory isn't in there

478
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,696
Brain anymore or

479
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:39,744
Or it never was in their brain or

480
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,304
Yeah I don't think we know the mechanism

481
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,584
By which

482
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,608
This kind of

483
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:47,680
Denial or Amnesia or combination works but

484
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:52,800
In the cases that I've been involved in where people have had some kind of

485
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:55,872
Amnesia or partial Amnesia or denial

486
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:58,432
It doesn't last forever

487
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,736
It's it's very difficult

488
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:02,784
To maintain that cam

489
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:03,808
Sade

490
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:08,416
What I find is it overtime people do

491
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,952
Recover traces

492
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:13,024
Of what happened and

493
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,560
They know what happened

494
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:17,376
What about 15 people who has

495
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,936
Genuinely snapped

496
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,216
And who

497
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,520
Committed a homicide

498
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:24,544
And then

499
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,592
They realize what they've done

500
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,640
Any immediate reaction

501
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,920
For most people

502
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:30,688
His

503
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:31,968
Oh my God

504
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:33,760
Look what I've done

505
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:35,808
And what am I going to do about it

506
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:38,368
I got to figure out some way to cover this up

507
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,416
Do you think it's

508
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:44,000
Is there another scenario where are you

509
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:49,376
It starts out as a lie as assertive cognizant lie like I didn't do this had nothing to do with this

510
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:51,936
And then over time

511
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:55,264
You truly believe that lie like you view kind of

512
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,056
Erase

513
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,080
Erase

514
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,872
The fact that you're lying and it just

515
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:00,640
Becomes

516
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:02,944
The truth of it for you

517
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:09,344
I think that happens I haven't seen that happen and homicide cases but I certainly seen it happened

518
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,648
Ordinary wife

519
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:13,184
Less often in homicides

520
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,024
Yeah I haven't even seen that and it's probably just because

521
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:23,424
And in most homicide cases the evidence is pretty overwhelming

522
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:24,448
That

523
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,728
You did it

524
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:35,456
Off the top of my head I can think of five different people in the story who other people have told me they think are either

525
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:37,760
Pathological Liars are psychopaths

526
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:39,808
Russian trust anything they say

527
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:43,392
The term psychopath gets thrown around so easily

528
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:47,488
The kind of catch-all term for cold hearted and calculating killer

529
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:51,840
If it non did this and if you did it the way Jay tells it

530
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:54,144
He is so cold hearted

531
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:57,216
Tell the cops that announces to him

532
00:28:57,472 --> 00:29:00,800
Motherfukers referring to like hugs and bugs and stuff

533
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,336
Think of hardcore

534
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:04,640
But he just killed a person with his bare hands

535
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:07,712
Lebanon said that

536
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:12,832
Does that mean the 15 years since has been this very very long con

537
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:17,952
What is calculating enough to only pretend to be the normal sounding person he is with me on the phone

538
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:23,840
A psychopath usually means a person who has little or no conscience

539
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,120
Is glib

540
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:28,192
You can't empathize or relate to other people's feelings

541
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,752
They can read other people very well

542
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:32,800
But they don't have genuine empathy

543
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:33,824
Another

544
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,616
Factor to be sure

545
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,384
Is

546
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,920
This

547
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:38,944
What's

548
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,784
Known in the profession is superficial charm

549
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:45,344
These are people who

550
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:46,624
Come across

551
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,160
Very smoothly

552
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:51,488
Effectively manipulate other people

553
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:54,304
And manipulate them without them knowing it very often

554
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,656
Now I'm running through my head

555
00:29:58,912 --> 00:29:59,424
Everything you just said

556
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:06,592
And some of it maybe another stuff

557
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,640
I mean

558
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:11,456
It really does seem like an on

559
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,992
Is is like

560
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,296
Really

561
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,344
Functioning really well

562
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,368
Minister

563
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,672
Fine in prison like he's

564
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,464
Season 3

565
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,024
Adaptable and he's always had like a

566
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:29,120
Job with responsibilities and he's not cutting into he's not been

567
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:32,448
Disciplined really ever except for having a cell phone

568
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:38,848
In like doesn't appear to have any kind of antisocial

569
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:40,896
Behaviorism

570
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:46,272
Friends he's got he's maintained his relationships outside the prison with his family and With Friends

571
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,552
Certain friends

572
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:49,600
I mean is that

573
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:52,416
Something to taken that I should be taking into account

574
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:56,000
I think so

575
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:00,864
Certainly

576
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:02,144
Cuts against

577
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:06,240
Theory that he's a psychopath

578
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:07,776
Arteries

579
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:08,800
Some kind of

580
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:12,384
Pathological person

581
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:14,688
But it doesn't rule it out

582
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:19,296
And the fact is most psychopaths are killers

583
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:21,600
And most Killers aren't Psychopaths

584
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,720
There's a there's a very limited overlap between those two spheres

585
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:34,144
Finally I asked you why should I be influenced by the fact that has so consistently maintained his innocence all these years

586
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:36,192
His experience

587
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:37,984
People who are wrongfully convicted

588
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,776
Always maintained their innocence

589
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:42,592
Even when it hurts them like in sentencing or parole

590
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:46,688
On the other hand he said just cuz you said you didn't do it

591
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:47,968
In four decades

592
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,504
Doesn't mean you didn't do it

593
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:51,808
But just aren't any rules for

594
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:56,416
Here's what I take away from this conversation with Charles Ewing

595
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:58,720
I don't think that is a psychopath

596
00:31:58,976 --> 00:31:59,488
I just don't

597
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,304
I think he has empathy I think he has real feelings

598
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:06,400
Because I've heard and seen him demonstrate empathy and emotion

599
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:08,192
Towards me and towards other people

600
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,264
He is able to imagine how someone else feels

601
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:14,592
Options it's a toss-up

602
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:20,992
State of Amnesia and denial and then supplanted that with actual lying

603
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,272
It's possible

604
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:28,672
Could've had simmering feelings of anger and resentment that then boiled over in a not quite by accident way

605
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:29,952
It's possible

606
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,000
Could he be truly innocent

607
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:33,536
It's possible

608
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:36,864
He said he's often asked on the stand

609
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,168
How do you know this person isn't lying to you

610
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,216
What is the answer he said is always the same

611
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:42,240
I don't know

612
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:45,056
In the course of his career he's been fooled

613
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:56,832
A handful of people who are listening to the story

614
00:32:57,088 --> 00:33:01,696
One thing they think makes a non look guilty is the way he talks about our brother doesn't talk about

615
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:03,488
Other people involved in the case

616
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:04,768
Especially J

617
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:08,608
But if you were really innocent we would hear him being matter

618
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:10,912
I know we talked about this

619
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:12,704
Why doesn't he sound more mad

620
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,008
But there's another factor I haven't mentioned

621
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:17,824
And that is as a defense attorneys explain to me

622
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,664
No good can come and harm can come

623
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:26,528
Attempting to contact or influence people on the outside for connected to his case

624
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,832
That's kind of inmate Behavior 101

625
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:32,672
Biggest what's a Cathy changed her story

626
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:35,232
Send me remember something exculpatory for Adnan

627
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,328
I'm in the state found out that Adnan had been writing to Kathy

628
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,864
Or threatening cat

629
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:41,632
He somehow

630
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:44,448
Talking smack about a podcast

631
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:49,824
By the state to challenge the validity of Kathy's new information

632
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:55,200
Anon is a smart guy he's been an inmate for 15 years he knows the deal

633
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:59,808
He also knows there's nothing he can do to change other people's minds about him

634
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:02,368
If a person genuinely doesn't think that I feel something

635
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:04,672
Put me in prison

636
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:05,696
Then

637
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:07,232
Me saying it

638
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:09,024
It really has no validity

639
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:10,816
In my eyes anyway

640
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:15,168
You know how do you think I did it

641
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:17,472
And if you think that I did it then

642
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:19,776
You can assume cuz I'm a normal

643
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,080
Unexpected

644
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:22,848
The monster

645
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:25,152
And they don't find that when x 8, expect

646
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:27,200
Or they don't find that

647
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:27,968
They don't know what to say

648
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,528
And the reality of it is I'm just a normal person

649
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,856
I know but I think actually

650
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:36,672
That's that's right but I think also what

651
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:41,792
People do is they put themselves immediately in your position and think what would I do

652
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:45,120
How would I be feeling how would I be asked if someone if I thought

653
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:51,008
You know someone had done me wrong and put me here and I would be screaming to the rooftops and they're not hearing you do that

654
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:52,032
System one

655
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:57,664
I mean it is really nothing to say if someone can't imagine how I feel this. There's no need for me

656
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:03,296
I mean it is what it is

657
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:10,208
I think it's a trap

658
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:11,744
To try to convince people

659
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:17,376
A few weeks ago after these rumors started surfacing I got a letter in the mail from a non

660
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:19,168
It was 18

661
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:20,960
Typed single-spaced pages

662
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:24,032
He gave me his reluctant permission to talk about it

663
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,848
His religion

664
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:29,408
His case how he's managed over the past 15 years

665
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,688
What's a good letter

666
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:31,712
Is it good writer

667
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:34,784
But it's song from pole to pole from distrust

668
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,808
Gratitude

669
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:36,832
Fusion

670
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:40,672
Anon is obviously aware of this podcast that it's out in the world

671
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:44,000
Negatale that my story had messed with his equilibrium

672
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:51,424
What is convicted of murder he said the biggest shock for him was that people thought he was capable of this hideous thing that people do

673
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:57,312
As I look back now he wrote I realized there were only three things I wanted after I was convicted

674
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:59,104
To stay close to my family

675
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,384
Prove my innocence

676
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:03,456
I just seen as a person again not a monster

677
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:05,504
The third one he says he's mad at

678
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:06,784
Inside prison

679
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:10,112
People here know me as a stand-up guy

680
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,392
Guards inmates

681
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:15,488
Staff has been around for 15 years I've seen me everyday

682
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:18,048
Recognize me as someone whose word can be trusted

683
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:22,400
I guess what I'm trying to say is that I was able to find a peace of mind in prison

684
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:23,936
But I lost at my trial

685
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:28,288
And now I come along as Robbie is best

686
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,056
Not his

687
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:31,104
And yank the store open again

688
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,688
To the outside world and to all its doubts about a nun's integrity

689
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:38,016
Stirring up the most painful possible questions

690
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:39,808
About whether he's a monster

691
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,600
It's his nightmare basically

692
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:44,672
Accused of manipulating everyone around him

693
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:48,512
Of course I had a sense of this feeling from him now and then

694
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:50,048
Over the years that we've been talkin

695
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:54,912
But in 40 hours of taped conversations

696
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:56,704
He was weighing every word

697
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:59,008
His goal was to keep it all business

698
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:02,336
Evaluate his case based on the evidence of loan

699
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:03,872
Not on his personality

700
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:09,760
I didn't want to do anything that could even remotely seem like I was trying to befriend you or Curry favor with you

701
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:15,392
I didn't want anyone to ever be able to accuse me of trying to ingratiate myself with you or manipulate you

702
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:16,160
SoundCloud

703
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:18,976
And having to do that

704
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:21,280
I had a rough year

705
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:25,120
My stepfather died in April then my father died two months later

706
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:26,400
And I knew that

707
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:30,240
Cuz I had to stick to what I know

708
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:35,360
Can you imagine what it's like to be afraid to show compassion to someone at a fear they won't believe you

709
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:36,896
I was so ashamed of that

710
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:44,576
And this second-guessing this monitoring of everything he says to me and therefore to the outside world

711
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:47,392
About anything really but especially about his case

712
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:49,952
He writes in his letter but it's crazy making

713
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:56,864
I'm always over-thinking analyzing what I say how it sounds and the fact that people always think I'm lying

714
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:00,448
All this thinking is to protect myself from being hurt

715
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,752
Not from being accused of his murder

716
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:05,824
But for being accused of being manipulative or lying

717
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:09,664
And I know it's crazy I know I'm paranoid but I can never shake it

718
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:13,760
Cuz no matter what I do or how careful I am it always comes back

719
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,344
I guess the only thing I could ask you to do is
