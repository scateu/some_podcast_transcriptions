What is a solution

00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,392
Previously on serial

20
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:03,744
That's fine but you still have to go through this

21
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:12,960
I have talked that they would check in on him and

22
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:15,264
Hope that that means

23
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:19,104
Somehow protecting him

24
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,456
Why would you have any court dates

25
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:25,248
Why would you have a court date coming up

26
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:32,416
From This American Life and WBEZ Chicago

27
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:38,816
It's serial one Courthouse told week by week I'm Sarah Koenig

28
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:48,544
Joshua was correct

29
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:53,408
The state was trying to invoke his syo they wanted to send them to adult prison

30
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:57,760
The morning after he called me I did inquire Dover at the Juvenile Justice Center

31
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,040
See what was what

32
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,856
So I'm actually have to

33
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,136
Courthouse right now

34
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:05,696
Are you at

35
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:09,536
So they're just going to set a date for

36
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:13,376
I guess hearing or the next whatever is going to happen next

37
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,168
But

38
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:17,216
But yeah how are you doing

39
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:21,568
I was up all night last night

40
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:26,944
I was thinking about last night

41
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:30,784
All I can muster was a solution that when I was Joshua's age

42
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,576
I was on irritating

43
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,600
Baidu

44
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:38,208
Alright try to get some sleep it's nothing's going to be better if you don't get sleep

45
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,192
I know you're worried I know you're worried

46
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,472
I know

47
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,800
It's not my job to comfort Joshua

48
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,848
Certainly not my job to tell him to go to bed

49
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:57,920
But I happen to be the one on the phone right now

50
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,480
Out of all the cases we watched

51
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,272
Joshua's got me most

52
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:05,088
I could not fathom that the state would give up on him

53
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:07,392
After all he dressed for law enforcement

54
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:09,184
I'd rather beat down teams org

55
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,464
A 19 year old kid

56
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,024
I did what I knew how to do

57
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,328
I reported out every beat of this sucker

58
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,352
Every turn

59
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:18,912
Go to Joshua almost everyday sometimes twice a day

60
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,448
For year-and-a-half

61
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,008
So that the story of Joshua would exist

62
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,056
Not for posterity sake

63
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:27,104
But for the sake of straight-up fairness

64
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:33,760
First thing I wanted to know

65
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:37,344
Why Joshua what was odys saying he done

66
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,440
I met the one with Jackson from their facilities and put them into the adult system

67
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:47,328
I got a copy of the motion to invoke Joshua's syo filed by the County prosecutor's office

68
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:50,400
Are the requests of the juvenile prison Indian River

69
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:56,032
Emotion claimed that Joshua created a substantial risk to the safety or security of the institution

70
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:59,104
But despite all the therapeutic programming Joshua completed

71
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,432
He consistently chooses to make criminal decisions

72
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:09,600
Then there's a list of about a dozen specific incidents just from the past 6 months assaults fights disruptive

73
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,904
Behaviors its own urine on a kid

74
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,208
It's on a remote control at a female guard

75
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,000
Get smashed video game console

76
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,839
Add later find out the incident that triggered the motion to invoke

77
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:22,911
Apparently Joshua had put out a hit on another kid

78
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,727
But usually means arranging for other kids to jump someone

79
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:30,335
The kid wasn't jumped but still the prosecutors considered it a serious threat

80
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:36,223
I got to say I was taken aback by the list I had that anxious jolt of hold up

81
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,831
Have I completely misunderstood who this person is Elizabeth bad

82
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:43,391
The summer at the end extensive

83
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:46,207
16 fights 6 menacing threats

84
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,743
21 disruptive behaviors

85
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,303
Etc but

86
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,839
I have another report

87
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:54,143
An internal odys report

88
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:58,751
The documents every incident involving Joshua whether as victim or aggressor

89
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,311
Promised all his time and odys custody

90
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:08,223
I want to cross reference request to invoke Joshua's syo with that internal odys report

91
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,247
I realized

92
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,575
These aren't isolated incidents

93
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,623
Many of them are connected

94
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,695
There's an assault

95
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,999
When Joshua hit a kid on February 3rd

96
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,535
What's missing

97
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,815
Is February 2nd

98
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:25,119
What you can see on that internal report

99
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:28,959
February 2nd that same kid walked up to Joshua the water fountain

100
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,239
And punched him in the face

101
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,543
There are few sequences like this

102
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:36,895
Tit for Tat sandwich only the top was included in the request to invoke his that's why I O

103
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:40,991
Yes indeed Joshua did throw pee at a kid on March 27th

104
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,319
3 before the same kid had assaulted Joshua

105
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,599
Entropy on him

106
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,647
Common weapon in juvenile

107
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:53,791
I'm in the list of Joshua's offenses by people who either work in odys

108
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:56,095
On behalf of kids inside odys

109
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,375
And I said

110
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,655
Sounds great but

111
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,959
Yeah for a kid who's been in there 3 years

112
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:01,983
Exceptional

113
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:05,823
Is cardhu known Joshua for a couple of years

114
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:08,383
She told me overall not a troublemaker

115
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,711
Not even on the radar in terms of major threats inside the facility

116
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,015
He gets mad sometimes you said

117
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,063
But usually for a legitimate reason

118
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:19,391
Joshua did throw a video gamer motor guard for instance

119
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:23,487
Joshua told me that's because the guard discussed his case in front of other kids

120
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,279
Snitches get stitches

121
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:28,607
Isn't she apologized later and they were cool after that

122
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,423
But there it was in their quest to invoke

123
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,727
Another incident on the list

124
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:37,567
Sounded as if Joshua had caused a car to get hurt during a fight

125
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:40,383
He said not accurate he was trying to defend the guard

126
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,943
The one time I visited Indian River

127
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,759
I'm at the same Garden passing she confirmed it

128
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,807
He was trying to protect me she said

129
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,343
Call Joshua honey

130
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:55,743
Again I couldn't interview anyone at odys on the record they don't participate in stories about specific youth

131
00:06:56,511 --> 00:07:02,143
But in a statement they reiterated that they do investigate allegations of misconduct and take action when necessary

132
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,983
When I put the two reports side by side

133
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:12,639
What I saw was the Raggedy morally compromised Chronicle for the kid at War Joshua wasn't only a victim

134
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,687
Store with the only a perpetrator

135
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,991
Like a lot of kids inside odys

136
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:21,343
He was both the most powerful gang in juvenile prison was after him

137
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,159
Color guards couldn't be trusted everyday

138
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,439
He felt unsafe

139
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:30,815
So we created alliances where he could dominated where he could took advantage where you could

140
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:37,215
Sun protection where I could but didn't make his behavior right then again odys prison

141
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,775
Really spin on an axis of right and wrong

142
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:43,103
See previous episode

143
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,223
The prosecutors offer Joshua deal

144
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,271
He didn't fight the vine over

145
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,063
And transferred to adult prison

146
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,343
Ticket 9 years

147
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,391
It went forward with the hearing

148
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:58,207
Set up an argument he could end up with more than that

149
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,743
As many as 18 years

150
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:03,583
Josh was assigned attorney with a guy named Jim whole flick

151
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:07,167
Jim hosek hadn't done one of these syo invocations before

152
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,959
How many people in the county had

153
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,775
Joshua didn't know whether to take the deal

154
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,335
What's the westhouse hotel Nia

155
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,343
But he said he's inclined to fight it

156
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,351
Who's everybody

157
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:39,935
Who's everybody

158
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,383
Show me

159
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:50,943
Joshua tried to Marshal support

160
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:55,295
He has some odys staff members to write letters to the court on his behalf

161
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,343
Cuz if you told them they were willing

162
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:02,975
Joshua's father who was in Jamaica pledge to hire Josh a private attorney just needed to arrange for payment

163
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:07,839
In the meantime Indian River declare that it wanted Joshua out now

164
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:10,399
While they waited for the final hearing on his ass yo

165
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,959
The superintendent claim Joshua is causing

166
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:15,775
Environment of constant response and panic

167
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,591
Court magistrate okay the transfer

168
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,639
Joshua was delivered to county jail

169
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,175
Adult County Jail

170
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:29,087
A couple of weeks went by and I can hear on the phone that Joshua was acclimating to the idea of an adult sentence

171
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,367
In adult prison

172
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,439
Decompress the nine years in his head

173
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,975
It really be 6 years

174
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:37,279
Since he'd already spent a few years in ody us

175
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,815
Probably less than six

176
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,607
It is granted judicial release

177
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:44,959
Bingham County with all these guys were getting walloped with big sentences

178
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:48,031
Joshua had a fresh perspective on the number 6

179
00:09:55,455 --> 00:10:00,831
17 years

180
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,879
Dislike

181
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,167
Compare two double digits he was saying

182
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,959
Maybe six was a lucky break

183
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:30,271
Joshua's brought to court the morning of his hearing he still didn't know what he was going to do

184
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,063
He met with Jim hosek

185
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:34,111
Who laid out the probable truth

186
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,183
But today nine years was the best case scenario

187
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,975
Joshua took the deal

188
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,815
Dashiell proceeding is hard to stomach

189
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,351
Joshua stood there

190
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,119
Crying

191
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:48,191
A few of his umpteen yes ma'ams barely Audible

192
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:52,799
And that you have demonstrated by your conduct

193
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:57,407
That Rehabilitation during the remaining period of juvenile jurisdiction is unlikely

194
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:03,039
I want point the judge ask someone to fetch Joshua some Kleenex

195
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,855
No one had come to his rescue

196
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:09,439
His father hadn't hired the private lawyer he said he was going to hire

197
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:13,023
Joshua civil attorneys never did file a lawsuit on Joshua's behalf

198
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:17,119
The Indian River staff who told Joshua that stick up for him vouch for his progress

199
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,143
Not here

200
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,703
I learn they've been firmly reminded

201
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,495
You work for odys

202
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:27,359
While we're at it we're the FBI agents would seem to like Joshua back in 2014

203
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,151
When I told him to check on him

204
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:30,943
I got it

205
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,735
Who's all too messy

206
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:33,503
Too much

207
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,551
All those incidents on the list

208
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:36,575
The contacts

209
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,623
Tit for Tat who started what

210
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:39,903
Too messy

211
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,207
Told me

212
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:45,791
Sure we could have picked apart three or four of the incidents on that list

213
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,071
Explained

214
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:50,143
Fights on paper are more intricate than they appear

215
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,959
What about the 40 other items

216
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,239
Teetering just behind

217
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,543
They're going to be crushed them hoes like said

218
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,591
But the sheer volume of incidents

219
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,663
One person who had shown up

220
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,199
Josh was only Witness

221
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,479
Lashayla Turner

222
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,783
Joshua is Mentor from Freedom School

223
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,855
She said gym hopefully I could contact her yesterday

224
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:12,415
She thought she might be called upon to testify

225
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,463
The Turner was upset

226
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,511
I thought it could be spot she said

227
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,351
I really thought I could be fought

228
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:23,167
In his letter to invoke Joshua's syo

229
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:27,263
What do is it written that there was no more they could do to rehabilitate Joshua

230
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:30,847
After no additional interventions and treatments that can be attempted

231
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,895
It is unfortunate they wrote

232
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:35,711
That he threw away the opportunity he was given

233
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:40,319
Stadia that Joshua is unfixable was Turner said

234
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,879
That part of it is completely yes

235
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,719
Miss Turner isn't some wide-eyed advocate

236
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,279
She's worked with lots of kids in juvenile facilities

237
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:53,119
For masters in public administration with a focus on youth policy

238
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,655
She's from East Cleveland

239
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:58,751
To the deep and personal experience with the good and the bad of gangs

240
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:02,079
She agrees that some of the kids at Indian River aren't ready to come out yet

241
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:05,151
But they are still works in not quite enough progress

242
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:09,759
Joshua though she said he is not one of the ones she most worried about

243
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:12,831
And he's not one of the ones odys should be most worried about

244
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:15,391
She does not accept that he hasn't progressed

245
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,183
Because to her

246
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:21,791
Joshua at 19 such a far cry from Joshua at 16

247
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:28,191
When he was the Hot Head Eric and a****** that judge when you met at first that I met verse

248
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:32,543
There's no doubt in my mind that that's when the conversation should have been had

249
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:38,943
The conversation of should we find them out absolutely because he's becoming expensive facility and he was a child.

250
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:45,343
Could he be rehabilitated a question of the big guy had a complete question and didn't think that he could

251
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:49,695
Sister said the only fight they had in Freedom School inside the facility only one

252
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,719
Joshua

253
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:57,375
His first week in the program he stood up on a chair and spit on somebody like I mean just outraged

254
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:00,703
Even in conversation with him after that it was his

255
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,007
Arrogance to him it was this

256
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,311
Haughtiness

257
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,687
Lily doesn't exist in him

258
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,711
Anymore

259
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,503
Sota now

260
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,551
Serious conversation completely change

261
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,319
2

262
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:19,391
I want to get out of here I want to be a better person

263
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,207
I'm asking

264
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:26,559
To not be put into these situations I'm asking you put on a different unit

265
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,375
Saratoga this been crying out

266
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,143
Saying

267
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,679
This is what I need

268
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,959
I want to get out of this

269
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,007
And you ignore that

270
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,311
What most disturbs Miss Turner

271
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:41,407
It was Joshua whose ethics and behavior were being scrutinized and punished

272
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:44,735
I know no one would look at what the state had done to him

273
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,039
I think Joshua is the

274
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,855
Best case example

275
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,903
FYI

276
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:58,303
Is so bogus when we have these expectations for kids to speak up about what's happening in the community as a test of

277
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:02,655
And things like that and we see the ramifications

278
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,959
And how we don't wrap around to protect that

279
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:11,359
I think the biggest issue isn't that Joshua hasn't held up his end of the bargain

280
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:13,407
Is that the state hasn't held up theirs

281
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,455
Family protected him

282
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:19,295
Having protected him from the gang he inflamed

283
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:25,695
By testifying for the state

284
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:40,287
More in a minute

285
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,943
This is the road tired

286
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:53,599
Brought to you by zip recruiter Michelle sarzen has figured out a way

287
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:59,999
If your dog to talk to you well kind of voice

288
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:06,911
But we don't have that what our device lives due to the mobile app is like your dog to build that communication

289
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:07,679
Bu

290
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:11,775
And tell you that hey I'm not scratching I'm getting good sleep

291
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,799
I am happy

292
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,103
Marcel's the CEO of vectrex

293
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,895
A device that your dog wears on her collar

294
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:19,967
Can monitor how many second she spends each day

295
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:22,783
Scratching your head running and walking

296
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:25,599
Basically is a health and fitness tracker for dogs

297
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:30,463
When owners are away from the dogs at work they can check in on the app to see how their pup is doing

298
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:32,511
Marcel uses vectrax on his dog

299
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,279
Pepper

300
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,815
She's always had kind of

301
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:35,839
No ears

302
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,631
Smelly ears

303
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,935
What do they smell like

304
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:44,031
The smell is probably a lot like a ichiza starting to spoil

305
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,847
Which is a symptom of an ear infection

306
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:53,759
What's the sensor on her collar we know the Baseline number is for her amount of shaking that she does their head

307
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:57,855
Stanley she starts now increasing that by 25 or 50%

308
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,903
She's trying to tell me

309
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:02,463
I am doing a couple my ears are hurting me

310
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,743

After the hearing Joshua was taken back to the county lockup

337
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,543
Peter go to be shipped out to prison within a few days

338
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,335
That's supposed to happen once your sentence

339
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:58,431
Joshua's understanding was that early on a Tuesday or Thursday morning

340
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:02,527
They're going to drive him from County Jail to an intake prison about 40 minutes from Cleveland

341
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,831
Are they figure out where to put you

342
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:07,135
What's going to be your home Institution

343
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,951
But a couple of Tuesdays and Thursdays came and went

344
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,487
And Joshua sat

345
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,511
In limbo

346
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:17,119
He wasn't getting either of the two medications he said he's been prescribed for his brain injury

347
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:19,935
None of his personal stuff that followed him from Indian River

348
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,983
His papers and photographs and notebooks

349
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,799
And also I need to emphasize

350
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:26,079
County Jail sucks

351
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,615
Go Google it

352
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,895
Cuyahoga County Jail

353
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,431
To the headline

354
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,711
Cleveland judge

355
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:34,527
I will not send people to jail after 6

356
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,319
Inmate dies in 4 months

357
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,135
Granted that was a post Joshua headline

358
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,671
But it was true that as well

359
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:44,255
County is not a place you want to spend even one extra day

360
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:47,327
Insult to injury Joshua had no money on his books

361
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:52,447
He couldn't buy any edible food or an extra t-shirt or normal toothbrush or minutes on a phone account

362
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:55,007
Why were they keeping him in County

363
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,543
What do they want with him

364
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:02,431
Yeah I think that's pretty much what's happening

365
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,223
Yeah

366
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:07,807
After it sat in jail for a month of Tuesdays and Thursdays

367
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:10,367
I emailed him hopefully to ask Anton age

368
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:13,183
Can you explain why Joshua still in County

369
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,719
His response

370
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:16,255
Joshua Stone County

371
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:19,071
Jim hope it wasn't Joshua's lawyer anymore

372
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,607
He said he'd look into it

373
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:27,263
Kim discovered a communication breakdown between the juvenile court and the county sheriff's office which one's the jail

374
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:33,919
Administratively no one knew or seem to notice or care that they didn't know who had jurisdiction over Josh

375
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:34,687
Joshua

376
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,479
But Jim said they clear it up

377
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,551
Josh and I developed a new routine

378
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,831
He called me and asked

379
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,111
Any word from history

380
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,391
Can I say something like

381
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:46,975
So apparently now everybody knows what's up and

382
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,767
Lady doctors for you

383
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,375
Nope that was early November

384
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:54,911
Late November

385
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,703
2 months after you've been sentenced

386
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:59,263
Joshua was still lousy and County

387
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:02,079
I'd run out of encouraging reports from the outside

388
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:07,711
Somebody at some point has to do something that's what that's all I know

389
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:13,343
Somebody at some point we'll have to do something they cannot keep you in County Jail indefinitely

390
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:16,416
I don't know what they doing

391
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,488
The metaphor could not have been clumsier

392
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:22,048
The government had forgotten about Joshua

393
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,608
In County Jail

394
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:26,400
Joshua was bored

395
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:31,264
Sometimes it be cooked in a Cell they all would be really 24 hours straight

396
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,568
I noticed

397
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,848
The Joshua

398
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,128
He wasn't raging

399
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,408
Women getting in fights

400
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:42,784
You know you sound like you sound pretty good

401
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:56,864
Cuz it's too much Tramadol is too much

402
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,656
Stressful donor

403
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,216
Interest less stressful there

404
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:09,664
Bingham County jail with a stress reliever

405
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:13,760
Just did their jobs as far as you could tell

406
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:15,296
People are nicer to one another

407
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:18,112
More relaxed with one another more supportive he said

408
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:24,512
Who's noticing what I noticed in the shift from middle school to high school just because one person didn't like you. Didn't mean

409
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:26,048
In the whole pod was against you

410
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:30,912
It was something of a revelation to him even white people do okay in here he said

411
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:47,040
The other young man I'd spoken to Leo Malik Davon white kid named wave

412
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:50,368
We've been in both odys and then an adult jail

413
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,392
But all agreed

414
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,928
That is it was

415
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:54,208
Dangerous as it was

416
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:56,256
Still better than juvenile

417
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,280
Less stress

418
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,584
The same feeling

419
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,120
Less stress more relaxed

420
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:05,472
Would stretch out and hold true when Joshua arrived at adult prison

421
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,008
Define Alicia

422
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:09,824
11.5 weeks after he been sentenced

423
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,128
Place called Allen Oakwood Correctional

424
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:13,408
In Lima Ohio

425
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,944
Set a 3 hour drive from Cleveland

426
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:16,736
Swiss Family couldn't visit

427
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:19,552
But Joshua was just happy to be sprung from his cell

428
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,112
She walking back and forth just cuz I can

429
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,976
Because he cooperated

430
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:29,536
An adult enemies lurked in adult prison

431
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,584
Joshua was put in protective custody

432
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:33,632
No heartless felons on his unit

433
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:36,960
He wasn't feuding with other inmates are getting into it with CEOs

434
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,752
Joshua marveled

435
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:42,080
There were fewer guards yet the inmates had more freedom

436
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:45,920
Part of it was maturity he said people trying to get home to your kids

437
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:48,992
The main reason the adult system was better he said

438
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:50,784
Was because it was harsher

439
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:53,344
Haider less forgiving ship all around

440
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:55,392
If you fight or act out

441
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,928
Throw your in on a CSA

442
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,232
Severe consequences rain down

443
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,536
Sissy

444
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:11,008
Another one

445
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:20,992
You're saying in juvenile the worst that could happen if you shut up in your room for the day

446
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,040
Transferring kissing adult prison

447
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:25,600
Are you Tony Toni Tone

448
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:33,536
Guards hero put their hands on you he said

449
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:35,072
They do not play

450
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:37,376
You could lose your phone calls or visitation

451
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:39,680
You can fester in the whole 4 months

452
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:42,496
The whole especially major deterrent he said

453
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,288
Nodejs

454
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:47,360
The longest your health in seclusion is 4 hours

455
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:48,896
Joshua said

456
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:51,200
Juveniles take advantage of that s***

457
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:51,968
The max

458
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:56,320
If you were to propose

459
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,856
Juvenile Justice Reform

460
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:59,392
It would be

461
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:02,208
That they should be stricter

462
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:07,328
You

463
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:10,144
The only understands who you feel me

464
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,960
County Jail was better than juvenile

465
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:15,776
Adult prison was better than County Jail

466
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,056
Harsher punishment

467
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,592
Was better than let at 8

468
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:22,176
Joshua's world had rotated 180

469
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:26,272
Adult prison was going to be like he said he would have skipped juvenile

470
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:29,600
You said to those cops and prosecutors back in 2014

471
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:30,624
Just buy me over

472
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,904
I'll take my chances

473
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:35,488
Corporation had gotten him nothing he said no real benefit

474
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,864
I said what about a shorter sentence though three armed robberies in adult Court

475
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:43,936
Good morning time in the teens or twenties event

476
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:46,240
He said look at my co-defendants

477
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,776
Half of them already out

478
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:54,688
Yeah you run your finger down the list of the 13 people named in the cut for an indictment bunch of them got two or three years

479
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:58,016
Only if you are serving more significant sentences

480
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:59,552
11 years 13 years

481
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,112
Joshua B. 9

482
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:08,768
To just come straight here he said that having my ass beaten odys for 3 years

483
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:16,960
Joshua was in prison

484
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:18,240
The six years ticking

485
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:20,032
For my purposes

486
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,056
In terms of plot

487
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,592
His story had ended

488
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,152
But he kept calling kept calling

489
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:26,432
And I kept answering

490
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:30,784
I just took a 10-minute break in fact because you called me while I was writing these sentences

491
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:34,624
I learned day-by-day what Joshua's life was turning into

492
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,416
On the cusp of 20 years old

493
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,696
In protective custody

494
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:42,816
State police officers near me

495
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,632
Lawyer

496
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,056
Pharmacy

497
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:59,968
About 60 people who couldn't mix with the general prison population in a different building across the street

498
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:01,760
Cops

499
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,808
Reasons I never fully understood a lot of whites

500
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:04,576
Supremacist

501
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,856
Aryan Brotherhood

502
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,672
Just said everyone seemed to get along okay

503
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,976
Abtech School

504
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,256
I got no problem with them

505
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,816
Anyways are you kind of had to get along

506
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:16,864
The unit was too small for anything else

507
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,936
Turn off phone calls from Indian River

508
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:22,240
I often hear hollering in the background

509
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:26,080
Now from Allen Correctional I can hear the soft click of billiard balls

510
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,872
Are pool table in the dining room

511
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,992
Joshua was the youngest on the potty said that he didn't feel like the adults around and we're dangerous

512
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:36,832
An adult in charge of the prison didn't feel like Joshua was dangerous

513
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,160
Odys Atty Joshua as a gang member

514
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:43,488
Reset the game coordinator for the adult prison system

515
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:46,560
How to chat with them checked out his history with tattoos

516
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:48,864
Did not tag him as gang affiliated

517
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:52,704
On a scale of 1 to 5 5 being supermax material

518
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:55,776
Joshua was designated a level 2 prisoner

519
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:59,616
Sacrifice of being a prisoner in protective custody

520
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:02,176
Does the closeness of the unit and the tedium

521
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:06,784
Joshua says he couldn't take advantage of some of the programs and apprenticeships across the street

522
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,320
Regine Pappas house

523
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:10,368
He was feeling the time

524
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,648
Feeling the time

525
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:12,416
But people

526
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:15,744
Joshua's intensely social

527
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,792
Is a talent for Gathering people

528
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,328
Pulling people towards him

529
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:21,120
Including people who can help him out

530
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:21,888
Acme

531
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,448
I do I'm small favors

532
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:26,496
Favors the reporter shouldn't really do

533
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:28,544
Connecting him to the outside world

534
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:30,592
Mostly by three-way phone calls

535
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:33,408
My most immediate benefit to Joshua was at

536
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,944
I like most of the people in his life

537
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:38,272
I could afford an endless supply of Global Tel Link minutes

538
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:40,576
Alright what's the number

539
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:42,112
2 + 6

540
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:44,672
Joshua want to contact

541
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:46,464
Continual contact

542
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,000
Usually with family

543
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:49,792
I became the operator

544
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,328
The Joshua

545
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:52,864
Yellow

546
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,400
Your granddad's on the phone

547
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:55,680
Hello

548
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:56,960
Hey grandson

549
00:28:57,728 --> 00:29:00,288
Joshua's troubles aren't news to his family obviously

550
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:02,848
Incarceration isn't news to them either

551
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,176
Even so it's heavy information when it comes

552
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:09,504
What's up man

553
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,648
I heard Mindy and Josh Mann

554
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,696
Break my heart

555
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:21,024
Your dad told me what happened

556
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,656
Joshua live with his grandfather for a year and is about 12

557
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:28,448
What you say

558
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:32,288
You say it's right

559
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:34,080
I'm good right now

560
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:37,152
Josh's relative said it was okay to use these recordings

561
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:39,712
Stanley's huge they live all over

562
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:43,552
In Cleveland of course but also in Florida California Jamaica

563
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:44,576
Skype

564
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:50,976
Funny little niece his great-grandmother his aunts and cousins parents sisters

565
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:51,744
His daughter

566
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:54,560
And every call he tells them he loves them

567
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:55,584
And they say it back

568
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,704
I love you

569
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:02,496
I love you too baby

570
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:10,688
When Josh was for his father was arrested by the DEA for conspiracy to distribute more than a thousand kg of marijuana and

571
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:11,456
And United States

572
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:13,760
Get along sentence in federal prison

573
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:16,320
His mother went to prison a couple years later

574
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:22,208
Once they were both locked up what happened was what you might imagine would happen to a kid longing for his absent parents

575
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,000
He floated from house to house

576
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,024
Miserable

577
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:28,352
Probably the most stable person in his life is his grandmother

578
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:30,144
She was legal guardian

579
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,192
He lived with her for long stretches growing up

580
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:35,520
I put you in the back to you member

581
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:44,736
Hello

582
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:51,136
By the time he was 13 Joshua began to paying at the Juvenile Court

583
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,672
Initially for petty stuff

584
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,976
Being unruly fighting at school

585
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:56,512
I got more serious

586
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,840
XIV was caught for strong arm robbery

587
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:01,632
And some friends mug are they new

588
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:04,960
Joshua sent to an odys residential facility

589
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:05,984
He escaped

590
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,776
Honda Brio with a friend

591
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,080
Call the sister from a gas station pay phone

592
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,872
She drove out to collect them

593
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,664
Once he was home

594
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,480
Heartless felons drug dealing guns

595
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:17,248
Strawberries

596
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,320
We held up the two BP is in the Popeyes

597
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,344
He was 15

598
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:27,744
50 Cent baby daughter was born

599
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,024
2 months later

600
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,328
The FBI came to get them

601
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:35,680
Hello

602
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:36,960
Hey Mami

603
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:42,848
Thank you your mommy 40 years old

604
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,920
Sometimes in the calls

605
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:51,296
It feels like the Master Clock of Joshua's immediate family is the criminal justice system itself

606
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:55,904
Continual pulse of court dates and visitation forms and commissary money

607
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:58,464
We come down there to drop the money off

608
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:07,936
Joshua knew I was recording these calls

609
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:10,496
Occasionally we discuss the content afterwards

610
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:11,264
Debrief

611
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,288
Mybatis relationship

612
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,080
Is open like that

613
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:15,616
Strikingly so

614
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:17,664
And you know I was rooting for him

615
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:19,456
Sometimes you call me

616
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,480
Just call me

617
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:26,624
I'm recording I don't know why

618
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:29,952
Fascinating to tell me

619
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,304
But

620
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:44,544
Yeah I got it on Friday

621
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:46,336
He was relieved

622
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:50,176
Joshua wrestled with the language arts portion of his GED twice before

623
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:57,088
Former odys guard who Joshua was a younger teenager had described him as impressionable

624
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:00,160
The kind of person who do good if he's around good

625
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,696
Too bad if he's around bad

626
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,536
Adult prison is filled by and large with adult criminals

627
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:09,888
I kept an antenna up for signs a Joshua might be listing toward Darkness

628
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:13,216
Sometimes I hear a hard blade of anger in his voice

629
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:15,264
He starts wearing more on the phone

630
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,056
I can really tell what that meant

631
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:19,104
Maybe was just more comfortable with me

632
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,152
Maybe it's just in a bad mood

633
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:23,712
On the positive side

634
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:27,040
Joshua become friends with an ex cop on the protective custody unit

635
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:31,392
A big guy who Joshua laughingly told me it was making his huge muscles even Huger

636
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,672
Working out all the time

637
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:34,208
Does ex-cop

638
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:35,488
Denayne Dixon

639
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:36,768
Hermes Cleveland

640
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:38,304
Jesse Nickerson case

641
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:42,912
The officer who taking Jesse to the park and pleaded guilty to a couple felonies as a result

642
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:45,216
Joshua really like the name

643
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:46,752
The new people in common

644
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:48,544
And today like Joshua

645
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,592
He's funny and charismatic today and told me

646
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,640
Feels like having a little brother around

647
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,456
Those interested in Janine's assessment

648
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:57,248
Once Joshua got out

649
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,808
Did you think Joshua could have an okay future

650
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,368
When that didn't include Perpetual incarceration

651
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:05,184
Right now at this point

652
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,744
Because why

653
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,328
Treason

654
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:16,960
Negativity

655
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,848
I hated this answer

656
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:27,968
Because Joshua was bound over he would now have an adult felony record

657
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:32,576
Joshua knew that would react the most long-term damage to his prospects once he got out

658
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,928
Tattoos began creeping back onto his hands and neck and face

659
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:43,584
All the places you had them removed before

660
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:56,384
I spent many phone calls looking up people on the internet for Joshua people he knew from

661
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,432
Cleveland County Jail

662
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:00,736
Charges he was asking

663
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,016
Are they going to trial

664
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,344
People who already been sentenced

665
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:06,624
How long they got

666
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:11,488
Which institution can give me the inmate number tell me the zip code again

667
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:12,768
Who's writing to them

668
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:14,304
Making contact

669
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:19,424
But some of the people he was having me look up their cases sounded terrible

670
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,216
Premeditated murder

671
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:23,776
A shot and then burned in a car

672
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:26,336
I asked him what are you doing

673
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:30,688
Looks like what you did with your pass is

674
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,248
That I'm not here to judge nobody

675
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:38,624
Like nobody is perfect everybody in this world made bad choices before

676
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:45,536
Sim Indiana

677
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:49,888
So might be there for a long time so you can suck you need

678
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:52,192
Good friends

679
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,032
Turn on lights lights

680
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:01,664
Sometimes a good friend

681
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,392
He was being kind

682
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,232
And I understood he was trying to give other people what he himself needed

683
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:17,536
Reminder that he wasn't a piece of s***

684
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:18,816
Throughs forgivable

685
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:19,584
Redeemable

686
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:24,960
He was taking a position far more Humane than the one that Criminal Justice System had taken with him

687
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:28,032
Try to think for a minute about why I was getting angry

688
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:32,128
I realized this community of inmates who was stitching together

689
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:33,152
Was worrying me

690
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:34,176
When you got out

691
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:37,504
So I think my reaction and having is like

692
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:43,392
Could you just please stay the f*** away from some criminals for a while so that

693
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:45,952
I'm not falling back into that world

694
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:49,280
And I think that's why I'm having this reaction which is it

695
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:54,400
Stairs to you

696
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:57,216
Sometimes you send me so that's why I

697
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:59,008
It is like like it's not that

698
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:03,104
Feisty

699
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:18,720
It's tempting to think that all this prison and Punishment lead somewhere

700
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:20,512
But there's a goal we can point to

701
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:22,560
People who commit crimes

702
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:27,424
Maybe if they turn their lives around a Civic reward awaits them back home

703
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:29,472
For someone like Joshua

704
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:32,288
It's hard to imagine what that reward would be

705
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,384
Ms Turner I told me the young men she's worked with inside the prison

706
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:40,480
Could you been able to crack open their feelings make themselves vulnerable

707
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:42,784
She's watched many of them come home

708
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:44,576
And then crumble

709
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:48,416
Because they're back and violent neighborhoods where they need armor to survive

710
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,208
She told me

711
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:56,608
The most successful ones I hate to say the ones that are communicating that they actually feel Joy

712
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:58,656
Are the ones who went back to the streets

713
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:00,704
Joshua new

714
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:06,336
You said it to me many times his only chance of survival was to never go back to Cleveland

715
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:09,408
If you returned home he was going to end up hurting someone

716
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:10,944
Or getting hurt

717
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:17,344
Right back at the Justice Center

718
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:35,776
The year we were in Cleveland

719
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:36,800
2017

720
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:40,384
More than 13000 felony cases move through the Justice Center

721
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,456
Brutalist Tower downtown 26 stories high

722
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:45,760
Hundreds of people coming in every day

723
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:47,552
Wound up emotional

724
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:59,072
Maybe watching a little TV will help them relax

725
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:03,168
That was the idea when the court had TVs installed in the waiting areas near the courtroom

726
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:06,496
On the 15th floor an older woman's weeping

727
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:08,288
To retreat into the ladies room

728
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:10,080
I can hear howling in there

729
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:12,128
Comes back out still crying

730
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,712
A young man maybe it's her son is folded over head in his hands

731
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:19,040
Write about them

732
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:22,880
The Food Network

733
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,440
That's the courthouse soundtrack

734
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:28,000
Clean kitchen cupboards well-stocked

735
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,584
Administrative judge auditioned other options

736
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:32,608
The news

737
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:33,632
Took setting

738
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:37,728
History Channel and boom there's something about the Nazis in the concentration camps

739
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,800
Sound of Animal Planet Cartoon Network

740
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:41,824
In the end

741
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,360
The most reliably soothing

742
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:44,640
Food Network

743
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:46,432
It does lolyou

744
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:47,712
You forget for a moment

745
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:50,272
How much is happening all over this building

746
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:54,368
Sturdy an attorney or the mean to hire an attorney

747
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:59,232
In the space of a year all those thousands of cases begin here in the arrangement room

748
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:01,792
Crucial decisions are made in the arraignment room

749
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:05,632
The judge chooses your lawyer if you can't afford one you can't usually

750
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:12,032
Signs your case to a courtroom future Bond

751
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:18,944
Adjusted up or down if you want keeps you in jail or lets you out

752
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:24,320
Didn't really quite understand it

753
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:29,952
Dozens of people are waiting their turn with this judge available at the ready big pilot case holders

754
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:36,352
Pakistan Embassy

755
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,520
Asking questions slows the Rhythm

756
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:45,312
Toyota Sienna

757
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:48,896
Arraignment is the Justice Center intake valve

758
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:51,200
The Russian cases now process

759
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:57,600
They all wish upstairs into court rooms

760
00:40:58,112 --> 00:41:00,672
About 2133 words

761
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:04,000
But enclosed many thousands of plea Bargains this year

762
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:05,024
Knowingly

763
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:11,680
Voluntarily

764
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:12,960
Are you doing this voluntarily

765
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:19,360
Involuntarily knowingly intelligently and voluntarily made

766
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:23,712
Floors down judge Daniel Gaul just re-elected by the way

767
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:25,760
Tell the defendant to pull up his pants

768
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:27,296
The guy's been in jail

769
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:29,344
Don't have a belt

770
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:35,232
Pull your trousers up

771
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:42,400
19th floor at Ryals just beginning jury selection

772
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:43,936
The jury pool

773
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:44,704
All white

774
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:46,752
C-41 woman is black

775
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:48,800
Jefferson it at a law firm

776
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:51,360
The defense attorney starts asking her questions

777
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:52,384
She's awesome

778
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,199
I think I have to go full disclosure hair

779
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:58,271
I am not emotionally

780
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,599
Ready to participate

781
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:04,415
In our legal system I have

782
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:05,951
So much

783
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:09,023
Personal disappointment

784
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:10,047
In

785
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:13,887
The inequities in our system

786
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:20,287
Ground floor in the hallway outside the doors to the county jail

787
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:21,567
A crowd is waiting

788
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:23,871
Fermenting Evan came to walkout

789
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:27,455
He spent 22 years in prison for murder he didn't do

790
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:29,759
People are singing Crying

791
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:31,039
Nacm

792
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:31,807
Exonerated

793
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:41,791
Radiohead

794
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:43,583
Repair

795
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:45,631
Outside on the street

796
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:48,447
Police officers from all over the county in the state

797
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:52,031
March in the annual Memorial parade

798
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:59,455
Honoring to local police officers who died during the past year in the line of duty

799
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:00,735
Separate incidents

800
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:03,295
The boat hit by cars while working on the highway

801
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:19,679
Backup on 18

802
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:21,983
Ninja Turtles courtroom sentencing

803
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:24,543
The brother of a murdered woman gives a statement

804
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:27,615
He talks quietly angrily for a few minutes

805
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:30,943
Is he glad the defendant is going to suffer every day in prison

806
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:34,783
I'm just act like you are

807
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:37,087
Seems like maybe he's winding down

808
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:39,135
And then he launches himself like a missile

809
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:40,159
At the defendant

810
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:49,375
Another sentencing for triple murder in a barbershop

811
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:50,911
The capital case

812
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:52,703
The courtrooms crammed

813
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:56,031
Relatives of the victims and of the defendant kill the gallery

814
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:58,079
The media set up in the jury box

815
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:59,615
Their cameras and microphones

816
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:02,431
Amanda and Alvin Wright comes forward

817
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:03,711
He was a victim in the case

818
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:07,039
I've been cutting someone's hair when shooting exploded the shop

819
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:09,343
These are people in New get killed

820
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:13,183
Alvin Wright had testified for the prosecution at trial

821
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:16,511
Now just before the judge issues her final decision

822
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:19,327
Whether she's going to sentence the defendant is 21

823
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,095
To death

824
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:22,399
Alvin Wright addresses the court

825
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:24,959
How situations f***** up

826
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:28,799
I mean

827
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,407
Guess what I'm dealing with though

828
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:36,223
The judge tells him to court of law

829
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:37,759
There's different words

830
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:38,783
Go ahead

831
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:40,319
I mean

832
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:42,367
The situation is messed up

833
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:45,695
List of situations

834
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:49,791
Do I agree with

835
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:52,095
Putting them down like a dog

836
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:53,631
No

837
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:00,031
Ain't nobody win

838
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:04,383
You put it down we don't get nobody back

839
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:06,943
Nothing

840
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:10,015
Just like we did we just keep losing

841
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:13,855
Dis black people. You just keep losing

842
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:17,439
You got all these white people right here

843
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:21,535
They looking at us like us like me in the zoo

844
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:23,583
This real s***

845
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:26,655
Atlanta Zoo

846
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:32,543
Nah, I'm just I'm just looking at the big picture up

847
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:35,615
Look at this

848
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:38,175
That's life

849
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:41,759
We got to do better than that

850
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:01,983
Best kept secret in the Justice Center is in the lobby it stuck between two pillars near the elevators

851
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:04,799
Looks like a wheel you might say to raffler bingo game

852
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:07,359
Three functions as a suggestion box

853
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:09,407
You can send kites for the staff

854
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:11,199
Administrative judge will get them

855
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:12,223
He's got the key

856
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:18,367
Hang around this building for your I have many suggestions just off the top of my head

857
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:20,671
Cool minimalist

858
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:25,023
Don't file charges on to a single crime when one charge will do

859
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:27,071
Don't overcharge the force that guilty plea

860
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:30,399
Don't lock anyone up unless they're demonstrable violent

861
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:33,727
Admit that police officers lie under oath

862
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:38,079
Get out of the punishment business and turned for the Urgent problem of fairness

863
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:43,199
Keep obsessive track of who exactly is being charged with what crime

864
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:47,039
Other setting shakes out and what their life looks like in 3 years or 5 years

865
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:50,111
Take me to the color of their skin and how much money they have

866
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:53,183
Don't share what you learn in a drawer and forget about it

867
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:56,511
Don't be insensibly tempted as Charles Dickens wrote

868
00:46:56,767 --> 00:47:00,863
Into a loose way of letting bad things alone to take their own bad course

869
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:04,191
Cops prosecutors judges lawyers

870
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:07,007
Call out the colleagues who degrade your profession

871
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:11,615
Find attorneys in public defenders at least twice as much as you're paying them now

872
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:18,015
Judges stop choosing attorneys citizens mix up the bench stop electing judges County

873
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:21,855
Overall slowdown doubt yourself

874
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:24,415
I know how corny the sounds but

875
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:28,511
Imagine that every person in the elevator car is part of your own family

876
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:31,583
And reflect on the far-reaching paying of prosecution

877
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:35,423
Also don't take anyone's mouth shut in court that happened

878
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:37,983
And consider getting rid of the grand jury

879
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:40,287
I could cram that will to bursting

880
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:42,591
If I'm only allowed one suggestion

881
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:43,615
I say

882
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:46,175
Let's all accept that something's gone wrong

883
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:47,967
Let's make that our premise

884
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:53,855
Many times during a reporting in Cleveland when I ask about problems are reforms

885
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:55,135
Someone would throw out

886
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:57,695
Well let's remember we have the best system in the world

887
00:47:58,463 --> 00:48:00,511
County prosecutor Michael O'Malley said it to me

888
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:04,351
I just think people need to realize we have the best criminal justice system in the world

889
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:10,495
The people who operate that system know about the wards and they can see we can always improve

890
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:13,567
But generally they're not chomping for an overhaul

891
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:17,663
The kind of Extreme Makeover that the data is screaming at us to undertake

892
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:19,199
We've all heard the stats

893
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:20,991
That we here in the United States

894
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:25,343
Imprison a vastly higher percentage of our population than any other country in the world

895
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:26,879
We are number one

896
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:29,183
The numbers are well-documented

897
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,463
Wildly out of whack

898
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:32,255
And unprecedented in our history

899
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,559
Also will document

900
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:35,583
Inequity

901
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:39,167
Every joint in the skeleton of our criminal justice system

902
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:40,959
Is Greece by racial discrimination

903
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:46,079
Compared to white people who committed the same crime and who have similar criminal histories

904
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:48,127
Black people and other people of color

905
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:54,527
