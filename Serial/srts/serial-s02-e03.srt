Previously

12
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:25,600
Cereal

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,744
We're like man is he like CIA or what he look at us and didn't he jumped for

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,816
Behind our bike we thought he's drunk

15
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:36,352
Kill you

16
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:41,216
Amusement of being quickly became very

17
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:45,056
Apparent to us that the Taliban new f****** b*******

18
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,616
He's in Pakistan

19
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,856
From This American Life and WBEZ Chicago its serial one story told me by week

20
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:04,256
I'm Sarah Koenig

21
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:17,056
Right after Bowe Bergdahl first went missing from his Outpost in Afghanistan

22
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:22,432
Word came down that the higher-ups wanted someone from Bo's platoon second platoon Blackfoot company

23
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:25,504
Record a message to Bill that they play on local radio

24
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:28,320
They wanted it to be a voice but would recognize

25
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:30,368
So the guy Bo was friends with

26
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,904
Guy from Louisiana

27
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,208
You have a very thick Louisiana accent

28
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:39,584
So basically

29
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:40,608
Chi

30
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,680
She went up there and I guess he didn't like it

31
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:47,520
They came down and they got me that's Josh quarter originally from Pennsylvania

32
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,824
Didn't want to make a message to Bo

33
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:54,688
He says he felt a little disloyal to his platoon calling out to the guy who is causing them such turmoil

34
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:58,784
But they did the baby, come they brought me up there two officers brought me up there

35
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,112
And they put a piece of paper in front of me which is a script

36
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,648
And said read this

37
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:05,696
What was the script

38
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,232
I was like

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,120
It was It was kind of cheesy to it was like hey Bo this is Josh we really miss you

40
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,400
I know we we just

41
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:18,496
Want you to come back we hope you're safe we hope everything's going okay

42
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,288
You know so come back

43
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,848
I guess I kept thinking later on that my

44
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:29,248
Like for the entire five years movie the same thing

45
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,784
Going on

46
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,832
In Pakistan and Afghanistan

47
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,624
Talon bow to come home

48
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:37,696
Safe to say bone ever heard the message

49
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,976
Also safe to say

50
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,536
Was trying really hard to come home

51
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,328
His first year in captivity

52
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:45,888
Starts with an escape and ends with an escape

53
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:48,448
Like shity bookends to a terrible year

54
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,872
In between the Escape spell was learning necessary Twisted lessons of survival

55
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,920
How to smile when you're in agony

56
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:00,224
But if you ask for something such as water

57
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,808
You're likely to get less of it or less of something else such as food

58
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:09,952
If you're severely dehydrated you can't really drink your own urine because it turns into a salty Brown sludge

59
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,512
The filth and stink are your best weapons

60
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:15,584
More disgusting you are at the less your captors want to come hear you

61
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,144
Which means you can scroll things away in your bed clothes

62
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,008
The smaller and weaker you can make yourself the more likely the Taliban are to let you alone

63
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,824
And as painful as it is to be forgotten

64
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,872
Ultimately that's what you want

65
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,320
Not even an animal

66
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,160
Picture someone taking a bag

67
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:45,024
The closet shutting the door and just forgetting about it

68
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:04,480
Melissa Ann jeans a drone with a commander in charge of keeping go prisoner up until 2013 on Sunday was killed in a dream

69
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,248
Gun strike

70
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,648
Give me food

71
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,047
Other guys

72
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,959
Literally just

73
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,031
And got

74
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:37,759
Back in Afghanistan the storm of search-and-rescue operations for Bo had slowed and then doing.

75
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,831
They keep your eyes and ears out of course

76
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:43,391
Military have to call it

77
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:46,463
Elbow was in the worst place he could be

78
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,255
Anyone who's going to rescue them

79
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:51,583
Locked in a room across the border in Pakistan

80
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:59,519
It seemed like a very strong possibility that he was a Taliban sympathizer I'll put it that way and it seemed that

81
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,055
That she

82
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,383
The unrated version is like what a f****** a******

83
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,407
You know

84
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:11,295
That was Mark balls first casual assessment of bow we heard the early reports it would walk off

85
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,599
What's a lot of people's assessment

86
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,927
That's understandable based on the information dripping out of the time

87
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:20,767
An early propaganda video reports that boat converted to Islam

88
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,863
Yeah and then they remember there was nothing of him like

89
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:29,215
But there has been there have been some kind of reporting that he was riding around on a horse

90
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,495
I remember that too

91
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:33,311
I'm just looking at 1 from the Daily Mail

92
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,591
And it says

93
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:40,991
One of his captors said that he converted to his mom it was going under the name Stella and was very relaxed in her come

94
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,015
Anthony unquote

95
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:42,783
It has

96
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:49,183
It has also been claimed that Bergdahl was so trusted by his kidnappers but they let him sleep without restraints and go bird and rabbit hunting with

97
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,463
Old British rifle

98
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:55,583
Oh you know what that reminds me I heard another one that he played soccer

99
00:05:56,095 --> 00:06:00,191
Information like this I learned that intelligence analysts refer to it as stray voltage

100
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:03,007
By that they mean it's almost certainly untrue

101
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:09,919
But still added up to people judging from the outside it didn't look good Mark said it made him feel like maybe Bo wasn't someone who

102
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:10,943
He should be caring about

103
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:14,783
What does the opposite feeling usually get when you hear about a p o w

104
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:21,695
Then after both came back and was in Germany recovering Mark talk to someone in the until world who knew what was going on

105
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,999
I actually remember somebody telling me

106
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,047
Oh yeah he's

107
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,071
He's doing

108
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,679
That's weird I thought he was

109
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,751
Call that guy

110
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:41,663
He's like he's not in this was during the jury went all the Press recording was about

111
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:44,991
You know how I like mentally damaged she was and how he was

112
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,015
Gradually

113
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,575
In a reactor that into the world and

114
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,879
Everyone's I cautioning like

115
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:55,231
And I don't expect him to pop up on TV anytime soon cuz he's severely

116
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,511
Traumatized

117
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,839
And then I was also hearing that like privately he was

118
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:03,167
I mean maybe all that stuff was true and I'm sure it is but

119
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,471
At the same time he was doing a lot of

120
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,775
Prefixes like wait he's

121
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,615
It doesn't sound like a Trader

122
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:16,479
When I finally heard Beau talk about his time with the Taliban

123
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,759
I thought no

124
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,551
He does not sound like a traitor

125
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,975
As brutal as both first year in captivity was

126
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,511
At least he had plans

127
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,303
His single-minded purpose

128
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,839
Was to get out

129
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:34,399
Asbestos Pokemon call the first Escape

130
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:40,543
You don't have the one where he ran 20 or 30 feet before I got tackled have in the first week he was in town in custody

131
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:47,711
Taliban fighters by the way have confirmed that bowed it escaped once briefly early on and then again for a longer time

132
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,735
Roughly a year later

133
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:52,831
That first week both as he was being held at House of some kind

134
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:57,183
His feet were tied with ropes a chain was wrapped in several loops around his wrist

135
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:03,839
He said he noticed that the previous morning a car had arrived with water and as soon as it did everyone went inside and

136
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,119
Another room for tea

137
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,423
So when the car came again with the water

138
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,959
Who says he saw his chance

139
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:16,127
You managed to manipulate the slack in the chain so that he could slip it over his knuckles he untied his feet

140
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:22,015
Doors of the room he was in relaxed from the outside with a thick wire to stick his hand through the crack to undo it

141
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,391
Sticking my hand out I mean good grief

142
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,439
If anyone was standing outside

143
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,231
Like they would have fully seen

144
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,023
Me fiddling with the damn liar

145
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,815
Basically trying to open the door

146
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,351
I know when does c

147
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:42,751
He runs outside turns right and then realizes he's in some kind of shallow Valley or Plateau he's 3

148
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:49,151
Houses about 200 yards off starts running is Shoeless he says there's mostly Jagged rocks underfoot but he spray

149
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:55,551
Prince's best he can at the first house he see some kids

150
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,575
The house

151
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:59,647
I see a woman come running out the date

152
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:00,927
She like

153
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:03,743
Seasoning does like that one footed light

154
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,279
Shutterstock

155
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,303
Staying inside

156
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,607
Runs back in the house

157
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:12,959
He keeps going is a group of men standing around the men also see him

158
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:18,847
Temple runs towards passes the second house comes to the third decides to climb onto the roof

159
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,895
And I get to the top of the roof

160
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,943
There's like a mud puddle there

161
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:27,295
And I'm staying low and you are basically to slide onto the roof

162
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,319
Happy Feet

163
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,599
You're covered in mud

164
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:34,463
And I like rolled a few times to try and cover myself weekly more mud

165
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,511
And I don't

166
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,327
I meant find him up there lead him back down

167
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,351
Is it

168
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,631
Interesting

169
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,423
I told you that's why I get to the

170
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:49,055
I guess the old lady from the house like

171
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,079
Old woman

172
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:50,847
Dixie House

173
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,127
I come out at

174
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:52,895
Commotion

175
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:55,711
Yeah I know he's like young guys are in everybody's like

176
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,247
Walking loudly

00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:03,391
This old woman comes up to me and she's like tries to like start

179
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,951
Like trying to wipe the mud off my face

180
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,535
They want young guys grabs her by that like arms

181
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,583
What kind of trucks are behind them

182
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,143
She like yells out of

183
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,935
Saying like leave me off

184
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,543
Start to finish the Escape lasted maybe 10 or 15 minutes Bo says

185
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,591
The aftermath was severe

186
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:25,919
They brought go back to where they've been holding him and when's evening came

187
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,967
Who says they beat him with a rubber hose

188
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:33,599
First it was one guy who spoke some English you twirl and twirl the hose and then whack it against both feet

189
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,671
Horoscopo covered his feet with his hands he wack his hands

190
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:40,255
He doesn't know exactly how long that lasted but it was a long while he says

191
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:44,095
The next morning a whole group of men came in with a guy who seem to be an elder

192
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,399
Nail tip turns hitting ball with the hose

193
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,191
Until the older man called them off

194
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,471
Turn

195
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,263
And then that evening

196
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,847
Those things was evening he's not sure since he was blindfolded this whole time

197
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:55,871
They moved them

198
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,663
A movement to a new place

199
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,431
Because

200
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,711
Pretty sure

201
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,991
Ser Lake out

202
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:04,063
You saw where we were or someone might have seen him

203
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,855
So we got to move

204
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:09,439
I'm running a new place how are you

205
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,279
Imprisoned or how did they continue

206
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,887
In the new place they

207
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,703
Put me on a

208
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,239
Afghan bed and

209
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,263
Change my

210
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,311
Feet

211
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,871
To the end of the bed and change my hands

212
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:31,199
Today is basically spread eagle

213
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,479
On the bed

214
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,063
That's so expensive

215
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,087
Basically

216
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,879
Majoria next 3 months

217
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:43,999
Three months but was chained spread eagle to a bed and blindfolded

218
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:47,583
It was allowed to get up twice a day to use a toilet he says that's it

219
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:51,167
In a statement bow-routt is released as part of his legal case

220
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:56,543
He said that because of the Heat and sweat his body got sore and raw where it was in contact with the bed

221
00:11:57,055 --> 00:12:00,895
Is eyes burn from the pressure of the blindfold he can never wipe the salt from them

222
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:05,759
He developed open wounds on his ankles and infection which into spread to his forehead

223
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:10,623
They beat the bottoms of his feet and other parts of his body with a copper cable

224
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:17,279
Ghostbuster came a day when he tried to walk and his guards saw his legs were shaking from weakness after that they rearranged when it is

225
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,047
His arms

226
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:22,143
Secured it down my side instead of over his head which allowed him to at least sit up

227
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,471
The room had dirt walls in a dirt-floor bus as

228
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:28,543
Every three or four weeks you could shower and wash his clothes

229
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,103
By the time 6 months head

230
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,383
Had diarrhea

231
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,455
You would have diarrhea for roughly three and a half years

232
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:41,855
No toilet paper or regular access to water most of the time his food with scant and came unpredictably

233
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:46,207
In the broadest Strokes his captivity consisted of twins hormones

234
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,999
Isolation and sickness

235
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:54,399
Or as well as principal military degree for describe it there were roughly three phases to post captivity Phase 1

236
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,167
Torture

237
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:57,471
Phase 2 abuse phase 3

238
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,359
Privation

239
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,919
How much lighter too much Darkness

240
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,455
Randomness

241
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:10,271
Where is the way

242
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:12,319
Your nerves into the ground

243
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:13,599
Yeah

244
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:22,815
Eeyore

245
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,351
Am I going to be able to

246
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:27,423
Go to the bathroom

247
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:30,239
Without some kind of problem

248
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:38,431
The conversations between Beau and Mark started just a few months after both came back

249
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:43,039
Botox a lot about how he's numb or distant or disconnected

250
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:46,367
Which actually has the benefit of helping him talk about what happened

251
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:50,719
Still the details about the worst episodes are sometimes hard to say

252
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,743
And hard for Mark

253
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:52,511
To take in

254
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,559
As a as a story it's

255
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:00,191
It's really it's overwhelming

256
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:04,287
And I can comprehend it in little bits and pieces

257
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:10,943
Like the isolated stuff as it goes along these details that you're giving me each one of them make sense

258
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,711
You know

259
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,991
And they're kind of

260
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,295
Not that hard to

261
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,367
To imagine cuz you're good at describing it

262
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:22,975
But they when you accumulate them all together and you think about this

263
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:25,279
Stretch of time and you think about

264
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:32,703
Just day-in-and-day-out if that's going to become sort of incomprehensibly

265
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:34,751
Dark

266
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:35,519
You know

267
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,151
Just

268
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:45,759
And I understand why they guys this year guys in the psychologists were so

269
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:49,087
Surprised that you weren't a total vegetable you know

270
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,415
Cuz I think that that's our

271
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,231
That would have been enough

272
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,791
To basically put

273
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,863
95% of people in a

274
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,423
Turn them into potatoes

275
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,823
But was being held by the haqqanis

276
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:14,175
A group run by very powerful pashtun family allowed with the Taliban

277
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:21,087
They're based in North waziristan which is in Pakistan's tribal region bordering Afghanistan

278
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:26,719
Agreed to hold boat for the Taliban and the guy in charge of Bose physical person was Melissa MaGee

279
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:31,071
A half-dozen times over the years

280
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:36,959
In all those who is kept and maybe eight different locations different compounds different rooms

281
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:38,495
Made of mud or cement

282
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:44,383
Especially at the beginning the Taliban question him

283
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,967
But he said they weren't what you might normally think of as an interrogation

284
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:52,063
The questions were strange and sometimes incoherent

285
00:15:55,135 --> 00:16:01,279
You're the officer is on your face how do they get their prostitutes

286
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:07,679
You know they're trying to find

287
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:16,895
Obama gay

288
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:19,711
I asked you about

289
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:22,271
How good a camera

290
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,951
Thankfully the guy who did speak English

291
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,231
And

292
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:39,935
Information

293
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:44,031
And so you never really ask me anything

294
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,311
That was

295
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:53,759
One time you asked me how many bombs

296
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:00,415
This hodgepodge a perfectly reasonable questions

297
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,439
How did the drones work

298
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,487
And then it kind of crazy talk

299
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:06,047
Is it true All American women are prostitutes

300
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,327
But they sleep with animals

301
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:10,399
It makes you wonder why they're just trying to rile though up

302
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:15,263
Or whether their understanding of our world is as paltry as our understanding of theirs

303
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,311
Something I learned really quickly

304
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:20,895
If you show hesitation in telling them something

305
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,943
I think they're onto something

306
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:30,111
But if you if they ask you a question and you just start talking to him like you're talking to a normal person

307
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,159
Make it extremely suspicious

308
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:38,559
Because they seemed well if he is has no problem telling me this and there's something wrong with that information

309
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,095
Sweeter way

310
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,631
They pretty much assume you're lying

311
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:45,471
Which is maybe why they didn't really pressing too hard on any of this stuff

312
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,775
High-ranking Taliban told us

313
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,823
True reporter sami yousaf zai

314
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:53,919
But ya didn't give them any useful intelligence or Corporation

315
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:59,039
Besides both said the Taliban get most of their information information they consider more trustworthy

316
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:01,855
From Afghan interpreters work with us forces

317
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,415
Valley wasn't Inwood Inu

318
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,951
It was in the sheer fact of him

319
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:08,255
A US Soldier that belong to them

320
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:12,095
Information for me wasn't like their main priority

321
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,399
Videos out of me

322
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,447
What they wanted to do

323
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:19,007
You might have seen some of these videos on the internet

324
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:22,335
Who said they made probably a dozen of them that were never released

325
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,871
But a small handful were

326
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:27,455
Both of the Taliban spend a lot of time making them

327
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,735
The morale-boosting

328
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:32,831
Plus he says the Taliban love to embarrass the United States anyway they can

329
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:36,671
But you can't make too many videos are released too many

330
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:38,975
Because every time you do you're exposing yourself

331
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:43,583
Details about the staging or someone's accent of the production values of the dacor

332
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,375
Might give your location away

333
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:49,727
Rosa said sometimes make a number of videos during the same shoot

334
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:53,055
Changing the backdrop for his clothes or his hair is beard

335
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:56,895
Different kind of videos have been taken at different times and different locations

336
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:00,479
Bose videos spoke English

337
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:03,295
Western educated had a slight British accent

338
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:07,391
He come into boys room always with the same irritating greeting

339
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,695
What's up

340
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,607
Freddy Fazbear

341
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:18,143
Hey what's up

342
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:25,311
I'm going to take a video of you

343
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:29,151
Think about what you're going to say

344
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,943
President Obama

345
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,319
Talk about bike

346
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,111
Call Carol home

347
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,439
How badly.

348
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,327
Stuff like that

349
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,119
Answer

350
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,911
Did you have to work on your answers

351
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,775
Talk to me

352
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:01,407
Turn the camera on

353
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:09,087
After that they wrote everything down

354
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,415
1

355
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:16,255
As my country farm and has treated their Muslim prisoners

356
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,047
In background

357
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,119
Guantanamo Bay

358
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,399
Abu ghraib

00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:24,191
The other Secret

360
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,263
Open round the world

361
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:29,311
But I bear Witness

362
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,615
Discontinued

363
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:38,015
In this video bows wearing a camouflage jacket helmet

364
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,039
And sunglasses

365
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,575
He looks really weird

366
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:47,231
He said the sunglasses were so you couldn't see his eyes reading the paper and also maybe because the Taliban think sunglasses look cool

367
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:53,119
Which grade and take pictures of naked

368
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:58,751
Leather dog barking at me inviting me if I country is Don Ramon's on Prison

369
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:02,335
Nails with diamonds

370
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,895
Who says the bed he was chained to spread eagle

371
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:06,431
Was just off to his left

372
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:09,247
Videos of the steam a lot

373
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:13,087
How well he's being treated compared to how the u.s. trees Taliban prisoners

374
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:17,440
How are we going to do in treating you

375
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:21,536
He says how are mujahideen treating you

376
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:24,096
Better than

377
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:26,912
A regular household

378
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:27,680
America

379
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:31,264
The videos also hit other common Taliban talking points

380
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:37,664
One of which is that the US government is lying to the American public about how many American soldiers have been killed in Afghanistan

381
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:40,224
Jamaican stream Daytona 200

382
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,016
Escobar

383
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,624
Mobile

384
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:53,536
I believe the death toll of Americans in Afghanistan is higher than what the government

385
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:54,816
Loud

386
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:56,352
The world snow

387
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:03,008
The Army has moral guidelines for how a soldier is supposed to behave if he or she is captured by the enemy

388
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,800
Call the code of conduct

389
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,592
It says among other things

390
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:12,224
If I am captured I will continue to resist by all means available I will make every effort to escape

391
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,088
I will give no information or take part in any action which might be harmful to my comrades

392
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,672
And when questioned besides name rank and serial number quote

393
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:24,512
I will evade answering further questions to the utmost of my ability

394
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:29,888
I will make no oral or written statements disloyal to my country and its allies or harmful to their cause

395
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:36,288
Soldiers I talk to you from Bo's Battalion told me the fact that Bo appears in these videos at all

396
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:39,104
It is answering their questions repeating their talking points

397
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:42,432
That right there is an obvious violation of the code of conduct

398
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,808
They said even if someone has a gun to your head and by the way both says there were guys with guns on his video shoot

399
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,880
You don't participate in the enemies propaganda campaign

400
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:56,256
Well that's actually an interpretation of the code that military officials do not agree with

401
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:59,328
That is not the standard the Army is asking soldiers to live up to

402
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:02,912
You are not expected to die refusing to make a video

403
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:08,032
In the first and second Gulf War is American pows shut up and propaganda videos to

404
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:10,080
Military didn't blame them for it

405
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:14,176
I understand that as a prisoner you're going to be compelled to do things you don't want to do

406
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:19,040
And also while the US military isn't getting courage you to be in a video if you're captured

407
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:23,136
There is an upside to being filmed your government has proof you're alive

408
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,952
A military hearing on Bose case

409
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:28,256
Terrence Russell the guy who debriefed bow

410
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:31,328
Said Indies videos bow did what he had to do

411
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:36,960
And that is the videos go on you can see him getting better at resisting at minimizing the propaganda value

412
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:43,360
In the very first video the Taliban released in July 2009

413
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:45,408
About three weeks after bow disappeared

414
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,736
Who is sitting in front of a table with some green liquid in a big mug

415
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:50,528
Marcus bow what it was

416
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,552
Mountain Dew

417
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:57,184
I give you one of those people off in that country

418
00:23:57,696 --> 00:24:00,512
It's in this video that bow explains how he was captured

419
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,816
Are you listening

420
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:06,400
Who captured outside of Miss Stella

421
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,472
What were you doing

422
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:11,520
I was

423
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:12,544
Benign

424
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:13,824
Paw Patrol

425
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,872
I was sneaking behind the troll

426
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:21,504
This is why they reported back in the US

427
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,880
Debo said he was caught while lagging behind on a patrol and again a bunch of the soldiers I talked to mention this

428
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,928
That when they heard it and made them mad

429
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,976
Is it such obvious nonsense

430
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:36,352
U.s. soldiers do not lag behind on Patrols in Afghanistan and then just disappear without anyone noticing

431
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,376
Katana thing

432
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,752
So when they heard it was in the video some of them saw it as evidence that bill was lying about what happened

433
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,544
But was lying

434
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,336
He says of course he was lying

435
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:49,664
He says he knew that Americans listening would know it was bologna

436
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,688
That was the point

437
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,736
Chinese one-way in the video

438
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:55,040
HB telling people hey

439
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:57,600
Video

440
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,256
Esprit rehearse

441
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:07,072
And has nothing to do with

442
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:11,424
Was it all for Hurst

443
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,448
Or staged

444
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,568
So none of it was you

445
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,384
You the real you

446
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,944
I mean would you edit

447
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,784
Desperately trying to figure out how to

448
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:33,696
Cooperating with them and yet cooperating him

449
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:44,448
Guys guarding Bo don't speak English which makes sense why would they

450
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:51,104
But also that same high-ranking Taliban told us they don't necessarily want someone like near anyone who speaks English

451
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,968
Because they might say something just inadvertently and it could help him with an escape

452
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:02,624
Even if they couldn't really talk to him though says they interacted with him they messed with them they throw things at him

453
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,696
AK-47 Adam just kidding

454
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:12,096
Once they tried to make him smoke a cigarette with a little firecracker in it when he handed it back healed bang and one of the guards

455
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:14,912
After that the guy gave him less food

456
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:20,800
Butler not to sleep in the daytime because it left him open to these guys they might take any opportunity

457
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:24,384
Picture of being shaved by the Taliban with a straight razor

458
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,408
He's handcuffed

459
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,480
Even then when he couldn't be more vulnerable

460
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:30,016
They have a laugh at his expense

461
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:38,976
Okay

462
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,192
IC

463
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,032
Videos to take pictures

464
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,080
Yourself

465
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:57,152
Yeah I'm getting worse

466
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:03,040
Basically the reality of situation

467
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:12,512
Sami Yusuf side the Afghan reporter interviewed some people who had dealings with bow while he was in captivity

468
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:17,888
Big Shot who came by and talked about his cell I got to cook for I'm a friend of one of the guards

469
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,936
Informal sanctions Entourage

470
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:24,800
Sammy took away from these interviews was that keeping Bergdahl was number one

471
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:25,568
Stressful

472
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:28,896
How to keep him away from everybody not truly from

473
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:33,504
Jonesy how to keep him away from Al-Qaeda Arabs in bandits in

474
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,320
If something happened you know

475
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:38,880
Continue our responsibility would be

476
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:42,208
You know beat anyone arrested by so that's why

477
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:46,816
These guys are watching the only US soldier who's ever been taken prisoner in this war

478
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:49,120
Other groups might want to steal him from them

479
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:55,008
Sammy said the guards had her talk that some Arabs and masks had almost made it to the house where they were holding bow

480
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,336
Captured and executed

481
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:01,920
Some people he thought were being paid by the US for information on bow

482
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:04,480
So even though it's a prestigious

483
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:05,760
Job is still suck

484
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,552
Yep

485
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:08,320
IC

486
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:09,856
Still like

487
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:11,904
Mentally lot of pressure range

488
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,696
I'm bored I think would happen

489
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,464
Boring

490
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:21,632
That's the other thing Sammy her in these interviews how tedious it was for them which is probably where the stupid and sometimes sadistic

491
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:22,656
Jokes come in

492
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:24,704
These guys are mostly young men

493
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,032
Are stuck inside a compound or some other prison location

494
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:30,592
Well they're Pals or maybe out and about enjoying themselves

495
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:31,616
In all

496
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:36,224
Having fun dancing Gitano something but here

497
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,528
And are you are bored nobody is allowed to come to visit

498
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:41,600
Because I'm just guy got in trouble

499
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:47,232
You cannot go out on we cannot go to the city we cannot make a phone call because it was not thinking

500
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,072
So even even even for the God you know

501
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,864
Do naturally happy

502
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:55,424
Write what students do what they are.

503
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:56,960
Then I'm sure

504
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,288
Milazzo Universe promising them a lot of thing

505
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,312
Lot of things

506
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:02,848
Yeah

507
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:04,640
McChicken

508
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,664
And you would hold more

509
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:06,688
Money

510
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:07,456
And everything

511
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:09,504
Sammy talk to a friend of one of the guards

512
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,368
Who told them that to amuse themselves they think up things to do to bow or how to get rid of bow

513
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:17,952
Ettalong hypothetical discussion about circumcising him

514
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:19,488
They talked about selling him

515
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:25,120
I may be calling in a funny tip the Americans that they had Osama Bin Laden so they'd be a raid they could be done with it

516
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:27,424
Another word for young guys

517
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,752
Shooting the shed following orders

518
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:38,176
Ghostkeepers would make him watch execution videos

519
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:44,576
Weddings are suicide bombers the very first day they got him they should have a video of mujahideen

520
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:48,160
Executing prisoners

521
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:50,720
In part because you still affected by them

522
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,768
Trenton details lodged in his head

523
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:59,168
In one a man is about to be beheaded and looks terrified he silent and a rooster is crowing

524
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:05,568
For both the videos are obviously disturbing on their face but they were also a Grizzly warning that this could have

525
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:07,104
Happened to him and anytime

526
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:11,200
They all had their own videos to show me

527
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:16,832
And where they showing at you like this is s*** that we've done or just stuff that other people we know are dumb

528
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:22,976
This is what other people have done

529
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,328
A few of them have been with his wife

530
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:29,376
My people have done

531
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,960
One guy who was

532
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:34,752
I would say literally

533
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:38,592
Basically out of his mind

534
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:42,688
And back to the point where the other Taliban called in Crazy Town

535
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:44,736
Tom

536
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,296
But where did they use for that

537
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:59,840
So they call him crazy town in

538
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:05,728
You tell me that he would kill he's killed

539
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:09,056
One time on one of those shifts

540
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,848
He told me to

541
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:15,456
Decapitated two guys and then a few months later it came back

542
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:17,760
He told me that he's on another

543
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:22,624
A while he was in the interim when it while you haven't seen you

544
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:32,608
I know the guys are basically their Afghans who betrayed their brothers

545
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:39,008
During all this time Bo's scheming and plotting

546
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:41,824
Gathering information that he hopes will get him out

547
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:44,128
And that he can deliver back to the US

548
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,408
Which by the way he does

549
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:49,248
Terrence Russell at the military hearing cookie and other debris furs

550
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:52,832
Intelligence debriefing overseer psychologist FBI agents

551
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:56,160
All found boiger to download whatever until he could

552
00:31:56,416 --> 00:32:01,280
And quote remarks on the quality of information Sergeant Bergdahl with providing unquote

553
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:03,584
Also they praise His recall

554
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:09,472
Who said he was trying all the time to store in his memory mental pictures of every detail he could

555
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:14,592
For this Mission he pretty much starts from zero when he's chained down and blindfolded

556
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:16,896
When you can't see he listens

557
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:19,968
Tries to discern the daily patterns of the people who kept them

558
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:20,992
When they slept

559
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:24,576
When the AIDS how their families work who's related to whom

560
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:28,160
Didn't know if it would be useful to him or to someone else back home

561
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:28,928
In case

562
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:33,792
I think it's moved around from house to house and allowed marginally more freedom

563
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:37,632
See at the stand he sponges up new bits of information

564
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:41,216
End up staying a while at a house owned by guy who thinks was named today

565
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:44,032
By this time it was so filthy

566
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:45,312
Smelled so bad

567
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:50,432
He said the young women in little boys resented having to deal with them they might spill his food on purpose

568
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:52,736
What's a boy beat him over the head with his own chain

569
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:55,296
Asbestos pocatello's because you've been humming

570
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:58,368
Both started to suss out information

571
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:04,768
Really enthusiastic

572
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:08,608
A blue baseball cap

573
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:09,632
Oh okay

574
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:14,752
The name of the

575
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,312
In the corner

576
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,848
The name of the town

577
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:23,968
Are all in English

578
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:30,624
I also like somebody had given it to them like some like Angie or somebody

579
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:33,952
That was their school uniform

580
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,792
So maybe that was the name of the place he was in North waziristan

581
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:41,376
Now we just have to figure out exactly where North waziristan was

582
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,472
Everywhere he was held he said except for one place in the mountains

583
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:51,872
He's pretty sure he wasn't too far from what he assumed was an American base you can hear artillery he could see helicopters losing a

584
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:53,152
Altitude to land

585
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:55,200
Ignore the scream of plane engines

586
00:33:55,968 --> 00:34:01,344
In fact what he was hearing was almost certainly a Pakistani bass oboe couldn't know that the best you could figure

587
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,928
He was still in Afghanistan very near the border

588
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:14,656
But had no special training and how to survive any of this how to deal with abuse

589
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,936
How to gather Intel

590
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:19,008
How to resist while making it look like you're cooperating

591
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:25,408
As an army private he had was called a level Seer training the most basic level of survival evasion

592
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:27,200
Resistance and Escape training

593
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:32,064
What it consisted of at the time of both employment according to both senior debriefer was

594
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,368
Here's a code of conduct on quote

595
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:40,256
She's just puzzling it out as he goes trying things and then trying them again

596
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:47,168
Days house is a sort of mud-hut attempts to dig himself out something like five times

597
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:53,056
To get rid of the dirty Blues from the wall he mix it with his own urine or feces and then smear it back on the wall

598
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:55,616
The Pebbles and rocks are harder to dispose of

599
00:34:55,872 --> 00:35:02,016
Are the same house there was a dog I'm pretty aggressive dog that the little boys and men especially were scared of

600
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:05,856
Most of the women sometimes gave it leftovers so I was nicer to them

601
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:12,256
Who knew if you tried to escape he couldn't have the dog freaking out and barking so he started sneaking a bit of food out to it

602
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:15,584
When he was led to the latrine which is right near where the dog slept

603
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:21,984
And that weibo made peace with the dog eventually begin sleeping in the room where Beau was his captors that was totally weird

604
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:28,128
Incidentally someone who analyzes and telling both case tell me one of the rumors they heard along the way

605
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:29,664
With a bow had a puppy

606
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,712
Possibly a German Shepherd puppy

607
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:34,272
Silliness

608
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:38,112
But maybe this sometimes vicious guard dog was the so-called puppy

609
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:44,256
Over the month spell managed to gather small items

610
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:46,048
Which he turned into tools

611
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:48,096
And by the end of that first year

612
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:50,656
Taken together they become his Escape kit

613
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:54,752
He had a length of PVC tube maybe 8 inches long

614
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:57,056
He's been able to keep with him since the very first house

615
00:35:57,568 --> 00:36:02,176
In one of the rooms he shoved it into the wall and peed out it so his urine wouldn't just be in the room

616
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:05,248
The people reappear later as part of a crossbar

617
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:07,808
He found a nail in a mud wall

618
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:09,088
He can make holes with it

619
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:10,368
Scrape away dirt with it

620
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:11,648
Cleaning fingernails with it

621
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,232
When the time came he spend weeks rubbing the head of it on a rock

622
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:19,072
Until it was just the right shape to get the old timey shackles off his rest

623
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:21,376
Is Jordan on the sole of the shoe

624
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:24,192
Probably the biggest score was a key

625
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:29,568
Feminine boy should come into his room when the boys was holding a bunch of keys on a string and dropped

626
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:34,176
When you did one of the keys got away it's all right near the mat we're both slapped

627
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,968
Cebu slid it underneath

628
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:38,528
Nobody seemed to notice it was missing

629
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:42,368
Wasn't the key to the padlock key needed to open

630
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:45,440
The Bose has the lost with these cheaply-made Chinese locks

631
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:50,048
Wiggling the key just so he could hit The Sweet Spot and pop them open

632
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:54,912
With that one key and using that technique it allow me to open

633
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:58,752
Padlocks that they're using the hold method

634
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:11,296
What were the years of the months

635
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:13,344
I was able to keep this key

636
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:16,160
Bowhead tried many mini Escape

637
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:19,488
He gotten as far as a courtyard up to a wall

638
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,280
But they were for Israeli

639
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:23,072
Is biggest best chance

640
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:25,632
Hey when he was at a remote place in the mountains

641
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:28,448
This is the farthest he ever was from a populated area

642
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:30,240
Basically Powhatan prison

643
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:32,544
Calls it the mountain Fortress

644
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:36,384
What the really it literally look like

645
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:44,064
Because

646
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:55,840
There's everything was just this really old and like it was actually

647
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:07,616
In the mountain Fortress bow is kept in a second-story room which is padlocked but there was a window

648
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:14,016
Without bars on it this place was so old and he seemed so pathetic by that point he says his guards weren't taking extra

649
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:14,784
Cautions

650
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:21,184
The key to PVC pipe plus it wouldn't stake that was in the room

651
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,256
Bottle of Mountain Dew hat blanket sandals

652
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:25,792
He went for it

653
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,864
Middle of the night

654
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:34,752
Call the night before

655
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:53,184
Putting everything together

656
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,280
Getting my hands tied up the water bottle that I had

657
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:10,080
The Rope was made from the two chains he's now liberated each about 6 ft long he says plus his bedding

658
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:12,384
It ended up being quite a bit longer than you need it

659
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,688
Drop to the ground with only about 15 feet

660
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:15,968
I didn't know that

661
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:32,096
There's a reason maybe you haven't heard other American pows Escape stories

662
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:35,424
Because there hasn't been a successful one since the Vietnam War

663
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:41,824
Again cuz you're supposed to attempt it but the Army understands especially since Vietnam

664
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,408
The odds are usually an overwhelmingly against you

665
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:50,016
If you're a p o w and you assess the situation and you decide

666
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:53,344
It's highly unlikely I can make it out that window without being shot

667
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:58,464
It's highly unlikely that even if I do make it out I'll be able to blend in with the local population

668
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,000
It is highly likely

669
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:03,072
But if the enemy finds me they will torture or kill me

670
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:06,400
So no I'm not going to try to go out that window

671
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:08,448
That is right in fine

672
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:10,240
No one will fault you for it

673
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:17,152
To me more than anything this moment in the mountain Fortress what's all the talk about Bo being a sympathizer to rest

674
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:19,456
Odoo not sympathize with the Taliban

675
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,992
A load the Taliban

676
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:23,040
So much so that even when he's sick

677
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,832
He doesn't have any food

678
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:28,672
He's already been punished for escaping the first time he knows what that's like

679
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:29,952
Instill

680
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:31,488
Goes out the window

681
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:49,664
Mixed bag out of his blanket what does water bottle in it swings it over his shoulder and starts walking

682
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:54,016
Apart from being rescued it was maybe the best moment of his five years

683
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:59,392
Yeah

684
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:09,888
It's High Desert Terrain

685
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:12,448
Cold at night hot in the day Rocky

686
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,776
Are bushes and trees supposed to look like Joshua trees

687
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:18,336
And something Piney not a lot of cover

688
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:22,688
But his immediate objective is not to hide though he'll have to do a lot of hiding obviously

689
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,528
Right now he's trying to get as far away as he can from The Fortress

690
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:29,344
He wants to spread the search party as thinly as possible

691
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:31,648
He has what he hopes is southeast

692
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:33,696
Intending to go into Pakistan

693
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:38,048
He figures he's got a better shot at encountering someone non-hostile to him in Pakistan

694
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,352
But the train is so difficult

695
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,632
He's in his shorts

696
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:43,168
Steep Maisy Mountain

697
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:45,472
Get over one there's immediately another one

698
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:51,872
And they're all about the same height so it's not like you can reach a peak and get your bearings see the twinkle of a friendly fob in the distance

699
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,919
He climbs and descends

700
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:55,455
Sometimes scooting on his butt

701
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:57,759
All the while he's listening for water

702
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,295
Three places water bottle

703
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:00,831
Images of valley

704
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:02,111
And is populated

705
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:06,975
He keeps having to fear this way or that skirt offense or house or sheepherders tent

706
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:25,407
I don't know how long I don't know how

707
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:50,495
Boat lands on a dry River bed on his left side

708
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:54,591
He said the word oof actually came out of his mouth just like in a cartoon

709
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:57,407
Loud enough so that some dog started barking their heads off

710
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:03,551
Away from where I am

711
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:09,439
I wanted to fill up my water bottle

712
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,399
My left hand

713
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:36,063
Your adrenaline must have just been pumping so hard this whole time

714
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:40,671
Reason why I didn't feel

715
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:42,975
End up feeling about

716
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:45,023
10 minutes later

717
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:49,119
He's done something terrible to his left leg and his left arm

718
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:51,679
And the pain of that starts to wash over him

719
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:53,215
And then just stay

720
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:56,031
It's getting later it's going to be light soon

721
00:43:56,287 --> 00:44:00,127
Chabot uses the small length of bar that have been used to hold his feet together

722
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:04,223
And he uses it to Claude the Earth at the base of a tree to make a hole

723
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:07,295
It's mulchy and then just rocks underneath but it's good enough

724
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:13,439
He piles of dirt around the whole to make a berm and then sticks branches into the burn so it Blends into the landscape better

725
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:15,231
Then he gets into the hole

726
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:16,767
Imposes blanket over himself

727
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:34,431
So that was his first night of freedom

728
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:37,759
In all books has this Escape lasted about nine days

729
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:44,415
Interviews with Sammy and another media reports the Taliban admit this Escape happened though there versions vary in terms

730
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:46,719
How it happened and how long it lasted

731
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,767
General days

732
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:52,351
Thursday briefers settled on 8.5 days

733
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:58,239
Once morning hits bow has to stay put in the hole he can't move around in the day

734
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:04,639
And where he is it populated and it's rural so people walk everywhere their foot past criss-crossing all over the place

735
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:08,479
Over the coming week while he's hiding and holes are trenches during the day

736
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:10,527
There were so many close calls

737
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:16,927
Sheet that came close and spooked women out Gathering something-or-other From the bushes men you could tell they were

738
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:19,231
Men with guns you can hear the clock on The Middle

739
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:25,375
There was a scare with a flashlight time when he heard the familiar beeping of those Motorola type walkie talkies the Taliban use

740
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:29,983
But I'm a little girls wanted off the road and up the hill where he was hiding

741
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:35,103
Three or four

742
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:44,575
And apparently they're looking for flowers or something

743
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:50,975
Are off the road like almost directly toward me

744
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:56,607
They pass right by his feet keep going there talking to each other Emerson whatever they're doing

745
00:45:56,863 --> 00:46:02,495
And then they come back down the hill a bus as they pass right by his head tiny oblivious girls

746
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:08,895
Can't walk properly because his left side is hurting so badly so he's crawling along on a combination of elbow

747
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:10,943
Or on his butt

748
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:12,735
Not going well

749
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:17,087
On top of everything he really has no idea where he's going he's completely lost

750
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:19,903
Kid learn Celestial navigation as a kid

751
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:23,231
And now he can't recall how the Big Dipper relates to the North Star

752
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:26,559
The water he's drinking is feted like I've seen too many sheep

753
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:28,351
Is eating grass

754
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:33,983
Don't make a difference

755
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:46,783
It's Isabella shrinking

756
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:49,855
Getting smaller and more helpless more primitive

757
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:51,903
Is s*** is completely green

758
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:53,439
He stuck in a hole all day

759
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:56,511
Is down to nothing no resources

760
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:58,559
Right above him

761
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:02,143
Some of the highest Tech equipment in the world for seeing and finding

762
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:03,935
Drones

763
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:07,007
American drones Guided by American eyes

764
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:13,919
They can't reach each other remembers one night being on top of the mountain

765
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:16,735
Remember

766
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:20,319
Drones

767
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:23,391
Like moving across the sky

768
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:26,719
Really

769
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:32,351
You're so close and yet

770
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:39,263
Things are so stacked against you that it's this

771
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:55,647
Time to think about what he do if a friendly Convoy Patrol came by

772
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:57,183
How did Safeway get their attention

773
00:47:57,695 --> 00:48:01,023
Did you ran out them in his Afghan clothes they might think he was a suicide bomber

774
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:03,071
Fisher cat you take all his clothes off

775
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,655
Pics of tall skinny naked white guy coming at you

776
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:08,447
Coming to Paul's over perhaps

777
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:12,543
If anyone had, crossbow they probably have taken in the following

778
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:14,591
He's in pain on his left side

779
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:16,127
Is in gastric distress

780
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:18,687
He's starving you scared and he's lost

781
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:20,991
Did you ever think that

782
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:25,599
During the course of the Escape that maybe you made a mistake that the you know being out

783
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:26,623
That escaping was

784
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:29,951
Maybe more treacherous than just staying put

785
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:36,607
I knew it was like before I escaped I knew it was going to be more

786
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:39,679
It's going to be more immediate risk

787
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:40,447
Yeah

788
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:46,591
I get myself out the window as in basically come to terms with the fact

789
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:49,151
Very much like a suicide

790
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:51,199
Fishing you know it's like

791
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:55,551
Looking for a needle in a haystack as far as being saved

792
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:01,695
What it was like okay if I'm going to die either

793
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:05,535
Exposure out there or being shot while I escape

794
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:09,375
It's better than having my head cut off cuz I thought enough of those movies to

795
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:12,191
Are videos with honor for those two

796
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:14,495
What that would be like

797
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:20,383
Perdiendo is too debilitated to cover much ground

798
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:22,175
Is hunger pangs were gone

799
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:23,967
Please blacking out when he stood up

800
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:25,247
Getting tunnel vision

801
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:28,575
He didn't exactly stop caring about getting caught

802
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:31,391
More like he stopped having the energy to be afraid

803
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:37,023
He remembers one of the last night watching the sun go down and it's only thought

804
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:38,559
Is that it was beautiful

805
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:49,311
On the last day of bow says he had passed out on top of the mountain

806
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:53,919
How many came to he started trying to make some sort of brace out of sticks for his left knee

807
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:55,455
Your voices

808
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:56,735
Rustling bushes

809
00:49:57,503 --> 00:50:01,087
I'm blowing he saw the search party coming up the mountain he was caught

810
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:06,463
Because of the drones the men wanted to get him off the mountain as quickly as I could

811
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:08,255
They took him back to the prison

812
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:12,863
One of the older guys both thinks he might have been a relative of Melissa and being attacked him

813
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:14,911
Try to rip his hair out his beard out

814
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:17,215
Rosetti mostly succeeded in doing

815
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:21,055
He was so out of it he didn't really feel it

816
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:25,663
He wasn't beaten more than that he says maybe because they knew looking at him

817
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:27,455
He might not survive a beating

818
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:30,783
Let him sleep

819
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:34,623
The next morning they cleaned him up and they took him to a meeting with Melissa and Ian

820
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:36,927
Principal message to boas

821
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:39,487
If you try to escape again will just kill you

822
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:41,535
I mean did you apologize to them

823
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:44,863
No I never apologize

824
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:47,423
Effort for trying to escape

825
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:51,007
I probably would have

826
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:58,943
Better than that escape was

827
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:01,759
The last time I saw Stars

828
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:03,807
Tonight

829
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:05,855
Horses pick me up

830
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:12,767
About 4 years inside

831
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:15,071
And while he's waiting

832
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:18,399
So many people would be trying to get Bo away from Sun game

833
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:22,751
All these huge military and diplomatic forces about to kick in

834
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:25,311
Just as the United States is realizing

835
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:26,847
We need to get out of this war

836
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:29,407
And then things get really interesting

837
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:31,711

Next episode of serial

859
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:06,687
Was it worse than Iraq

860
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:10,527
That that deployment I mean

861
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:14,111
Yeah it was the worst year of my life it was horrible yeah

862
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:17,951
Your operations order had something to do with Bowe Bergdahl

863
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:20,255
Then people were going to give it to

864
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:23,327
The stamp of approval say go ahead and Smash Smash down some doors

865
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:24,095
Asking questions

866
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:34,591
I have some guilt like maybe there's something I could do but then what if I don't

867
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:38,175
Exactly why I've always sort of treated the way he was treated

868
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:44,319
But it's certainly plausible to me that the reason he was treated so horribly

869
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:46,623
Was because I was treated so well
