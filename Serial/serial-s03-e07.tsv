EDL	00:03:00,224	00:03:02,784	| serial-s03-e07 |	How could that not be a giant settlement waiting to happen
EDL	00:03:03,296	00:03:07,392	| serial-s03-e07 |	Scott Ramsey wasn't that interested in the holding cell story didn't seem outraged by it
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:09,184	| serial-s03-e07 |	You got it might be hard to prove
EDL	00:03:10,208	00:03:12,512	| serial-s03-e07 |	Instead he wanted to hear more about the other thing
EDL	00:03:12,512	00:03:13,280	| serial-s03-e07 |	4th of July
EDL	00:03:14,048	00:03:17,632	| serial-s03-e07 |	From Jesse's description it did sound like maybe the police had targeted him
EDL	00:03:18,400	00:03:19,936	| serial-s03-e07 |	Maybe that could lead to civil action
EDL	00:03:20,448	00:03:24,288	| serial-s03-e07 |	Okay let me ask let me ask a couple of questions the thing on
EDL	00:03:24,288	00:03:27,104	| serial-s03-e07 |	The incident on the 4th what proof do we have that it happen
EDL	00:03:28,128	00:03:31,968	| serial-s03-e07 |	I have several videos I stole videos
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:33,248	| serial-s03-e07 |	And they have videos
EDL	00:03:33,760	00:03:38,368	| serial-s03-e07 |	And then you and then also you have video from people's cameras and probably
EDL	00:03:38,368	00:03:40,416	| serial-s03-e07 |	Somebody cams is that what you're talking about
EDL	00:03:43,232	00:03:45,792	| serial-s03-e07 |	Scott Ramsey tells Jesse to gather video evidence
EDL	00:03:45,792	00:03:46,560	| serial-s03-e07 |	Find witnesses
EDL	00:03:47,072	00:03:49,120	| serial-s03-e07 |	7 to 10 people would be good he says
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:50,912	| serial-s03-e07 |	Preferably people without criminal records
EDL	00:03:51,680	00:03:53,728	| serial-s03-e07 |	And then he'll assess the potential
EDL	00:03:53,728	00:03:54,496	| serial-s03-e07 |	Her lawsuit
EDL	00:03:59,872	00:04:04,224	| serial-s03-e07 |	But I'm past it became obvious Scott Ramsey wasn't going to file a new lawsuit
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:06,784	| serial-s03-e07 |	Jesse didn't produce the evidence Scott Ramsey task 4

EDL	00:16:59,647	00:17:01,183	| serial-s03-e07 |	At the hands of police
EDL	00:17:01,183	00:17:03,487	| serial-s03-e07 |	Are very different and they're very different people
EDL	00:17:03,999	00:17:06,303	| serial-s03-e07 |	But in certain ways their cases Echo each other
EDL	00:17:06,815	00:17:07,839	| serial-s03-e07 |	The aftershocks
EDL	00:17:07,839	00:17:08,351	| serial-s03-e07 |	Especially
EDL	00:17:09,375	00:17:12,447	| serial-s03-e07 |	If you remember Aramis was trying to get rid of his criminal charges
EDL	00:17:12,447	00:17:13,983	| serial-s03-e07 |	So they could file a civil lawsuit
EDL	00:17:14,751	00:17:16,799	| serial-s03-e07 |	The resisting arrest was a sticking point
EDL	00:17:17,311	00:17:18,591	| serial-s03-e07 |	He was going to plead to it
EDL	00:17:18,591	00:17:20,127	| serial-s03-e07 |	The city was going to drop it
EDL	00:17:20,127	00:17:21,151	| serial-s03-e07 |	They're at a standoff
EDL	00:17:22,175	00:17:23,455	| serial-s03-e07 |	The trial date was set
EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:25,503	| serial-s03-e07 |	And then at video came out
EDL	00:17:25,503	00:17:27,807	| serial-s03-e07 |	The one that Aramis is lawyer called a miracle
EDL	00:17:27,807	00:17:29,087	| serial-s03-e07 |	Manna From Heaven
EDL	00:17:29,599	00:17:30,879	| serial-s03-e07 |	Only legally speaking
EDL	00:17:30,879	00:17:31,647	| serial-s03-e07 |	Of course
EDL	00:17:31,647	00:17:33,951	| serial-s03-e07 |	In every other way the video was horrible
EDL	00:17:35,231	00:17:37,279	| serial-s03-e07 |	It showed a white Euclid Police Officer
EDL	00:17:37,279	00:17:39,583	| serial-s03-e07 |	Michael amiott the same one from aramis's case
EDL	00:17:40,351	00:17:43,167	| serial-s03-e07 |	Beating the crap out of a young black guy during a traffic stop
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:45,215	| serial-s03-e07 |	Seemingly without provocation
EDL	00:17:45,983	00:17:48,799	| serial-s03-e07 |	The guy in the video actually videos there are several
EDL	00:17:48,799	00:17:50,591	| serial-s03-e07 |	Richard Hubbard the Third
EDL	00:17:51,103	00:17:53,407	| serial-s03-e07 |	You can see Hubbard splayed out on the asphalt
EDL	00:17:53,407	00:17:57,503	| serial-s03-e07 |	Officer amiott on top of him punching in the face with both arms
EDL	00:17:57,503	00:17:58,527	| serial-s03-e07 |	Right left
EDL	00:17:58,527	00:17:59,295	| serial-s03-e07 |	Right left
EDL	00:18:00,063	00:18:04,415	| serial-s03-e07 |	You see Harper's girlfriend on her hands and knees slapping the ground just a few feet away from them
EDL	00:18:04,927	00:18:06,207	| serial-s03-e07 |	Screaming for it to stop
EDL	00:18:07,231	00:18:09,535	| serial-s03-e07 |	Pretty soon the story was in The Washington Post
EDL	00:18:09,535	00:18:11,839	| serial-s03-e07 |	The New York Post the LA Times CNN
EDL	00:18:12,351	00:18:13,631	| serial-s03-e07 |	They did the same thing to me
EDL	00:18:14,143	00:18:16,703	| serial-s03-e07 |	I mean it seems like they're going from one to another
EDL	00:18:17,215	00:18:18,751	| serial-s03-e07 |	When Aramis watched it
EDL	00:18:18,751	00:18:20,799	| serial-s03-e07 |	He recognized with bitterness
EDL	00:18:20,799	00:18:21,823	| serial-s03-e07 |	The beating in that video
EDL	00:18:22,335	00:18:24,127	| serial-s03-e07 |	The series of moves the officers make
EDL	00:18:24,639	00:18:27,967	| serial-s03-e07 |	Officer amiott straightaway tries to kick Richard Hubbard in the crotch
EDL	00:18:28,991	00:18:31,551	| serial-s03-e07 |	Guess I don't know maybe that's a new procedure and Euclid
EDL	00:18:32,063	00:18:37,439	| serial-s03-e07 |	Maybe they beg you to tell you to the ground and need you and kick you in the face and pays you and I
EDL	00:18:37,439	00:18:40,255	| serial-s03-e07 |	Maybe I don't know maybe that's the new procedure you could I don't know
EDL	00:18:41,791	00:18:44,351	| serial-s03-e07 |	Aramis is civil attorney Paul cristallo
EDL	00:18:44,351	00:18:48,191	| serial-s03-e07 |	Figured the Hubbard video would persuade the city of Euclid to drop the resisting
EDL	00:18:48,191	00:18:49,471	| serial-s03-e07 |	Maybe drop everything
EDL	00:18:50,239	00:18:54,847	| serial-s03-e07 |	Because how are you going to put an officer on the stand who's been suspended for excessive force
EDL	00:18:55,615	00:18:59,967	| serial-s03-e07 |	Who it turned out that had to resign from his previous job at the mentor Police Department
EDL	00:18:59,967	00:19:01,503	| serial-s03-e07 |	For lying about a traffic stop
EDL	00:19:02,015	00:19:03,807	| serial-s03-e07 |	Crisp uniform
EDL	00:19:03,807	00:19:06,879	| serial-s03-e07 |	Officer amiott probably would look like a bad egg if he testified
EDL	00:19:10,207	00:19:13,535	| serial-s03-e07 |	Few weeks went by Euclid did not drop the whole thing
EDL	00:19:13,535	00:19:18,655	| serial-s03-e07 |	September 7th 2017 has had his final pre-trial date in Euclid
EDL	00:19:18,655	00:19:19,423	| serial-s03-e07 |	Is it Thursday

EDL	00:19:23,519	00:19:27,359	| serial-s03-e07 |	Spiros gonakis Armistice criminal attorney was running around the courthouse
EDL	00:19:27,359	00:19:29,151	| serial-s03-e07 |	Haggling over the most recent plea offer

EDL	00:19:32,223	00:19:36,319	| serial-s03-e07 |	They're a little tense understandably they weren't sure what was about to happen
EDL	00:19:36,319	00:19:40,159	| serial-s03-e07 |	They've been fighting these charges for a long time 9 months
EDL	00:19:40,159	00:19:41,439	| serial-s03-e07 |	That was all very real
EDL	00:19:41,951	00:19:47,071	| serial-s03-e07 |	The prospect that if they couldn't work something out today and Aramis ended up a trial and was convicted at trial
EDL	00:19:47,583	00:19:48,607	| serial-s03-e07 |	He could get jail time
EDL	00:19:49,887	00:19:51,167	| serial-s03-e07 |	Spiros walks over
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:53,727	| serial-s03-e07 |	Ocean City wants to speak to Aramis and Khalid

EDL	00:19:55,775	00:19:57,311	| serial-s03-e07 |	No I'm not okay
EDL	00:19:57,311	00:20:00,895	| serial-s03-e07 |	They step outside the building I can see them through the plate-glass windows
EDL	00:20:01,407	00:20:02,943	| serial-s03-e07 |	Spiros gesticulating

EDL	00:48:04,095	00:48:04,607	| serial-s03-e07 |	But
EDL	00:48:05,119	00:48:06,655	| serial-s03-e07 |	They want to single out something like
EDL	00:48:07,423	00:48:08,703	| serial-s03-e07 |	Why I am a trouble
EDL	00:48:08,703	00:48:10,495	| serial-s03-e07 |	Human being live while I was trouble person

EDL	00:48:28,671	00:48:30,207	| serial-s03-e07 |	That's not the case man
EDL	00:48:30,207	00:48:30,975	| serial-s03-e07 |	That's not the case
EDL	00:48:32,511	00:48:34,815	| serial-s03-e07 |	Jesse went willingly for the next 10 minutes
EDL	00:48:34,815	00:48:35,839	| serial-s03-e07 |	About Sergeant Williams

EDL	00:48:37,119	00:48:39,423	| serial-s03-e07 |	I think his reaction was so intense because
EDL	00:48:39,423	00:48:41,215	| serial-s03-e07 |	You been through so much more in Ricky's.
EDL	00:48:41,983	00:48:44,543	| serial-s03-e07 |	Is it to Denise Bugatti Wilkos to

EDL	00:48:47,615	00:48:49,151	| serial-s03-e07 |	And he was found dead in her Palm
EDL	00:48:50,431	00:48:52,223	| serial-s03-e07 |	Baba Antoine died as an infant
EDL	00:48:52,991	00:48:55,807	| serial-s03-e07 |	Is teenage nephew DeAndre died in a drive-by
EDL	00:48:56,831	00:48:57,599	| serial-s03-e07 |	Then
EDL	00:48:57,599	00:48:59,903	| serial-s03-e07 |	Now over wrongs that they believe the police have done him
EDL	00:49:01,183	00:49:01,695	| serial-s03-e07 |	I think
EDL	00:49:02,207	00:49:04,511	| serial-s03-e07 |	When does peeing so much meaning on Ricky
EDL	00:49:04,511	00:49:06,047	| serial-s03-e07 |	Ricky's death effects

EDL	00:49:06,815	00:49:08,095	| serial-s03-e07 |	Jessie found it offensive
EDL	00:49:08,607	00:49:09,375	| serial-s03-e07 |	Generalizing
EDL	00:49:10,655	00:49:13,215	| serial-s03-e07 |	Jesse wasn't in the mood to have us off his favorite
EDL	00:49:13,727	00:49:14,495	| serial-s03-e07 |	YouTube angry
EDL	00:49:15,775	00:49:17,567	| serial-s03-e07 |	I wasn't interested in being explained
EDL	00:49:18,079	00:49:19,103	| serial-s03-e07 |	Especially

EDL	00:49:26,783	00:49:31,903	| serial-s03-e07 |	I'm tired of being treated like a I'm trying to I'm tired of being the victim so
EDL	00:49:32,415	00:49:35,999	| serial-s03-e07 |	No more Jesse Nickerson is being a victim like I'm not letting
EDL	00:49:37,023	00:49:39,839	| serial-s03-e07 |	Words that mean like timeout

EDL	00:49:51,871	00:49:54,175	| serial-s03-e07 |	Going to let it happen like I'm not just about to
EDL	00:49:54,943	00:49:58,015	| serial-s03-e07 |	I do see all these are the times I never did nothing back

EDL	00:50:00,319	00:50:03,135	| serial-s03-e07 |	If not I'm not about to keep being a victim and I better
EDL	00:50:03,647	00:50:06,463	| serial-s03-e07 |	Now I have to press them to get into lay it out explicitly
EDL	00:50:07,231	00:50:10,303	| serial-s03-e07 |	But Jesse was saying that the next time the police got physical with him
EDL	00:50:11,071	00:50:12,095	| serial-s03-e07 |	His plan was to find that
EDL	00:50:13,631	00:50:15,167	| serial-s03-e07 |	Petit Morrison for everyone
EDL	00:50:15,167	00:50:17,215	| serial-s03-e07 |	Especially words

EDL	00:50:19,007	00:50:22,335	| serial-s03-e07 |	That leads in East Cleveland I paid to be driving down Jetty Street a lot
EDL	00:50:23,103	00:50:25,663	| serial-s03-e07 |	Riding Jesse ticketing off a ticket for the usual

EDL	00:50:31,039	00:50:32,063	| serial-s03-e07 |	Later told me
EDL	00:50:32,063	00:50:36,927	| serial-s03-e07 |	The attitude of the folks in charge was that while opposition to go out of their way to White Jesse up

EDL	00:50:38,463	00:50:42,559	| serial-s03-e07 |	Handle Jesse whenever the opportunity presented itself
EDL	00:50:43,071	00:50:45,631	| serial-s03-e07 |	Eventually these given, told me
EDL	00:50:45,631	00:50:46,911	| serial-s03-e07 |	The Snowball Effect
EDL	00:50:46,911	00:50:48,191	| serial-s03-e07 |	Well you know

EDL	00:50:58,175	00:51:03,295	| serial-s03-e07 |	Las Vegas going to tell you it's how Jesse's pile up with criminal charges in East Cleveland Show
EDL	00:51:04,575	00:51:08,671	| serial-s03-e07 |	Does it beat once audit trial but the bulk of them dragged on for months
EDL	00:51:09,183	00:51:10,463	| serial-s03-e07 |	Months and months
EDL	00:51:11,487	00:51:16,351	| serial-s03-e07 |	Until one cool day in January when is Cleveland essentially held out one hand to make a deal
EDL	00:51:16,863	00:51:17,887	| serial-s03-e07 |	Imma be all the

EDL	00:51:21,983	00:51:23,775	| serial-s03-e07 |	I'm guessing 4th of July arrests
EDL	00:51:23,775	00:51:27,615	| serial-s03-e07 |	I didn't have body cam video about backed up the claim but Jesse will be aggressive
EDL	00:51:30,687	00:51:33,759	| serial-s03-e07 |	Invitan Jesse pleaded to three misdemeanor charges
EDL	00:51:34,271	00:51:37,599	| serial-s03-e07 |	Including the menacing charge against off the Dunkin at the gas station
EDL	00:51:38,111	00:51:39,391	| serial-s03-e07 |	I know those charges
EDL	00:51:39,391	00:51:40,415	| serial-s03-e07 |	I said he went off to him
EDL	00:51:40,927	00:51:42,975	| serial-s03-e07 |	Alcanfor year in jail
EDL	00:51:43,743	00:51:50,143	| serial-s03-e07 |	During the sentencing the city prosecutor listed some of his old felony convictions
EDL	00:51:50,143	00:51:50,911	| serial-s03-e07 |	Cleveland
EDL	00:51:51,423	00:51:53,471	| serial-s03-e07 |	Some 22 cases in the hole
EDL	00:51:53,471	00:51:57,055	| serial-s03-e07 |	Keep a body cam video from one of Jesse's previous arrest
EDL	00:51:57,055	00:51:58,847	| serial-s03-e07 |	Wow through the phone
EDL	00:51:58,847	00:52:01,151	| serial-s03-e07 |	Jesse was mouthing off to the police officer
EDL	00:52:01,151	00:52:02,687	| serial-s03-e07 |	What you didn't know
EDL	00:52:02,687	00:52:04,479	| serial-s03-e07 |	Was that Matt same arrest with suspect
EDL	00:52:05,247	00:52:07,551	| serial-s03-e07 |	Jesse later beat that case to trial
EDL	00:52:08,063	00:52:09,087	| serial-s03-e07 |	Anyway
EDL	00:52:09,087	00:52:13,695	| serial-s03-e07 |	In a brief filed is a call the city argued that Jesse pose a danger to the police
EDL	00:52:14,207	00:52:15,487	| serial-s03-e07 |	On top of that
EDL	00:52:15,487	00:52:20,095	| serial-s03-e07 |	Will the quote extremely negatively influence in the city of East Cleveland
EDL	00:52:22,143	00:52:23,935	| serial-s03-e07 |	The judge William dolsen
EDL	00:52:23,935	00:52:25,471	| serial-s03-e07 |	Didn't say move by the city's pitch
EDL	00:52:26,495	00:52:29,055	| serial-s03-e07 |	Instead he did something I did not see coming
EDL	00:52:30,079	00:52:31,871	| serial-s03-e07 |	He pretty much ignores that the city had a point
EDL	00:52:32,639	00:52:35,199	| serial-s03-e07 |	But also the manager told everyone
EDL	00:52:35,199	00:52:36,735	| serial-s03-e07 |	The evil Jesse had a point to
EDL	00:52:37,503	00:52:39,551	| serial-s03-e07 |	The city and the police had it out for him
EDL	00:52:40,575	00:52:41,599	| serial-s03-e07 |	Fulton Fab
EDL	00:52:41,599	00:52:42,623	| serial-s03-e07 |	In not so many words
EDL	00:52:43,135	00:52:44,415	| serial-s03-e07 |	That's probably true
EDL	00:52:44,927	00:52:48,255	| serial-s03-e07 |	Obviously I wasn't there I don't know what occurred but it seems like
EDL	00:52:48,255	00:52:49,791	| serial-s03-e07 |	You prevailed there was a settlement
EDL	00:52:50,303	00:52:51,839	| serial-s03-e07 |	So obviously something happy
EDL	00:52:51,839	00:52:54,655	| serial-s03-e07 |	That could be the reason you have a problem with
EDL	00:52:54,655	00:52:55,423	| serial-s03-e07 |	The police
EDL	00:52:55,423	00:52:56,191	| serial-s03-e07 |	I cannot discount
EDL	00:52:56,703	00:52:58,239	| serial-s03-e07 |	And at the same time
EDL	00:52:58,239	00:52:59,775	| serial-s03-e07 |	That may be a reason why
EDL	00:52:59,775	00:53:01,823	| serial-s03-e07 |	They have a problem with you is like okay
EDL	00:53:02,335	00:53:07,711	| serial-s03-e07 |	We we think that he prevailed and he shouldn't Prevail so yeah everytime you know his blinkers not working
EDL	00:53:08,479	00:53:12,831	| serial-s03-e07 |	This this this is Carter as blank is possible they don't like you maybe and you may not like me
EDL	00:53:13,343	00:53:15,647	| serial-s03-e07 |	So now how do we deal with encounter
EDL	00:53:15,647	00:53:17,695	| serial-s03-e07 |	So did you end up in court at the key
EDL	00:53:19,231	00:53:22,815	| serial-s03-e07 |	Josh Wilson decided some kind of solution other than jail time was in order
EDL	00:53:24,863	00:53:26,655	| serial-s03-e07 |	He said his deputies six months of probation
EDL	00:53:27,423	00:53:31,263	| serial-s03-e07 |	Enrolled him in a program designed to teach people how to have better experiences
EDL	00:53:33,823	00:53:35,103	| serial-s03-e07 |	Is hope he later told me
EDL	00:53:35,615	00:53:37,919	| serial-s03-e07 |	That Jesse would learn how to behave better
EDL	00:53:37,919	00:53:38,687	| serial-s03-e07 |	Around police
EDL	00:53:39,199	00:53:42,271	| serial-s03-e07 |	The common self-saving interactions would be less heated
EDL	00:53:43,807	00:53:45,087	| serial-s03-e07 |	It was almost kind
EDL	00:53:46,879	00:53:49,695	| serial-s03-e07 |	It also seemed like the judge was hoping Jesse would change
EDL	00:53:50,207	00:53:51,231	| serial-s03-e07 |	Because he knew
EDL	00:53:51,231	00:53:52,767	| serial-s03-e07 |	These Cleveland Police weren't going to
EDL	00:54:05,823	00:54:10,687	| serial-s03-e07 |	Just before Jesse's 30th birthday on the phone
EDL	00:54:10,687	00:54:12,479	| serial-s03-e07 |	Jessie was full of resolve
EDL	00:54:12,479	00:54:14,527	| serial-s03-e07 |	Is wasting too much energy on the court
EDL	00:54:15,295	00:54:16,831	| serial-s03-e07 |	Is ready to do something
EDL	00:54:16,831	00:54:17,599	| serial-s03-e07 |	Meaningful
EDL	00:54:18,111	00:54:19,647	| serial-s03-e07 |	Read a book about his life
EDL	00:54:20,415	00:54:22,719	| serial-s03-e07 |	You want to ride the end of his story now he said
EDL	00:54:23,231	00:54:24,511	| serial-s03-e07 |	But it would be a good ending
EDL	00:54:26,047	00:54:30,143	| serial-s03-e07 |	If you spot Jesse into a data set no one's favorite place to hang out
EDL	00:54:30,143	00:54:31,167	| serial-s03-e07 |	Sorry Jessie
EDL	00:54:31,167	00:54:34,239	| serial-s03-e07 |	But if you consider him not as a trash talker with a rap sheet
EDL	00:54:34,751	00:54:37,055	| serial-s03-e07 |	What is a 30-year old man going about his business
EDL	00:54:37,567	00:54:40,895	| serial-s03-e07 |	Aldar the criminal justice system is pretty much done with Jesse
EDL	00:54:41,919	00:54:44,223	| serial-s03-e07 |	Because people in their thirties and older
EDL	00:54:44,223	00:54:47,039	| serial-s03-e07 |	They're not the ones committing the most and the worst
EDL	00:54:47,039	00:54:50,623	| serial-s03-e07 |	Crimes does one research paper I read gently put it
EDL	00:54:50,623	00:54:52,927	| serial-s03-e07 |	Crime tends to be a Young Person's activity
EDL	00:54:54,207	00:54:56,511	| serial-s03-e07 |	To see the people that system is really focused on
EDL	00:54:57,023	00:54:59,583	| serial-s03-e07 |	We need to just lean to the left a little bit
EDL	00:54:59,583	00:55:01,119	| serial-s03-e07 |	Look behind Jessie
EDL	00:55:01,631	00:55:02,655	| serial-s03-e07 |	Are the teenagers
EDL	00:55:03,935	00:55:06,239	| serial-s03-e07 |	What's next time on cereal
EDL	00:55:06,239	00:55:07,775	| serial-s03-e07 |	Which will be in 2 weeks
EDL	00:55:07,775	00:55:09,055	| serial-s03-e07 |	I got to go out of town
