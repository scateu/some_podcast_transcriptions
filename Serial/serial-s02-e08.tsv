EDL	00:00:30,464	00:00:30,976	| serial-s02-e08 |	Previously
EDL	00:00:31,488	00:00:32,000	| serial-s02-e08 |	I'm cereal
EDL	00:00:32,512	00:00:35,584	| serial-s02-e08 |	Gentlemanly is a good where he is very much a gentleman
EDL	00:00:40,960	00:00:42,496	| serial-s02-e08 |	Do you think he's lying
EDL	00:00:45,056	00:00:48,384	| serial-s02-e08 |	And then all the sudden he shows up in his uniform
EDL	00:01:05,024	00:01:11,168	| serial-s02-e08 |	Where can I find WBEZ Chicago its serial one story told week by week I'm sorry.
EDL	00:01:15,776	00:01:18,848	| serial-s02-e08 |	I think the following will likely be a question I pose court-martial
EDL	00:01:19,360	00:01:20,896	| serial-s02-e08 |	Did the Army screw up
EDL	00:01:20,896	00:01:23,456	| serial-s02-e08 |	By accepting Bow by deploying him to Afghanistan
EDL	00:01:24,736	00:01:27,552	| serial-s02-e08 |	Just remind you but was separated from the Coast Guard
EDL	00:01:27,552	00:01:28,320	| serial-s02-e08 |	In 2006
EDL	00:01:28,832	00:01:32,160	| serial-s02-e08 |	After he became overwhelmed and had a breakdown during basic training
EDL	00:01:32,672	00:01:35,488	| serial-s02-e08 |	The Army in order to enlist him 2 years later
EDL	00:01:35,488	00:01:37,280	| serial-s02-e08 |	Would have to waive its usual standard
EDL	00:01:37,280	00:01:37,792	| serial-s02-e08 |	It's what you did
EDL	00:01:38,304	00:01:42,656	| serial-s02-e08 |	So the question actually is did the Army Recruiting process work like it was supposed to
EDL	00:01:43,936	00:01:48,544	| serial-s02-e08 |	Separation from the Coast Guard wasn't labeled a psych discharge on paper
EDL	00:01:48,544	00:01:49,824	| serial-s02-e08 |	But that's essentially what it was
EDL	00:01:50,336	00:01:51,616	| serial-s02-e08 |	So did the Army miss something
EDL	00:01:52,640	00:01:54,944	| serial-s02-e08 |	We talked to a retired army psychiatrist
EDL	00:01:54,944	00:01:56,224	| serial-s02-e08 |	Dr. elspeth Cameron Ritchie
EDL	00:01:56,736	00:02:02,624	| serial-s02-e08 |	Who's deployed all over to his chief of forensic psychiatry and also of inpatient Psychiatry at Walter Reed
EDL	00:02:03,136	00:02:06,208	| serial-s02-e08 |	And she was Psychiatry consultant to the Army Surgeon General
EDL	00:02:06,208	00:02:08,256	| serial-s02-e08 |	The top mental health advocacy position in the army
EDL	00:02:09,024	00:02:11,584	| serial-s02-e08 |	Dr. Ritchie's assessment of how all this went down with bow
EDL	00:02:13,120	00:02:14,656	| serial-s02-e08 |	She got the whole thing sounded pretty normal
EDL	00:02:15,168	00:02:16,192	| serial-s02-e08 |	Like standard practice
EDL	00:02:16,960	00:02:21,312	| serial-s02-e08 |	Attack of the army didn't have all the details about bows hospitalization in the Coast Guard
EDL	00:02:21,312	00:02:22,336	| serial-s02-e08 |	Not uncommon
EDL	00:02:22,848	00:02:29,248	| serial-s02-e08 |	She said getting access to more detailed medical information especially between branches of the military
EDL	00:02:29,248	00:02:33,600	| serial-s02-e08 |	Coast Guard and army was hard because the military's Network system wasn't so hot
EDL	00:02:33,600	00:02:35,648	| serial-s02-e08 |	Information sharing was incomplete
EDL	00:02:35,648	00:02:42,048	| serial-s02-e08 |	But she also didn't feel like anything we told her about those Coast Guard situation would have been disqualifying
EDL	00:02:42,048	00:02:43,584	| serial-s02-e08 |	Even if the Army had known
EDL	00:02:43,584	00:02:48,704	| serial-s02-e08 |	Had sent him for a mental health evaluation as the Coast Guard doctor recommended
EDL	00:02:48,704	00:02:54,848	| serial-s02-e08 |	Even if o had been assessed by saying Army psychiatrist dr. Ritchie said it probably would have been one session
EDL	00:02:55,616	00:02:59,712	| serial-s02-e08 |	And unless you showed obvious outward signs of psychosis or something like that
EDL	00:02:59,712	00:03:04,832	| serial-s02-e08 |	You're really depending on the potential recruit to self-report any psychological problems
EDL	00:03:04,832	00:03:08,416	| serial-s02-e08 |	So it's quite possible but would have been okayed regardless
EDL	00:03:08,928	00:03:11,488	| serial-s02-e08 |	At the end of the day doctor what she told us
EDL	00:03:11,488	00:03:16,864	| serial-s02-e08 |	The best assessment for weather someone's going to make it in the Army doesn't happen in the recruitment office anyway
EDL	00:03:16,864	00:03:20,192	| serial-s02-e08 |	What happens during the sustained high pressure test of basic training
EDL	00:03:20,960	00:03:22,752	| serial-s02-e08 |	And bow did really well in Army basic
EDL	00:03:24,544	00:03:25,568	| serial-s02-e08 |	That's one View
EDL	00:03:26,080	00:03:27,360	| serial-s02-e08 |	Now for a second opinion
EDL	00:03:28,128	00:03:29,152	| serial-s02-e08 |	Tumblr
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:30,176	| serial-s02-e08 |	The ball is dropped
EDL	00:03:31,200	00:03:33,248	| serial-s02-e08 |	This is dr. Michael valdovinos
EDL	00:03:33,248	00:03:34,784	| serial-s02-e08 |	He's a clinical psychologist
EDL	00:03:34,784	00:03:37,088	| serial-s02-e08 |	Is in the Air Force for about seven and a half years
EDL	00:03:37,088	00:03:41,440	| serial-s02-e08 |	Any worked in the Seer program which teaches survival evasion resistance and Escape
EDL	00:03:42,208	00:03:43,232	| serial-s02-e08 |	He knows Bo
EDL	00:03:43,232	00:03:45,792	| serial-s02-e08 |	Has led this year psych team
EDL	00:03:45,792	00:03:48,096	| serial-s02-e08 |	It helps reintegrate Bell right after his rescue
EDL	00:03:48,096	00:03:50,656	| serial-s02-e08 |	Those first few weeks when bow is at the hospital in Germany
EDL	00:03:51,680	00:03:52,448	| serial-s02-e08 |	Two things
EDL	00:03:52,448	00:03:56,288	| serial-s02-e08 |	Jalapenos has permission from bow to talk to me about their conversations
EDL	00:03:56,800	00:03:59,360	| serial-s02-e08 |	And also he was not officially Bose doctor
EDL	00:03:59,360	00:04:02,176	| serial-s02-e08 |	The job was to reintegrate them not diagnosing or anything
EDL	00:04:02,688	00:04:04,480	| serial-s02-e08 |	He never even saw both medical record back
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:08,320	| serial-s02-e08 |	He's not breaking any doctor patient confidentiality
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:12,672	| serial-s02-e08 |	All three things I guess the last being both of you knows cares about bow
EDL	00:04:12,672	00:04:15,488	| serial-s02-e08 |	Who's not just passionate on the question of what happens to him
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:23,167	| serial-s02-e08 |	Is that the Army recruiter should have looked harder at both situation should have asked more questions before
EDL	00:04:23,167	00:04:23,679	| serial-s02-e08 |	Signing him up
EDL	00:04:24,447	00:04:28,543	| serial-s02-e08 |	Even if the recruiter didn't have the particulars of Bose Coast Guard discharge in front of them
EDL	00:04:29,055	00:04:31,103	| serial-s02-e08 |	Or information about Bose hospitalization
EDL	00:04:31,615	00:04:36,991	| serial-s02-e08 |	He says the mere fact that Billy been separated at all from a branch of the military begged more scrutiny
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:46,207	| serial-s02-e08 |	Medieval bit more concerned about that
EDL	00:04:46,719	00:04:52,863	| serial-s02-e08 |	What is taking it may be a few steps further to say hey
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:57,471	| serial-s02-e08 |	Because what is separation like most house you just on its face
EDL	00:04:57,471	00:05:01,055	| serial-s02-e08 |	Is it for whatever reason this person couldn't hack it in basic training
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:06,687	| serial-s02-e08 |	Any Army recruiter's job is to send that potential recruit straight back into basic training
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:10,015	| serial-s02-e08 |	In both cases the same situation he washed out of two years earlier
EDL	00:05:11,039	00:05:13,343	| serial-s02-e08 |	Finally told him
EDL	00:05:13,343	00:05:16,159	| serial-s02-e08 |	At the recruiter did know about his problems in the Coast Guard
EDL	00:05:16,671	00:05:18,463	| serial-s02-e08 |	Because Beau says he told the recruiter
EDL	00:05:18,975	00:05:19,999	| serial-s02-e08 |	Who said he was afraid not to
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:23,071	| serial-s02-e08 |	Time since you know not a good idea to keep things from the government
EDL	00:05:23,839	00:05:29,983	| serial-s02-e08 |	No one that is
EDL	00:05:29,983	00:05:32,287	| serial-s02-e08 |	So you broke down training and
EDL	00:05:32,287	00:05:33,567	| serial-s02-e08 |	What's a hospital
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:40,479	| serial-s02-e08 |	As part of his application bow did a test
EDL	00:05:40,479	00:05:44,575	| serial-s02-e08 |	That he had not consulted with a behavioral health care provider in the last 7 years
EDL	00:05:45,343	00:05:47,391	| serial-s02-e08 |	General doll ask him about that
EDL	00:05:47,391	00:05:51,743	| serial-s02-e08 |	Listen to Coast Guard treatment wouldn't have triggered the idea of Consulting a psychologist
EDL	00:05:53,023	00:05:55,071	| serial-s02-e08 |	I found that to be consistent with those other paper
EDL	00:05:55,839	00:06:01,727	| serial-s02-e08 |	Since I'm his medical history form bochek yes to the question of whether he'd ever received Counseling of any type
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:04,799	| serial-s02-e08 |	He said he was thinking of canceling he had when he was 10 years old
EDL	00:06:06,335	00:06:09,151	| serial-s02-e08 |	General. Concluded that the Army recruiter
EDL	00:06:09,151	00:06:09,663	| serial-s02-e08 |	On paper
EDL	00:06:10,175	00:06:11,199	| serial-s02-e08 |	Did everything he was supposed
EDL	00:06:11,711	00:06:13,503	| serial-s02-e08 |	Read the codes all the regulations
EDL	00:06:14,527	00:06:15,551	| serial-s02-e08 |	Put in a footnote
EDL	00:06:15,551	00:06:18,111	| serial-s02-e08 |	Y'all seem to agree that this system isn't good enough
EDL	00:06:18,623	00:06:21,951	| serial-s02-e08 |	Situation probably should have been looked at more carefully
EDL	00:06:22,719	00:06:25,279	| serial-s02-e08 |	He wrote that when you're deciding whether to reenlist someone
EDL	00:06:25,791	00:06:28,607	| serial-s02-e08 |	Few things are more relevant than a prior separation
EDL	00:06:29,375	00:06:34,495	| serial-s02-e08 |	Seattle quotes it seems inadequate that we would rely on an interview an applicant statement
EDL	00:06:34,495	00:06:36,799	| serial-s02-e08 |	Explain the details of prior service
EDL	00:06:36,799	00:06:38,847	| serial-s02-e08 |	And not review the separation action
EDL	00:06:43,455	00:06:45,759	| serial-s02-e08 |	Where was bows head at the
EDL	00:06:45,759	00:06:46,271	| serial-s02-e08 |	This time
EDL	00:06:46,783	00:06:50,111	| serial-s02-e08 |	It's funny once you hear how both thought about the military
EDL	00:06:50,111	00:06:51,391	| serial-s02-e08 |	Why you want to join
EDL	00:06:51,903	00:06:55,231	| serial-s02-e08 |	Probably it does help explain why he decided to walk off his post
EDL	00:06:56,255	00:06:58,047	| serial-s02-e08 |	Did you did you
EDL	00:06:58,047	00:06:59,839	| serial-s02-e08 |	Think that you were going to be a career Soldier
EDL	00:07:04,447	00:07:07,775	| serial-s02-e08 |	Set my mind to get lost
EDL	00:07:13,919	00:07:16,479	| serial-s02-e08 |	World War
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:24,159	| serial-s02-e08 |	Yeah I wanted to be a samurai Soldier
EDL	00:07:24,671	00:07:27,487	| serial-s02-e08 |	Right
EDL	00:07:27,999	00:07:32,863	| serial-s02-e08 |	I wanted to be
EDL	00:07:36,959	00:07:40,543	| serial-s02-e08 |	I love the idea of just
EDL	00:07:40,543	00:07:44,383	| serial-s02-e08 |	Basically your hands and that's it
EDL	00:07:45,151	00:07:47,455	| serial-s02-e08 |	Bruce Lee when he was a kid
EDL	00:07:47,455	00:07:48,223	| serial-s02-e08 |	Private school
EDL	00:07:48,735	00:07:55,135	| serial-s02-e08 |	You watched his movies later read his books Asian Warriors especially Samurai he learned about the Bushido code
EDL	00:07:55,135	00:07:58,463	| serial-s02-e08 |	Which stresses honor and loyalty and self-sacrifice
EDL	00:07:58,463	00:08:04,863	| serial-s02-e08 |	Campbell's childhood bedroom his dad kept a collector set of old army manuals way up high in the bookshelf that is deadly
EDL	00:08:04,863	00:08:05,887	| serial-s02-e08 |	Love military history
EDL	00:08:06,399	00:08:08,703	| serial-s02-e08 |	Climbed up there and got the books down
EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:11,007	| serial-s02-e08 |	He couldn't read it study the pictures
EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:12,287	| serial-s02-e08 |	So
EDL	00:08:26,623	00:08:29,183	| serial-s02-e08 |	But I only option I had was to be
EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:34,047	| serial-s02-e08 |	Those ideal Soldier the one from history
EDL	00:08:34,559	00:08:38,143	| serial-s02-e08 |	Fights for a cause he or she is completely personally committed to
EDL	00:08:38,655	00:08:41,215	| serial-s02-e08 |	That Soldier rallies behind military leaders
EDL	00:08:41,215	00:08:42,239	| serial-s02-e08 |	That he or she trusts
EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:47,103	| serial-s02-e08 |	The modern Soldier turns out to have no choice about those essential aspects of combat
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:48,639	| serial-s02-e08 |	Instead
EDL	00:08:48,639	00:08:51,455	| serial-s02-e08 |	He's a brainless private that does whatever the government tells him to do
EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:54,271	| serial-s02-e08 |	Come here go there go fight these people
EDL	00:08:54,271	00:08:55,295	| serial-s02-e08 |	He's just a tool
EDL	00:08:55,807	00:08:56,831	| serial-s02-e08 |	That's how Bo sauce
EDL	00:08:57,855	00:09:01,183	| serial-s02-e08 |	I knew this was going to be the case when he signed up
EDL	00:09:01,183	00:09:02,207	| serial-s02-e08 |	I sort of knew it
EDL	00:09:02,719	00:09:04,511	| serial-s02-e08 |	He thought he could handle that Gulf of meaning
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:09,631	| serial-s02-e08 |	And I was hoping that I had to deal with everyday
EDL	00:09:10,143	00:09:13,471	| serial-s02-e08 |	It's like an hour to play the game you have to play by the rules as they were
EDL	00:09:13,983	00:09:16,543	| serial-s02-e08 |	Being as they were busy
EDL	00:09:22,687	00:09:24,223	| serial-s02-e08 |	This is one of the things about Bo
EDL	00:09:24,991	00:09:28,319	| serial-s02-e08 |	He wants recognizes that his expectations are unrealistic

EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:35,743	| serial-s02-e08 |	But at the same time he will fiercely defend his vision of how things should be
EDL	00:09:36,255	00:09:37,279	| serial-s02-e08 |	He does not let go
EDL	00:09:38,047	00:09:40,095	| serial-s02-e08 |	Especially when it comes to what he saw in Afghanistan
EDL	00:09:40,607	00:09:41,631	| serial-s02-e08 |	Do you think
EDL	00:09:41,631	00:09:44,703	| serial-s02-e08 |	What you witnessed and what you were reacting to
EDL	00:09:45,215	00:09:45,983	| serial-s02-e08 |	Was
EDL	00:09:47,007	00:09:50,591	| serial-s02-e08 |	The Army in an especially bad way
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:51,103	| serial-s02-e08 |	Or
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:53,919	| serial-s02-e08 |	Was it just the army
EDL	00:09:53,919	00:09:55,711	| serial-s02-e08 |	Meaning of self and kind of
EDL	00:09:56,991	00:10:00,063	| serial-s02-e08 |	Messed up as it you know in a kind of average weather
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:01,599	| serial-s02-e08 |	That make any sense
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:07,999	| serial-s02-e08 |	Normal
EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:09,791	| serial-s02-e08 |	Maybe what I was looking at was
EDL	00:10:09,791	00:10:12,351	| serial-s02-e08 |	Everyday Army however
EDL	00:10:20,799	00:10:21,567	| serial-s02-e08 |	Welding leads

EDL	00:10:28,479	00:10:31,807	| serial-s02-e08 |	What I was looking at was problems when I was looking at was
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:38,463	| serial-s02-e08 |	SimpliSafe
EDL	00:10:53,311	00:10:55,103	| serial-s02-e08 |	Marx conclusion about Bell

EDL	00:10:56,383	00:10:57,151	| serial-s02-e08 |	Talking to him
EDL	00:10:57,663	00:10:58,943	| serial-s02-e08 |	He's not a conscientious
EDL	00:10:59,967	00:11:05,087	| serial-s02-e08 |	But he's also not your casual deserter he throws up his hands and just says don't care about any of this out of here
EDL	00:11:05,855	00:11:07,391	| serial-s02-e08 |	Mark thinks he's the opposite of that
EDL	00:11:07,903	00:11:09,951	| serial-s02-e08 |	He's a rare person who will act
EDL	00:11:09,951	00:11:14,303	| serial-s02-e08 |	Rightly or wrongly it turns out but still he will act according to his principal
EDL	00:11:15,327	00:11:20,703	| serial-s02-e08 |	And his principles are wrapped up with the very institution that so many people now feel he betrayed
EDL	00:11:21,471	00:11:24,799	| serial-s02-e08 |	The disillusionment of somebody that really believes in the army
EDL	00:11:25,823	00:11:27,103	| serial-s02-e08 |	Be somebody that
EDL	00:11:27,615	00:11:29,407	| serial-s02-e08 |	Things that military leadership

EDL	00:11:31,455	00:11:32,735	| serial-s02-e08 |	The sacred position
EDL	00:11:34,015	00:11:35,807	| serial-s02-e08 |	He wants the Army to be better
EDL	00:11:37,087	00:11:41,695	| serial-s02-e08 |	The military is huge for him right in here and resented something
EDL	00:11:41,695	00:11:45,535	| serial-s02-e08 |	There's got to be a better word than huge but it represented something
EDL	00:11:46,303	00:11:48,095	| serial-s02-e08 |	Very powerful to him
EDL	00:11:48,607	00:11:49,887	| serial-s02-e08 |	Even before he joined
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:51,679	| serial-s02-e08 |	And
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:54,239	| serial-s02-e08 |	His sense of himself as a man
EDL	00:11:54,239	00:11:55,007	| serial-s02-e08 |	To his
EDL	00:11:55,007	00:11:56,799	| serial-s02-e08 |	Relationship to
EDL	00:11:56,799	00:11:59,359	| serial-s02-e08 |	Country to all sorts of
EDL	00:12:00,127	00:12:03,199	| serial-s02-e08 |	Big identity questions that were floating around for him
EDL	00:12:04,735	00:12:06,783	| serial-s02-e08 |	And it's still really important to him
EDL	00:12:07,551	00:12:09,599	| serial-s02-e08 |	He still kind of want his
EDL	00:12:10,111	00:12:12,415	| serial-s02-e08 |	Day of Reckoning with those values
EDL	00:12:13,183	00:12:15,999	| serial-s02-e08 |	In a way why he hasn't taken the more
EDL	00:12:18,303	00:12:22,143	| serial-s02-e08 |	Future all this which would just beat us her to stick your hands out and Save
EDL	00:12:22,655	00:12:24,191	| serial-s02-e08 |	Whatever you guys say I like
EDL	00:12:24,959	00:12:25,983	| serial-s02-e08 |	Guilty gif
EDL	00:12:26,495	00:12:28,799	| serial-s02-e08 |	Get me out of here
EDL	00:12:29,567	00:12:32,639	| serial-s02-e08 |	I think he doesn't want to cross the line
EDL	00:12:32,639	00:12:34,431	| serial-s02-e08 |	I'm saying I had no point
EDL	00:12:35,967	00:12:37,759	| serial-s02-e08 |	Which is not to say that Beau wants all this
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:38,527	| serial-s02-e08 |	The tension on a MAO
EDL	00:12:39,039	00:12:40,831	| serial-s02-e08 |	He wasn't speaking this big an audience
EDL	00:12:41,855	00:12:46,719	| serial-s02-e08 |	And by the way he's not asking to be some kind of like Paul Revere he just wanted he didn't
EDL	00:12:47,487	00:12:49,023	| serial-s02-e08 |	Phone never wanted
EDL	00:12:49,791	00:12:54,143	| serial-s02-e08 |	The discussion is happening now write his whole goal was to talk to
EDL	00:12:55,679	00:12:59,519	| serial-s02-e08 |	Looks like it's inter-family dispute he wanted to talk to people in the military
EDL	00:13:00,287	00:13:01,055	| serial-s02-e08 |	Yeah
EDL	00:13:01,055	00:13:04,127	| serial-s02-e08 |	There was actually reporter that was sent to
EDL	00:13:04,639	00:13:11,039	| serial-s02-e08 |	It was like embedded or something with his unit that was hanging around there and it's like he pulled the reporter aside and
EDL	00:13:11,039	00:13:12,063	| serial-s02-e08 |	Sad hey
EDL	00:13:12,063	00:13:14,623	| serial-s02-e08 |	Get loaded ass this will make a great story
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:18,975	| serial-s02-e08 |	You didn't do that he wanted to be heard within the military so
EDL	00:13:18,975	00:13:24,863	| serial-s02-e08 |	Obviously that didn't happen and obviously he behaved in a way which runs counter to like every single
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:29,215	| serial-s02-e08 |	Military precept ever known since the dawn of time which is he now you don't
EDL	00:13:29,727	00:13:35,871	| serial-s02-e08 |	You don't walk away from your from your brother so he's not a great messenger for his mess
EDL	00:13:37,151	00:13:41,247	| serial-s02-e08 |	But
EDL	00:13:49,439	00:13:51,231	| serial-s02-e08 |	I'm walking off like you did
EDL	00:13:51,231	00:13:52,767	| serial-s02-e08 |	Is it so unthinkable
EDL	00:13:53,535	00:13:58,143	| serial-s02-e08 |	Did start to see signs that Bo wasn't totally okay
EDL	00:13:59,679	00:14:01,983	| serial-s02-e08 |	At the September Hearing in Bose case
EDL	00:14:01,983	00:14:04,031	| serial-s02-e08 |	Greg Leatherman Bose weapons squad leader
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:06,847	| serial-s02-e08 |	Testified that at some point he noticed something was up
EDL	00:14:07,871	00:14:11,967	| serial-s02-e08 |	It started to kind of feel that he wasn't adjusting to the deployment like the rest of the guys were
EDL	00:14:13,503	00:14:15,807	| serial-s02-e08 |	Leatherman said he wasn't incredibly alarm
EDL	00:14:15,807	00:14:19,135	| serial-s02-e08 |	But he figures he got to say something to one of the higher-ups about it just in case
EDL	00:14:19,903	00:14:22,463	| serial-s02-e08 |	When did he's on a patrol somewhere southeast of Toronto
EDL	00:14:22,463	00:14:25,535	| serial-s02-e08 |	He finds himself sitting next to his first sergeant Pablo Jimenez
EDL	00:14:26,303	00:14:30,911	| serial-s02-e08 |	And so I told for sergeant that you know I thought that Sergeant Bergdahl should chat with somebody
EDL	00:14:31,423	00:14:37,311	| serial-s02-e08 |	You know whether be combat stress or a chaplain or even if it were just you know the company Commander just sit down and
EDL	00:14:37,311	00:14:38,591	| serial-s02-e08 |	Hey man how's everything going
EDL	00:14:39,615	00:14:42,431	| serial-s02-e08 |	Buzz lawyer a Slenderman how him and his responded to his seat
EDL	00:14:43,199	00:14:44,735	| serial-s02-e08 |	I'm just going to redo that part of the transcript
EDL	00:14:45,503	00:14:46,015	| serial-s02-e08 |	Answer
EDL	00:14:46,527	00:14:51,391	| serial-s02-e08 |	First sergeant said that he didn't want to he didn't want one of his guys to tell him what was wrong and his company
EDL	00:14:51,391	00:14:54,719	| serial-s02-e08 |	That was not my place to tell him if he had problems inside of his company
EDL	00:14:55,487	00:14:55,999	| serial-s02-e08 |	Question
EDL	00:14:56,511	00:15:00,095	| serial-s02-e08 |	I think when we interviewed you you had even more colorful language of what he said
EDL	00:15:00,607	00:15:01,119	| serial-s02-e08 |	Yes sir
EDL	00:15:01,887	00:15:02,655	| serial-s02-e08 |	Could you tell us that
EDL	00:15:03,167	00:15:03,935	| serial-s02-e08 |	Sure
EDL	00:15:03,935	00:15:04,959	| serial-s02-e08 |	He said f*** off
EDL	00:15:05,471	00:15:07,007	| serial-s02-e08 |	He said shut the f******
EDL	00:15:07,007	00:15:10,335	| serial-s02-e08 |	No one needs to hear what a f****** E5 has to say about a guy in my company
EDL	00:15:11,103	00:15:11,871	| serial-s02-e08 |	And I said
EDL	00:15:11,871	00:15:12,639	| serial-s02-e08 |	Rodger for sergeant
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:22,111	| serial-s02-e08 |	News report General Dollar includes a statement from Jimenez who says he doesn't recall this conversation with Letterman or n
EDL	00:15:22,111	00:15:23,391	| serial-s02-e08 |	Any conversation like that
EDL	00:15:23,391	00:15:27,999	| serial-s02-e08 |	Show no red flags or emotional problems as far as I could tell
EDL	00:15:27,999	00:15:28,511	| serial-s02-e08 |	Uncle
EDL	00:15:33,631	00:15:36,959	| serial-s02-e08 |	Whose friend said from his messages and letters home
EDL	00:15:36,959	00:15:39,775	| serial-s02-e08 |	I could tell he wasn't very happy with how things were going in Afghanistan
EDL	00:15:40,543	00:15:43,615	| serial-s02-e08 |	In retrospect you can sort of see his thoughts churning
EDL	00:15:43,615	00:15:44,639	| serial-s02-e08 |	Plans farming
EDL	00:15:45,663	00:15:48,479	| serial-s02-e08 |	On June 27th just three days before Bowl left mask
EDL	00:15:48,991	00:15:50,527	| serial-s02-e08 |	He wrote a letter to his parents
EDL	00:15:50,527	00:15:54,367	| serial-s02-e08 |	Venting and when she sounded pretty disgusted with how the Army was operating in Afghanistan
EDL	00:15:55,135	00:15:58,463	| serial-s02-e08 |	Give me the more loving letter to a girl he was romantically involved with
EDL	00:15:58,463	00:15:59,999	| serial-s02-e08 |	Group emails
EDL	00:15:59,999	00:16:02,559	| serial-s02-e08 |	When was titled who is John Galt
EDL	00:16:02,559	00:16:03,839	| serial-s02-e08 |	His friend Chad was on that email
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:05,631	| serial-s02-e08 |	I saw that was like
EDL	00:16:06,143	00:16:07,423	| serial-s02-e08 |	Hydrangea
EDL	00:16:07,423	00:16:09,983	| serial-s02-e08 |	Okay here we go
EDL	00:16:10,495	00:16:13,055	| serial-s02-e08 |	John Galt is a character from Atlas Shrugged
EDL	00:16:13,567	00:16:16,127	| serial-s02-e08 |	Very first line of the book who is John Galt
EDL	00:16:16,127	00:16:18,687	| serial-s02-e08 |	And after it's about a thousand pages
EDL	00:16:18,687	00:16:25,087	| serial-s02-e08 |	Finally learned that John Galt is this genius industrialist who said have single-handedly has shutdown the world economy
EDL	00:16:25,087	00:16:25,855	| serial-s02-e08 |	In order to fix it
EDL	00:16:26,367	00:16:28,159	| serial-s02-e08 |	He stops the machine
EDL	00:16:28,159	00:16:34,559	| serial-s02-e08 |	In the book he finally reveals himself delivering I kid you not 60 page speech laying out his
EDL	00:16:34,559	00:16:35,327	| serial-s02-e08 |	Awesome me
EDL	00:16:35,327	00:16:37,119	| serial-s02-e08 |	I rather Ayn rand's philosophy
EDL	00:16:37,631	00:16:42,495	| serial-s02-e08 |	And honestly just as an exercise you can grab almost any sentence from that John Galt
EDL	00:16:42,495	00:16:45,055	| serial-s02-e08 |	And apply it to what both ended up doing
EDL	00:16:45,567	00:16:46,335	| serial-s02-e08 |	Princeton
EDL	00:16:46,335	00:16:50,687	| serial-s02-e08 |	Call a code of values accepted by choice is a code of morality unquote
EDL	00:16:51,967	00:16:53,247	| serial-s02-e08 |	And now it just for kicks
EDL	00:16:53,247	00:16:55,295	| serial-s02-e08 |	Stirring save the Bushido code
EDL	00:16:55,807	00:16:59,391	| serial-s02-e08 |	The part that teaches that it's your duty to try to write a moral wrong
EDL	00:16:59,391	00:17:00,927	| serial-s02-e08 |	Regardless of whether you'll succeed
EDL	00:17:01,695	00:17:03,487	| serial-s02-e08 |	That's maybe a potent cocktail if your bow
EDL	00:17:05,279	00:17:07,071	| serial-s02-e08 |	Here's a text to BOS June 27th email
EDL	00:17:08,095	00:17:10,655	| serial-s02-e08 |	It is not the being of value who fails the
EDL	00:17:10,655	00:17:12,959	| serial-s02-e08 |	The system is the system that has failed the man
EDL	00:17:13,471	00:17:14,751	| serial-s02-e08 |	Her man should not stoop
EDL	00:17:14,751	00:17:15,775	| serial-s02-e08 |	To fit the system
EDL	00:17:15,775	00:17:19,359	| serial-s02-e08 |	But the system should be made and remade to fit the man who holds value as worth
EDL	00:17:19,871	00:17:21,663	| serial-s02-e08 |	I will serve no Bandon or liar
EDL	00:17:22,175	00:17:23,967	| serial-s02-e08 |	For I know John Galt and understand
EDL	00:17:24,479	00:17:27,551	| serial-s02-e08 |	This life is too short to serve those who compromise value and it's
EDL	00:17:27,551	00:17:28,319	| serial-s02-e08 |	FX
EDL	00:17:28,319	00:17:29,343	| serial-s02-e08 |	I am done compromising
EDL	00:17:30,623	00:17:32,159	| serial-s02-e08 |	His friend Nick read that email
EDL	00:17:32,159	00:17:32,927	| serial-s02-e08 |	Along with everyone else
EDL	00:17:33,439	00:17:34,719	| serial-s02-e08 |	What uses like
EDL	00:17:35,487	00:17:37,279	| serial-s02-e08 |	Or did you think like
EDL	00:17:37,279	00:17:38,303	| serial-s02-e08 |	Like
EDL	00:17:38,303	00:17:39,839	| serial-s02-e08 |	Sorting through a bimbo
EDL	00:17:41,887	00:17:43,935	| serial-s02-e08 |	Yeah this is the other kinds of things
EDL	00:17:43,935	00:17:44,703	| serial-s02-e08 |	He would say

EDL	00:21:21,024	00:21:23,328	| serial-s02-e08 |	And the potential to misinterpret situations

EDL	00:21:31,008	00:21:32,544	| serial-s02-e08 |	Obviously stressful
EDL	00:21:32,544	00:21:34,848	| serial-s02-e08 |	Who's not super tight with the guys in his unit
EDL	00:21:34,848	00:21:35,872	| serial-s02-e08 |	He starts to think his
EDL	00:21:35,872	00:21:37,408	| serial-s02-e08 |	Battalion Commander is against them
EDL	00:21:37,408	00:21:39,200	| serial-s02-e08 |	Might even send them on a suicide mission
EDL	00:21:39,712	00:21:41,760	| serial-s02-e08 |	Which is very paranoid thinking
EDL	00:21:41,760	00:21:43,808	| serial-s02-e08 |	And that all leads to a decision that isn't
EDL	00:21:44,320	00:21:45,856	| serial-s02-e08 |	Well entirely sane
EDL	00:21:46,368	00:21:48,928	| serial-s02-e08 |	I'll buy that point I think the paranoias at all
EDL	00:21:48,928	00:21:50,208	| serial-s02-e08 |	How to push him over the edge
EDL	00:21:51,232	00:21:52,000	| serial-s02-e08 |	He said I'm doing it
EDL	00:21:52,768	00:21:55,840	| serial-s02-e08 |	When you start thinking about the idea of him being Jason Bourne and
EDL	00:21:56,352	00:22:02,752	| serial-s02-e08 |	Still having pain doing Special Operations
EDL	00:22:02,752	00:22:03,520	| serial-s02-e08 |	Going to going
EDL	00:22:03,520	00:22:05,056	| serial-s02-e08 |	And then bring the hell
EDL	00:22:05,568	00:22:10,176	| serial-s02-e08 |	Not really thinking through the ramifications of walking off a bass into
EDL	00:22:10,176	00:22:12,224	| serial-s02-e08 |	Basically until the Taliban
EDL	00:22:12,736	00:22:15,552	| serial-s02-e08 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:22:22,464	00:22:23,744	| serial-s02-e08 |	Frustrated with the army
EDL	00:22:23,744	00:22:27,328	| serial-s02-e08 |	There's still something I think biologically that's going to keep us from
EDL	00:22:27,840	00:22:30,144	| serial-s02-e08 |	And I literally blocking off of
EDL	00:22:30,144	00:22:33,472	| serial-s02-e08 |	I just self-preservation at that point when taking back
EDL	00:22:34,240	00:22:35,520	| serial-s02-e08 |	You know I fell for him

EDL	00:22:58,304	00:23:00,864	| serial-s02-e08 |	The Army knows about this diagnosis
EDL	00:23:00,864	00:23:04,192	| serial-s02-e08 |	At the September hearing the Army prosecutor
EDL	00:23:04,192	00:23:05,472	| serial-s02-e08 |	Major Margaret kurz
EDL	00:23:05,472	00:23:08,288	| serial-s02-e08 |	Give a preview of the Army's thinking on the subject
EDL	00:23:08,288	00:23:12,640	| serial-s02-e08 |	One of the key points from the psychiatrist doctor Lang's report
EDL	00:23:13,920	00:23:20,320	| serial-s02-e08 |	Set in 2009 at the time of the alleged criminal misconduct the accused was able to appreciate
EDL	00:23:20,320	00:23:24,672	| serial-s02-e08 |	She ate the nature and quality and wrongfulness of his conduct unquote
EDL	00:23:25,696	00:23:27,744	| serial-s02-e08 |	Another words mental illness
EDL	00:23:27,744	00:23:29,792	| serial-s02-e08 |	Who should be held responsible for his actions
EDL	00:23:37,472	00:23:42,080	| serial-s02-e08 |	The other day I checked back in with Mark to see if the diagnosis made him think differently about anything
EDL	00:23:42,848	00:23:44,896	| serial-s02-e08 |	I guess it's it it's an interesting
EDL	00:23:45,408	00:23:47,712	| serial-s02-e08 |	Datapoint I don't know that it's the
EDL	00:23:48,736	00:23:50,272	| serial-s02-e08 |	Northstar
EDL	00:23:50,784	00:23:51,808	| serial-s02-e08 |	Of the story
EDL	00:23:52,832	00:23:56,672	| serial-s02-e08 |	Mark feels like he already knew walking off was not a rational thing to do
EDL	00:23:57,184	00:24:00,000	| serial-s02-e08 |	So putting a label on Bose way of thinking didn't really change much more
EDL	00:24:01,536	00:24:07,424	| serial-s02-e08 |	I told Mark that for me the diagnosis made me let go of any lingering doubts I had about the truthfulness of Bowser
EDL	00:24:08,448	00:24:09,984	| serial-s02-e08 |	Like all the details that didn't add up
EDL	00:24:10,496	00:24:13,312	| serial-s02-e08 |	Well yeah if you're paranoid and doing some magical thinking
EDL	00:24:13,312	00:24:13,824	| serial-s02-e08 |	Corset
EDL	00:24:15,360	00:24:16,384	| serial-s02-e08 |	It makes me believe in
EDL	00:24:16,384	00:24:18,944	| serial-s02-e08 |	He really was in his mind trying to raise an alarm
EDL	00:24:19,712	00:24:20,992	| serial-s02-e08 |	Mark already believes
EDL	00:24:21,760	00:24:24,832	| serial-s02-e08 |	So aside from a legal defense Mark wasn't sure the diagnosis made much of
EDL	00:24:25,856	00:24:29,184	| serial-s02-e08 |	Any worried in fact that once they heard the diagnosis
EDL	00:24:29,184	00:24:29,952	| serial-s02-e08 |	People
EDL	00:24:29,952	00:24:31,232	| serial-s02-e08 |	Maybe people like me
EDL	00:24:31,232	00:24:34,560	| serial-s02-e08 |	Would disregard everything but was saying about his military experience
EDL	00:24:35,584	00:24:36,608	| serial-s02-e08 |	I do think that
EDL	00:24:36,608	00:24:38,400	| serial-s02-e08 |	For you the diagnosis
EDL	00:24:40,192	00:24:42,752	| serial-s02-e08 |	It makes him more credible to you but it also
EDL	00:24:43,264	00:24:45,312	| serial-s02-e08 |	Means you take him less seriously
EDL	00:24:45,312	00:24:45,824	| serial-s02-e08 |	I think
EDL	00:24:46,336	00:24:47,360	| serial-s02-e08 |	As a as a
EDL	00:24:47,872	00:24:49,664	| serial-s02-e08 |	A kid with opinions you know
EDL	00:24:50,176	00:24:52,224	| serial-s02-e08 |	Has like an American soldier with a
EDL	00:24:52,224	00:24:52,736	| serial-s02-e08 |	Opinions
EDL	00:24:53,760	00:24:59,392	| serial-s02-e08 |	No I don't think that's correct I think that I think his Assessments in a general way
EDL	00:24:59,392	00:25:00,416	| serial-s02-e08 |	Of like the
EDL	00:25:00,928	00:25:07,328	| serial-s02-e08 |	Like I think we can all agree like the war in Afghanistan has not been a success right I guess I'm more think he was kind of right
EDL	00:25:07,328	00:25:08,864	| serial-s02-e08 |	By accident right
EDL	00:25:09,632	00:25:11,424	| serial-s02-e08 |	What is that mean right by accident
EDL	00:25:11,424	00:25:15,264	| serial-s02-e08 |	Like he sort of happens to be rich but not
EDL	00:25:15,264	00:25:19,872	| serial-s02-e08 |	He's not specifically right in the particular instances he's
EDL	00:25:19,872	00:25:21,920	| serial-s02-e08 |	That's really giving us examples of
EDL	00:25:22,432	00:25:23,456	| serial-s02-e08 |	The overall failure
EDL	00:25:24,224	00:25:28,832	| serial-s02-e08 |	But he's responding to real data points right I mean he's not thinking that stuff just from his
EDL	00:25:29,600	00:25:31,648	| serial-s02-e08 |	From his cat log cabin in Idaho
EDL	00:25:32,416	00:25:38,048	| serial-s02-e08 |	I guess but if I mean again I know we've we survived argued about on them before but I feel like
EDL	00:25:38,048	00:25:38,560	| serial-s02-e08 |	You know
EDL	00:25:39,328	00:25:45,728	| serial-s02-e08 |	His beef with Amna remember isn't like we never should have gone up there in the first place we never shut you know what I mean his beef really
EDL	00:25:45,728	00:25:47,776	| serial-s02-e08 |	At the end of the day has biggest complaint
EDL	00:25:48,288	00:25:50,080	| serial-s02-e08 |	Is this feeling of
EDL	00:25:51,104	00:25:53,920	| serial-s02-e08 |	R Commander doesn't care about our welfare
EDL	00:25:54,432	00:26:00,832	| serial-s02-e08 |	Yeah that it was to the point where he was maybe going to send us on a suicide mission to get rid of us because we
EDL	00:26:00,832	00:26:01,856	| serial-s02-e08 |	We are bad for his
EDL	00:26:01,856	00:26:02,624	| serial-s02-e08 |	Butaton
EDL	00:26:02,624	00:26:04,160	| serial-s02-e08 |	Yeah right like that's not
EDL	00:26:04,160	00:26:10,560	| serial-s02-e08 |	No I mean there's a lot of different judgments that that are stacked on top of each other and the last one is
EDL	00:26:10,560	00:26:11,072	| serial-s02-e08 |	Is is
EDL	00:26:11,840	00:26:13,888	| serial-s02-e08 |	Just deeply paranoid and
EDL	00:26:13,888	00:26:16,448	| serial-s02-e08 |	You can reject it on its face I don't think there's a
EDL	00:26:16,448	00:26:17,472	| serial-s02-e08 |	Commander of the US
EDL	00:26:18,496	00:26:19,776	| serial-s02-e08 |	Armed Forces who is
EDL	00:26:19,776	00:26:23,104	| serial-s02-e08 |	Do anything remotely like what both adjust
EDL	00:26:23,104	00:26:24,896	| serial-s02-e08 |	Okay so I just think it's just
EDL	00:26:25,920	00:26:28,736	| serial-s02-e08 |	But the other but the judgments that precede that
EDL	00:26:28,736	00:26:29,248	| serial-s02-e08 |	That
EDL	00:26:30,016	00:26:31,296	| serial-s02-e08 |	Maybe this Commander
EDL	00:26:32,064	00:26:33,856	| serial-s02-e08 |	Has other priorities in a
EDL	00:26:33,856	00:26:34,624	| serial-s02-e08 |	It besides
EDL	00:26:35,136	00:26:41,280	| serial-s02-e08 |	Purely the welfare of his soldiers I think that's clearly on the face of it true because he they did
EDL	00:26:41,792	00:26:45,120	| serial-s02-e08 |	Put American lives at risk to retrieve equipment
EDL	00:26:45,888	00:26:49,984	| serial-s02-e08 |	And that is part of the calculation of Warren you can talk to people and
EDL	00:26:50,496	00:26:55,104	| serial-s02-e08 |	Up and down the chain of command and I'll sell ya s*** like that happens all the time where you weigh
EDL	00:26:55,616	00:26:56,640	| serial-s02-e08 |	Someone's life
EDL	00:26:57,152	00:26:58,688	| serial-s02-e08 |	Against a piece of equipment
EDL	00:26:59,200	00:27:00,992	| serial-s02-e08 |	And that maybe a
EDL	00:27:00,992	00:27:04,064	| serial-s02-e08 |	An everyday calculation but that doesn't make it any less
EDL	00:27:04,832	00:27:07,904	| serial-s02-e08 |	F***** up especially if you're the kid that is
EDL	00:27:07,904	00:27:10,464	| serial-s02-e08 |	Whose life is being weighed to get the equipment back
EDL	00:27:11,744	00:27:13,024	| serial-s02-e08 |	Here's where Mark and I die virgin
EDL	00:27:13,792	00:27:16,608	| serial-s02-e08 |	He links Bose personal experience more directly to
EDL	00:27:16,608	00:27:17,888	| serial-s02-e08 |	The problems of the world than I do
EDL	00:27:18,400	00:27:21,216	| serial-s02-e08 |	He wants to be careful to separate what bows saying
EDL	00:27:21,216	00:27:22,240	| serial-s02-e08 |	From who Bo is
EDL	00:27:22,752	00:27:24,800	| serial-s02-e08 |	In a case like this though that's the rub
EDL	00:27:25,312	00:27:26,080	| serial-s02-e08 |	Moxie's.
EDL	00:27:26,848	00:27:28,384	| serial-s02-e08 |	Why I keep going back to
EDL	00:27:29,152	00:27:35,552	| serial-s02-e08 |	Tip something that somebody sent me a long time ago which is like I kind of agree with everything you said but I still want to punch him in the face
EDL	00:27:35,552	00:27:36,064	| serial-s02-e08 |	You know
EDL	00:27:37,856	00:27:39,904	| serial-s02-e08 |	It's like that line from The Big Lebowski
EDL	00:27:39,904	00:27:41,440	| serial-s02-e08 |	You're not wrong Walter
EDL	00:27:41,440	00:27:42,208	| serial-s02-e08 |	You're just an a******
EDL	00:27:43,488	00:27:47,072	| serial-s02-e08 |	I've heard something akin to that sentiment from a bunch of the soldiers who served with
EDL	00:27:48,096	00:27:52,448	| serial-s02-e08 |	It was not driving the leadership without a controller you know he's right about a lot of s***
EDL	00:27:52,448	00:27:54,496	| serial-s02-e08 |	We all are. We're all worried about it
EDL	00:27:54,496	00:27:55,520	| serial-s02-e08 |	Darrell Hanson
EDL	00:27:56,288	00:27:57,824	| serial-s02-e08 |	Does the fact of his
EDL	00:27:58,336	00:28:01,664	| serial-s02-e08 |	What he describes as his good intentions matter to you
EDL	00:28:04,224	00:28:05,504	| serial-s02-e08 |	Yes it does
EDL	00:28:05,504	00:28:09,600	| serial-s02-e08 |	I mean but it intention like that is not ever Justified today
EDL	00:28:10,368	00:28:16,512	| serial-s02-e08 |	It's something so huge and such a big decision in that caused so many consequences with it
EDL	00:28:16,512	00:28:18,048	| serial-s02-e08 |	I feel like you won't have to be God
EDL	00:28:18,560	00:28:21,632	| serial-s02-e08 |	To make that kind of decision
EDL	00:28:27,264	00:28:29,312	| serial-s02-e08 |	I want to be careful not to suggest
EDL	00:28:29,312	00:28:31,616	| serial-s02-e08 |	All the soldiers we talk to are in lockstep
EDL	00:28:32,384	00:28:36,736	| serial-s02-e08 |	Some of them even when we talked to them last summer said they'd already forgiven bow moved on
EDL	00:28:37,248	00:28:38,528	| serial-s02-e08 |	Other said they never get over it
EDL	00:28:39,296	00:28:43,392	| serial-s02-e08 |	The past week or two my producer Dan and I checked in without a half dozen soldiers
EDL	00:28:43,904	00:28:47,744	| serial-s02-e08 |	See if anything they'd heard from both so far in the podcast had made them feel differently
EDL	00:28:48,512	00:28:51,072	| serial-s02-e08 |	Some said they still thought he was lying about why you left
EDL	00:28:51,584	00:28:53,376	| serial-s02-e08 |	Other said they believe him now
EDL	00:28:53,376	00:28:54,912	| serial-s02-e08 |	What are trying to forgive what he did
EDL	00:28:55,424	00:28:56,192	| serial-s02-e08 |	But they just
EDL	00:28:56,192	00:28:57,728	| serial-s02-e08 |	Can't quite get there
EDL	00:28:58,240	00:28:59,008	| serial-s02-e08 |	Here's Ben Evans
EDL	00:29:00,032	00:29:02,336	| serial-s02-e08 |	He may have had the greatest intentions of the world but
EDL	00:29:04,128	00:29:05,664	| serial-s02-e08 |	Yeah I just don't I can't
EDL	00:29:07,968	00:29:08,736	| serial-s02-e08 |	Yeah just don't
EDL	00:29:10,016	00:29:11,552	| serial-s02-e08 |	Yeah
EDL	00:29:13,856	00:29:16,160	| serial-s02-e08 |	I talked to John Thurman for a while recently
EDL	00:29:16,928	00:29:22,560	| serial-s02-e08 |	John's mother is a therapist and like a lot of veterans he's also had counseling to help him deal with the after-effects of
EDL	00:29:22,560	00:29:23,072	| serial-s02-e08 |	Deployment
EDL	00:29:23,584	00:29:25,120	| serial-s02-e08 |	Maybe a little more
EDL	00:29:25,120	00:29:27,424	| serial-s02-e08 |	Touchy feely on the question of those Mental Health
EDL	00:29:27,936	00:29:32,544	| serial-s02-e08 |	I wanted to know if a diagnosis would help John not to say that what bow did was okay
EDL	00:29:32,544	00:29:34,848	| serial-s02-e08 |	But whether diagnosis would help John forgive bow
EDL	00:29:35,360	00:29:36,128	| serial-s02-e08 |	Personally
EDL	00:29:36,640	00:29:39,456	| serial-s02-e08 |	I got pretty pushy with John about it he was a really good sport
EDL	00:29:39,968	00:29:41,248	| serial-s02-e08 |	Yeah we all experience
EDL	00:29:41,248	00:29:41,760	| serial-s02-e08 |	The same thing
EDL	00:29:42,784	00:29:43,808	| serial-s02-e08 |	And we didn't walk off
EDL	00:29:45,088	00:29:51,488	| serial-s02-e08 |	I know I know but you're saying we all experience the same thing and we drove on
EDL	00:29:51,488	00:29:55,328	| serial-s02-e08 |	To you is you didn't experience well yes I didn't see it from his lens
EDL	00:29:55,328	00:29:58,400	| serial-s02-e08 |	You know she was she was getting
EDL	00:29:58,400	00:30:00,704	| serial-s02-e08 |	Scared by Adele you weren't
EDL	00:30:01,216	00:30:05,056	| serial-s02-e08 |	Like you're not perceiving danger in those reprimands
EDL	00:30:05,056	00:30:06,336	| serial-s02-e08 |	And he is
EDL	00:30:06,848	00:30:08,128	| serial-s02-e08 |	Yeah and I
EDL	00:30:08,128	00:30:14,528	| serial-s02-e08 |	I mean I don't think there was danger in those reprimands cuz I don't know I know that's not the poor not argue
EDL	00:30:14,528	00:30:15,552	| serial-s02-e08 |	Weather
EDL	00:30:16,576	00:30:18,624	| serial-s02-e08 |	We're not arguing whether he's correct
EDL	00:30:18,624	00:30:19,648	| serial-s02-e08 |	Yeah
EDL	00:30:20,416	00:30:21,696	| serial-s02-e08 |	I really really really
EDL	00:30:21,696	00:30:22,208	| serial-s02-e08 |	Try
EDL	00:30:23,232	00:30:24,000	| serial-s02-e08 |	To see it from
EDL	00:30:24,000	00:30:24,512	| serial-s02-e08 |	His side
EDL	00:30:25,024	00:30:28,608	| serial-s02-e08 |	Through his lens and I understand that he and I have very different brains
EDL	00:30:32,192	00:30:33,216	| serial-s02-e08 |	Perception or not
EDL	00:30:34,240	00:30:35,520	| serial-s02-e08 |	I mean I still can never
EDL	00:30:35,520	00:30:36,032	| serial-s02-e08 |	Forgiven
EDL	00:30:36,544	00:30:37,312	| serial-s02-e08 |	Mercante
EDL	00:30:37,312	00:30:38,080	| serial-s02-e08 |	And it's on Principe
EDL	00:30:39,360	00:30:40,640	| serial-s02-e08 |	He broke
EDL	00:30:40,640	00:30:41,920	| serial-s02-e08 |	That intimate Bond
EDL	00:30:42,688	00:30:43,968	| serial-s02-e08 |	That we all share with each other
EDL	00:30:44,992	00:30:47,040	| serial-s02-e08 |	That's not something you can ever come back
EDL	00:30:47,040	00:30:48,576	| serial-s02-e08 |	I don't care where your head was
EDL	00:30:49,856	00:30:50,880	| serial-s02-e08 |	Bo you still f****** dead
EDL	00:30:51,392	00:30:52,416	| serial-s02-e08 |	You walked off
EDL	00:30:52,416	00:30:52,928	| serial-s02-e08 |	And you betrayed
EDL	00:30:54,208	00:30:57,792	| serial-s02-e08 |	It's like you stop there. It stops there
EDL	00:30:58,304	00:31:01,120	| serial-s02-e08 |	And that's just that that's the infantryman and me taking over
EDL	00:31:07,008	00:31:08,800	| serial-s02-e08 |	I'm a dyed-in-the-wool civilian
EDL	00:31:08,800	00:31:09,824	| serial-s02-e08 |	From a family of civilian
EDL	00:31:10,336	00:31:12,640	| serial-s02-e08 |	My father was in the Army in World War II
EDL	00:31:12,640	00:31:16,992	| serial-s02-e08 |	But he didn't deployed overseas the only War Stories I remember him telling me we're about like
EDL	00:31:16,992	00:31:18,272	| serial-s02-e08 |	Carousing in Denver
EDL	00:31:18,784	00:31:19,296	| serial-s02-e08 |	Sorry Dad
EDL	00:31:19,808	00:31:26,208	| serial-s02-e08 |	It wasn't immediately obvious to me why some of the people both served with were not even just mad
EDL	00:31:26,208	00:31:26,976	| serial-s02-e08 |	Hurt
EDL	00:31:26,976	00:31:28,000	| serial-s02-e08 |	Deeply hurt in some case
EDL	00:31:29,280	00:31:30,816	| serial-s02-e08 |	What I understand now is that
EDL	00:31:30,816	00:31:31,840	| serial-s02-e08 |	That Bond
EDL	00:31:31,840	00:31:33,376	| serial-s02-e08 |	Brotherhood they feel
EDL	00:31:33,376	00:31:34,400	| serial-s02-e08 |	It's not just a cliche
EDL	00:31:34,912	00:31:37,728	| serial-s02-e08 |	What is a cliche but it's also profoundly true
EDL	00:31:38,240	00:31:39,776	| serial-s02-e08 |	I think about it this way
EDL	00:31:39,776	00:31:41,568	| serial-s02-e08 |	In my life who would die for me
EDL	00:31:42,080	00:31:42,592	| serial-s02-e08 |	Really
EDL	00:31:43,104	00:31:43,872	| serial-s02-e08 |	My mom maybe
EDL	00:31:44,640	00:31:45,408	| serial-s02-e08 |	Who would I die
EDL	00:31:46,432	00:31:46,944	| serial-s02-e08 |	Ikids
EDL	00:31:47,968	00:31:50,272	| serial-s02-e08 |	And so imagine you're in a platoon
EDL	00:31:50,272	00:31:51,808	| serial-s02-e08 |	You become so close
EDL	00:31:51,808	00:31:52,832	| serial-s02-e08 |	So fast
EDL	00:31:52,832	00:31:54,368	| serial-s02-e08 |	To all these guys around you
EDL	00:31:54,368	00:31:56,160	| serial-s02-e08 |	You recognize each other's cough
EDL	00:31:56,160	00:31:57,440	| serial-s02-e08 |	Are there silhouette in the dark
EDL	00:31:57,952	00:32:00,256	| serial-s02-e08 |	You would die for The Other Guys in your platoon
EDL	00:32:00,256	00:32:01,792	| serial-s02-e08 |	Even if you don't like them you do it
EDL	00:32:02,304	00:32:03,584	| serial-s02-e08 |	And they would die for you
EDL	00:32:04,096	00:32:06,400	| serial-s02-e08 |	It's not even hypothetical it happens all the time
EDL	00:32:07,168	00:32:08,192	| serial-s02-e08 |	And because of that
EDL	00:32:08,192	00:32:09,728	| serial-s02-e08 |	Personalities aside
EDL	00:32:09,728	00:32:14,336	| serial-s02-e08 |	These guys become family to one another if you walk away like Bo did
EDL	00:32:14,336	00:32:16,896	| serial-s02-e08 |	You break the promise you all have made to each other
EDL	00:32:17,408	00:32:18,688	| serial-s02-e08 |	You undermine the whole Enterprise
EDL	00:32:19,456	00:32:20,992	| serial-s02-e08 |	Your family starts to crumble
EDL	00:32:20,992	00:32:21,760	| serial-s02-e08 |	When you need it most
EDL	00:32:22,784	00:32:29,184	| serial-s02-e08 |	And that's what the soldiers say happened during the search for Bo Bo's friend Chris Engels said
EDL	00:32:29,184	00:32:33,792	| serial-s02-e08 |	It was like the soul of their platoon just dwindled people shrink into themselves
EDL	00:32:34,304	00:32:39,424	| serial-s02-e08 |	Even afterwards 2nd platoon felt like they were blamed for believing
EDL	00:32:39,424	00:32:41,728	| serial-s02-e08 |	They were sort of banished from the larger family of the
EDL	00:32:41,728	00:32:42,240	| serial-s02-e08 |	Italian
EDL	00:32:43,008	00:32:45,312	| serial-s02-e08 |	A sergeant everyone told us they just love
EDL	00:32:45,312	00:32:46,336	| serial-s02-e08 |	A guy named Larry Hein
EDL	00:32:46,848	00:32:48,384	| serial-s02-e08 |	Was moved out of the platoon
EDL	00:32:48,384	00:32:51,456	| serial-s02-e08 |	Summer Place by commander who was to put it gently
