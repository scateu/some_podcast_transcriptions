EDL	00:00:46,080	00:00:47,616	| serial-s02-e03 |	He's in Pakistan
EDL	00:00:52,480	00:00:58,112	| serial-s02-e03 |	From This American Life and WBEZ Chicago its serial one story told me by week
EDL	00:00:58,112	00:01:04,256	| serial-s02-e03 |	I'm Sarah Koenig
EDL	00:01:13,728	00:01:17,312	| serial-s02-e03 |	Right after Bowe Bergdahl first went missing from his Outpost in Afghanistan
EDL	00:01:17,312	00:01:22,688	| serial-s02-e03 |	Word came down that the higher-ups wanted someone from Bo's platoon second platoon Blackfoot company
EDL	00:01:22,688	00:01:25,504	| serial-s02-e03 |	Record a message to Bill that they play on local radio
EDL	00:01:26,272	00:01:28,320	| serial-s02-e03 |	They wanted it to be a voice but would recognize
EDL	00:01:28,832	00:01:30,624	| serial-s02-e03 |	So the guy Bo was friends with
EDL	00:01:30,624	00:01:32,160	| serial-s02-e03 |	Guy from Louisiana
EDL	00:01:32,160	00:01:34,208	| serial-s02-e03 |	You have a very thick Louisiana accent
EDL	00:01:37,024	00:01:39,584	| serial-s02-e03 |	So basically
EDL	00:01:40,096	00:01:40,608	| serial-s02-e03 |	Chi
EDL	00:01:42,144	00:01:43,936	| serial-s02-e03 |	She went up there and I guess he didn't like it
EDL	00:01:43,936	00:01:47,520	| serial-s02-e03 |	They came down and they got me that's Josh quarter originally from Pennsylvania
EDL	00:01:48,032	00:01:50,080	| serial-s02-e03 |	Didn't want to make a message to Bo
EDL	00:01:50,080	00:01:54,944	| serial-s02-e03 |	He says he felt a little disloyal to his platoon calling out to the guy who is causing them such turmoil
EDL	00:01:54,944	00:01:59,040	| serial-s02-e03 |	But they did the baby, come they brought me up there two officers brought me up there
EDL	00:01:59,040	00:02:02,112	| serial-s02-e03 |	And they put a piece of paper in front of me which is a script
EDL	00:02:02,624	00:02:03,648	| serial-s02-e03 |	And said read this
EDL	00:02:04,928	00:02:05,696	| serial-s02-e03 |	What was the script
EDL	00:02:06,464	00:02:07,232	| serial-s02-e03 |	I was like
EDL	00:02:08,000	00:02:13,376	| serial-s02-e03 |	It was It was kind of cheesy to it was like hey Bo this is Josh we really miss you
EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:14,656	| serial-s02-e03 |	I know we we just
EDL	00:02:14,656	00:02:18,752	| serial-s02-e03 |	Want you to come back we hope you're safe we hope everything's going okay
EDL	00:02:18,752	00:02:20,288	| serial-s02-e03 |	You know so come back
EDL	00:02:20,800	00:02:23,104	| serial-s02-e03 |	I guess I kept thinking later on that my
EDL	00:02:23,104	00:02:29,248	| serial-s02-e03 |	Like for the entire five years movie the same thing
EDL	00:02:29,760	00:02:31,040	| serial-s02-e03 |	Going on
EDL	00:02:31,040	00:02:33,088	| serial-s02-e03 |	In Pakistan and Afghanistan
EDL	00:02:33,088	00:02:34,624	| serial-s02-e03 |	Talon bow to come home
EDL	00:02:35,392	00:02:37,952	| serial-s02-e03 |	Safe to say bone ever heard the message
EDL	00:02:37,952	00:02:39,232	| serial-s02-e03 |	Also safe to say
EDL	00:02:39,232	00:02:41,792	| serial-s02-e03 |	Was trying really hard to come home
EDL	00:02:41,792	00:02:43,584	| serial-s02-e03 |	His first year in captivity
EDL	00:02:43,584	00:02:46,144	| serial-s02-e03 |	Starts with an escape and ends with an escape
EDL	00:02:46,144	00:02:48,448	| serial-s02-e03 |	Like shity bookends to a terrible year
EDL	00:02:51,520	00:02:55,872	| serial-s02-e03 |	In between the Escape spell was learning necessary Twisted lessons of survival
EDL	00:02:56,384	00:02:58,176	| serial-s02-e03 |	How to smile when you're in agony
EDL	00:02:58,176	00:03:00,480	| serial-s02-e03 |	But if you ask for something such as water
EDL	00:03:00,480	00:03:03,808	| serial-s02-e03 |	You're likely to get less of it or less of something else such as food
EDL	00:03:04,320	00:03:09,952	| serial-s02-e03 |	If you're severely dehydrated you can't really drink your own urine because it turns into a salty Brown sludge
EDL	00:03:10,464	00:03:12,768	| serial-s02-e03 |	The filth and stink are your best weapons
EDL	00:03:12,768	00:03:15,840	| serial-s02-e03 |	More disgusting you are at the less your captors want to come hear you
EDL	00:03:15,840	00:03:18,400	| serial-s02-e03 |	Which means you can scroll things away in your bed clothes
EDL	00:03:18,400	00:03:23,008	| serial-s02-e03 |	The smaller and weaker you can make yourself the more likely the Taliban are to let you alone
EDL	00:03:23,520	00:03:26,080	| serial-s02-e03 |	And as painful as it is to be forgotten
EDL	00:03:26,080	00:03:27,872	| serial-s02-e03 |	Ultimately that's what you want
EDL	00:03:35,296	00:03:36,320	| serial-s02-e03 |	Not even an animal
EDL	00:03:37,600	00:03:40,160	| serial-s02-e03 |	Picture someone taking a bag
EDL	00:03:40,928	00:03:45,024	| serial-s02-e03 |	The closet shutting the door and just forgetting about it
EDL	00:03:58,336	00:04:04,736	| serial-s02-e03 |	Melissa Ann jeans a drone with a commander in charge of keeping go prisoner up until 2013 on Sunday was killed in a dream
EDL	00:04:04,736	00:04:05,248	| serial-s02-e03 |	Gun strike
EDL	00:04:09,600	00:04:11,648	| serial-s02-e03 |	Give me food
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:18,047	| serial-s02-e03 |	Other guys
EDL	00:04:23,167	00:04:24,959	| serial-s02-e03 |	Literally just
EDL	00:04:27,007	00:04:28,031	| serial-s02-e03 |	And got
EDL	00:04:32,127	00:04:37,759	| serial-s02-e03 |	Back in Afghanistan the storm of search-and-rescue operations for Bo had slowed and then doing.
EDL	00:04:38,783	00:04:41,087	| serial-s02-e03 |	They keep your eyes and ears out of course
EDL	00:04:41,087	00:04:43,391	| serial-s02-e03 |	Military have to call it
EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:46,719	| serial-s02-e03 |	Elbow was in the worst place he could be
EDL	00:04:46,719	00:04:48,511	| serial-s02-e03 |	Anyone who's going to rescue them
EDL	00:04:48,511	00:04:51,583	| serial-s02-e03 |	Locked in a room across the border in Pakistan
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:59,775	| serial-s02-e03 |	It seemed like a very strong possibility that he was a Taliban sympathizer I'll put it that way and it seemed that
EDL	00:04:59,775	00:05:01,055	| serial-s02-e03 |	That she
EDL	00:05:02,079	00:05:04,383	| serial-s02-e03 |	The unrated version is like what a f****** a******
EDL	00:05:04,895	00:05:05,407	| serial-s02-e03 |	You know
EDL	00:05:06,175	00:05:11,295	| serial-s02-e03 |	That was Mark balls first casual assessment of bow we heard the early reports it would walk off
EDL	00:05:11,807	00:05:13,855	| serial-s02-e03 |	What's a lot of people's assessment
EDL	00:05:13,855	00:05:17,183	| serial-s02-e03 |	That's understandable based on the information dripping out of the time
EDL	00:05:17,183	00:05:20,767	| serial-s02-e03 |	An early propaganda video reports that boat converted to Islam
EDL	00:05:21,279	00:05:24,863	| serial-s02-e03 |	Yeah and then they remember there was nothing of him like
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:29,471	| serial-s02-e03 |	But there has been there have been some kind of reporting that he was riding around on a horse
EDL	00:05:29,471	00:05:30,495	| serial-s02-e03 |	I remember that too
EDL	00:05:31,007	00:05:33,311	| serial-s02-e03 |	I'm just looking at 1 from the Daily Mail
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:34,847	| serial-s02-e03 |	And it says
EDL	00:05:34,847	00:05:41,247	| serial-s02-e03 |	One of his captors said that he converted to his mom it was going under the name Stella and was very relaxed in her come
EDL	00:05:41,247	00:05:42,271	| serial-s02-e03 |	Anthony unquote
EDL	00:05:42,271	00:05:43,039	| serial-s02-e03 |	It has
EDL	00:05:43,039	00:05:49,439	| serial-s02-e03 |	It has also been claimed that Bergdahl was so trusted by his kidnappers but they let him sleep without restraints and go bird and rabbit hunting with
EDL	00:05:49,439	00:05:50,463	| serial-s02-e03 |	Old British rifle
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:55,583	| serial-s02-e03 |	Oh you know what that reminds me I heard another one that he played soccer
EDL	00:05:56,095	00:06:00,447	| serial-s02-e03 |	Information like this I learned that intelligence analysts refer to it as stray voltage
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:03,007	| serial-s02-e03 |	By that they mean it's almost certainly untrue
EDL	00:06:03,775	00:06:10,175	| serial-s02-e03 |	But still added up to people judging from the outside it didn't look good Mark said it made him feel like maybe Bo wasn't someone who
EDL	00:06:10,175	00:06:10,943	| serial-s02-e03 |	He should be caring about
EDL	00:06:11,711	00:06:14,783	| serial-s02-e03 |	What does the opposite feeling usually get when you hear about a p o w
EDL	00:06:15,807	00:06:21,951	| serial-s02-e03 |	Then after both came back and was in Germany recovering Mark talk to someone in the until world who knew what was going on
EDL	00:06:21,951	00:06:23,999	| serial-s02-e03 |	I actually remember somebody telling me
EDL	00:06:24,511	00:06:26,303	| serial-s02-e03 |	Oh yeah he's
EDL	00:06:26,303	00:06:27,071	| serial-s02-e03 |	He's doing
EDL	00:06:30,655	00:06:31,679	| serial-s02-e03 |	That's weird I thought he was
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:34,751	| serial-s02-e03 |	Call that guy
EDL	00:06:35,775	00:06:41,663	| serial-s02-e03 |	He's like he's not in this was during the jury went all the Press recording was about
EDL	00:06:42,175	00:06:45,247	| serial-s02-e03 |	You know how I like mentally damaged she was and how he was
EDL	00:06:45,247	00:06:46,015	| serial-s02-e03 |	Gradually
EDL	00:06:46,783	00:06:48,575	| serial-s02-e03 |	In a reactor that into the world and
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:50,879	| serial-s02-e03 |	Everyone's I cautioning like
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:55,231	| serial-s02-e03 |	And I don't expect him to pop up on TV anytime soon cuz he's severely
EDL	00:06:55,743	00:06:56,511	| serial-s02-e03 |	Traumatized
EDL	00:06:57,279	00:06:59,839	| serial-s02-e03 |	And then I was also hearing that like privately he was
EDL	00:07:00,351	00:07:03,167	| serial-s02-e03 |	I mean maybe all that stuff was true and I'm sure it is but
EDL	00:07:03,679	00:07:05,727	| serial-s02-e03 |	At the same time he was doing a lot of
EDL	00:07:05,727	00:07:07,775	| serial-s02-e03 |	Prefixes like wait he's
EDL	00:07:09,567	00:07:11,615	| serial-s02-e03 |	It doesn't sound like a Trader
EDL	00:07:13,407	00:07:16,735	| serial-s02-e03 |	When I finally heard Beau talk about his time with the Taliban
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:17,759	| serial-s02-e03 |	I thought no
EDL	00:07:18,271	00:07:19,551	| serial-s02-e03 |	He does not sound like a traitor
EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:27,231	| serial-s02-e03 |	As brutal as both first year in captivity was
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:28,511	| serial-s02-e03 |	At least he had plans
EDL	00:07:29,023	00:07:30,559	| serial-s02-e03 |	His single-minded purpose
EDL	00:07:30,559	00:07:32,095	| serial-s02-e03 |	Was to get out
EDL	00:07:32,095	00:07:34,655	| serial-s02-e03 |	Asbestos Pokemon call the first Escape
EDL	00:07:34,655	00:07:40,543	| serial-s02-e03 |	You don't have the one where he ran 20 or 30 feet before I got tackled have in the first week he was in town in custody
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:47,967	| serial-s02-e03 |	Taliban fighters by the way have confirmed that bowed it escaped once briefly early on and then again for a longer time
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:48,735	| serial-s02-e03 |	Roughly a year later
EDL	00:07:49,503	00:07:53,087	| serial-s02-e03 |	That first week both as he was being held at House of some kind
EDL	00:07:53,087	00:07:57,183	| serial-s02-e03 |	His feet were tied with ropes a chain was wrapped in several loops around his wrist
EDL	00:07:57,695	00:08:04,095	| serial-s02-e03 |	He said he noticed that the previous morning a car had arrived with water and as soon as it did everyone went inside and
EDL	00:08:04,095	00:08:05,119	| serial-s02-e03 |	Another room for tea
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:07,679	| serial-s02-e03 |	So when the car came again with the water
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:08,959	| serial-s02-e03 |	Who says he saw his chance
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:16,383	| serial-s02-e03 |	You managed to manipulate the slack in the chain so that he could slip it over his knuckles he untied his feet
EDL	00:08:16,383	00:08:22,015	| serial-s02-e03 |	Doors of the room he was in relaxed from the outside with a thick wire to stick his hand through the crack to undo it
EDL	00:08:24,319	00:08:27,647	| serial-s02-e03 |	Sticking my hand out I mean good grief
EDL	00:08:27,647	00:08:29,695	| serial-s02-e03 |	If anyone was standing outside

EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:05,759	| serial-s02-e03 |	He developed open wounds on his ankles and infection which into spread to his forehead

EDL	00:12:17,535	00:12:18,303	| serial-s02-e03 |	His arms
EDL	00:12:18,303	00:12:22,399	| serial-s02-e03 |	Secured it down my side instead of over his head which allowed him to at least sit up
EDL	00:12:22,399	00:12:25,471	| serial-s02-e03 |	The room had dirt walls in a dirt-floor bus as
EDL	00:12:25,983	00:12:28,543	| serial-s02-e03 |	Every three or four weeks you could shower and wash his clothes
EDL	00:12:29,567	00:12:31,359	| serial-s02-e03 |	By the time 6 months head
EDL	00:12:31,359	00:12:32,639	| serial-s02-e03 |	Had diarrhea
EDL	00:12:32,639	00:12:35,711	| serial-s02-e03 |	You would have diarrhea for roughly three and a half years
EDL	00:12:35,711	00:12:41,855	| serial-s02-e03 |	No toilet paper or regular access to water most of the time his food with scant and came unpredictably
EDL	00:12:42,879	00:12:46,463	| serial-s02-e03 |	In the broadest Strokes his captivity consisted of twins hormones
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:48,255	| serial-s02-e03 |	Isolation and sickness
EDL	00:12:48,255	00:12:54,655	| serial-s02-e03 |	Or as well as principal military degree for describe it there were roughly three phases to post captivity Phase 1
EDL	00:12:54,655	00:12:55,423	| serial-s02-e03 |	Torture
EDL	00:12:55,423	00:12:57,471	| serial-s02-e03 |	Phase 2 abuse phase 3
EDL	00:13:01,823	00:13:03,615	| serial-s02-e03 |	Privation
EDL	00:13:03,615	00:13:06,175	| serial-s02-e03 |	How much lighter too much Darkness
EDL	00:13:06,175	00:13:07,455	| serial-s02-e03 |	Randomness
EDL	00:13:08,223	00:13:10,527	| serial-s02-e03 |	Where is the way
EDL	00:13:10,527	00:13:12,319	| serial-s02-e03 |	Your nerves into the ground
EDL	00:13:13,087	00:13:13,599	| serial-s02-e03 |	Yeah
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:23,071	| serial-s02-e03 |	Eeyore
EDL	00:13:23,071	00:13:24,351	| serial-s02-e03 |	Am I going to be able to
EDL	00:13:25,631	00:13:27,679	| serial-s02-e03 |	Go to the bathroom
EDL	00:13:27,679	00:13:30,239	| serial-s02-e03 |	Without some kind of problem
EDL	00:13:34,847	00:13:38,431	| serial-s02-e03 |	The conversations between Beau and Mark started just a few months after both came back
EDL	00:13:39,711	00:13:43,295	| serial-s02-e03 |	Botox a lot about how he's numb or distant or disconnected
EDL	00:13:43,295	00:13:46,367	| serial-s02-e03 |	Which actually has the benefit of helping him talk about what happened
EDL	00:13:47,135	00:13:50,975	| serial-s02-e03 |	Still the details about the worst episodes are sometimes hard to say
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:51,999	| serial-s02-e03 |	And hard for Mark
EDL	00:13:51,999	00:13:52,511	| serial-s02-e03 |	To take in
EDL	00:13:53,023	00:13:54,559	| serial-s02-e03 |	As a as a story it's
EDL	00:13:57,375	00:14:00,191	| serial-s02-e03 |	It's really it's overwhelming
EDL	00:14:01,727	00:14:04,287	| serial-s02-e03 |	And I can comprehend it in little bits and pieces
EDL	00:14:05,311	00:14:11,199	| serial-s02-e03 |	Like the isolated stuff as it goes along these details that you're giving me each one of them make sense
EDL	00:14:11,199	00:14:11,967	| serial-s02-e03 |	You know
EDL	00:14:11,967	00:14:12,991	| serial-s02-e03 |	And they're kind of
EDL	00:14:13,759	00:14:15,295	| serial-s02-e03 |	Not that hard to
EDL	00:14:16,063	00:14:18,367	| serial-s02-e03 |	To imagine cuz you're good at describing it
EDL	00:14:19,135	00:14:23,231	| serial-s02-e03 |	But they when you accumulate them all together and you think about this
EDL	00:14:23,231	00:14:25,279	| serial-s02-e03 |	Stretch of time and you think about
EDL	00:14:27,071	00:14:32,703	| serial-s02-e03 |	Just day-in-and-day-out if that's going to become sort of incomprehensibly
EDL	00:14:34,239	00:14:35,007	| serial-s02-e03 |	Dark
EDL	00:14:35,007	00:14:35,519	| serial-s02-e03 |	You know
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:41,407	| serial-s02-e03 |	Just
EDL	00:14:41,407	00:14:45,759	| serial-s02-e03 |	And I understand why they guys this year guys in the psychologists were so
EDL	00:14:46,271	00:14:49,087	| serial-s02-e03 |	Surprised that you weren't a total vegetable you know
EDL	00:14:51,135	00:14:52,415	| serial-s02-e03 |	Cuz I think that that's our
EDL	00:14:53,951	00:14:55,231	| serial-s02-e03 |	That would have been enough
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:14:57,791	| serial-s02-e03 |	To basically put
EDL	00:14:58,815	00:15:00,863	| serial-s02-e03 |	95% of people in a
EDL	00:15:02,143	00:15:03,423	| serial-s02-e03 |	Turn them into potatoes
EDL	00:15:08,287	00:15:09,823	| serial-s02-e03 |	But was being held by the haqqanis
EDL	00:15:10,335	00:15:14,175	| serial-s02-e03 |	A group run by very powerful pashtun family allowed with the Taliban
EDL	00:15:14,943	00:15:21,343	| serial-s02-e03 |	They're based in North waziristan which is in Pakistan's tribal region bordering Afghanistan
EDL	00:15:21,343	00:15:26,719	| serial-s02-e03 |	Agreed to hold boat for the Taliban and the guy in charge of Bose physical person was Melissa MaGee
EDL	00:15:27,743	00:15:31,071	| serial-s02-e03 |	A half-dozen times over the years
EDL	00:15:31,583	00:15:37,215	| serial-s02-e03 |	In all those who is kept and maybe eight different locations different compounds different rooms
EDL	00:15:37,215	00:15:38,495	| serial-s02-e03 |	Made of mud or cement
EDL	00:15:41,055	00:15:44,639	| serial-s02-e03 |	Especially at the beginning the Taliban question him
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:47,967	| serial-s02-e03 |	But he said they weren't what you might normally think of as an interrogation
EDL	00:15:48,479	00:15:52,063	| serial-s02-e03 |	The questions were strange and sometimes incoherent
EDL	00:15:55,135	00:16:01,535	| serial-s02-e03 |	You're the officer is on your face how do they get their prostitutes
EDL	00:16:01,535	00:16:07,679	| serial-s02-e03 |	You know they're trying to find
EDL	00:16:13,311	00:16:17,151	| serial-s02-e03 |	Obama gay
EDL	00:16:17,151	00:16:19,711	| serial-s02-e03 |	I asked you about
EDL	00:16:20,735	00:16:22,271	| serial-s02-e03 |	How good a camera
EDL	00:16:27,647	00:16:30,207	| serial-s02-e03 |	Thankfully the guy who did speak English
EDL	00:16:30,207	00:16:31,231	| serial-s02-e03 |	And
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:39,935	| serial-s02-e03 |	Information
EDL	00:16:41,727	00:16:44,031	| serial-s02-e03 |	And so you never really ask me anything
EDL	00:16:44,543	00:16:45,311	| serial-s02-e03 |	That was
EDL	00:16:50,687	00:16:53,759	| serial-s02-e03 |	One time you asked me how many bombs
EDL	00:16:57,855	00:17:00,671	| serial-s02-e03 |	This hodgepodge a perfectly reasonable questions
EDL	00:17:00,671	00:17:01,439	| serial-s02-e03 |	How did the drones work
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:03,487	| serial-s02-e03 |	And then it kind of crazy talk
EDL	00:17:03,999	00:17:06,303	| serial-s02-e03 |	Is it true All American women are prostitutes
EDL	00:17:06,303	00:17:07,327	| serial-s02-e03 |	But they sleep with animals
EDL	00:17:08,095	00:17:10,655	| serial-s02-e03 |	It makes you wonder why they're just trying to rile though up
EDL	00:17:10,655	00:17:15,519	| serial-s02-e03 |	Or whether their understanding of our world is as paltry as our understanding of theirs
EDL	00:17:15,519	00:17:17,567	| serial-s02-e03 |	Something I learned really quickly
EDL	00:17:17,567	00:17:20,895	| serial-s02-e03 |	If you show hesitation in telling them something
EDL	00:17:21,407	00:17:22,943	| serial-s02-e03 |	I think they're onto something
EDL	00:17:23,967	00:17:30,367	| serial-s02-e03 |	But if you if they ask you a question and you just start talking to him like you're talking to a normal person
EDL	00:17:30,367	00:17:32,159	| serial-s02-e03 |	Make it extremely suspicious
EDL	00:17:32,671	00:17:38,559	| serial-s02-e03 |	Because they seemed well if he is has no problem telling me this and there's something wrong with that information

EDL	00:17:40,351	00:17:41,631	| serial-s02-e03 |	They pretty much assume you're lying
EDL	00:17:42,143	00:17:45,471	| serial-s02-e03 |	Which is maybe why they didn't really pressing too hard on any of this stuff
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:48,031	| serial-s02-e03 |	High-ranking Taliban told us

EDL	00:17:54,431	00:17:59,039	| serial-s02-e03 |	Besides both said the Taliban get most of their information information they consider more trustworthy

EDL	00:18:15,167	00:18:16,447	| serial-s02-e03 |	What they wanted to do
EDL	00:18:17,215	00:18:19,007	| serial-s02-e03 |	You might have seen some of these videos on the internet
EDL	00:18:19,519	00:18:22,591	| serial-s02-e03 |	Who said they made probably a dozen of them that were never released
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:23,871	| serial-s02-e03 |	But a small handful were
EDL	00:18:25,151	00:18:27,711	| serial-s02-e03 |	Both of the Taliban spend a lot of time making them
EDL	00:18:27,711	00:18:28,991	| serial-s02-e03 |	The morale-boosting
EDL	00:18:28,991	00:18:32,831	| serial-s02-e03 |	Plus he says the Taliban love to embarrass the United States anyway they can
EDL	00:18:33,855	00:18:36,927	| serial-s02-e03 |	But you can't make too many videos are released too many
EDL	00:18:36,927	00:18:38,975	| serial-s02-e03 |	Because every time you do you're exposing yourself
EDL	00:18:39,487	00:18:43,839	| serial-s02-e03 |	Details about the staging or someone's accent of the production values of the dacor

EDL	00:20:41,087	00:20:47,487	| serial-s02-e03 |	He said the sunglasses were so you couldn't see his eyes reading the paper and also maybe because the Taliban think sunglasses look cool
EDL	00:20:47,487	00:20:53,119	| serial-s02-e03 |	Which grade and take pictures of naked

EDL	00:21:27,936	00:21:31,520	| serial-s02-e03 |	The videos also hit other common Taliban talking points
EDL	00:21:31,520	00:21:37,664	| serial-s02-e03 |	One of which is that the US government is lying to the American public about how many American soldiers have been killed in Afghanistan

EDL	00:22:03,520	00:22:04,800	| serial-s02-e03 |	Call the code of conduct
EDL	00:22:05,312	00:22:06,592	| serial-s02-e03 |	It says among other things
EDL	00:22:07,104	00:22:12,480	| serial-s02-e03 |	If I am captured I will continue to resist by all means available I will make every effort to escape
EDL	00:22:12,480	00:22:17,088	| serial-s02-e03 |	I will give no information or take part in any action which might be harmful to my comrades
EDL	00:22:17,600	00:22:20,928	| serial-s02-e03 |	And when questioned besides name rank and serial number quote
EDL	00:22:20,928	00:22:24,768	| serial-s02-e03 |	I will evade answering further questions to the utmost of my ability
EDL	00:22:24,768	00:22:29,888	| serial-s02-e03 |	I will make no oral or written statements disloyal to my country and its allies or harmful to their cause
EDL	00:22:31,424	00:22:36,544	| serial-s02-e03 |	Soldiers I talk to you from Bo's Battalion told me the fact that Bo appears in these videos at all
EDL	00:22:36,544	00:22:39,104	| serial-s02-e03 |	It is answering their questions repeating their talking points
EDL	00:22:39,616	00:22:42,432	| serial-s02-e03 |	That right there is an obvious violation of the code of conduct
EDL	00:22:43,200	00:22:47,808	| serial-s02-e03 |	They said even if someone has a gun to your head and by the way both says there were guys with guns on his video shoot
EDL	00:22:48,320	00:22:50,880	| serial-s02-e03 |	You don't participate in the enemies propaganda campaign
EDL	00:22:51,904	00:22:56,512	| serial-s02-e03 |	Well that's actually an interpretation of the code that military officials do not agree with
EDL	00:22:56,512	00:22:59,328	| serial-s02-e03 |	That is not the standard the Army is asking soldiers to live up to

EDL	00:23:10,336	00:23:14,176	| serial-s02-e03 |	I understand that as a prisoner you're going to be compelled to do things you don't want to do
EDL	00:23:14,944	00:23:19,296	| serial-s02-e03 |	And also while the US military isn't getting courage you to be in a video if you're captured
EDL	00:23:19,296	00:23:23,136	| serial-s02-e03 |	There is an upside to being filmed your government has proof you're alive

EDL	00:23:31,584	00:23:36,960	| serial-s02-e03 |	And that is the videos go on you can see him getting better at resisting at minimizing the propaganda value
EDL	00:23:39,264	00:23:43,616	| serial-s02-e03 |	In the very first video the Taliban released in July 2009
EDL	00:23:43,616	00:23:45,408	| serial-s02-e03 |	About three weeks after bow disappeared

EDL	00:23:57,696	00:24:00,512	| serial-s02-e03 |	It's in this video that bow explains how he was captured
EDL	00:24:01,024	00:24:02,816	| serial-s02-e03 |	Are you listening

EDL	00:24:13,056	00:24:14,080	| serial-s02-e03 |	Paw Patrol
EDL	00:24:14,080	00:24:15,872	| serial-s02-e03 |	I was sneaking behind the troll
EDL	00:24:19,456	00:24:21,760	| serial-s02-e03 |	This is why they reported back in the US
EDL	00:24:21,760	00:24:27,136	| serial-s02-e03 |	Debo said he was caught while lagging behind on a patrol and again a bunch of the soldiers I talked to mention this
EDL	00:24:27,136	00:24:29,184	| serial-s02-e03 |	That when they heard it and made them mad
EDL	00:24:29,184	00:24:31,232	| serial-s02-e03 |	Is it such obvious nonsense
EDL	00:24:31,232	00:24:36,608	| serial-s02-e03 |	U.s. soldiers do not lag behind on Patrols in Afghanistan and then just disappear without anyone noticing
EDL	00:24:36,608	00:24:37,376	| serial-s02-e03 |	Katana thing
EDL	00:24:38,400	00:24:42,752	| serial-s02-e03 |	So when they heard it was in the video some of them saw it as evidence that bill was lying about what happened
EDL	00:24:43,520	00:24:44,800	| serial-s02-e03 |	But was lying
EDL	00:24:44,800	00:24:46,336	| serial-s02-e03 |	He says of course he was lying
EDL	00:24:46,848	00:24:49,920	| serial-s02-e03 |	He says he knew that Americans listening would know it was bologna
EDL	00:24:49,920	00:24:50,688	| serial-s02-e03 |	That was the point
EDL	00:24:51,200	00:24:52,992	| serial-s02-e03 |	Chinese one-way in the video
EDL	00:24:52,992	00:24:55,040	| serial-s02-e03 |	HB telling people hey

EDL	00:25:11,680	00:25:12,448	| serial-s02-e03 |	Or staged
EDL	00:25:16,032	00:25:17,568	| serial-s02-e03 |	So none of it was you

EDL	00:25:31,136	00:25:33,696	| serial-s02-e03 |	Cooperating with them and yet cooperating him
EDL	00:25:40,352	00:25:44,448	| serial-s02-e03 |	Guys guarding Bo don't speak English which makes sense why would they
EDL	00:25:44,960	00:25:51,360	| serial-s02-e03 |	But also that same high-ranking Taliban told us they don't necessarily want someone like near anyone who speaks English
EDL	00:25:51,360	00:25:55,968	| serial-s02-e03 |	Because they might say something just inadvertently and it could help him with an escape
EDL	00:25:56,480	00:26:02,880	| serial-s02-e03 |	Even if they couldn't really talk to him though says they interacted with him they messed with them they throw things at him

EDL	00:26:12,352	00:26:15,168	| serial-s02-e03 |	After that the guy gave him less food
EDL	00:26:15,168	00:26:21,056	| serial-s02-e03 |	Butler not to sleep in the daytime because it left him open to these guys they might take any opportunity

EDL	00:29:09,760	00:29:14,624	| serial-s02-e03 |	Who told them that to amuse themselves they think up things to do to bow or how to get rid of bow

EDL	00:29:44,832	00:29:48,416	| serial-s02-e03 |	Executing prisoners
EDL	00:29:48,416	00:29:50,976	| serial-s02-e03 |	In part because you still affected by them

EDL	00:29:53,280	00:29:59,424	| serial-s02-e03 |	In one a man is about to be beheaded and looks terrified he silent and a rooster is crowing
EDL	00:29:59,424	00:30:05,824	| serial-s02-e03 |	For both the videos are obviously disturbing on their face but they were also a Grizzly warning that this could have
EDL	00:30:05,824	00:30:07,104	| serial-s02-e03 |	Happened to him and anytime
EDL	00:30:07,616	00:30:11,200	| serial-s02-e03 |	They all had their own videos to show me
EDL	00:30:11,968	00:30:16,832	| serial-s02-e03 |	And where they showing at you like this is s*** that we've done or just stuff that other people we know are dumb
EDL	00:30:19,648	00:30:22,976	| serial-s02-e03 |	This is what other people have done
EDL	00:30:24,000	00:30:27,328	| serial-s02-e03 |	A few of them have been with his wife
EDL	00:30:28,352	00:30:29,376	| serial-s02-e03 |	My people have done
EDL	00:30:30,912	00:30:33,216	| serial-s02-e03 |	One guy who was
EDL	00:30:33,216	00:30:34,752	| serial-s02-e03 |	I would say literally
EDL	00:30:36,032	00:30:38,592	| serial-s02-e03 |	Basically out of his mind
EDL	00:30:39,104	00:30:42,688	| serial-s02-e03 |	And back to the point where the other Taliban called in Crazy Town
EDL	00:30:44,224	00:30:44,736	| serial-s02-e03 |	Tom
EDL	00:30:46,272	00:30:47,296	| serial-s02-e03 |	But where did they use for that
EDL	00:30:57,024	00:30:59,840	| serial-s02-e03 |	So they call him crazy town in
EDL	00:31:02,656	00:31:05,728	| serial-s02-e03 |	You tell me that he would kill he's killed
EDL	00:31:07,008	00:31:09,312	| serial-s02-e03 |	One time on one of those shifts
EDL	00:31:09,312	00:31:11,104	| serial-s02-e03 |	He told me to
EDL	00:31:11,104	00:31:15,456	| serial-s02-e03 |	Decapitated two guys and then a few months later it came back
EDL	00:31:16,224	00:31:17,760	| serial-s02-e03 |	He told me that he's on another
EDL	00:31:19,808	00:31:22,624	| serial-s02-e03 |	A while he was in the interim when it while you haven't seen you
EDL	00:31:28,256	00:31:32,608	| serial-s02-e03 |	I know the guys are basically their Afghans who betrayed their brothers
EDL	00:31:36,192	00:31:39,264	| serial-s02-e03 |	During all this time Bo's scheming and plotting
EDL	00:31:39,264	00:31:41,824	| serial-s02-e03 |	Gathering information that he hopes will get him out
EDL	00:31:42,336	00:31:44,384	| serial-s02-e03 |	And that he can deliver back to the US
EDL	00:31:44,384	00:31:45,408	| serial-s02-e03 |	Which by the way he does
EDL	00:31:46,176	00:31:49,504	| serial-s02-e03 |	Terrence Russell at the military hearing cookie and other debris furs
EDL	00:31:49,504	00:31:52,832	| serial-s02-e03 |	Intelligence debriefing overseer psychologist FBI agents

EDL	00:31:56,416	00:32:01,280	| serial-s02-e03 |	And quote remarks on the quality of information Sergeant Bergdahl with providing unquote
EDL	00:32:01,792	00:32:03,584	| serial-s02-e03 |	Also they praise His recall
EDL	00:32:04,096	00:32:09,472	| serial-s02-e03 |	Who said he was trying all the time to store in his memory mental pictures of every detail he could
EDL	00:32:10,496	00:32:14,592	| serial-s02-e03 |	For this Mission he pretty much starts from zero when he's chained down and blindfolded
EDL	00:32:15,104	00:32:17,152	| serial-s02-e03 |	When you can't see he listens
EDL	00:32:17,152	00:32:20,224	| serial-s02-e03 |	Tries to discern the daily patterns of the people who kept them
EDL	00:32:20,224	00:32:21,248	| serial-s02-e03 |	When they slept
EDL	00:32:21,248	00:32:24,576	| serial-s02-e03 |	When the AIDS how their families work who's related to whom
EDL	00:32:25,088	00:32:28,416	| serial-s02-e03 |	Didn't know if it would be useful to him or to someone else back home
EDL	00:32:28,416	00:32:28,928	| serial-s02-e03 |	In case
EDL	00:32:29,952	00:32:34,048	| serial-s02-e03 |	I think it's moved around from house to house and allowed marginally more freedom
EDL	00:32:34,048	00:32:37,632	| serial-s02-e03 |	See at the stand he sponges up new bits of information
EDL	00:32:38,144	00:32:41,216	| serial-s02-e03 |	End up staying a while at a house owned by guy who thinks was named today
EDL	00:32:41,984	00:32:44,288	| serial-s02-e03 |	By this time it was so filthy
EDL	00:32:44,288	00:32:45,568	| serial-s02-e03 |	Smelled so bad
EDL	00:32:45,568	00:32:50,688	| serial-s02-e03 |	He said the young women in little boys resented having to deal with them they might spill his food on purpose
EDL	00:32:50,688	00:32:52,992	| serial-s02-e03 |	What's a boy beat him over the head with his own chain
EDL	00:32:52,992	00:32:55,296	| serial-s02-e03 |	Asbestos pocatello's because you've been humming
EDL	00:32:56,064	00:32:58,368	| serial-s02-e03 |	Both started to suss out information
EDL	00:33:01,696	00:33:04,768	| serial-s02-e03 |	Really enthusiastic
EDL	00:33:07,072	00:33:08,864	| serial-s02-e03 |	A blue baseball cap
EDL	00:33:08,864	00:33:09,632	| serial-s02-e03 |	Oh okay
EDL	00:33:13,728	00:33:14,752	| serial-s02-e03 |	The name of the
EDL	00:33:16,032	00:33:17,568	| serial-s02-e03 |	In the corner
EDL	00:33:17,568	00:33:18,848	| serial-s02-e03 |	The name of the town
EDL	00:33:22,432	00:33:23,968	| serial-s02-e03 |	Are all in English
EDL	00:33:26,272	00:33:30,624	| serial-s02-e03 |	I also like somebody had given it to them like some like Angie or somebody
EDL	00:33:31,648	00:33:33,952	| serial-s02-e03 |	That was their school uniform
EDL	00:33:34,720	00:33:37,792	| serial-s02-e03 |	So maybe that was the name of the place he was in North waziristan
EDL	00:33:38,304	00:33:41,376	| serial-s02-e03 |	Now we just have to figure out exactly where North waziristan was
EDL	00:33:42,400	00:33:45,728	| serial-s02-e03 |	Everywhere he was held he said except for one place in the mountains
EDL	00:33:45,728	00:33:52,128	| serial-s02-e03 |	He's pretty sure he wasn't too far from what he assumed was an American base you can hear artillery he could see helicopters losing a
EDL	00:33:52,128	00:33:53,408	| serial-s02-e03 |	Altitude to land
EDL	00:33:53,408	00:33:55,200	| serial-s02-e03 |	Ignore the scream of plane engines
EDL	00:33:55,968	00:34:01,600	| serial-s02-e03 |	In fact what he was hearing was almost certainly a Pakistani bass oboe couldn't know that the best you could figure
EDL	00:34:01,600	00:34:04,928	| serial-s02-e03 |	He was still in Afghanistan very near the border
EDL	00:34:09,536	00:34:14,912	| serial-s02-e03 |	But had no special training and how to survive any of this how to deal with abuse
EDL	00:34:14,912	00:34:16,192	| serial-s02-e03 |	How to gather Intel
EDL	00:34:16,192	00:34:19,264	| serial-s02-e03 |	How to resist while making it look like you're cooperating
EDL	00:34:19,264	00:34:25,664	| serial-s02-e03 |	As an army private he had was called a level Seer training the most basic level of survival evasion
EDL	00:34:25,664	00:34:27,456	| serial-s02-e03 |	Resistance and Escape training
EDL	00:34:27,456	00:34:32,320	| serial-s02-e03 |	What it consisted of at the time of both employment according to both senior debriefer was
EDL	00:34:32,320	00:34:34,624	| serial-s02-e03 |	Here's a code of conduct on quote
EDL	00:34:34,624	00:34:40,256	| serial-s02-e03 |	She's just puzzling it out as he goes trying things and then trying them again
EDL	00:34:41,280	00:34:47,424	| serial-s02-e03 |	Days house is a sort of mud-hut attempts to dig himself out something like five times
EDL	00:34:47,424	00:34:53,312	| serial-s02-e03 |	To get rid of the dirty Blues from the wall he mix it with his own urine or feces and then smear it back on the wall
EDL	00:34:53,312	00:34:55,872	| serial-s02-e03 |	The Pebbles and rocks are harder to dispose of
EDL	00:34:55,872	00:35:02,272	| serial-s02-e03 |	Are the same house there was a dog I'm pretty aggressive dog that the little boys and men especially were scared of
EDL	00:35:02,272	00:35:06,112	| serial-s02-e03 |	Most of the women sometimes gave it leftovers so I was nicer to them
EDL	00:35:06,112	00:35:12,512	| serial-s02-e03 |	Who knew if you tried to escape he couldn't have the dog freaking out and barking so he started sneaking a bit of food out to it
EDL	00:35:12,512	00:35:15,840	| serial-s02-e03 |	When he was led to the latrine which is right near where the dog slept
EDL	00:35:15,840	00:35:21,984	| serial-s02-e03 |	And that weibo made peace with the dog eventually begin sleeping in the room where Beau was his captors that was totally weird
EDL	00:35:23,264	00:35:28,384	| serial-s02-e03 |	Incidentally someone who analyzes and telling both case tell me one of the rumors they heard along the way
EDL	00:35:28,384	00:35:29,920	| serial-s02-e03 |	With a bow had a puppy
EDL	00:35:29,920	00:35:31,712	| serial-s02-e03 |	Possibly a German Shepherd puppy
EDL	00:35:32,224	00:35:34,528	| serial-s02-e03 |	Silliness
EDL	00:35:34,528	00:35:38,112	| serial-s02-e03 |	But maybe this sometimes vicious guard dog was the so-called puppy
EDL	00:35:41,952	00:35:44,512	| serial-s02-e03 |	Over the month spell managed to gather small items
EDL	00:35:44,512	00:35:46,048	| serial-s02-e03 |	Which he turned into tools
EDL	00:35:46,816	00:35:48,352	| serial-s02-e03 |	And by the end of that first year
EDL	00:35:48,352	00:35:50,656	| serial-s02-e03 |	Taken together they become his Escape kit
EDL	00:35:51,936	00:35:55,008	| serial-s02-e03 |	He had a length of PVC tube maybe 8 inches long
EDL	00:35:55,008	00:35:57,056	| serial-s02-e03 |	He's been able to keep with him since the very first house
EDL	00:35:57,568	00:36:02,176	| serial-s02-e03 |	In one of the rooms he shoved it into the wall and peed out it so his urine wouldn't just be in the room
EDL	00:36:02,944	00:36:05,248	| serial-s02-e03 |	The people reappear later as part of a crossbar
EDL	00:36:06,272	00:36:08,064	| serial-s02-e03 |	He found a nail in a mud wall
EDL	00:36:08,064	00:36:09,344	| serial-s02-e03 |	He can make holes with it
EDL	00:36:09,344	00:36:10,624	| serial-s02-e03 |	Scrape away dirt with it
EDL	00:36:10,624	00:36:11,648	| serial-s02-e03 |	Cleaning fingernails with it
EDL	00:36:12,160	00:36:15,232	| serial-s02-e03 |	When the time came he spend weeks rubbing the head of it on a rock
EDL	00:36:15,744	00:36:19,072	| serial-s02-e03 |	Until it was just the right shape to get the old timey shackles off his rest
EDL	00:36:19,584	00:36:21,376	| serial-s02-e03 |	Is Jordan on the sole of the shoe
EDL	00:36:22,144	00:36:24,192	| serial-s02-e03 |	Probably the biggest score was a key
EDL	00:36:24,704	00:36:29,568	| serial-s02-e03 |	Feminine boy should come into his room when the boys was holding a bunch of keys on a string and dropped
EDL	00:36:30,336	00:36:34,176	| serial-s02-e03 |	When you did one of the keys got away it's all right near the mat we're both slapped
EDL	00:36:34,688	00:36:35,968	| serial-s02-e03 |	Cebu slid it underneath
EDL	00:36:36,992	00:36:38,528	| serial-s02-e03 |	Nobody seemed to notice it was missing
EDL	00:36:39,552	00:36:42,624	| serial-s02-e03 |	Wasn't the key to the padlock key needed to open
EDL	00:36:42,624	00:36:45,696	| serial-s02-e03 |	The Bose has the lost with these cheaply-made Chinese locks
EDL	00:36:45,696	00:36:50,304	| serial-s02-e03 |	Wiggling the key just so he could hit The Sweet Spot and pop them open
EDL	00:36:50,304	00:36:55,168	| serial-s02-e03 |	With that one key and using that technique it allow me to open
EDL	00:36:55,168	00:36:58,752	| serial-s02-e03 |	Padlocks that they're using the hold method
EDL	00:37:09,248	00:37:11,296	| serial-s02-e03 |	What were the years of the months
EDL	00:37:11,808	00:37:13,344	| serial-s02-e03 |	I was able to keep this key
EDL	00:37:14,368	00:37:16,160	| serial-s02-e03 |	Bowhead tried many mini Escape
EDL	00:37:16,928	00:37:19,488	| serial-s02-e03 |	He gotten as far as a courtyard up to a wall
EDL	00:37:20,000	00:37:21,280	| serial-s02-e03 |	But they were for Israeli
EDL	00:37:21,792	00:37:23,328	| serial-s02-e03 |	Is biggest best chance
EDL	00:37:23,328	00:37:25,888	| serial-s02-e03 |	Hey when he was at a remote place in the mountains
EDL	00:37:25,888	00:37:28,704	| serial-s02-e03 |	This is the farthest he ever was from a populated area
EDL	00:37:28,704	00:37:30,240	| serial-s02-e03 |	Basically Powhatan prison
EDL	00:37:31,008	00:37:32,544	| serial-s02-e03 |	Calls it the mountain Fortress
EDL	00:37:33,056	00:37:36,384	| serial-s02-e03 |	What the really it literally look like
EDL	00:37:42,272	00:37:44,064	| serial-s02-e03 |	Because
EDL	00:37:50,976	00:37:55,840	| serial-s02-e03 |	There's everything was just this really old and like it was actually
EDL	00:38:01,984	00:38:07,872	| serial-s02-e03 |	In the mountain Fortress bow is kept in a second-story room which is padlocked but there was a window
EDL	00:38:07,872	00:38:14,272	| serial-s02-e03 |	Without bars on it this place was so old and he seemed so pathetic by that point he says his guards weren't taking extra
EDL	00:38:14,272	00:38:15,040	| serial-s02-e03 |	Cautions
EDL	00:38:15,040	00:38:21,440	| serial-s02-e03 |	The key to PVC pipe plus it wouldn't stake that was in the room
EDL	00:38:21,440	00:38:24,256	| serial-s02-e03 |	Bottle of Mountain Dew hat blanket sandals
EDL	00:38:24,768	00:38:25,792	| serial-s02-e03 |	He went for it
EDL	00:38:26,560	00:38:28,864	| serial-s02-e03 |	Middle of the night
EDL	00:38:33,472	00:38:34,752	| serial-s02-e03 |	Call the night before
EDL	00:38:47,040	00:38:53,440	| serial-s02-e03 |	Putting everything together
EDL	00:38:53,440	00:38:57,280	| serial-s02-e03 |	Getting my hands tied up the water bottle that I had
EDL	00:39:04,960	00:39:10,336	| serial-s02-e03 |	The Rope was made from the two chains he's now liberated each about 6 ft long he says plus his bedding
EDL	00:39:10,336	00:39:12,640	| serial-s02-e03 |	It ended up being quite a bit longer than you need it
EDL	00:39:12,640	00:39:14,944	| serial-s02-e03 |	Drop to the ground with only about 15 feet
EDL	00:39:14,944	00:39:15,968	| serial-s02-e03 |	I didn't know that
EDL	00:39:28,256	00:39:32,096	| serial-s02-e03 |	There's a reason maybe you haven't heard other American pows Escape stories
EDL	00:39:32,608	00:39:35,424	| serial-s02-e03 |	Because there hasn't been a successful one since the Vietnam War
EDL	00:39:36,448	00:39:42,080	| serial-s02-e03 |	Again cuz you're supposed to attempt it but the Army understands especially since Vietnam
EDL	00:39:42,080	00:39:45,408	| serial-s02-e03 |	The odds are usually an overwhelmingly against you
EDL	00:39:46,432	00:39:50,272	| serial-s02-e03 |	If you're a p o w and you assess the situation and you decide
EDL	00:39:50,272	00:39:53,344	| serial-s02-e03 |	It's highly unlikely I can make it out that window without being shot
EDL	00:39:53,856	00:39:58,720	| serial-s02-e03 |	It's highly unlikely that even if I do make it out I'll be able to blend in with the local population
EDL	00:39:58,720	00:40:00,256	| serial-s02-e03 |	It is highly likely
EDL	00:40:00,256	00:40:03,328	| serial-s02-e03 |	But if the enemy finds me they will torture or kill me
EDL	00:40:03,328	00:40:06,656	| serial-s02-e03 |	So no I'm not going to try to go out that window
EDL	00:40:06,656	00:40:08,704	| serial-s02-e03 |	That is right in fine
EDL	00:40:08,704	00:40:10,240	| serial-s02-e03 |	No one will fault you for it
EDL	00:40:11,264	00:40:17,152	| serial-s02-e03 |	To me more than anything this moment in the mountain Fortress what's all the talk about Bo being a sympathizer to rest
EDL	00:40:17,664	00:40:19,712	| serial-s02-e03 |	Odoo not sympathize with the Taliban
EDL	00:40:19,712	00:40:21,248	| serial-s02-e03 |	A load the Taliban
EDL	00:40:21,248	00:40:23,296	| serial-s02-e03 |	So much so that even when he's sick
EDL	00:40:23,296	00:40:25,088	| serial-s02-e03 |	He doesn't have any food
EDL	00:40:25,088	00:40:28,928	| serial-s02-e03 |	He's already been punished for escaping the first time he knows what that's like
EDL	00:40:28,928	00:40:29,952	| serial-s02-e03 |	Instill
EDL	00:40:30,464	00:40:31,488	| serial-s02-e03 |	Goes out the window
EDL	00:40:43,776	00:40:49,664	| serial-s02-e03 |	Mixed bag out of his blanket what does water bottle in it swings it over his shoulder and starts walking
EDL	00:40:50,432	00:40:54,016	| serial-s02-e03 |	Apart from being rescued it was maybe the best moment of his five years
EDL	00:40:58,368	00:40:59,392	| serial-s02-e03 |	Yeah
EDL	00:41:08,608	00:41:10,144	| serial-s02-e03 |	It's High Desert Terrain
EDL	00:41:10,144	00:41:12,448	| serial-s02-e03 |	Cold at night hot in the day Rocky
EDL	00:41:12,960	00:41:16,032	| serial-s02-e03 |	Are bushes and trees supposed to look like Joshua trees
EDL	00:41:16,032	00:41:18,336	| serial-s02-e03 |	And something Piney not a lot of cover
EDL	00:41:18,848	00:41:22,688	| serial-s02-e03 |	But his immediate objective is not to hide though he'll have to do a lot of hiding obviously
EDL	00:41:23,200	00:41:26,784	| serial-s02-e03 |	Right now he's trying to get as far away as he can from The Fortress
EDL	00:41:26,784	00:41:29,344	| serial-s02-e03 |	He wants to spread the search party as thinly as possible
EDL	00:41:29,856	00:41:31,904	| serial-s02-e03 |	He has what he hopes is southeast
EDL	00:41:31,904	00:41:33,952	| serial-s02-e03 |	Intending to go into Pakistan
EDL	00:41:33,952	00:41:38,048	| serial-s02-e03 |	He figures he's got a better shot at encountering someone non-hostile to him in Pakistan
EDL	00:41:38,560	00:41:40,608	| serial-s02-e03 |	But the train is so difficult
EDL	00:41:40,608	00:41:41,888	| serial-s02-e03 |	He's in his shorts
EDL	00:41:41,888	00:41:43,424	| serial-s02-e03 |	Steep Maisy Mountain
EDL	00:41:43,424	00:41:45,728	| serial-s02-e03 |	Get over one there's immediately another one
EDL	00:41:45,728	00:41:51,872	| serial-s02-e03 |	And they're all about the same height so it's not like you can reach a peak and get your bearings see the twinkle of a friendly fob in the distance
EDL	00:41:52,384	00:41:54,175	| serial-s02-e03 |	He climbs and descends
EDL	00:41:54,175	00:41:55,455	| serial-s02-e03 |	Sometimes scooting on his butt
EDL	00:41:55,967	00:41:58,015	| serial-s02-e03 |	All the while he's listening for water
EDL	00:41:58,015	00:41:59,295	| serial-s02-e03 |	Three places water bottle
EDL	00:41:59,807	00:42:01,087	| serial-s02-e03 |	Images of valley
EDL	00:42:01,087	00:42:02,367	| serial-s02-e03 |	And is populated
EDL	00:42:02,367	00:42:06,975	| serial-s02-e03 |	He keeps having to fear this way or that skirt offense or house or sheepherders tent
EDL	00:42:23,103	00:42:25,407	| serial-s02-e03 |	I don't know how long I don't know how
EDL	00:42:47,679	00:42:50,495	| serial-s02-e03 |	Boat lands on a dry River bed on his left side
EDL	00:42:51,007	00:42:54,847	| serial-s02-e03 |	He said the word oof actually came out of his mouth just like in a cartoon
EDL	00:42:54,847	00:42:57,407	| serial-s02-e03 |	Loud enough so that some dog started barking their heads off
EDL	00:42:59,711	00:43:03,551	| serial-s02-e03 |	Away from where I am
EDL	00:43:06,111	00:43:09,439	| serial-s02-e03 |	I wanted to fill up my water bottle
EDL	00:43:17,375	00:43:18,399	| serial-s02-e03 |	My left hand
EDL	00:43:32,735	00:43:36,063	| serial-s02-e03 |	Your adrenaline must have just been pumping so hard this whole time
EDL	00:43:38,111	00:43:40,671	| serial-s02-e03 |	Reason why I didn't feel
EDL	00:43:41,439	00:43:42,975	| serial-s02-e03 |	End up feeling about
EDL	00:43:43,999	00:43:45,023	| serial-s02-e03 |	10 minutes later
EDL	00:43:45,535	00:43:49,119	| serial-s02-e03 |	He's done something terrible to his left leg and his left arm
EDL	00:43:49,631	00:43:51,935	| serial-s02-e03 |	And the pain of that starts to wash over him
EDL	00:43:51,935	00:43:53,215	| serial-s02-e03 |	And then just stay
EDL	00:43:53,983	00:43:56,287	| serial-s02-e03 |	It's getting later it's going to be light soon
EDL	00:43:56,287	00:44:00,383	| serial-s02-e03 |	Chabot uses the small length of bar that have been used to hold his feet together
EDL	00:44:00,383	00:44:04,479	| serial-s02-e03 |	And he uses it to Claude the Earth at the base of a tree to make a hole
EDL	00:44:04,479	00:44:07,551	| serial-s02-e03 |	It's mulchy and then just rocks underneath but it's good enough
EDL	00:44:07,551	00:44:13,439	| serial-s02-e03 |	He piles of dirt around the whole to make a berm and then sticks branches into the burn so it Blends into the landscape better
EDL	00:44:13,951	00:44:15,487	| serial-s02-e03 |	Then he gets into the hole
EDL	00:44:15,487	00:44:16,767	| serial-s02-e03 |	Imposes blanket over himself
EDL	00:44:32,639	00:44:34,431	| serial-s02-e03 |	So that was his first night of freedom
EDL	00:44:34,943	00:44:37,759	| serial-s02-e03 |	In all books has this Escape lasted about nine days
EDL	00:44:38,271	00:44:44,671	| serial-s02-e03 |	Interviews with Sammy and another media reports the Taliban admit this Escape happened though there versions vary in terms
EDL	00:44:44,671	00:44:46,975	| serial-s02-e03 |	How it happened and how long it lasted
EDL	00:44:46,975	00:44:48,767	| serial-s02-e03 |	General days
EDL	00:44:49,279	00:44:52,351	| serial-s02-e03 |	Thursday briefers settled on 8.5 days
EDL	00:44:53,119	00:44:58,495	| serial-s02-e03 |	Once morning hits bow has to stay put in the hole he can't move around in the day
EDL	00:44:58,495	00:45:04,895	| serial-s02-e03 |	And where he is it populated and it's rural so people walk everywhere their foot past criss-crossing all over the place
EDL	00:45:04,895	00:45:08,735	| serial-s02-e03 |	Over the coming week while he's hiding and holes are trenches during the day
EDL	00:45:08,735	00:45:10,783	| serial-s02-e03 |	There were so many close calls
EDL	00:45:10,783	00:45:17,183	| serial-s02-e03 |	Sheet that came close and spooked women out Gathering something-or-other From the bushes men you could tell they were
EDL	00:45:17,183	00:45:19,487	| serial-s02-e03 |	Men with guns you can hear the clock on The Middle
EDL	00:45:19,487	00:45:25,375	| serial-s02-e03 |	There was a scare with a flashlight time when he heard the familiar beeping of those Motorola type walkie talkies the Taliban use
EDL	00:45:25,887	00:45:29,983	| serial-s02-e03 |	But I'm a little girls wanted off the road and up the hill where he was hiding
EDL	00:45:33,055	00:45:35,103	| serial-s02-e03 |	Three or four
EDL	00:45:40,479	00:45:44,831	| serial-s02-e03 |	And apparently they're looking for flowers or something
EDL	00:45:44,831	00:45:51,231	| serial-s02-e03 |	Are off the road like almost directly toward me
EDL	00:45:51,231	00:45:56,863	| serial-s02-e03 |	They pass right by his feet keep going there talking to each other Emerson whatever they're doing
EDL	00:45:56,863	00:46:02,751	| serial-s02-e03 |	And then they come back down the hill a bus as they pass right by his head tiny oblivious girls
EDL	00:46:02,751	00:46:08,895	| serial-s02-e03 |	Can't walk properly because his left side is hurting so badly so he's crawling along on a combination of elbow
EDL	00:46:10,175	00:46:10,943	| serial-s02-e03 |	Or on his butt
EDL	00:46:11,455	00:46:12,991	| serial-s02-e03 |	Not going well
EDL	00:46:12,991	00:46:17,087	| serial-s02-e03 |	On top of everything he really has no idea where he's going he's completely lost

EDL	00:46:20,159	00:46:23,231	| serial-s02-e03 |	And now he can't recall how the Big Dipper relates to the North Star
EDL	00:46:23,743	00:46:26,559	| serial-s02-e03 |	The water he's drinking is feted like I've seen too many sheep

EDL	00:47:52,319	00:47:55,903	| serial-s02-e03 |	Time to think about what he do if a friendly Convoy Patrol came by
EDL	00:47:55,903	00:47:57,183	| serial-s02-e03 |	How did Safeway get their attention
EDL	00:47:57,695	00:48:01,023	| serial-s02-e03 |	Did you ran out them in his Afghan clothes they might think he was a suicide bomber

EDL	00:48:09,215	00:48:12,543	| serial-s02-e03 |	If anyone had, crossbow they probably have taken in the following
EDL	00:48:13,055	00:48:14,847	| serial-s02-e03 |	He's in pain on his left side
EDL	00:48:14,847	00:48:16,127	| serial-s02-e03 |	Is in gastric distress
EDL	00:48:16,639	00:48:18,687	| serial-s02-e03 |	He's starving you scared and he's lost
EDL	00:48:19,455	00:48:20,991	| serial-s02-e03 |	Did you ever think that
EDL	00:48:21,503	00:48:25,855	| serial-s02-e03 |	During the course of the Escape that maybe you made a mistake that the you know being out
EDL	00:48:25,855	00:48:26,623	| serial-s02-e03 |	That escaping was
EDL	00:48:27,903	00:48:29,951	| serial-s02-e03 |	Maybe more treacherous than just staying put
EDL	00:48:33,535	00:48:36,607	| serial-s02-e03 |	I knew it was like before I escaped I knew it was going to be more
EDL	00:48:37,375	00:48:39,935	| serial-s02-e03 |	It's going to be more immediate risk
EDL	00:48:39,935	00:48:40,447	| serial-s02-e03 |	Yeah
EDL	00:48:41,215	00:48:46,847	| serial-s02-e03 |	I get myself out the window as in basically come to terms with the fact
EDL	00:48:46,847	00:48:49,151	| serial-s02-e03 |	Very much like a suicide
EDL	00:48:50,175	00:48:51,455	| serial-s02-e03 |	Fishing you know it's like
EDL	00:48:51,455	00:48:55,551	| serial-s02-e03 |	Looking for a needle in a haystack as far as being saved
EDL	00:48:58,879	00:49:01,951	| serial-s02-e03 |	What it was like okay if I'm going to die either
EDL	00:49:01,951	00:49:05,791	| serial-s02-e03 |	Exposure out there or being shot while I escape
EDL	00:49:05,791	00:49:09,375	| serial-s02-e03 |	It's better than having my head cut off cuz I thought enough of those movies to
EDL	00:49:09,887	00:49:12,191	| serial-s02-e03 |	Are videos with honor for those two
EDL	00:49:13,471	00:49:14,495	| serial-s02-e03 |	What that would be like
EDL	00:49:17,311	00:49:20,639	| serial-s02-e03 |	Perdiendo is too debilitated to cover much ground
EDL	00:49:20,639	00:49:22,431	| serial-s02-e03 |	Is hunger pangs were gone
EDL	00:49:22,431	00:49:24,223	| serial-s02-e03 |	Please blacking out when he stood up
EDL	00:49:24,223	00:49:25,247	| serial-s02-e03 |	Getting tunnel vision
EDL	00:49:26,271	00:49:28,575	| serial-s02-e03 |	He didn't exactly stop caring about getting caught
EDL	00:49:29,087	00:49:31,391	| serial-s02-e03 |	More like he stopped having the energy to be afraid
EDL	00:49:32,927	00:49:37,279	| serial-s02-e03 |	He remembers one of the last night watching the sun go down and it's only thought
EDL	00:49:37,279	00:49:38,559	| serial-s02-e03 |	Is that it was beautiful
EDL	00:49:45,727	00:49:49,311	| serial-s02-e03 |	On the last day of bow says he had passed out on top of the mountain
EDL	00:49:49,823	00:49:53,919	| serial-s02-e03 |	How many came to he started trying to make some sort of brace out of sticks for his left knee
EDL	00:49:54,687	00:49:55,711	| serial-s02-e03 |	Your voices
EDL	00:49:55,711	00:49:56,735	| serial-s02-e03 |	Rustling bushes
EDL	00:49:57,503	00:50:01,087	| serial-s02-e03 |	I'm blowing he saw the search party coming up the mountain he was caught
EDL	00:50:02,623	00:50:06,719	| serial-s02-e03 |	Because of the drones the men wanted to get him off the mountain as quickly as I could
EDL	00:50:06,719	00:50:08,255	| serial-s02-e03 |	They took him back to the prison
EDL	00:50:08,767	00:50:13,119	| serial-s02-e03 |	One of the older guys both thinks he might have been a relative of Melissa and being attacked him
EDL	00:50:13,119	00:50:15,167	| serial-s02-e03 |	Try to rip his hair out his beard out
EDL	00:50:15,167	00:50:17,215	| serial-s02-e03 |	Rosetti mostly succeeded in doing
EDL	00:50:18,239	00:50:21,055	| serial-s02-e03 |	He was so out of it he didn't really feel it
EDL	00:50:21,823	00:50:25,919	| serial-s02-e03 |	He wasn't beaten more than that he says maybe because they knew looking at him
EDL	00:50:25,919	00:50:27,455	| serial-s02-e03 |	He might not survive a beating
EDL	00:50:30,271	00:50:30,783	| serial-s02-e03 |	Let him sleep
EDL	00:50:31,295	00:50:34,623	| serial-s02-e03 |	The next morning they cleaned him up and they took him to a meeting with Melissa and Ian
EDL	00:50:35,391	00:50:36,927	| serial-s02-e03 |	Principal message to boas
EDL	00:50:37,439	00:50:39,743	| serial-s02-e03 |	If you try to escape again will just kill you
EDL	00:50:39,743	00:50:41,535	| serial-s02-e03 |	I mean did you apologize to them
EDL	00:50:42,303	00:50:44,863	| serial-s02-e03 |	No I never apologize
EDL	00:50:45,887	00:50:47,423	| serial-s02-e03 |	Effort for trying to escape
EDL	00:50:50,239	00:50:51,007	| serial-s02-e03 |	I probably would have
EDL	00:50:57,151	00:50:58,943	| serial-s02-e03 |	Better than that escape was
EDL	00:50:59,711	00:51:01,759	| serial-s02-e03 |	The last time I saw Stars

EDL	00:51:15,327	00:51:18,399	| serial-s02-e03 |	So many people would be trying to get Bo away from Sun game
EDL	00:51:19,167	00:51:22,751	| serial-s02-e03 |	All these huge military and diplomatic forces about to kick in

EDL	00:53:05,407	00:53:06,687	| serial-s02-e03 |	Was it worse than Iraq
EDL	00:53:08,479	00:53:10,783	| serial-s02-e03 |	That that deployment I mean
EDL	00:53:10,783	00:53:14,111	| serial-s02-e03 |	Yeah it was the worst year of my life it was horrible yeah
EDL	00:53:14,623	00:53:18,207	| serial-s02-e03 |	Your operations order had something to do with Bowe Bergdahl
EDL	00:53:18,207	00:53:20,511	| serial-s02-e03 |	Then people were going to give it to
EDL	00:53:20,511	00:53:23,583	| serial-s02-e03 |	The stamp of approval say go ahead and Smash Smash down some doors
EDL	00:53:23,583	00:53:24,095	| serial-s02-e03 |	Asking questions
EDL	00:53:28,447	00:53:34,847	| serial-s02-e03 |	I have some guilt like maybe there's something I could do but then what if I don't
EDL	00:53:34,847	00:53:38,431	| serial-s02-e03 |	Exactly why I've always sort of treated the way he was treated
EDL	00:53:38,431	00:53:44,575	| serial-s02-e03 |	But it's certainly plausible to me that the reason he was treated so horribly
EDL	00:53:44,575	00:53:46,623	| serial-s02-e03 |	Was because I was treated so well
