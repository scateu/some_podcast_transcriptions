EDL	00:18:31,807	00:18:33,087	| serial-s01-e01 |	How long did it take you
EDL	00:18:33,599	00:18:35,391	| serial-s01-e01 |	Did they take the whole
EDL	00:18:36,671	00:18:37,439	| serial-s01-e01 |	25 minutes
EDL	00:18:38,207	00:18:38,975	| serial-s01-e01 |	Audi

EDL	00:18:54,079	00:18:54,847	| serial-s01-e01 |	Equal work
EDL	00:18:55,615	00:18:56,639	| serial-s01-e01 |	I want to say that but
EDL	00:18:58,687	00:19:00,223	| serial-s01-e01 |	So those are the key points
EDL	00:19:00,223	00:19:02,527	| serial-s01-e01 |	Anon told Janet
EDL	00:19:02,527	00:19:03,295	| serial-s01-e01 |	She did it
EDL	00:19:03,295	00:19:03,807	| serial-s01-e01 |	We buried her
EDL	00:19:05,087	00:19:08,415	| serial-s01-e01 |	A story wasn't just the foundation of the state's case against Adnan
EDL	00:19:08,415	00:19:10,463	| serial-s01-e01 |	It was the state's case against Adnan
EDL	00:19:11,231	00:19:13,535	| serial-s01-e01 |	It's cold
EDL	00:19:13,535	00:19:15,583	| serial-s01-e01 |	Describing a crime of passion hair
EDL	00:19:16,095	00:19:17,375	| serial-s01-e01 |	This is something much darker
EDL	00:19:17,887	00:19:20,447	| serial-s01-e01 |	Methodically map out the death of your friend
EDL	00:19:20,447	00:19:23,263	| serial-s01-e01 |	Strangle her with her own hands so close up like that
EDL	00:19:24,031	00:19:30,175	| serial-s01-e01 |	A killer but a master liar and manipulator psychopath probably
EDL	00:19:36,319	00:19:39,903	| serial-s01-e01 |	Maximum Security Prison in Western Maryland
EDL	00:19:39,903	00:19:42,207	| serial-s01-e01 |	He calls me at my request about twice a week
EDL	00:19:42,975	00:19:45,791	| serial-s01-e01 |	Direct me from a bank of eight payphones in the Rec Hall
EDL	00:19:45,791	00:19:48,863	| serial-s01-e01 |	Pretty large room where other guys are sitting at tables with middle seats
EDL	00:19:48,863	00:19:49,631	| serial-s01-e01 |	Attached to them
EDL	00:19:49,631	00:19:52,447	| serial-s01-e01 |	Playing chess or cards using a microwave or watching TV
EDL	00:19:52,447	00:19:53,983	| serial-s01-e01 |	And get a little loud sometimes
EDL	00:19:54,495	00:19:59,359	| serial-s01-e01 |	Once I asked if all 8 phones are always occupied he said because guys have been in for a long time
EDL	00:19:59,871	00:20:00,895	| serial-s01-e01 |	How to call
EDL	00:20:01,919	00:20:05,247	| serial-s01-e01 |	21st in person I was struck by two things
EDL	00:20:05,247	00:20:07,039	| serial-s01-e01 |	He was way bigger than expected
EDL	00:20:07,039	00:20:08,319	| serial-s01-e01 |	Barrel-chested and tall
EDL	00:20:08,831	00:20:13,183	| serial-s01-e01 |	Minnesota sightseeing
EDL	00:20:13,695	00:20:18,815	| serial-s01-e01 |	30 to life in prison becoming larger and properly bearded
EDL	00:20:19,839	00:20:22,399	| serial-s01-e01 |	And the second thing what you can't miss about Adnan
EDL	00:20:22,399	00:20:24,959	| serial-s01-e01 |	Is that he has giant brown eyes like a dairy cow
EDL	00:20:25,727	00:20:28,031	| serial-s01-e01 |	That's a promise my most idiotic lines of inquiry
EDL	00:20:28,543	00:20:31,103	| serial-s01-e01 |	Could someone who looks like that really strangle his girlfriend
EDL	00:20:31,871	00:20:32,383	| serial-s01-e01 |	Idiotic
EDL	00:20:34,431	00:20:40,575	| serial-s01-e01 |	You first heard a story of the crime I didn't mean for it to happen like that
EDL	00:20:41,087	00:20:41,855	| serial-s01-e01 |	He said
EDL	00:20:41,855	00:20:42,623	| serial-s01-e01 |	It didn't happen
EDL	00:20:43,135	00:20:44,415	| serial-s01-e01 |	None of this is true
EDL	00:20:44,415	00:20:44,927	| serial-s01-e01 |	At all
EDL	00:20:45,439	00:20:48,255	| serial-s01-e01 |	He said he had nothing to do with his murder and he doesn't know who did
EDL	00:20:49,791	00:20:52,351	| serial-s01-e01 |	He was announced first serious relationship with a girl
EDL	00:20:52,351	00:20:56,447	| serial-s01-e01 |	He said he loved her in the way of high school love but then also in the way of high school got over her
EDL	00:20:56,959	00:21:00,799	| serial-s01-e01 |	So that when they broke up for good sometime before Christmas break of senior year
EDL	00:21:00,799	00:21:03,359	| serial-s01-e01 |	He says he was sad for sure but not obsessed
EDL	00:21:04,383	00:21:07,199	| serial-s01-e01 |	I just sometimes wish like they can look into my brain
EDL	00:21:07,711	00:21:13,087	| serial-s01-e01 |	I see how I really felt about it and no matter what else I'm going to say they were seen that this guy had no
EDL	00:21:13,087	00:21:17,440	| serial-s01-e01 |	I have no ill-will towards whatever the motivation is to kill someone I had absolutely
EDL	00:21:17,440	00:21:19,232	| serial-s01-e01 |	You know what I mean
EDL	00:21:20,256	00:21:22,560	| serial-s01-e01 |	Don't you ever say why
EDL	00:21:23,072	00:21:25,120	| serial-s01-e01 |	Soulmate is mad
EDL	00:21:25,120	00:21:29,216	| serial-s01-e01 |	Going to never come with any type of proof or anything
EDL	00:21:29,216	00:21:29,984	| serial-s01-e01 |	Everything
EDL	00:21:30,496	00:21:33,056	| serial-s01-e01 |	I was never mad at her that I was ever
EDL	00:21:33,568	00:21:35,872	| serial-s01-e01 |	Angry with her that I have a threatened
EDL	00:21:35,872	00:21:42,016	| serial-s01-e01 |	Yeah that's the only thing I can really hold on
EDL	00:21:54,560	00:21:57,120	| serial-s01-e01 |	He's adamant about this you can hear it right he's staunch
EDL	00:21:58,144	00:22:02,240	| serial-s01-e01 |	To go back and tell his version of what happened that day
EDL	00:22:02,240	00:22:03,520	| serial-s01-e01 |	CJ story
EDL	00:22:04,288	00:22:06,336	| serial-s01-e01 |	Everything becomes a lot in maschera
EDL	00:22:06,848	00:22:10,688	| serial-s01-e01 |	Yes he hung out with Jay on the 13th both during and after school
EDL	00:22:10,688	00:22:12,736	| serial-s01-e01 |	He doesn't remember exactly where they were
EDL	00:22:13,760	00:22:14,272	| serial-s01-e01 |	What time it was
EDL	00:22:16,832	00:22:19,392	| serial-s01-e01 |	January 14th and folded like any other day
EDL	00:22:19,392	00:22:20,928	| serial-s01-e01 |	Normal mostly uneventful day
EDL	00:22:21,696	00:22:24,256	| serial-s01-e01 |	He says there are a couple of things that do stand out though
EDL	00:22:25,024	00:22:26,816	| serial-s01-e01 |	Stephanie's birthday
EDL	00:22:27,328	00:22:29,120	| serial-s01-e01 |	Stephanie was one of a dog's best friend
EDL	00:22:29,120	00:22:30,400	| serial-s01-e01 |	And also J's girlfriend
EDL	00:22:31,424	00:22:33,216	| serial-s01-e01 |	Stephanie a birthday present
EDL	00:22:33,728	00:22:36,288	| serial-s01-e01 |	Stuffed reindeer which is given to her and second.

EDL	00:22:39,872	00:22:42,944	| serial-s01-e01 |	It occurred to me that days at
EDL	00:22:42,944	00:22:44,480	| serial-s01-e01 |	I was going to ask your boyfriend
EDL	00:22:44,992	00:22:45,760	| serial-s01-e01 |	Did you get hurt
EDL	00:22:46,528	00:22:48,064	| serial-s01-e01 |	So sometime during the day
EDL	00:22:48,576	00:22:49,600	| serial-s01-e01 |	4 News
EDL	00:22:52,672	00:22:54,464	| serial-s01-e01 |	Hold up for a second
EDL	00:22:54,464	00:22:58,816	| serial-s01-e01 |	Stephanie of a president
EDL	00:22:59,840	00:23:03,424	| serial-s01-e01 |	Well. Stephanie was very close friend of mine
EDL	00:23:03,424	00:23:03,936	| serial-s01-e01 |	It was just
EDL	00:23:05,216	00:23:07,264	| serial-s01-e01 |	I just got to make sure that
EDL	00:23:07,264	00:23:09,056	| serial-s01-e01 |	She also got a gift from him
EDL	00:23:09,056	00:23:10,080	| serial-s01-e01 |	You know she had mentioned
EDL	00:23:11,104	00:23:12,896	| serial-s01-e01 |	She was looking forward to getting
EDL	00:23:14,432	00:23:16,224	| serial-s01-e01 |	We have to get to kiss that I gave her
EDL	00:23:16,736	00:23:19,040	| serial-s01-e01 |	So it just as I would with any friends
EDL	00:23:19,552	00:23:21,344	| serial-s01-e01 |	I just kind of
EDL	00:23:21,344	00:23:22,368	| serial-s01-e01 |	We don't want to check on that
EDL	00:23:22,880	00:23:24,928	| serial-s01-e01 |	You didn't get her a gift
EDL	00:23:25,440	00:23:26,720	| serial-s01-e01 |	Can I have free periods
EDL	00:23:27,488	00:23:29,792	| serial-s01-e01 |	Jordan schools
EDL	00:23:29,792	00:23:32,352	| serial-s01-e01 |	It was not abnormal for me to leave school to go to
EDL	00:23:33,376	00:23:34,144	| serial-s01-e01 |	And then come back
EDL	00:23:35,680	00:23:37,216	| serial-s01-e01 |	So I went to this house
EDL	00:23:40,288	00:23:41,312	| serial-s01-e01 |	What happened to
EDL	00:23:41,312	00:23:43,104	| serial-s01-e01 |	Get a present for Stephanie she said no

EDL	00:23:59,744	00:24:01,280	| serial-s01-e01 |	When school is over
EDL	00:24:01,280	00:24:03,072	| serial-s01-e01 |	I would have went to the library
EDL	00:24:03,072	00:24:03,584	| serial-s01-e01 |	I know that
EDL	00:24:04,096	00:24:08,960	| serial-s01-e01 |	I use chat with other music but if I was going to check my email using the library computer
EDL	00:24:09,472	00:24:11,264	| serial-s01-e01 |	Sometimes I would go there
EDL	00:24:11,264	00:24:14,336	| serial-s01-e01 |	Because track practice didn't start until around
EDL	00:24:14,848	00:24:17,408	| serial-s01-e01 |	Maybe 3 or 3:30 ish
EDL	00:24:17,408	00:24:18,944	| serial-s01-e01 |	So I can start right after school
EDL	00:24:19,456	00:24:23,296	| serial-s01-e01 |	So they would appear to sign up almost like an hour hour and change
EDL	00:24:26,880	00:24:30,464	| serial-s01-e01 |	This hour and change after school this is the crucial window
EDL	00:24:31,232	00:24:33,792	| serial-s01-e01 |	This is the time when the state says hey was killed
EDL	00:24:34,560	00:24:39,680	| serial-s01-e01 |	School got out of 215 people remember seeing her after her last class heading to her car
EDL	00:24:40,192	00:24:42,752	| serial-s01-e01 |	Story on the cell phone records
EDL	00:24:42,752	00:24:44,800	| serial-s01-e01 |	She was dead by 2:36 p.m.
EDL	00:24:46,080	00:24:47,872	| serial-s01-e01 |	So sometime in those 21 minutes
EDL	00:24:47,872	00:24:49,920	| serial-s01-e01 |	Between 2:15 and 2:36
EDL	00:24:49,920	00:24:50,688	| serial-s01-e01 |	She strangled
EDL	00:24:51,968	00:24:54,784	| serial-s01-e01 |	Obviously the same window and non needed to account for
EDL	00:24:55,296	00:24:56,576	| serial-s01-e01 |	Dakota
EDL	00:24:56,576	00:24:58,624	| serial-s01-e01 |	My case lived and died in those 21 minutes
EDL	00:25:02,464	00:25:06,304	| serial-s01-e01 |	Well maybe the library but nobody testified at a trial
EDL	00:25:06,304	00:25:07,840	| serial-s01-e01 |	To track practice
EDL	00:25:07,840	00:25:11,168	| serial-s01-e01 |	He does remember being a track one day when it was snowing which might have been that day
EDL	00:25:11,680	00:25:15,520	| serial-s01-e01 |	The coach testified that probably was there but he can't be a hundred percent sure
EDL	00:25:15,520	00:25:16,800	| serial-s01-e01 |	As a rule he didn't take attendance
EDL	00:25:17,824	00:25:21,152	| serial-s01-e01 |	After school is when his memories become nonspecific
EDL	00:25:21,664	00:25:27,040	| serial-s01-e01 |	Usually we did this are we probably would have done that
EDL	00:25:27,552	00:25:32,160	| serial-s01-e01 |	Did come to pick up at 9 after track that pardoned on seems to more less remember
EDL	00:25:32,160	00:25:36,000	| serial-s01-e01 |	Was Ramadan so it would have been fasting all day and hungry
EDL	00:25:36,000	00:25:39,584	| serial-s01-e01 |	It probably would have been closer to time for me to break fast
EDL	00:25:39,584	00:25:41,120	| serial-s01-e01 |	He would have came to pick me up
EDL	00:25:41,120	00:25:42,656	| serial-s01-e01 |	Everybody went to go get something to eat
EDL	00:25:43,168	00:25:46,240	| serial-s01-e01 |	So sweet after I eat and then I would have had to have gone
EDL	00:25:47,008	00:25:49,312	| serial-s01-e01 |	Did home by like around 7
EDL	00:25:50,848	00:25:54,688	| serial-s01-e01 |	Or usually like the last 10 nights of Ramadan my father would spend the night at the mosque
EDL	00:25:55,200	00:25:56,736	| serial-s01-e01 |	A lot of times I would take your food
EDL	00:25:57,248	00:26:01,856	| serial-s01-e01 |	Pixel format how to take it
EDL	00:26:01,856	00:26:02,624	| serial-s01-e01 |	Evening prayer
EDL	00:26:03,648	00:26:04,928	| serial-s01-e01 |	Did you ever
EDL	00:26:04,928	00:26:06,464	| serial-s01-e01 |	Leave the campus
EDL	00:26:06,464	00:26:08,000	| serial-s01-e01 |	Before the end of track track
EDL	00:26:08,512	00:26:09,280	| serial-s01-e01 |	Did you ever
EDL	00:26:11,840	00:26:12,864	| serial-s01-e01 |	You sure
EDL	00:26:14,400	00:26:16,704	| serial-s01-e01 |	I want to say that I'm 99% sure
EDL	00:26:17,984	00:26:19,776	| serial-s01-e01 |	The reason why I can't see hundred is because
EDL	00:26:20,288	00:26:22,592	| serial-s01-e01 |	I mean I understand that it comes across as
EDL	00:26:23,104	00:26:29,248	| serial-s01-e01 |	I don't know if it does or doesn't but it seems like I remember things that are beneficial to me but things that are beneficial thing that I can't remember
EDL	00:26:29,248	00:26:33,856	| serial-s01-e01 |	It's just that I don't really know what to say that a lot of it
EDL	00:26:33,856	00:26:34,880	| serial-s01-e01 |	I do remember it
EDL	00:26:35,392	00:26:38,208	| serial-s01-e01 |	Missing pieces that comes from what other people have sex
EDL	00:26:38,208	00:26:40,000	| serial-s01-e01 |	You know that they remember write any kind of
EDL	00:26:53,312	00:26:59,712	| serial-s01-e01 |	Ananda is problematic because
EDL	00:26:59,712	00:27:02,784	| serial-s01-e01 |	If he's innocent right it's any other day of course he doesn't remember
EDL	00:27:03,296	00:27:04,832	| serial-s01-e01 |	But you can also read it as
EDL	00:27:04,832	00:27:06,880	| serial-s01-e01 |	How convenient he doesn't remember the day
EDL	00:27:07,392	00:27:10,464	| serial-s01-e01 |	Story
EDL	00:27:10,464	00:27:11,744	| serial-s01-e01 |	Because he has no story
EDL	00:27:11,744	00:27:18,144	| serial-s01-e01 |	Definitely understand it's going to look at this to say all men must be lying is so coincidental
EDL	00:27:18,144	00:27:19,680	| serial-s01-e01 |	He doesn't remember what he did
EDL	00:27:19,680	00:27:21,984	| serial-s01-e01 |	I mean I completely understand that
EDL	00:27:21,984	00:27:23,520	| serial-s01-e01 |	Can I get that
EDL	00:27:23,520	00:27:29,920	| serial-s01-e01 |	Just feel like I said
EDL	00:27:29,920	00:27:32,736	| serial-s01-e01 |	There's nothing casual I can do
EDL	00:27:33,248	00:27:34,784	| serial-s01-e01 |	You remember that day
EDL	00:27:34,784	00:27:36,832	| serial-s01-e01 |	Nothing I can do

EDL	00:32:37,120	00:32:41,216	| serial-s01-e01 |	And she remembers specifically that that day she went home with her when she went to her boyfriend's house
EDL	00:32:41,728	00:32:42,240	| serial-s01-e01 |	With him
EDL	00:32:42,752	00:32:44,032	| serial-s01-e01 |	And they got snowed in
EDL	00:32:44,544	00:32:45,824	| serial-s01-e01 |	And I still really have late at night
EDL	00:32:46,592	00:32:50,688	| serial-s01-e01 |	And she remembered that for the following two days schools closed
EDL	00:32:51,456	00:32:53,248	| serial-s01-e01 |	Associate very specific details about
EDL	00:32:53,248	00:32:55,040	| serial-s01-e01 |	Why should remember that day
EDL	00:32:55,808	00:32:57,600	| serial-s01-e01 |	Even wrote out an affidavit on the spot
EDL	00:32:58,112	00:33:03,232	| serial-s01-e01 |	She says she in a non spoke for about 15 to 20 minutes while she was waiting for her boyfriend to give her a ride
EDL	00:33:03,744	00:33:06,048	| serial-s01-e01 |	We left around 2:40 unquote
EDL	00:33:06,816	00:33:08,864	| serial-s01-e01 |	Remember hey supposed to be dead by 2:30
EDL	00:33:09,888	00:33:11,168	| serial-s01-e01 |	The kicker
EDL	00:33:11,680	00:33:17,312	| serial-s01-e01 |	No attorney has ever contacted me about January 13th 1999 and the above information
EDL	00:33:18,848	00:33:21,152	| serial-s01-e01 |	Benefit of the doubt for a second
EDL	00:33:21,152	00:33:24,224	| serial-s01-e01 |	Maybe at 9 never actually showed the letters to Christina Gutierrez
EDL	00:33:24,736	00:33:25,504	| serial-s01-e01 |	Attorney
EDL	00:33:25,504	00:33:26,784	| serial-s01-e01 |	Sure he said he did but
EDL	00:33:28,320	00:33:29,344	| serial-s01-e01 |	Well I know
EDL	00:33:29,856	00:33:33,696	| serial-s01-e01 |	Deep inside Gutierrez notes on the case I have boxes and boxes of such stuff
EDL	00:33:34,208	00:33:35,744	| serial-s01-e01 |	There's this in her handwriting
EDL	00:33:36,256	00:33:37,792	| serial-s01-e01 |	Asia-plus boyfriend
EDL	00:33:37,792	00:33:40,096	| serial-s01-e01 |	Saw him in library 2:15 to 3
EDL	00:33:42,912	00:33:46,240	| serial-s01-e01 |	Date of July 13th more than 4 months after annan's arrest
EDL	00:33:46,752	00:33:50,336	| serial-s01-e01 |	This is written by one of the chairs as law clerks who visited in jail
EDL	00:33:50,848	00:33:53,664	| serial-s01-e01 |	Call Asia McClain saw him in the library at
EDL	00:33:53,664	00:33:54,432	| serial-s01-e01 |	3
EDL	00:33:54,432	00:33:56,224	| serial-s01-e01 |	Is your boyfriend saw him too
EDL	00:33:56,224	00:33:57,760	| serial-s01-e01 |	Library may have cameras
EDL	00:33:59,296	00:34:02,880	| serial-s01-e01 |	Yoy with the person never heard from a trial
EDL	00:34:02,880	00:34:06,464	| serial-s01-e01 |	Solid non crazy detail-oriented Alibi Witness
EDL	00:34:06,464	00:34:09,280	| serial-s01-e01 |	In a case that's so sorely needed Alibi Witnesses
EDL	00:34:10,304	00:34:13,888	| serial-s01-e01 |	I can't ask Christina Gutierrez cuz she died in 2004
EDL	00:34:13,888	00:34:15,936	| serial-s01-e01 |	Put that question to a few defense attorneys
EDL	00:34:19,008	00:34:22,848	| serial-s01-e01 |	Especially if it's just one person then it becomes one person's word over another
EDL	00:34:22,848	00:34:26,176	| serial-s01-e01 |	Single witness like that can backfire under cross-examination
EDL	00:34:26,176	00:34:29,248	| serial-s01-e01 |	Or they might take the focus away from the weaknesses in the states
EDL	00:34:30,528	00:34:36,416	| serial-s01-e01 |	So there are conceivable strategic reasons why Christina Gutierrez might not have wanted to put Asia McClain on the stand
EDL	00:34:37,696	00:34:39,744	| serial-s01-e01 |	What is inconceivable they all said
EDL	00:34:40,256	00:34:42,560	| serial-s01-e01 |	It's not ever contact Asia McClain
EDL	00:34:42,560	00:34:47,424	| serial-s01-e01 |	To never make the call never check it out never find out if her story helps or hurts your case
EDL	00:34:47,424	00:34:48,704	| serial-s01-e01 |	That makes no sense
EDL	00:34:48,704	00:34:49,216	| serial-s01-e01 |	Whatsoever
EDL	00:34:49,728	00:34:50,496	| serial-s01-e01 |	That is not a strategy
EDL	00:34:51,264	00:34:52,032	| serial-s01-e01 |	Is a fox
EDL	00:34:53,312	00:34:58,688	| serial-s01-e01 |	When I first heard about the letters in the word mistake
EDL	00:34:58,688	00:35:00,736	| serial-s01-e01 |	Never heard from
EDL	00:35:01,248	00:35:02,272	| serial-s01-e01 |	Such a slam dunk
EDL	00:35:02,272	00:35:02,784	| serial-s01-e01 |	Are done
EDL	00:35:03,808	00:35:05,088	| serial-s01-e01 |	Announce family hard annuity
EDL	00:35:05,600	00:35:08,160	| serial-s01-e01 |	Who filed a petition in court based on the age affidavit
EDL	00:35:08,928	00:35:14,560	| serial-s01-e01 |	His argument was an honest trial could have turned out differently if Gutierrez had checked out Asia story
EDL	00:35:14,560	00:35:16,864	| serial-s01-e01 |	Until when should get some form of what's called
EDL	00:35:16,864	00:35:17,888	| serial-s01-e01 |	Post-conviction relief
EDL	00:35:19,424	00:35:25,824	| serial-s01-e01 |	The hearing for her story by this time
EDL	00:35:25,824	00:35:29,408	| serial-s01-e01 |	He finds an address in the west coast tries calling sending messages
EDL	00:35:29,408	00:35:29,920	| serial-s01-e01 |	Nothing
EDL	00:35:30,432	00:35:35,808	| serial-s01-e01 |	Write a letter to her get it to a private investigator
EDL	00:35:36,576	00:35:39,648	| serial-s01-e01 |	Fiance come to the door opens it part way
EDL	00:35:39,648	00:35:42,720	| serial-s01-e01 |	Tell the investigator that she cannot speak to Asia
EDL	00:35:42,720	00:35:49,120	| serial-s01-e01 |	But that from what he knows about the case but not as guilty and deserve the punishment he got later the investigator
EDL	00:35:49,120	00:35:50,656	| serial-s01-e01 |	Gets a call from the fiance
EDL	00:35:50,656	00:35:52,704	| serial-s01-e01 |	We don't have to talk to you leave us alone
EDL	00:35:54,240	00:35:56,800	| serial-s01-e01 |	So I called off the search for Asia
EDL	00:35:56,800	00:36:00,128	| serial-s01-e01 |	Figuring once a witness turns on you like that it's too risky to keep pushing
EDL	00:36:01,152	00:36:06,528	| serial-s01-e01 |	And then at announce hearing on the new petition it comes out that Asia had done the very thing they dreaded
EDL	00:36:07,296	00:36:10,112	| serial-s01-e01 |	Asia had called one of the prosecutors in a nun's case
EDL	00:36:10,112	00:36:11,136	| serial-s01-e01 |	Mexican and Kevin urick
EDL	00:36:11,648	00:36:12,928	| serial-s01-e01 |	And undermined her own state
EDL	00:36:13,696	00:36:15,232	| serial-s01-e01 |	This is from a recording of the hearing
EDL	00:36:15,744	00:36:17,280	| serial-s01-e01 |	Mr. eurocast testifying on the witness
EDL	00:36:21,120	00:36:21,888	| serial-s01-e01 |	Sanlitun
EDL	00:36:23,680	00:36:25,728	| serial-s01-e01 |	A young lady named Asia called me
EDL	00:36:42,624	00:36:49,024	| serial-s01-e01 |	It was its I don't know what happened to her and why she would do
EDL	00:36:49,024	00:36:50,560	| serial-s01-e01 |	Do this again
EDL	00:36:51,072	00:36:54,912	| serial-s01-e01 |	She says it's not true that it was bullied into reading that statement 15 years ago
EDL	00:36:54,912	00:37:01,312	| serial-s01-e01 |	She can't fathom why Asia would discredit her own statement like that I don't know why they weren't the affidavit was written
EDL	00:37:01,312	00:37:02,080	| serial-s01-e01 |	Voluntarily
EDL	00:37:02,592	00:37:08,224	| serial-s01-e01 |	I'm going to turn in a license attorney I work on homeland security is like I have no reason to make
EDL	00:37:08,992	00:37:10,016	| serial-s01-e01 |	Something like this up
EDL	00:37:10,016	00:37:12,576	| serial-s01-e01 |	You know I didn't even know she existed until
EDL	00:37:13,856	00:37:14,624	| serial-s01-e01 |	On top of the convicts
EDL	00:37:15,392	00:37:16,160	| serial-s01-e01 |	So what do you think
EDL	00:37:16,160	00:37:20,256	| serial-s01-e01 |	Happened why would they have this sort of violent reaction to
EDL	00:37:20,256	00:37:22,048	| serial-s01-e01 |	Helping out an on now
EDL	00:37:22,816	00:37:24,608	| serial-s01-e01 |	I don't know
EDL	00:37:25,632	00:37:26,400	| serial-s01-e01 |	It was
EDL	00:37:27,424	00:37:28,192	| serial-s01-e01 |	Just really odd
EDL	00:37:30,240	00:37:31,008	| serial-s01-e01 |	Asian Chao app
EDL	00:37:33,056	00:37:36,896	| serial-s01-e01 |	After all they had the original letters and the affidavit that's all that should have mattered
EDL	00:37:37,408	00:37:38,432	| serial-s01-e01 |	But it didn't look good
EDL	00:37:38,944	00:37:40,480	| serial-s01-e01 |	Be natural for the judge to wonder
EDL	00:37:40,992	00:37:42,784	| serial-s01-e01 |	Why can't the defense produces Asia
EDL	00:37:43,552	00:37:45,600	| serial-s01-e01 |	Why is she making this call to a prosecutor
EDL	00:37:46,368	00:37:47,648	| serial-s01-e01 |	I mean anyone
EDL	00:37:47,648	00:37:51,488	| serial-s01-e01 |	I wondered I wondered if maybe she was pressured into writing that affidavit
EDL	00:37:51,488	00:37:53,280	| serial-s01-e01 |	She was hiding something
EDL	00:37:53,792	00:37:56,352	| serial-s01-e01 |	Like maybe she lied in those 1999 letters
EDL	00:37:56,864	00:38:02,240	| serial-s01-e01 |	Maybe she didn't really see I'm not at the library that day and I just wanted to insert herself into something exciting
EDL	00:38:02,240	00:38:05,312	| serial-s01-e01 |	She was grown up she wanted nothing to do with any of it
EDL	00:38:06,848	00:38:12,224	| serial-s01-e01 |	234 months after I first sat down with Rabia I become fixated on finding Asia
EDL	00:38:12,224	00:38:14,016	| serial-s01-e01 |	Bloodhound on this thing
EDL	00:38:14,016	00:38:18,624	| serial-s01-e01 |	Because a whole case seemed to me to be teetering on her memories of that afternoon
EDL	00:38:18,624	00:38:22,464	| serial-s01-e01 |	I have to know if I really was in the library at 2:36
EDL	00:38:22,464	00:38:22,976	| serial-s01-e01 |	TM
EDL	00:38:23,488	00:38:24,768	| serial-s01-e01 |	Because he was
EDL	00:38:24,768	00:38:26,304	| serial-s01-e01 |	Library equals innocent
EDL	00:38:26,816	00:38:31,168	| serial-s01-e01 |	It's so maddeningly simple and maybe I can crack it if I can just talk to Asia
EDL	00:38:31,936	00:38:36,288	| serial-s01-e01 |	I read her along gentle pleading letter and send it off to an address I found online
EDL	00:38:36,800	00:38:38,848	| serial-s01-e01 |	I'm calling people who know her
EDL	00:38:38,848	00:38:40,128	| serial-s01-e01 |	I think might know her
EDL	00:38:40,128	00:38:46,528	| serial-s01-e01 |	I'm checking the same Loop of Facebook MyLife LinkedIn sites over and over trawling for clues about where she might be
EDL	00:38:46,528	00:38:47,552	| serial-s01-e01 |	Kakashi might think
EDL	00:38:48,320	00:38:52,160	| serial-s01-e01 |	You're wondering why I went so nuts on this story versus some other murder case
EDL	00:38:52,672	00:38:56,256	| serial-s01-e01 |	The best I can explain is this is the one that came to me
EDL	00:38:56,256	00:39:02,656	| serial-s01-e01 |	It wasn't halfway across the world or even next door I came right to my lap and if I could
EDL	00:39:02,656	00:39:03,424	| serial-s01-e01 |	Bottom of it
EDL	00:39:03,424	00:39:04,192	| serial-s01-e01 |	Should I try
EDL	00:39:05,728	00:39:09,568	| serial-s01-e01 |	I start running down all the other information in ages 1999 letters
EDL	00:39:10,336	00:39:13,152	| serial-s01-e01 |	She mentioned they were security cameras inside the Library
EDL	00:39:13,664	00:39:16,992	| serial-s01-e01 |	I want to see the very nice manager there are Michelle hamiel
EDL	00:39:17,504	00:39:21,088	| serial-s01-e01 |	Was there a security system back in 99 that could have been checked
EDL	00:39:21,088	00:39:21,856	| serial-s01-e01 |	Set the time
EDL	00:39:21,856	00:39:22,880	| serial-s01-e01 |	Probably
EDL	00:39:22,880	00:39:23,904	| serial-s01-e01 |	Yes I'm going to say
EDL	00:39:25,184	00:39:26,208	| serial-s01-e01 |	And what system was it
EDL	00:39:26,208	00:39:30,304	| serial-s01-e01 |	I have no idea it was a old system
EDL	00:39:31,072	00:39:32,352	| serial-s01-e01 |	But you can probably video
EDL	00:39:32,864	00:39:33,376	| serial-s01-e01 |	It was video
EDL	00:39:34,144	00:39:37,216	| serial-s01-e01 |	And that was part of set up every morning you put a video tape in
EDL	00:39:37,216	00:39:39,520	| serial-s01-e01 |	Hello how are you guys recycling the videotape
EDL	00:39:40,032	00:39:40,544	| serial-s01-e01 |	Yes
EDL	00:39:41,312	00:39:41,824	| serial-s01-e01 |	Think
EDL	00:39:42,336	00:39:43,616	| serial-s01-e01 |	Ran for a week
EDL	00:39:43,616	00:39:46,176	| serial-s01-e01 |	So you had a Monday taper Tuesday for Wednesday
EDL	00:39:46,176	00:39:46,688	| serial-s01-e01 |	What's up what's up
EDL	00:39:47,456	00:39:53,344	| serial-s01-e01 |	So even if on the very day that Asia had written her first letter A Nosler had run out to find the security tape
EDL	00:39:53,344	00:39:55,648	| serial-s01-e01 |	It probably would have been non-existent by then
EDL	00:39:56,672	00:40:00,000	| serial-s01-e01 |	What about the computer using to check his email
EDL	00:40:00,512	00:40:04,864	| serial-s01-e01 |	To use a computer did people have to sign in like write their name down
EDL	00:40:04,864	00:40:05,376	| serial-s01-e01 |	They did
EDL	00:40:06,144	00:40:07,168	| serial-s01-e01 |	And what was the system that
EDL	00:40:08,448	00:40:09,728	| serial-s01-e01 |	Piece of paper and pencil
EDL	00:40:09,728	00:40:12,800	| serial-s01-e01 |	By any chance were logged
EDL	00:40:12,800	00:40:15,616	| serial-s01-e01 |	Meticulously and kept for 15 years were they
EDL	00:40:15,616	00:40:17,664	| serial-s01-e01 |	No
EDL	00:40:18,176	00:40:18,688	| serial-s01-e01 |	Hummer
EDL	00:40:20,480	00:40:20,992	| serial-s01-e01 |	We got nothing
EDL	00:40:22,016	00:40:25,344	| serial-s01-e01 |	The mystery of Ages boyfriend Derek and his friend Gerard
EDL	00:40:25,856	00:40:30,720	| serial-s01-e01 |	Winter and spring every time I went to Baltimore I went to Derek's mom's house looking for him
EDL	00:40:30,720	00:40:33,024	| serial-s01-e01 |	Vintage Rose window tinting business
EDL	00:40:33,024	00:40:34,048	| serial-s01-e01 |	And then finally
EDL	00:40:34,560	00:40:35,840	| serial-s01-e01 |	All right so you are Jerrod Johnson
EDL	00:40:38,144	00:40:41,728	| serial-s01-e01 |	You don't know how excited we are to be talkin to I've been looking for you for like 4 months
EDL	00:40:43,008	00:40:46,336	| serial-s01-e01 |	You didn't do anything but we were hoping maybe you remember this moment
EDL	00:40:47,872	00:40:49,920	| serial-s01-e01 |	On January 13th
EDL	00:40:50,432	00:40:51,968	| serial-s01-e01 |	1999
EDL	00:40:53,248	00:40:54,016	| serial-s01-e01 |	Do you
EDL	00:40:54,016	00:40:56,064	| serial-s01-e01 |	Have any memory
EDL	00:40:56,576	00:40:57,600	| serial-s01-e01 |	By any miracle
EDL	00:40:58,112	00:40:59,392	| serial-s01-e01 |	That you went
EDL	00:40:59,904	00:41:02,464	| serial-s01-e01 |	To Woodlawn Public Library branch
EDL	00:41:03,232	00:41:06,304	| serial-s01-e01 |	Near Woodlawn High School to pick up Asia McClain
EDL	00:41:06,304	00:41:07,328	| serial-s01-e01 |	With your friend Derek
EDL	00:41:08,608	00:41:09,888	| serial-s01-e01 |	I have no idea
EDL	00:41:11,168	00:41:11,680	| serial-s01-e01 |	Aja metoyer
EDL	00:41:12,192	00:41:13,472	| serial-s01-e01 |	Is that a person or book
EDL	00:41:14,752	00:41:17,056	| serial-s01-e01 |	Jefferson
EDL	00:41:17,568	00:41:19,360	| serial-s01-e01 |	No no recollection of
EDL	00:41:20,640	00:41:21,408	| serial-s01-e01 |	Scratch girod
EDL	00:41:22,176	00:41:23,200	| serial-s01-e01 |	Derek was my last hope
EDL	00:41:23,712	00:41:25,248	| serial-s01-e01 |	Eventually I caught him at home
EDL	00:41:25,248	00:41:27,552	| serial-s01-e01 |	Considering I woke him up he was exceedingly courteous
EDL	00:41:28,064	00:41:30,368	| serial-s01-e01 |	You show me a photo of Asian him all dressed up
EDL	00:41:30,368	00:41:31,648	| serial-s01-e01 |	They dated most of senior year
EDL	00:41:32,160	00:41:33,696	| serial-s01-e01 |	What's up here
EDL	00:41:34,208	00:41:34,976	| serial-s01-e01 |	Yeah
EDL	00:41:34,976	00:41:37,280	| serial-s01-e01 |	Beautiful
EDL	00:41:37,280	00:41:38,048	| serial-s01-e01 |	Yeah
EDL	00:41:38,048	00:41:39,328	| serial-s01-e01 |	That's my eyes
EDL	00:41:40,864	00:41:42,912	| serial-s01-e01 |	But there couldn't remember that day either
EDL	00:41:43,424	00:41:44,448	| serial-s01-e01 |	Shocking I know
EDL	00:41:45,216	00:41:50,336	| serial-s01-e01 |	Need to pick you up from school almost every day back then either from the library or from the front of the school
EDL	00:41:50,336	00:41:52,128	| serial-s01-e01 |	Because you spoke to a lot of her friend
EDL	00:41:52,128	00:41:52,895	| serial-s01-e01 |	AAA
EDL	00:41:54,431	00:41:55,967	| serial-s01-e01 |	It's very possible that
EDL	00:41:57,759	00:41:58,527	| serial-s01-e01 |	Could have spoken
EDL	00:41:58,527	00:42:00,319	| serial-s01-e01 |	The gentleman and her on Bad Day
EDL	00:42:01,087	00:42:02,367	| serial-s01-e01 |	But it's
EDL	00:42:02,367	00:42:03,903	| serial-s01-e01 |	Very hard to remember do you know if
EDL	00:42:03,903	00:42:04,415	| serial-s01-e01 |	15 years later
EDL	00:42:04,927	00:42:07,999	| serial-s01-e01 |	But it it's it sounds you know very
EDL	00:42:07,999	00:42:10,303	| serial-s01-e01 |	It sounds like this could have happened
EDL	00:42:10,815	00:42:13,375	| serial-s01-e01 |	I don't think he's not the type of person that would lie
EDL	00:42:13,375	00:42:16,191	| serial-s01-e01 |	I just a reminder
EDL	00:42:16,191	00:42:17,215	| serial-s01-e01 |	Person you know
EDL	00:42:17,215	00:42:19,007	| serial-s01-e01 |	To get involved
EDL	00:42:19,007	00:42:19,519	| serial-s01-e01 |	With Ally
EDL	00:42:22,079	00:42:23,615	| serial-s01-e01 |	Scioscia
EDL	00:42:23,615	00:42:25,663	| serial-s01-e01 |	It seems pretty credible
EDL	00:42:31,551	00:42:35,135	| serial-s01-e01 |	Call my cell phone from a blocked number
EDL	00:42:35,647	00:42:36,159	| serial-s01-e01 |	You guessed it
EDL	00:42:38,207	00:42:42,303	| serial-s01-e01 |	I wish I could say that my charming persuasive letter is it prompted Asia to call
EDL	00:42:42,303	00:42:44,095	| serial-s01-e01 |	But the truth is she never got my letter
EDL	00:42:44,095	00:42:44,863	| serial-s01-e01 |	I had the wrong address
EDL	00:42:45,375	00:42:50,239	| serial-s01-e01 |	But you was calling because I followed up weeks later it with a one-line email and she was responding to that
EDL	00:42:50,239	00:42:51,007	| serial-s01-e01 |	A little confused
EDL	00:42:56,383	00:43:00,479	| serial-s01-e01 |	I mean I have
EDL	00:43:01,503	00:43:05,855	| serial-s01-e01 |	I recorded our conversation on the cell which is why the sound quality is so bad sorry about that
EDL	00:43:06,879	00:43:09,439	| serial-s01-e01 |	33 year old stay-at-home mother
EDL	00:43:09,439	00:43:13,279	| serial-s01-e01 |	And she has not spent the last 15 years worrying about if he's guilty
EDL	00:43:13,791	00:43:17,119	| serial-s01-e01 |	I trust
EDL	00:43:19,423	00:43:21,983	| serial-s01-e01 |	Because I mean I was never
EDL	00:43:22,751	00:43:28,639	| serial-s01-e01 |	I was there a question now is never informed of anything pertaining to the case
EDL	00:43:28,639	00:43:31,455	| serial-s01-e01 |	I don't know why he was convicted
EDL	00:43:31,967	00:43:35,551	| serial-s01-e01 |	You just said she was spooked when the private investigator came to her house
EDL	00:43:35,551	00:43:37,599	| serial-s01-e01 |	I don't know if that's why she didn't Testify the
EDL	00:43:37,599	00:43:38,367	| serial-s01-e01 |	Securing
EDL	00:43:38,367	00:43:42,463	| serial-s01-e01 |	Why she made the call to the prosecutor but you told me that when she got the knock at the door
EDL	00:43:42,463	00:43:43,999	| serial-s01-e01 |	That was not cool
EDL	00:43:44,767	00:43:50,399	| serial-s01-e01 |	Christopher if I could do it the last thing you want is a murderer being pissed off at you knowing where you live
EDL	00:43:51,423	00:43:55,775	| serial-s01-e01 |	Potato remarkably clear memory of what happened on January 13th 1999
EDL	00:43:56,287	00:44:00,127	| serial-s01-e01 |	She had an internship at the time and so she got out of school much earlier than everyone else
EDL	00:44:00,639	00:44:04,479	| serial-s01-e01 |	Derek was supposed to come get her at the library along with the rod that they were very late
EDL	00:44:04,991	00:44:08,063	| serial-s01-e01 |	Remember seeing Adnan come in after Woodlawn let out for the day
EDL	00:44:08,575	00:44:12,927	| serial-s01-e01 |	He said the table and Frank we weren't
EDL	00:44:12,927	00:44:15,743	| serial-s01-e01 |	Really close friends or anything like that
EDL	00:44:15,743	00:44:16,255	| serial-s01-e01 |	You know
EDL	00:44:22,911	00:44:25,471	| serial-s01-e01 |	Never end
EDL	00:44:25,983	00:44:27,007	| serial-s01-e01 |	I can't remember
EDL	00:44:29,055	00:44:33,151	| serial-s01-e01 |	I think I'm going to ask her how he was doing whatever and he says Finance
EDL	00:44:52,351	00:44:53,887	| serial-s01-e01 |	Tell about it he just
EDL	00:44:59,263	00:45:03,871	| serial-s01-e01 |	I just wish the best for her attitude and
EDL	00:45:03,871	00:45:07,711	| serial-s01-e01 |	I'm not sure why ages memory of this interaction is so clear all these years later
EDL	00:45:08,223	00:45:10,271	| serial-s01-e01 |	Because she wrote it down
EDL	00:45:10,271	00:45:12,575	| serial-s01-e01 |	The time in his letters and then the affidavit
EDL	00:45:12,575	00:45:13,855	| serial-s01-e01 |	At the detail somehow stop
EDL	00:45:14,623	00:45:21,023	| serial-s01-e01 |	Do you remember what time you were talking this would have happened in the library do you remember what time that come
EDL	00:45:21,023	00:45:22,047	| serial-s01-e01 |	Conversation would have happened
EDL	00:45:26,143	00:45:27,679	| serial-s01-e01 |	I don't because
EDL	00:45:27,679	00:45:28,703	| serial-s01-e01 |	I know
EDL	00:45:28,703	00:45:32,287	| serial-s01-e01 |	School let out around 2:15.
EDL	00:45:33,311	00:45:34,335	| serial-s01-e01 |	2:30
EDL	00:45:35,103	00:45:41,503	| serial-s01-e01 |	Cuz you would said you got out of school earlier than other people so were you there were you at the library before 2:50
EDL	00:45:41,503	00:45:42,015	| serial-s01-e01 |	Teen
EDL	00:45:43,295	00:45:47,391	| serial-s01-e01 |	Oh yeah I have a few hours
EDL	00:45:48,159	00:45:50,719	| serial-s01-e01 |	Yeah I was pretty scared
EDL	00:45:50,719	00:45:55,071	| serial-s01-e01 |	And you know and he asked me what
EDL	00:45:55,071	00:45:57,887	| serial-s01-e01 |	Teenager boy
EDL	00:46:02,495	00:46:08,639	| serial-s01-e01 |	Don't even start with me
EDL	00:46:11,711	00:46:13,503	| serial-s01-e01 |	I remember that day because
EDL	00:46:14,015	00:46:15,551	| serial-s01-e01 |	That was the best
EDL	00:46:16,831	00:46:17,599	| serial-s01-e01 |	David
EDL	00:46:17,599	00:46:18,367	| serial-s01-e01 |	No
EDL	00:46:18,879	00:46:21,695	| serial-s01-e01 |	Were there snow days after that do you remember
EDL	00:46:23,487	00:46:28,863	| serial-s01-e01 |	I want to say there was because I think that was like the first snow of the year
EDL	00:46:30,911	00:46:33,983	| serial-s01-e01 |	I wouldn't have even remembered if it hadn't been for the
EDL	00:46:33,983	00:46:34,495	| serial-s01-e01 |	Snow
EDL	00:46:37,055	00:46:37,567	| serial-s01-e01 |	You know
EDL	00:46:38,335	00:46:41,919	| serial-s01-e01 |	I just remember being so pissed about being late
EDL	00:46:45,247	00:46:46,527	| serial-s01-e01 |	The First Noel
EDL	00:46:47,039	00:46:48,575	| serial-s01-e01 |	The snow is important
EDL	00:46:48,575	00:46:50,367	| serial-s01-e01 |	He disappeared on Wednesday
EDL	00:46:50,367	00:46:52,159	| serial-s01-e01 |	That night there was a huge ice storm
EDL	00:46:52,159	00:46:53,183	| serial-s01-e01 |	Which is unusual in Maryland
EDL	00:46:53,951	00:46:55,743	| serial-s01-e01 |	It ended up being a state emergency
EDL	00:46:55,743	00:46:57,279	| serial-s01-e01 |	School is closed for the rest of the week
EDL	00:46:58,559	00:47:00,607	| serial-s01-e01 |	They just started asking me questions about the case
EDL	00:47:01,119	00:47:02,655	| serial-s01-e01 |	Wasn't there DNA evidence
EDL	00:47:02,655	00:47:04,703	| serial-s01-e01 |	What exactly was James Harden the whole thing
EDL	00:47:05,727	00:47:07,519	| serial-s01-e01 |	She wasn't sure of none was guilty
EDL	00:47:08,031	00:47:10,591	| serial-s01-e01 |	She said things I've now heard from so many people since
EDL	00:47:11,103	00:47:12,895	| serial-s01-e01 |	He seems like he cared about her
EDL	00:47:12,895	00:47:14,687	| serial-s01-e01 |	He didn't seem angry or upset
EDL	00:47:14,687	00:47:15,711	| serial-s01-e01 |	There was more proof
EDL	00:47:16,223	00:47:18,271	| serial-s01-e01 |	It just you know
EDL	00:47:19,039	00:47:23,391	| serial-s01-e01 |	I didn't want to wait in here I just started something you know what I mean
EDL	00:47:24,159	00:47:30,303	| serial-s01-e01 |	Yeah
EDL	00:47:31,839	00:47:32,607	| serial-s01-e01 |	I mean
EDL	00:47:32,607	00:47:33,887	| serial-s01-e01 |	32 years old
EDL	00:47:34,399	00:47:35,935	| serial-s01-e01 |	Now and I know that
EDL	00:47:36,703	00:47:37,983	| serial-s01-e01 |	You know there's people out there
EDL	00:47:41,567	00:47:43,359	| serial-s01-e01 |	Calm demeanor you know
EDL	00:47:44,383	00:47:46,175	| serial-s01-e01 |	And I know some people who
EDL	00:47:47,967	00:47:50,783	| serial-s01-e01 |	Call Mom is known as and do something
EDL	00:47:50,783	00:47:54,111	| serial-s01-e01 |	EBay regret for the rest of your life
EDL	00:47:57,183	00:48:02,559	| serial-s01-e01 |	Yeah now it's be nice if there was some technicality something that would prove his innocence
EDL	00:48:05,119	00:48:11,519	| serial-s01-e01 |	Stephen person I've met in my life but I think I think Asia like
EDL	00:48:11,519	00:48:14,847	| serial-s01-e01 |	You might be that technicality to see what I mean like your
EDL	00:48:15,359	00:48:16,639	| serial-s01-e01 |	If you're saying
EDL	00:48:16,639	00:48:19,199	| serial-s01-e01 |	You saw him on this day at that time
EDL	00:48:19,711	00:48:21,503	| serial-s01-e01 |	That means the states
EDL	00:48:21,503	00:48:22,527	| serial-s01-e01 |	Timeline
EDL	00:48:22,527	00:48:25,855	| serial-s01-e01 |	For their this whole their whole theory of the case doesn't make any sense
EDL	00:48:29,439	00:48:30,207	| serial-s01-e01 |	Because
EDL	00:48:30,207	00:48:31,231	| serial-s01-e01 |	They're saying
EDL	00:48:31,743	00:48:33,535	| serial-s01-e01 |	He was in the car with her
EDL	00:48:34,303	00:48:38,143	| serial-s01-e01 |	At the very time that you're saying nice I'm at the library and we were talking
EDL	00:48:39,167	00:48:41,983	| serial-s01-e01 |	Do you know what I mean like that's exactly the window
EDL	00:48:41,983	00:48:43,519	| serial-s01-e01 |	Where they're saying she was
EDL	00:48:43,519	00:48:44,031	| serial-s01-e01 |	Murdered
EDL	00:48:47,871	00:48:50,175	| serial-s01-e01 |	In case you couldn't hear that it was a sigh
EDL	00:48:50,175	00:48:52,223	| serial-s01-e01 |	I completely understand that Sy
EDL	00:48:52,991	00:48:54,271	| serial-s01-e01 |	I feel a lot of the time
EDL	00:48:55,039	00:48:56,831	| serial-s01-e01 |	Because I talked to a non regularly
EDL	00:48:56,831	00:48:57,855	| serial-s01-e01 |	And he just
EDL	00:48:57,855	00:49:04,255	| serial-s01-e01 |	Doesn't seem like a murderer
EDL	00:49:04,255	00:49:07,583	| serial-s01-e01 |	Few minutes after I hung up with Asia
EDL	00:49:07,583	00:49:08,607	| serial-s01-e01 |	Adnan called
EDL	00:49:08,607	00:49:09,119	| serial-s01-e01 |	On schedule
EDL	00:49:11,167	00:49:12,703	| serial-s01-e01 |	I'm good
EDL	00:49:12,703	00:49:13,983	| serial-s01-e01 |	I'm good
EDL	00:49:15,775	00:49:17,823	| serial-s01-e01 |	So I was just talking to Asia McClain
EDL	00:49:22,175	00:49:24,479	| serial-s01-e01 |	You don't sound very excited
EDL	00:49:29,599	00:49:30,879	| serial-s01-e01 |	I really don't know
EDL	00:49:31,903	00:49:33,695	| serial-s01-e01 |	This was not the reaction I expected
EDL	00:49:34,207	00:49:36,767	| serial-s01-e01 |	I felt like I just interviewed an ivory-billed woodpecker
EDL	00:49:37,279	00:49:39,583	| serial-s01-e01 |	Remembered
EDL	00:49:39,583	00:49:42,399	| serial-s01-e01 |	Instead of being excited and said it was heartbreaking
EDL	00:49:45,471	00:49:46,495	| serial-s01-e01 |	Because it's
EDL	00:49:47,263	00:49:51,871	| serial-s01-e01 |	I'm not making this up
EDL	00:50:21,055	00:50:24,895	| serial-s01-e01 |	No no I mean I I C I totally iced tea
EDL	00:50:24,895	00:50:27,199	| serial-s01-e01 |	I see what you're saying I hadn't thought about it
EDL	00:50:27,199	00:50:27,967	| serial-s01-e01 |	In that way
EDL	00:50:35,135	00:50:37,183	| serial-s01-e01 |	Because they were all correct
EDL	00:50:37,183	00:50:37,951	| serial-s01-e01 |	It was too late
EDL	00:50:38,719	00:50:42,303	| serial-s01-e01 |	The judge rules on a petition a few weeks before I spoke to Asia
EDL	00:50:43,583	00:50:49,983	| serial-s01-e01 |	The judge wrote in his opinion that Christina Gutierrez his decision not to use Asia McClain as an alibi Witness
EDL	00:50:49,983	00:50:50,751	| serial-s01-e01 |	Strategic
EDL	00:50:51,519	00:50:55,359	| serial-s01-e01 |	After all ages original letters didn't specify an exact time
EDL	00:50:55,359	00:51:00,223	| serial-s01-e01 |	Temperaturas could have reasonably concluded that Asia was offering to lie in order to help an ion
EDL	00:51:00,991	00:51:04,575	| serial-s01-e01 |	And finally he wrote his letter contradicted
EDL	00:51:05,087	00:51:07,391	| serial-s01-e01 |	Ava said she saw him at the public library
EDL	00:51:07,391	00:51:10,207	| serial-s01-e01 |	Said he was on the school campus the whole afternoon
EDL	00:51:10,975	00:51:14,559	| serial-s01-e01 |	Maybe the judge didn't understand it was on library is basically part of the campus
EDL	00:51:15,327	00:51:15,839	| serial-s01-e01 |	But anyway
EDL	00:51:16,863	00:51:19,679	| serial-s01-e01 |	Is legally worthless
EDL	00:51:19,679	00:51:26,079	| serial-s01-e01 |	Said she saw you when the state contends you're strangling
EDL	00:51:26,079	00:51:27,359	| serial-s01-e01 |	Is worthless
EDL	00:51:27,871	00:51:31,455	| serial-s01-e01 |	A few days after I spoke to Asia she wrote me an email
EDL	00:51:31,967	00:51:34,015	| serial-s01-e01 |	I've been thinking a lot about Adnan She Wrote
EDL	00:51:34,527	00:51:37,599	| serial-s01-e01 |	All this time I thought the courts prove it was Adnan that killed her
EDL	00:51:37,599	00:51:39,391	| serial-s01-e01 |	I thought he was where he deserve to be
EDL	00:51:39,903	00:51:41,183	| serial-s01-e01 |	Assure
EDL	00:51:41,183	00:51:45,535	| serial-s01-e01 |	He was our friend too and it sucks feeling like you don't know who really killed your friend
EDL	00:51:46,047	00:51:47,839	| serial-s01-e01 |	He was the sweetest person ever
EDL	00:51:48,351	00:51:51,423	| serial-s01-e01 |	If you didn't kill Hae we owe it to him to try to make that clear
EDL	00:51:53,215	00:51:54,495	| serial-s01-e01 |	We need to put this to rest
EDL	00:51:55,519	00:51:59,615	| serial-s01-e01 |	I just hope that a nun isn't some sick bastard just trying to manipulate his way out of jail
EDL	00:52:00,639	00:52:01,407	| serial-s01-e01 |	I wrote back
EDL	00:52:01,919	00:52:02,687	| serial-s01-e01 |	Believe me

EDL	00:52:22,143	00:52:23,935	| serial-s01-e01 |	Something wasn't going on it wasn't good
EDL	00:52:24,447	00:52:26,495	| serial-s01-e01 |	It was just strange behavior for anybody
EDL	00:52:26,495	00:52:28,543	| serial-s01-e01 |	Basically threatened me like you know what I'm
EDL	00:52:29,567	00:52:35,967	| serial-s01-e01 |	What are you thinking right now
EDL	00:52:35,967	00:52:42,367	| serial-s01-e01 |	Literally thinking like like could have gone crazy
