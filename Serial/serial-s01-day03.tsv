EDL	00:00:45,568	00:00:46,336	| serial-s01-day03 |	I don't know
EDL	00:00:47,360	00:00:48,896	| serial-s01-day03 |	You texted me
EDL	00:00:48,896	00:00:51,968	| serial-s01-day03 |	You take me at lunch time and said you had an answer for me
EDL	00:00:52,480	00:00:57,088	| serial-s01-day03 |	What I have the answer to Is the thing you're dying to know is
EDL	00:00:57,088	00:01:02,208	| serial-s01-day03 |	What does AT&T mean when it says you can't use incoming calls for
EDL	00:01:02,208	00:01:03,744	| serial-s01-day03 |	Shut up
EDL	00:01:03,744	00:01:07,584	| serial-s01-day03 |	So here's here's the answer that the state's expert said today
EDL	00:01:08,096	00:01:09,376	| serial-s01-day03 |	With that means is
EDL	00:01:11,168	00:01:14,240	| serial-s01-day03 |	It's it's referring not to cell towers
EDL	00:01:15,008	00:01:16,544	| serial-s01-day03 |	But it's referring to
EDL	00:01:16,544	00:01:20,384	| serial-s01-day03 |	The switch the Serta Grant the black the giant brain of all this
EDL	00:01:20,384	00:01:23,200	| serial-s01-day03 |	The cell towers in an area is the thing that decides
EDL	00:01:23,200	00:01:25,760	| serial-s01-day03 |	Like which Tower get switch handles with call
EDL	00:01:26,528	00:01:28,576	| serial-s01-day03 |	I believe so you probably know that better than I
EDL	00:01:28,576	00:01:29,344	| serial-s01-day03 |	Yeah
EDL	00:01:29,856	00:01:30,624	| serial-s01-day03 |	Okay
EDL	00:01:30,624	00:01:31,648	| serial-s01-day03 |	And so
EDL	00:01:31,648	00:01:32,416	| serial-s01-day03 |	He's saying
EDL	00:01:32,928	00:01:36,512	| serial-s01-day03 |	The best the best explanation he could oh by the way I forgot to tell you this
EDL	00:01:37,024	00:01:43,424	| serial-s01-day03 |	The switch that covers the dc-baltimore area or at least it the one that did in 1990
EDL	00:01:43,424	00:01:46,240	| serial-s01-day03 |	And I don't know if it's the same one but it's called the dawgbone
EDL	00:01:46,240	00:01:49,312	| serial-s01-day03 |	Which I thought was funny
EDL	00:01:49,312	00:01:50,592	| serial-s01-day03 |	Hi cuz
EDL	00:01:50,592	00:01:54,432	| serial-s01-day03 |	Because it's it covers to metropolitan areas so it's like
EDL	00:01:54,432	00:01:54,944	| serial-s01-day03 |	You know like a
EDL	00:01:55,712	00:01:58,272	| serial-s01-day03 |	A ball at what ended about the other
EDL	00:02:05,184	00:02:08,512	| serial-s01-day03 |	The dog house
EDL	00:02:08,512	00:02:10,816	| serial-s01-day03 |	Even though, at the dawgbone anyway
EDL	00:02:11,328	00:02:12,608	| serial-s01-day03 |	What do you say the best
EDL	00:02:12,608	00:02:15,936	| serial-s01-day03 |	The best explanation that this cell tower expert gave
EDL	00:02:16,960	00:02:19,264	| serial-s01-day03 |	He's like he's an FBI agent
EDL	00:02:20,544	00:02:22,592	| serial-s01-day03 |	And she is his specialty is cell tower now
EDL	00:02:23,104	00:02:26,176	| serial-s01-day03 |	What you saying is what that disclaimer mean
EDL	00:02:27,200	00:02:28,224	| serial-s01-day03 |	Is
EDL	00:02:28,224	00:02:29,504	| serial-s01-day03 |	For example
EDL	00:02:29,504	00:02:31,040	| serial-s01-day03 |	Say I live in Atlanta
EDL	00:02:32,064	00:02:35,904	| serial-s01-day03 |	That's in so that's my home switch is going to be Atlanta
EDL	00:02:36,928	00:02:41,280	| serial-s01-day03 |	Say I get on an airplane I turn my phone off I get an airplane I fly to Bali
EDL	00:02:41,280	00:02:42,048	| serial-s01-day03 |	Tomorrow
EDL	00:02:42,048	00:02:44,096	| serial-s01-day03 |	And I arrive in Baltimore
EDL	00:02:44,608	00:02:46,144	| serial-s01-day03 |	I don't turn on my phone
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:50,752	| serial-s01-day03 |	Like I never I don't answer right away the Baltimore cellular network
EDL	00:02:51,520	00:02:53,568	| serial-s01-day03 |	But calls are coming into my phone
EDL	00:02:54,336	00:02:55,104	| serial-s01-day03 |	While it's off
EDL	00:02:56,384	00:02:57,664	| serial-s01-day03 |	Those calls
EDL	00:02:57,664	00:03:04,064	| serial-s01-day03 |	On a call log on a record of my activity will show the Atlanta switch for those calls
EDL	00:03:04,064	00:03:07,392	| serial-s01-day03 |	When I'm actually in Baltimore but my phone doesn't know yet
EDL	00:03:07,392	00:03:10,208	| serial-s01-day03 |	That I'm involved that is actually a question that I have had
EDL	00:03:10,720	00:03:12,768	| serial-s01-day03 |	For like 2 years
EDL	00:03:12,768	00:03:13,536	| serial-s01-day03 |	I know
EDL	00:03:14,048	00:03:17,120	| serial-s01-day03 |	But this FBI expert is saying
EDL	00:03:17,120	00:03:19,936	| serial-s01-day03 |	That doesn't apply to the Lincoln Park
EDL	00:03:20,960	00:03:25,056	| serial-s01-day03 |	Because the issue with those leakin Park calls was cell towers not switches
EDL	00:03:26,080	00:03:28,384	| serial-s01-day03 |	So he's saying this the cell testimony
EDL	00:03:28,384	00:03:28,896	| serial-s01-day03 |	Travis Fine
EDL	00:03:30,432	00:03:31,200	| serial-s01-day03 |	Yeah
EDL	00:03:31,200	00:03:35,296	| serial-s01-day03 |	Well he's saying there's one call actually that he disagrees with
EDL	00:03:37,088	00:03:38,112	| serial-s01-day03 |	Anyone
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:38,624	| serial-s01-day03 |	Who is Scott the
EDL	00:03:39,136	00:03:40,416	| serial-s01-day03 |	Call log in front of them
EDL	00:03:40,416	00:03:42,720	| serial-s01-day03 |	It's the 514 call which is a voicemail
EDL	00:03:42,720	00:03:43,232	| serial-s01-day03 |	Alcohol
EDL	00:03:44,768	00:03:48,096	| serial-s01-day03 |	But yeah basically other than that one call he's saying
EDL	00:03:48,096	00:03:49,120	| serial-s01-day03 |	He thought that
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:51,168	| serial-s01-day03 |	Cell tower expert to test
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:52,960	| serial-s01-day03 |	Defy data nuns original trial
EDL	00:03:53,472	00:03:55,776	| serial-s01-day03 |	Did a perfectly fine job in
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:03:56,544	| serial-s01-day03 |	He agreed with that test
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:03:59,360	| serial-s01-day03 |	But
EDL	00:04:00,128	00:04:04,992	| serial-s01-day03 |	The expert esl experts who testified for an onside who testified yesterday
EDL	00:04:05,760	00:04:06,528	| serial-s01-day03 |	Disagree
EDL	00:04:06,528	00:04:08,576	| serial-s01-day03 |	Completely and he is saying
EDL	00:04:08,576	00:04:09,344	| serial-s01-day03 |	That
EDL	00:04:09,344	00:04:10,880	| serial-s01-day03 |	That original
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:13,440	| serial-s01-day03 |	Cell testimony from anions trial
EDL	00:04:13,952	00:04:15,232	| serial-s01-day03 |	Doesn't hold up
EDL	00:04:15,232	00:04:20,607	| serial-s01-day03 |	Because the expert back then never saw that disclaimer and that this that disclaimer
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:22,655	| serial-s01-day03 |	Does apply to cell tower
EDL	00:04:23,679	00:04:24,959	| serial-s01-day03 |	So that's the problem
EDL	00:04:24,959	00:04:26,495	| serial-s01-day03 |	And they're going to continue to fight about that
EDL	00:04:27,263	00:04:30,591	| serial-s01-day03 |	It's going to be this is going to be a brawl over this thing
EDL	00:04:30,591	00:04:32,895	| serial-s01-day03 |	And it's still going with they they're not done
EDL	00:04:32,895	00:04:34,431	| serial-s01-day03 |	Cross-examining him
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:37,247	| serial-s01-day03 |	I say and they added another day to the hearing
EDL	00:04:37,247	00:04:40,575	| serial-s01-day03 |	On Monday and I could even see it going Pat be on Monday
EDL	00:04:40,575	00:04:41,855	| serial-s01-day03 |	Translate it a lot to cover
EDL	00:04:42,879	00:04:46,719	| serial-s01-day03 |	Okay so this is not this is not settled at all this is not tied up
EDL	00:04:46,719	00:04:48,255	| serial-s01-day03 |	All right no
EDL	00:04:49,279	00:04:50,047	| serial-s01-day03 |	So what else happened today
EDL	00:04:50,559	00:04:53,887	| serial-s01-day03 |	So the rest of the day was all about The Alibi issue
EDL	00:04:54,399	00:04:57,727	| serial-s01-day03 |	And two things happened in that
EDL	00:04:57,727	00:05:01,055	| serial-s01-day03 |	What is that an onside put on an investigator
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:04,895	| serial-s01-day03 |	And they had hired an investigator and they basically said look
EDL	00:05:04,895	00:05:07,967	| serial-s01-day03 |	They gave Christina Gutierrez is in tire
EDL	00:05:10,015	00:05:16,415	| serial-s01-day03 |	Alibi witness list that she had disclosed to the state back in the day before the first trial
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:17,695	| serial-s01-day03 |	Don's Original defense attorney
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:21,279	| serial-s01-day03 |	His original defense attorney the one who all this is about
EDL	00:05:21,279	00:05:27,423	| serial-s01-day03 |	And she had 80 some names on this list rise like a huge long last
EDL	00:05:27,423	00:05:31,519	| serial-s01-day03 |	So Justin Browns team had said to this investigator
EDL	00:05:31,519	00:05:33,823	| serial-s01-day03 |	Alright go find as many
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:35,359	| serial-s01-day03 |	People as you can off this list
EDL	00:05:35,359	00:05:37,407	| serial-s01-day03 |	And find out if they spoke to
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:40,223	| serial-s01-day03 |	Christina Gutierrez or her office back then
EDL	00:05:40,991	00:05:42,271	| serial-s01-day03 |	And what he said is
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:43,551	| serial-s01-day03 |	He
EDL	00:05:43,551	00:05:45,855	| serial-s01-day03 |	Was able to get in touch with 41 people
EDL	00:05:46,879	00:05:48,159	| serial-s01-day03 |	Of those
EDL	00:05:49,439	00:05:52,255	| serial-s01-day03 |	4 people said they had spoken to Christina
EDL	00:05:53,535	00:05:57,119	| serial-s01-day03 |	And none of them was spoken to about being an alibi
EDL	00:05:59,423	00:06:00,447	| serial-s01-day03 |	Only four people
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:01,215	| serial-s01-day03 |	Wow
EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:04,031	| serial-s01-day03 |	And it was one of those things were like well that doesn't
EDL	00:06:04,031	00:06:05,311	| serial-s01-day03 |	Sound good you know
EDL	00:06:05,311	00:06:07,359	| serial-s01-day03 |	It was a little
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:08,639	| serial-s01-day03 |	Yeah
EDL	00:06:08,639	00:06:15,039	| serial-s01-day03 |	But then the state came back and sort of showed a bunch of documents from her files all of which Wii U
EDL	00:06:15,039	00:06:17,855	| serial-s01-day03 |	You and I've seen I mean they're all stuff we have as well
EDL	00:06:17,855	00:06:23,999	| serial-s01-day03 |	And I remember these two and you know it does show that they were doing some work to
EDL	00:06:24,767	00:06:27,839	| serial-s01-day03 |	Find witnesses to find Alibi witnesses to speak to
EDL	00:06:27,839	00:06:28,863	| serial-s01-day03 |	People to subpoena
EDL	00:06:28,863	00:06:29,631	| serial-s01-day03 |	People
EDL	00:06:29,631	00:06:33,727	| serial-s01-day03 |	So it was just it was a little bit mushy like the back
EDL	00:06:33,727	00:06:37,055	| serial-s01-day03 |	Can 4th of that it was kind of felt like sort of a draw or something
EDL	00:06:37,055	00:06:38,079	| serial-s01-day03 |	I don't know it's
EDL	00:06:38,079	00:06:39,359	| serial-s01-day03 |	Like really whatever she did
EDL	00:06:39,871	00:06:40,383	| serial-s01-day03 |	Wasn't
EDL	00:06:41,151	00:06:41,663	| serial-s01-day03 |	Drake
EDL	00:06:42,175	00:06:43,455	| serial-s01-day03 |	That wasn't her defense
EDL	00:06:43,455	00:06:44,735	| serial-s01-day03 |	It's like she just didn't go that route
EDL	00:06:46,783	00:06:49,087	| serial-s01-day03 |	Possibly for you no lack of trying
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:50,111	| serial-s01-day03 |	But
EDL	00:06:51,135	00:06:52,671	| serial-s01-day03 |	If she didn't do nothing
EDL	00:06:53,183	00:06:55,743	| serial-s01-day03 |	So it was a little hard to sounds inconclusive
EDL	00:06:56,511	00:06:58,559	| serial-s01-day03 |	It was inconclusive who won that round.
EDL	00:06:58,559	00:06:59,071	| serial-s01-day03 |	Have to say
EDL	00:07:00,351	00:07:03,935	| serial-s01-day03 |	It was there a superstar witnessed today or something like that yes it's the most

EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:39,775	| serial-s01-day03 |	And she was just so unequivocal about
EDL	00:07:39,775	00:07:40,543	| serial-s01-day03 |	How
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:44,383	| serial-s01-day03 |	There's no excuse you can think of for why she didn't
EDL	00:07:45,151	00:07:48,223	| serial-s01-day03 |	Investigate at the minimum investigate
EDL	00:07:49,247	00:07:51,807	| serial-s01-day03 |	And he just put it in in such
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:58,207	| serial-s01-day03 |	In like just no uncertain terms like he said he basically said if you have a credible Alibi witness that is
EDL	00:07:58,207	00:07:58,975	| serial-s01-day03 |	Is the best
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:07:59,999	| serial-s01-day03 |	Possible defense
EDL	00:08:00,511	00:08:01,279	| serial-s01-day03 |	Can have right
EDL	00:08:01,791	00:08:03,583	| serial-s01-day03 |	And so he's like that's what you're always looking
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:10,751	| serial-s01-day03 |	And he told this Parable actually about a long time ago when he was I think it was he was saying he was a prosecutor at the time and he had this
EDL	00:08:10,751	00:08:11,519	| serial-s01-day03 |	This case
EDL	00:08:11,519	00:08:16,127	| serial-s01-day03 |	And the defense put up this Alibi witness you said you know actually at the time of the
EDL	00:08:16,127	00:08:16,639	| serial-s01-day03 |	Crime
EDL	00:08:17,151	00:08:18,431	| serial-s01-day03 |	I saw the defendant
EDL	00:08:18,431	00:08:20,735	| serial-s01-day03 |	On a bus traveling to Philadelphia
EDL	00:08:20,735	00:08:21,503	| serial-s01-day03 |	Summer like that
EDL	00:08:22,015	00:08:23,295	| serial-s01-day03 |	And
EDL	00:08:23,295	00:08:26,111	| serial-s01-day03 |	And he said he's her came back at this woman and he said she was

EDL	00:08:43,519	00:08:48,639	| serial-s01-day03 |	Cuz you were saying how that case really reminded him of this one
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:51,199	| serial-s01-day03 |	Because it was the same kind of witness
EDL	00:08:51,199	00:08:56,063	| serial-s01-day03 |	Right like that's who you want like that's in Asia McClain like that's the caliber that she was

EDL	00:09:12,703	00:09:13,471	| serial-s01-day03 |	Kind of ticks
EDL	00:09:13,471	00:09:16,543	| serial-s01-day03 |	Through all the things that
EDL	00:09:17,055	00:09:18,591	| serial-s01-day03 |	The states
EDL	00:09:18,591	00:09:21,151	| serial-s01-day03 |	Had criticized about her letters and
EDL	00:09:21,151	00:09:22,431	| serial-s01-day03 |	Her memories of like
EDL	00:09:22,431	00:09:23,711	| serial-s01-day03 |	You know this the
EDL	00:09:23,711	00:09:27,039	| serial-s01-day03 |	Inconsistency is willing consistencies or it seems like she's too
EDL	00:09:27,039	00:09:29,855	| serial-s01-day03 |	Too eager to help or put it have possibly contradicted
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:30,623	| serial-s01-day03 |	Uno estate
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:33,695	| serial-s01-day03 |	That Adnan had said
EDL	00:09:33,695	00:09:35,999	| serial-s01-day03 |	To the police about where he went he was just like no
EDL	00:09:35,999	00:09:37,279	| serial-s01-day03 |	No no
EDL	00:09:37,279	00:09:39,839	| serial-s01-day03 |	No he was like everything about her letters seemed
EDL	00:09:40,351	00:09:41,631	| serial-s01-day03 |	Like assets to her
EDL	00:09:41,631	00:09:43,167	| serial-s01-day03 |	He was like first of all
EDL	00:09:43,167	00:09:47,007	| serial-s01-day03 |	She's bringing up the surveillance stuff a possible surveillance cameras
EDL	00:09:47,007	00:09:48,031	| serial-s01-day03 |	In the library
EDL	00:09:48,031	00:09:54,431	| serial-s01-day03 |	And he's like regardless of whether it exists the fact that she wants it to exist mean she's so confident and what she remembers that she
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:09:55,711	| serial-s01-day03 |	He wants it corroborated
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:09:57,247	| serial-s01-day03 |	Right so that's good
EDL	00:09:58,015	00:10:04,415	| serial-s01-day03 |	That she's just very confident in what she remembers his chain saying she's not really good friends with an honours
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:04,927	| serial-s01-day03 |	Floor with hay
EDL	00:10:05,695	00:10:06,975	| serial-s01-day03 |	And he's like that's perfect
EDL	00:10:07,487	00:10:08,767	| serial-s01-day03 |	Because she knows them both
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:09,791	| serial-s01-day03 |	But she's not going to be
EDL	00:10:09,791	00:10:10,303	| serial-s01-day03 |	Be biased
EDL	00:10:11,327	00:10:14,399	| serial-s01-day03 |	Cuz she's not good friends with either one of them yeah
EDL	00:10:15,167	00:10:19,519	| serial-s01-day03 |	He said oh the fact that she's offering up her boyfriend and her
EDL	00:10:19,519	00:10:20,799	| serial-s01-day03 |	Her boyfriend's friend
EDL	00:10:20,799	00:10:23,103	| serial-s01-day03 |	You know who all he would come back and drop it.
EDL	00:10:23,103	00:10:26,687	| serial-s01-day03 |	Phuket bakeri sounds like she's giving you two more labs
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:27,711	| serial-s01-day03 |	He's like she's
EDL	00:10:28,479	00:10:28,991	| serial-s01-day03 |	Perfect
EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:30,783	| serial-s01-day03 |	And he said
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:37,183	| serial-s01-day03 |	In a situation like that you immediately pounced you move as fast as possible and you go in person
EDL	00:10:37,183	00:10:37,951	| serial-s01-day03 |	Talk to that one
EDL	00:10:38,975	00:10:39,487	| serial-s01-day03 |	Always
EDL	00:10:39,999	00:10:40,767	| serial-s01-day03 |	You always
EDL	00:10:40,767	00:10:42,815	| serial-s01-day03 |	Very convincing
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:44,863	| serial-s01-day03 |	It was so he was just so
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:46,655	| serial-s01-day03 |	Categorical about it was like
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:47,423	| serial-s01-day03 |	Kiss and then
EDL	00:10:47,935	00:10:48,959	| serial-s01-day03 |	He said
EDL	00:10:48,959	00:10:52,031	| serial-s01-day03 |	In terms of what he thought he could have done for Adnan
EDL	00:10:52,031	00:10:52,799	| serial-s01-day03 |	Case
EDL	00:10:52,799	00:10:54,335	| serial-s01-day03 |	He said he called it a game changer
EDL	00:10:54,847	00:10:58,943	| serial-s01-day03 |	He said he said it would have changed the ball games results
EDL	00:10:59,455	00:11:00,991	| serial-s01-day03 |	And that's of course that they
EDL	00:11:00,991	00:11:01,759	| serial-s01-day03 |	Write that
EDL	00:11:01,759	00:11:02,783	| serial-s01-day03 |	That anions
EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:03,551	| serial-s01-day03 |	Side needs
EDL	00:11:03,551	00:11:04,575	| serial-s01-day03 |	The show is that it would have changed
EDL	00:11:05,343	00:11:05,855	| serial-s01-day03 |	The trial if
EDL	00:11:06,623	00:11:07,647	| serial-s01-day03 |	Justified at the time
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:09,439	| serial-s01-day03 |	And so his upshot was just like
EDL	00:11:09,439	00:11:10,207	| serial-s01-day03 |	So
EDL	00:11:10,719	00:11:12,511	| serial-s01-day03 |	You know his analysis was
EDL	00:11:13,023	00:11:14,815	| serial-s01-day03 |	Christina's lawyer
EDL	00:11:14,815	00:11:15,583	| serial-s01-day03 |	Fell
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:17,887	| serial-s01-day03 |	Below the standard required by law
EDL	00:11:20,447	00:11:21,215	| serial-s01-day03 |	He sounds like a
EDL	00:11:21,215	00:11:21,727	| serial-s01-day03 |	Very good with
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:23,263	| serial-s01-day03 |	He was a
EDL	00:11:23,263	00:11:25,567	| serial-s01-day03 |	He was a great witness for the defense
EDL	00:11:25,567	00:11:26,847	| serial-s01-day03 |	I mean I feel convinced
EDL	00:11:27,615	00:11:31,711	| serial-s01-day03 |	Well that divide but you know hold off because they did not cross-examine him
EDL	00:11:31,711	00:11:35,295	| serial-s01-day03 |	So the state has had not had its crack at that guy okay
EDL	00:11:35,295	00:11:37,087	| serial-s01-day03 |	And like you said before this didn't turn out
EDL	00:11:37,087	00:11:37,855	| serial-s01-day03 |	Give me the last day of the year
EDL	00:11:38,367	00:11:40,159	| serial-s01-day03 |	They're going to continue on Monday
EDL	00:11:40,159	00:11:42,975	| serial-s01-day03 |	Yeah they're going to continue on Monday
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:46,047	| serial-s01-day03 |	Okay but I I can't be here Monday
EDL	00:11:46,047	00:11:48,095	| serial-s01-day03 |	I can't cover it Monday no
EDL	00:11:48,095	00:11:49,119	| serial-s01-day03 |	We need you to
EDL	00:11:49,119	00:11:50,655	| serial-s01-day03 |	Get we need you to go home
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:57,055	| serial-s01-day03 |	I know so I have to do our other are season 2 podcast I have to make the next episode or it won't
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:11:57,823	| serial-s01-day03 |	Happen
EDL	00:11:57,823	00:11:59,103	| serial-s01-day03 |	We know we needed
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:02,943	| serial-s01-day03 |	I think what we'll do is I'll cover it in some way
EDL	00:12:05,247	00:12:11,647	| serial-s01-day03 |	Definitely when the judge rules probably something on our website so when you write that will definitely let people know on the E
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:13,439	| serial-s01-day03 |	Email it'll be on the on the website
EDL	00:12:13,439	00:12:14,719	| serial-s01-day03 |	Okay yeah yeah that's
EDL	00:12:14,719	00:12:18,047	| serial-s01-day03 |	Sounds good do we know when we don't know when the judge will rule
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:20,863	| serial-s01-day03 |	No I mean he'll probably take some weeks and
EDL	00:12:21,375	00:12:22,399	| serial-s01-day03 |	Do it carefully in
EDL	00:12:22,399	00:12:23,935	| serial-s01-day03 |	And come up with his real name
EDL	00:12:26,239	00:12:27,775	| serial-s01-day03 |	He seems very deliver it and very
EDL	00:12:28,543	00:12:30,079	| serial-s01-day03 |	I know he seems to be listening very very careful
EDL	00:12:31,615	00:12:35,967	| serial-s01-day03 |	Can you can you just explain what the possible outcomes are like what are the possible things that
EDL	00:12:35,967	00:12:36,735	| serial-s01-day03 |	If he could
EDL	00:12:36,735	00:12:39,551	| serial-s01-day03 |	Decide so me all of this is about
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:40,831	| serial-s01-day03 |	Will he
EDL	00:12:40,831	00:12:42,623	| serial-s01-day03 |	He will this judge
EDL	00:12:42,623	00:12:45,695	| serial-s01-day03 |	Decide that he thinks Adnan should get a new trial
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:51,583	| serial-s01-day03 |	So if he decides to that he thinks at 9 could should get a new trial based on these issues
EDL	00:12:52,351	00:12:54,655	| serial-s01-day03 |	I mean I got to think the state will appeal that
EDL	00:12:55,679	00:12:57,983	| serial-s01-day03 |	So an appeal will happen
EDL	00:12:57,983	00:12:58,751	| serial-s01-day03 |	Okay if
EDL	00:12:58,751	00:13:03,615	| serial-s01-day03 |	If if he says no I don't think a Nan should get a new trial
EDL	00:13:04,127	00:13:06,431	| serial-s01-day03 |	Then it goes back
EDL	00:13:06,431	00:13:07,199	| serial-s01-day03 |	2
EDL	00:13:07,199	00:13:08,223	| serial-s01-day03 |	The court of Special Ops
EDL	00:13:08,223	00:13:08,735	| serial-s01-day03 |	Peels
EDL	00:13:09,247	00:13:10,527	| serial-s01-day03 |	For them to decide what
EDL	00:13:10,527	00:13:11,295	| serial-s01-day03 |	What to do
EDL	00:13:11,295	00:13:12,831	| serial-s01-day03 |	It's probably either way the outcome will be
EDL	00:13:13,343	00:13:14,623	| serial-s01-day03 |	It's going to go back to the
EDL	00:13:16,671	00:13:21,279	| serial-s01-day03 |	But that said it's like this does not feel like some sort of like technical
EDL	00:13:21,791	00:13:26,143	| serial-s01-day03 |	Bump along the way that like they're just sort of getting through to get things on the record
EDL	00:13:26,143	00:13:27,935	| serial-s01-day03 |	You know it feels like
EDL	00:13:28,447	00:13:32,543	| serial-s01-day03 |	It's a real sort of like fight for survival in there
EDL	00:13:32,543	00:13:37,919	| serial-s01-day03 |	It feels like a mini-trial really is what's happening even though it's not a trial that is how it feels
EDL	00:13:39,967	00:13:46,111	| serial-s01-day03 |	All right I should probably hang up item to let you go by Dana
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:53,279	| serial-s01-day03 |	Okay by the way I quit cuz I'm going to go join the FBI cell phone investigatory division
EDL	00:13:53,279	00:13:59,679	| serial-s01-day03 |	Oh no it's not called that what's it called it's called cast cellular analysis survey team
EDL	00:13:59,679	00:14:00,959	| serial-s01-day03 |	That's what you need to join
EDL	00:14:03,263	00:14:07,359	| serial-s01-day03 |	You could be a cast member
