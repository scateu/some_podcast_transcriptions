EDL	00:00:47,104	00:00:53,504	| serial-s01-e11 |	From This American Life and WBEZ Chicago
EDL	00:00:53,504	00:00:56,832	| serial-s01-e11 |	Chicago its serial one story told me five week I'm Sarah Koenig
EDL	00:01:00,160	00:01:03,232	| serial-s01-e11 |	For two months now I've been grappling with rumors about Adnan
EDL	00:01:03,744	00:01:06,560	| serial-s01-e11 |	People telling me there's stuff you don't know about Adnan
EDL	00:01:06,560	00:01:07,584	| serial-s01-e11 |	Stuff you need to know
EDL	00:01:07,584	00:01:08,864	| serial-s01-e11 |	Understand who you're dealing with
EDL	00:01:09,632	00:01:13,472	| serial-s01-e11 |	These communications came in the form of phone calls many phone calls
EDL	00:01:13,472	00:01:16,288	| serial-s01-e11 |	Sometimes one-on-one sometimes conference calls
EDL	00:01:16,288	00:01:17,312	| serial-s01-e11 |	Also text
EDL	00:01:17,312	00:01:18,336	| serial-s01-e11 |	And nervous emails
EDL	00:01:18,848	00:01:23,712	| serial-s01-e11 |	I can't tell this one I've spoken to that one and then that one gets worried that a broken my word which I
EDL	00:01:23,712	00:01:24,736	| serial-s01-e11 |	Promise I haven't
EDL	00:01:25,248	00:01:30,368	| serial-s01-e11 |	One person two doesn't confirm the thing person one told me and I report that back to person one
EDL	00:01:30,368	00:01:32,160	| serial-s01-e11 |	Person one often tells me
EDL	00:01:32,160	00:01:33,440	| serial-s01-e11 |	Person to is lying to me
EDL	00:01:35,232	00:01:39,584	| serial-s01-e11 |	All these rumors are coming from people and non knew growing up in the mosque community
EDL	00:01:40,096	00:01:43,168	| serial-s01-e11 |	The Salvation family is to attend Islamic Society of Baltimore
EDL	00:01:43,936	00:01:48,288	| serial-s01-e11 |	Some of these people I've already talked to during my first round of reporting for the story
EDL	00:01:48,288	00:01:52,896	| serial-s01-e11 |	But then once the series started and they heard how I'd known as being portrayed a new round of phone calls began
EDL	00:01:53,920	00:01:59,040	| serial-s01-e11 |	The Rumours themselves are nothing to dastardly nobody is saying I saw him do it or I
EDL	00:01:59,040	00:01:59,808	| serial-s01-e11 |	Proof
EDL	00:01:59,808	00:02:02,112	| serial-s01-e11 |	What is directly connected to the crime
EDL	00:02:02,880	00:02:06,208	| serial-s01-e11 |	There are a great many things I don't know about a non
EDL	00:02:06,208	00:02:08,512	| serial-s01-e11 |	And some of the things I was hearing we're giving me pause
EDL	00:02:09,280	00:02:11,328	| serial-s01-e11 |	Check them out as best I could
EDL	00:02:11,328	00:02:16,448	| serial-s01-e11 |	Every single one and some of them are so small that I initially was confused by the telling
EDL	00:02:16,448	00:02:18,496	| serial-s01-e11 |	Waiting for the punchline that it already slid by
EDL	00:02:19,520	00:02:20,288	| serial-s01-e11 |	Such as
EDL	00:02:20,288	00:02:21,824	| serial-s01-e11 |	He took a piece of my clothing
EDL	00:02:21,824	00:02:23,360	| serial-s01-e11 |	Piece of designer sportswear
EDL	00:02:23,872	00:02:28,480	| serial-s01-e11 |	Over explained climbing a wall
EDL	00:02:28,992	00:02:30,272	| serial-s01-e11 |	And then apologize profusely
EDL	00:02:31,808	00:02:34,624	| serial-s01-e11 |	Hi Sarah Koenig I'm going to confess something right now
EDL	00:02:35,136	00:02:37,184	| serial-s01-e11 |	I have done exactly the same thing
EDL	00:02:37,184	00:02:38,464	| serial-s01-e11 |	More than one side wager
EDL	00:02:39,488	00:02:43,328	| serial-s01-e11 |	On the other end of the scale was a story so incriminating
EDL	00:02:44,864	00:02:46,912	| serial-s01-e11 |	Well this one is true then we're done
EDL	00:02:46,912	00:02:48,192	| serial-s01-e11 |	Our story is over
EDL	00:02:48,192	00:02:48,960	| serial-s01-e11 |	Mini alcohol
EDL	00:02:49,728	00:02:52,800	| serial-s01-e11 |	This was the biggie and I work every angle I could discuss it out
EDL	00:02:53,312	00:02:54,336	| serial-s01-e11 |	I heard it second hand
EDL	00:02:54,848	00:02:58,432	| serial-s01-e11 |	That someone said something about at 9 at a party 15 years
EDL	00:02:59,200	00:03:03,296	| serial-s01-e11 |	I spent weeks trying to learn first the name and the location of that someone
EDL	00:03:03,296	00:03:08,928	| serial-s01-e11 |	Done trying to contact at someone and then finally driving several hours to question that someone in person
EDL	00:03:09,952	00:03:13,536	| serial-s01-e11 |	I nervously knock at the door nice guy comes out WeChat
EDL	00:03:13,536	00:03:16,864	| serial-s01-e11 |	He tells me what I've spent all these weeks and hours waiting for
EDL	00:03:17,376	00:03:19,680	| serial-s01-e11 |	He says I remember at 9
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:20,192	| serial-s01-e11 |	Nice kid
EDL	00:03:20,704	00:03:23,008	| serial-s01-e11 |	Remember he seemed sad when his girlfriend broke up
EDL	00:03:24,288	00:03:25,824	| serial-s01-e11 |	And so I promised him
EDL	00:03:26,336	00:03:27,104	| serial-s01-e11 |	I heard this
EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:31,456	| serial-s01-e11 |	Is that true that anything else you want to tell me
EDL	00:03:32,224	00:03:32,992	| serial-s01-e11 |	The Galaxy
EDL	00:03:33,504	00:03:34,528	| serial-s01-e11 |	That's all you had for me
EDL	00:03:35,552	00:03:41,184	| serial-s01-e11 |	Can I have a file on my desk about this rumor and I just stamped it with my big cartoon stamp
EDL	00:03:41,184	00:03:42,464	| serial-s01-e11 |	Unsubstantiated
EDL	00:03:42,976	00:03:44,000	| serial-s01-e11 |	I cross it off the list
EDL	00:03:52,192	00:03:54,240	| serial-s01-e11 |	This one more rumor I'll tell you about in a minute
EDL	00:03:54,752	00:04:00,384	| serial-s01-e11 |	But first I want to talk about why relatively few people from the musk Community are willing to talk on tape
EDL	00:04:00,384	00:04:02,176	| serial-s01-e11 |	Or on the record about a 9
EDL	00:04:02,688	00:04:04,224	| serial-s01-e11 |	What I'm talking about
EDL	00:04:04,736	00:04:05,760	| serial-s01-e11 |	Here's a lie
EDL	00:04:05,760	00:04:08,320	| serial-s01-e11 |	Not his real name and this is also not his real voice
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:09,856	| serial-s01-e11 |	Why the secrecy
EDL	00:04:14,976	00:04:16,256	| serial-s01-e11 |	Play it on
EDL	00:04:24,959	00:04:29,055	| serial-s01-e11 |	He probably knows something how do we know he's not involved
EDL	00:04:43,647	00:04:49,535	| serial-s01-e11 |	Talking like that you're one of them I mean your supplier you're basically saying I'm sick coming to this
EDL	00:04:50,047	00:04:51,071	| serial-s01-e11 |	Irrational
EDL	00:04:52,095	00:04:53,375	| serial-s01-e11 |	I'm under 500
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:05:00,543	| serial-s01-e11 |	Ali another is told me that their Community is judgemental
EDL	00:05:01,055	00:05:03,615	| serial-s01-e11 |	Right and wrong is drummed into early and often
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:07,711	| serial-s01-e11 |	Adults judge kids Behavior which then gets reflected back onto their parents
EDL	00:05:08,479	00:05:13,087	| serial-s01-e11 |	This is certainly not unique to their community and the other thing that isn't unique is how close-knit it is
EDL	00:05:13,855	00:05:18,719	| serial-s01-e11 |	Information and gossip travels swiftly and you don't want to be the one who goes against the grain
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:21,023	| serial-s01-e11 |	Or said something that could hurt at 9 or his parents
EDL	00:05:21,535	00:05:23,583	| serial-s01-e11 |	No one wants to end up in hot water
EDL	00:05:24,095	00:05:26,399	| serial-s01-e11 |	I live in a small town I understand that
EDL	00:05:27,935	00:05:32,799	| serial-s01-e11 |	But what I haven't totally understood I think is how scared people were arrested
EDL	00:05:33,311	00:05:36,127	| serial-s01-e11 |	I got an anonymous text recently that said
EDL	00:05:36,127	00:05:38,431	| serial-s01-e11 |	Who attends the Baltimore
EDL	00:05:39,199	00:05:42,783	| serial-s01-e11 |	My father and I are good friends and have known each other for years
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:47,135	| serial-s01-e11 |	Anon story has always been an urban legend to us kids growing up in the Muslim Community
EDL	00:05:47,135	00:05:49,695	| serial-s01-e11 |	Clouded in mystery and used as a cautionary Tale
EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:53,023	| serial-s01-e11 |	Some people did speak out on tape
EDL	00:05:53,535	00:05:56,863	| serial-s01-e11 |	I mean Robbie inside Chaudhary obviously dead and there are others too
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:06:01,471	| serial-s01-e11 |	A significant fraction of people including all who are scared
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:06,591	| serial-s01-e11 |	Police said his parents were especially protective like a 10 on the protective scale
EDL	00:06:06,591	00:06:10,431	| serial-s01-e11 |	After done was arrested they were frantic about his safety
EDL	00:06:10,431	00:06:12,223	| serial-s01-e11 |	His own life changed because of it
EDL	00:06:16,575	00:06:18,367	| serial-s01-e11 |	Are you serious that really happened
EDL	00:06:20,927	00:06:25,023	| serial-s01-e11 |	Cuz your mailbox was like at the end of the driveway or at the end
EDL	00:06:25,023	00:06:26,047	| serial-s01-e11 |	Attached to the wall of my
EDL	00:07:04,191	00:07:05,983	| serial-s01-e11 |	Really
EDL	00:07:08,543	00:07:09,311	| serial-s01-e11 |	McDonald's
EDL	00:07:23,135	00:07:24,671	| serial-s01-e11 |	It everyone just gets quiet
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:42,079	| serial-s01-e11 |	A bunch of people I talked to told me they feel guilty towards Adnan
EDL	00:07:42,079	00:07:43,359	| serial-s01-e11 |	They let him down
EDL	00:07:43,359	00:07:45,151	| serial-s01-e11 |	Because they let him astray
EDL	00:07:45,151	00:07:50,527	| serial-s01-e11 |	Or didn't protect him or didn't Mentor him or didn't show up enough a trial or didn't visit him in jail
EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:53,343	| serial-s01-e11 |	Even when you're on the fence about as innocent said
EDL	00:07:53,855	00:07:56,927	| serial-s01-e11 |	Please tell him that I love him or please tell him I'm sorry
EDL	00:07:57,439	00:08:00,255	| serial-s01-e11 |	You should tell him yourself you can write to him you know
EDL	00:08:01,023	00:08:03,071	| serial-s01-e11 |	And then sometimes comes a pause
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:06,399	| serial-s01-e11 |	The reason
EDL	00:08:06,399	00:08:08,191	| serial-s01-e11 |	Said he wanted me to know this
EDL	00:08:08,191	00:08:08,703	| serial-s01-e11 |	About Anan
EDL	00:08:18,175	00:08:21,503	| serial-s01-e11 |	Atlanta
EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:55,551	| serial-s01-e11 |	The name of the kind of kid who'd stand up when your parents came into the room at least said
EDL	00:08:56,063	00:08:58,623	| serial-s01-e11 |	At parties or events he be the first one to ask
EDL	00:08:58,623	00:08:59,903	| serial-s01-e11 |	How can I help you Auntie
EDL	00:08:59,903	00:09:01,951	| serial-s01-e11 |	I need help setting up those tables uncle
EDL	00:09:02,975	00:09:04,511	| serial-s01-e11 |	This was what I like
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:05,791	| serial-s01-e11 |	Disguise an anonymous
EDL	00:09:06,303	00:09:12,703	| serial-s01-e11 |	How to say
EDL	00:09:12,703	00:09:18,847	| serial-s01-e11 |	Normally I probably would enforce that on their face aren't connected to the crime at hand
EDL	00:09:19,615	00:09:23,455	| serial-s01-e11 |	But in this case I decided it was worthwhile because of where these rumors
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:23,967	| serial-s01-e11 |	Come from
EDL	00:09:24,735	00:09:31,135	| serial-s01-e11 |	I think these rumors are coming from a feeling that a handful of people have I've heard this turnabout for people people who knew it.
EDL	00:09:31,135	00:09:31,647	| serial-s01-e11 |	Growing up
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:35,231	| serial-s01-e11 |	Capable of committing this crime
EDL	00:09:35,999	00:09:40,095	| serial-s01-e11 |	I think they believed they saw things in his personality that they think I am not seeing
EDL	00:09:40,607	00:09:42,143	| serial-s01-e11 |	Namely that he's duplicitous
EDL	00:09:42,655	00:09:43,935	| serial-s01-e11 |	The term psychopath
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:44,959	| serial-s01-e11 |	Custodian sometimes
EDL	00:09:45,471	00:09:51,103	| serial-s01-e11 |	People told me he used his charm and his smarts to deflect suspicion or weasel out of things when he got caught
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:53,663	| serial-s01-e11 |	Pretty much what the judge said to him at a sentencing
EDL	00:09:54,943	00:09:58,527	| serial-s01-e11 |	Which brings me to the only rumor I heard that at least partly checked out
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:09:59,551	| serial-s01-e11 |	It was this
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:02,111	| serial-s01-e11 |	Adnan stole money
EDL	00:10:02,111	00:10:02,623	| serial-s01-e11 |	From the mosque
EDL	00:10:03,135	00:10:03,903	| serial-s01-e11 |	Donation money
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:07,487	| serial-s01-e11 |	Various versions of how this happened or could have happened
EDL	00:10:07,487	00:10:13,631	| serial-s01-e11 |	But from what I can tell the basic story is people who come to pray on Fridays and it's a lot of people many hundreds
EDL	00:10:13,631	00:10:15,935	| serial-s01-e11 |	Some of them put donation boxes
EDL	00:10:15,935	00:10:17,215	| serial-s01-e11 |	And that's what it done scam
EDL	00:10:18,239	00:10:20,287	| serial-s01-e11 |	Two people told me they saw him do it
EDL	00:10:20,287	00:10:22,335	| serial-s01-e11 |	One person told me he'd seen it several times
EDL	00:10:22,847	00:10:23,615	| serial-s01-e11 |	He wouldn't go on tape
EDL	00:10:24,127	00:10:25,407	| serial-s01-e11 |	But the other guy did
EDL	00:10:29,247	00:10:30,527	| serial-s01-e11 |	Every Friday
EDL	00:10:30,527	00:10:33,855	| serial-s01-e11 |	This is a guy I can't name whose voice was also changed
EDL	00:10:33,855	00:10:34,879	| serial-s01-e11 |	The explanation above
EDL	00:10:35,647	00:10:36,927	| serial-s01-e11 |	Because he was
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:40,511	| serial-s01-e11 |	Look upon like The Golden Child

EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:50,751	| serial-s01-e11 |	Collecting money
EDL	00:10:50,751	00:10:54,335	| serial-s01-e11 |	Organ donation boxes available around on Friday after prayer
EDL	00:10:54,335	00:10:56,127	| serial-s01-e11 |	You know he does
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:09,183	| serial-s01-e11 |	And nobody questions
EDL	00:11:09,183	00:11:10,975	| serial-s01-e11 |	You know good little Muslim kids
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:17,631	| serial-s01-e11 |	You you saw him actually take money
EDL	00:11:18,143	00:11:22,495	| serial-s01-e11 |	Noriel absolutely song empty
EDL	00:11:23,775	00:11:28,383	| serial-s01-e11 |	This guy is estimated that Adnan had stolen many thousands of dollars over time
EDL	00:11:28,383	00:11:30,943	| serial-s01-e11 |	Tens of thousands maybe $100,000
EDL	00:11:31,711	00:11:35,551	| serial-s01-e11 |	This sounded Fantastical to me so I checked with multiple Patel
EDL	00:11:36,063	00:11:38,879	| serial-s01-e11 |	He was president of the Islamic Society of Baltimore at the time
EDL	00:11:40,159	00:11:45,023	| serial-s01-e11 |	He said he's never heard of Adnan taking donation money but that it does happen from time to time
EDL	00:11:45,023	00:11:46,559	| serial-s01-e11 |	Someone stealing or trying to
EDL	00:11:47,071	00:11:49,119	| serial-s01-e11 |	There are people who take shoes yet it
EDL	00:11:49,119	00:11:51,167	| serial-s01-e11 |	My own brand new shoes were stolen
EDL	00:11:51,167	00:11:53,983	| serial-s01-e11 |	Twice he said that happened once in New York and once in Baltimore
EDL	00:11:54,751	00:11:58,335	| serial-s01-e11 |	But if it did take money he said there's no way it was a big amount
EDL	00:11:59,103	00:12:03,199	| serial-s01-e11 |	He's an average people donated about $2,500 at Friday prayers
EDL	00:12:03,199	00:12:06,015	| serial-s01-e11 |	Thousand dollars if it was a special occasion
EDL	00:12:08,831	00:12:10,879	| serial-s01-e11 |	He said keep the electricity and heat on
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:15,231	| serial-s01-e11 |	If they were even $100 short on any given week that have noticed
EDL	00:12:15,231	00:12:19,327	| serial-s01-e11 |	So sure maybe 20 bucks for 40 bucks here there but not hundreds
EDL	00:12:20,863	00:12:21,631	| serial-s01-e11 |	Out of the question
EDL	00:12:23,167	00:12:24,959	| serial-s01-e11 |	Anon says it's true
EDL	00:12:25,471	00:12:26,495	| serial-s01-e11 |	He did take donation money
EDL	00:12:27,519	00:12:29,055	| serial-s01-e11 |	21st ask him about it
EDL	00:12:29,055	00:12:29,823	| serial-s01-e11 |	He was unhappy
EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:34,175	| serial-s01-e11 |	I'd ask him so many frankly insulting things
EDL	00:12:34,175	00:12:38,015	| serial-s01-e11 |	So many nosey and inappropriate questions and he's never given me push back
EDL	00:12:38,527	00:12:40,063	| serial-s01-e11 |	But this was the last straw
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:43,135	| serial-s01-e11 |	What does it have to do with the case you wanted to know
EDL	00:12:43,135	00:12:47,487	| serial-s01-e11 |	He's ever claimed that he's innocent of killing her because he's a perfect or even a good person
EDL	00:12:47,487	00:12:50,559	| serial-s01-e11 |	He said so why talk about this and why the double standard
EDL	00:12:51,071	00:12:54,911	| serial-s01-e11 |	I wasn't going to everyone else's closet and pulling out skeletons that made them look fat
EDL	00:12:55,423	00:12:58,239	| serial-s01-e11 |	What do I protect other people and call him out on everything
EDL	00:12:58,751	00:13:02,335	| serial-s01-e11 |	He's endured other stuff in my reporting that he didn't think was fair to him
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:05,407	| serial-s01-e11 |	You go for my savior to my executioner on it you know it just
EDL	00:13:07,967	00:13:09,759	| serial-s01-e11 |	But now he was sticking up from selfie set
EDL	00:13:10,527	00:13:11,551	| serial-s01-e11 |	You seem pissed
EDL	00:13:11,551	00:13:13,087	| serial-s01-e11 |	And hurt and I understood it
EDL	00:13:13,599	00:13:18,719	| serial-s01-e11 |	I'm innocent very uncomfortable thing for me to talk about something that I did
EDL	00:13:18,719	00:13:24,351	| serial-s01-e11 |	I've never denied it I've never I don't see I don't understand I just think it's really unfair to me
EDL	00:13:24,351	00:13:30,751	| serial-s01-e11 |	If this. If you don't want to talk about this that's your prerogative like I'm not going to force you to talk about if you don't want to talk about it
EDL	00:13:30,751	00:13:36,639	| serial-s01-e11 |	And this is the only thing I don't talk about
EDL	00:13:41,503	00:13:42,783	| serial-s01-e11 |	It has nothing to do with the case
EDL	00:13:44,831	00:13:49,695	| serial-s01-e11 |	Chicken called out on my stuff
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:52,511	| serial-s01-e11 |	Well I mean
EDL	00:13:57,375	00:14:02,751	| serial-s01-e11 |	Zen phone calls later and he told me his stealing story
EDL	00:14:03,263	00:14:06,591	| serial-s01-e11 |	It was during the summer maybe this summer before eighth grade he said
EDL	00:14:06,591	00:14:08,639	| serial-s01-e11 |	Joy like the Friday prayers
EDL	00:14:10,175	00:14:13,759	| serial-s01-e11 |	A lot of times it'll be one adult and he would get like four or five kids together
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:16,831	| serial-s01-e11 |	Hey look I want you guys to go around and collect
EDL	00:14:17,599	00:14:21,695	| serial-s01-e11 |	You know money from people Horst and Erica have a different days it was different ways
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:25,791	| serial-s01-e11 |	Who's usually anywhere from like four to five of us we don't have little boxes or something
EDL	00:14:26,303	00:14:28,607	| serial-s01-e11 |	And people would come and able to Bonnie and
EDL	00:14:29,119	00:14:33,983	| serial-s01-e11 |	Usually like it was
EDL	00:14:33,983	00:14:36,287	| serial-s01-e11 |	It was like thousands of dollars in cash
EDL	00:14:36,287	00:14:37,055	| serial-s01-e11 |	Like one
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:39,103	| serial-s01-e11 |	5 * 20
EDL	00:14:39,615	00:14:43,455	| serial-s01-e11 |	$1,500 in cash
EDL	00:14:43,455	00:14:47,295	| serial-s01-e11 |	I don't really remember who I'm not saying it wasn't saying it wasn't me
EDL	00:14:47,295	00:14:51,135	| serial-s01-e11 |	Yeah I just idea came up like a man we could take like 60 or $80
EDL	00:14:51,647	00:14:52,415	| serial-s01-e11 |	Go to the movies
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:53,951	| serial-s01-e11 |	Go to the mall
EDL	00:14:53,951	00:14:55,231	| serial-s01-e11 |	Airplane arcade
EDL	00:14:55,743	00:14:57,535	| serial-s01-e11 |	You like eating stuff like that
EDL	00:14:57,535	00:15:00,095	| serial-s01-e11 |	Eventually but you think we're like one or two of us
EDL	00:15:00,607	00:15:07,007	| serial-s01-e11 |	Would like pocket a $20 bill and another $20
EDL	00:15:07,007	00:15:13,407	| serial-s01-e11 |	And I mean
EDL	00:15:13,407	00:15:16,479	| serial-s01-e11 |	You know I mean it is nothing but I'm proud of it
EDL	00:15:16,479	00:15:19,039	| serial-s01-e11 |	You know I'm very ashamed of it you know I don't
EDL	00:15:19,039	00:15:22,111	| serial-s01-e11 |	I don't I don't say that we were kids to try to put it in contacts
EDL	00:15:22,111	00:15:24,159	| serial-s01-e11 |	How to make an excuse
EDL	00:15:24,159	00:15:26,207	| serial-s01-e11 |	Maybe I am right but it's just you know
EDL	00:15:27,487	00:15:31,583	| serial-s01-e11 |	What made you look made you realize what made you stop and what made you realize it was wrong
EDL	00:15:32,351	00:15:38,495	| serial-s01-e11 |	I mean I wish I could say that it was like you know some feeling over there or something or feeling them wrong but it wasn't me
EDL	00:15:43,359	00:15:46,431	| serial-s01-e11 |	Anon says he was caught red-handed by shamim
EDL	00:15:46,431	00:15:47,455	| serial-s01-e11 |	His mother
EDL	00:15:47,455	00:15:52,063	| serial-s01-e11 |	She said she found some money in his pants pocket and ask him where it came from and the truth came out
EDL	00:15:52,575	00:15:54,111	| serial-s01-e11 |	He said she was horrified
EDL	00:15:54,111	00:15:56,671	| serial-s01-e11 |	It was the classic I'm not angry I'm disappointed
EDL	00:15:57,439	00:15:58,975	| serial-s01-e11 |	More disappointed than she's ever been in him
EDL	00:16:00,511	00:16:03,071	| serial-s01-e11 |	Annonces back then he didn't think he was hurting anyone
EDL	00:16:04,095	00:16:05,631	| serial-s01-e11 |	They spent so much time at the mosque
EDL	00:16:05,631	00:16:08,959	| serial-s01-e11 |	Can I shovel snow and they help set up events and clean up
EDL	00:16:08,959	00:16:13,055	| serial-s01-e11 |	I told him it was akin to taking 20 bucks from the tale of the family store at the end of the night
EDL	00:16:13,823	00:16:16,383	| serial-s01-e11 |	He said the course as an adult he knows how wrong that is
EDL	00:16:16,895	00:16:19,199	| serial-s01-e11 |	Get it
EDL	00:16:20,479	00:16:26,623	| serial-s01-e11 |	Announce telling of the stealing episode is a much more boys-will-be-boys version than what I'd heard from other people
EDL	00:16:26,623	00:16:30,207	| serial-s01-e11 |	Who told me they saw in his actions something more malignant
EDL	00:16:30,975	00:16:34,047	| serial-s01-e11 |	I talked to from the mosque Community said
EDL	00:16:34,047	00:16:35,583	| serial-s01-e11 |	This was so low
EDL	00:16:35,583	00:16:38,399	| serial-s01-e11 |	To take the hard earned cache of hard-working people
EDL	00:16:38,399	00:16:40,191	| serial-s01-e11 |	At the mosque of all places
EDL	00:16:40,703	00:16:41,727	| serial-s01-e11 |	This is a terrible thing
EDL	00:16:42,495	00:16:43,519	| serial-s01-e11 |	Other people said
EDL	00:16:45,311	00:16:49,407	| serial-s01-e11 |	Mr Patel then president of the mosque was thoroughly unruffled by the whole thing
EDL	00:16:49,407	00:16:51,199	| serial-s01-e11 |	Dunkin Donuts
EDL	00:16:51,199	00:16:51,967	| serial-s01-e11 |	3 more or less
EDL	00:16:53,247	00:16:55,039	| serial-s01-e11 |	It certainly does not a murderer make
EDL	00:16:55,807	00:17:00,671	| serial-s01-e11 |	Person does something like this it's not even necessarily a sign of bad character
EDL	00:17:02,975	00:17:05,279	| serial-s01-e11 |	Didn't see how is connected to the crime
EDL	00:17:05,279	00:17:09,375	| serial-s01-e11 |	And also some people told me they'd shoplifted before they broken the rules
EDL	00:17:09,887	00:17:11,679	| serial-s01-e11 |	So people in Glass Houses man
EDL	00:17:12,959	00:17:16,799	| serial-s01-e11 |	And in the end these guys all set with most of an Old Friends Day
EDL	00:17:16,799	00:17:19,103	| serial-s01-e11 |	He didn't have it in him to kill someone
EDL	00:17:19,103	00:17:20,639	| serial-s01-e11 |	It wasn't in his DNA
EDL	00:17:21,407	00:17:24,735	| serial-s01-e11 |	To me this question is the hard center of a nonce case
EDL	00:17:25,503	00:17:27,295	| serial-s01-e11 |	Can you tell really
EDL	00:17:27,295	00:17:29,599	| serial-s01-e11 |	Can you tell if someone has a crime like this in him
EDL	00:17:30,623	00:17:33,695	| serial-s01-e11 |	I think most of us think if we know someone well we can tell
EDL	00:17:34,207	00:17:36,767	| serial-s01-e11 |	React as detectives all the time Gathering evidence
EDL	00:17:37,279	00:17:42,399	| serial-s01-e11 |	Certain scenes we remember or the look on someone's face or that thing he said when he got mad
EDL	00:17:42,399	00:17:44,191	| serial-s01-e11 |	And then we act as a judge
EDL	00:17:44,191	00:17:44,703	| serial-s01-e11 |	Character
EDL	00:17:45,471	00:17:46,495	| serial-s01-e11 |	It's just a human thing
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:50,335	| serial-s01-e11 |	Of course it's slippery because it's so subjective
EDL	00:17:50,847	00:17:55,455	| serial-s01-e11 |	One person's evidence of good character is another person's evidence of questionable character
EDL	00:17:56,479	00:17:57,503	| serial-s01-e11 |	Case in point
EDL	00:17:57,503	00:18:01,087	| serial-s01-e11 |	I heard from many people that Adnan was the opposite of violent
EDL	00:18:01,087	00:18:03,903	| serial-s01-e11 |	But he was someone who would take the heat out of 10 situations
EDL	00:18:04,671	00:18:06,975	| serial-s01-e11 |	I've never even seen him in a fight
EDL	00:18:07,487	00:18:09,535	| serial-s01-e11 |	I don't even see him mad at anybody
EDL	00:18:10,303	00:18:13,119	| serial-s01-e11 |	This is Atif Iqbal from the mosque
EDL	00:18:13,119	00:18:14,911	| serial-s01-e11 |	That's his real name and his real voice
EDL	00:18:15,423	00:18:17,215	| serial-s01-e11 |	Exactly
EDL	00:18:17,215	00:18:19,519	| serial-s01-e11 |	Anybody like me
EDL	00:18:19,519	00:18:24,383	| serial-s01-e11 |	And here like somebody told me that you said something about me and some other person
EDL	00:18:24,383	00:18:30,271	| serial-s01-e11 |	Or something and I went up there to confront him and he was like I don't know what you heard I didn't say anything like that
EDL	00:18:30,271	00:18:35,391	| serial-s01-e11 |	But you haven't said something like that ball blouses you know getting all Rowdy up and he just came and kissed me on my cheek
EDL	00:18:35,391	00:18:36,415	| serial-s01-e11 |	The Dodgers play
EDL	00:18:36,415	00:18:38,719	| serial-s01-e11 |	Diffuse me like completely like
EDL	00:18:39,231	00:18:43,071	| serial-s01-e11 |	I miss that he kissed you on your cheek
EDL	00:18:43,583	00:18:49,215	| serial-s01-e11 |	Beatrice Vio veggie like it just like completely like diffuse me like I couldn't even be angry anymore
EDL	00:18:50,239	00:18:54,847	| serial-s01-e11 |	So I mean that's why I like I just couldn't even fathom the thought of him
EDL	00:18:54,847	00:18:55,871	| serial-s01-e11 |	Kelly
EDL	00:18:55,871	00:18:56,383	| serial-s01-e11 |	I mean
EDL	00:18:56,895	00:18:58,175	| serial-s01-e11 |	Joe Somebody
EDL	00:18:59,199	00:19:01,247	| serial-s01-e11 |	Like I don't even know how to
EDL	00:19:01,247	00:19:05,343	| serial-s01-e11 |	Say it's just like you don't like his personality
EDL	00:19:06,623	00:19:09,439	| serial-s01-e11 |	Separatists that kiss on the cheek is a towel
EDL	00:19:09,439	00:19:10,463	| serial-s01-e11 |	It's the real at 9
EDL	00:19:10,975	00:19:15,839	| serial-s01-e11 |	Prefer that other guy who said Adnan stolen who thinks I might be guilty of a crime is in prison for
EDL	00:19:16,607	00:19:20,191	| serial-s01-e11 |	That same piece maker quality was something he brought up to me
EDL	00:19:20,191	00:19:22,495	| serial-s01-e11 |	As evidence that Adnan was full of s***
EDL	00:19:22,495	00:19:25,055	| serial-s01-e11 |	Halo taking out the tension out of a situation
EDL	00:19:25,055	00:19:31,199	| serial-s01-e11 |	It was ice breaker
EDL	00:19:36,319	00:19:38,623	| serial-s01-e11 |	Majority
EDL	00:19:45,023	00:19:46,559	| serial-s01-e11 |	Here's the Curious Thing though

EDL	00:20:47,487	00:20:49,279	| serial-s01-e11 |	I've been pretty Ordinary People
EDL	00:20:50,303	00:20:51,839	| serial-s01-e11 |	This is Charles Ewing
EDL	00:20:51,839	00:20:54,399	| serial-s01-e11 |	He's a forensic psychologist and a lawyer
EDL	00:20:54,399	00:20:56,447	| serial-s01-e11 |	He teaches at the SUNY Buffalo Law School
EDL	00:20:56,959	00:21:00,287	| serial-s01-e11 |	He told me he's evaluated several thousand criminal defendant
EDL	00:21:00,287	00:21:03,871	| serial-s01-e11 |	And testified more than 700 trials as an expert witness
EDL	00:21:04,639	00:21:08,991	| serial-s01-e11 |	Mostly lately homicides committed by people in Intimate Relationships
EDL	00:21:08,991	00:21:10,783	| serial-s01-e11 |	And homicides committed by young people
EDL	00:21:11,807	00:21:14,623	| serial-s01-e11 |	You and your listen to about half the episodes of the show
EDL	00:21:15,135	00:21:19,232	| serial-s01-e11 |	Obviously he can't weigh in on a non psychological Health I'd be ridiculous
EDL	00:21:19,744	00:21:26,144	| serial-s01-e11 |	But I want him to find out what's a valid way to try to understand what's going on when someone kill someone else
EDL	00:21:26,144	00:21:27,680	| serial-s01-e11 |	What's the range of options here
EDL	00:21:28,704	00:21:31,776	| serial-s01-e11 |	He said most of the time he's doing Insanity evaluations
EDL	00:21:32,288	00:21:35,104	| serial-s01-e11 |	Evaluations for extreme emotional disturbance
EDL	00:21:35,104	00:21:39,200	| serial-s01-e11 |	Usually in cases where there's not a question of whether the defendant did it
EDL	00:21:39,200	00:21:40,480	| serial-s01-e11 |	More question of why
EDL	00:21:40,992	00:21:44,320	| serial-s01-e11 |	And again most of people he's evaluating a pretty ordinary
EDL	00:21:44,832	00:21:45,600	| serial-s01-e11 |	Some

EDL	00:21:47,648	00:21:49,440	| serial-s01-e11 |	Some serial killers some

EDL	00:21:50,464	00:21:52,000	| serial-s01-e11 |	Some really awful
EDL	00:21:52,000	00:21:53,792	| serial-s01-e11 |	Psychopathic individuals
EDL	00:21:53,792	00:21:54,816	| serial-s01-e11 |	For the most part
EDL	00:21:55,584	00:21:56,608	| serial-s01-e11 |	People kill
EDL	00:21:57,120	00:21:58,912	| serial-s01-e11 |	Not in a premeditated way
EDL	00:21:59,424	00:22:01,472	| serial-s01-e11 |	They're not evil they're not sociopathic
EDL	00:22:02,240	00:22:02,752	| serial-s01-e11 |	Psychopathic
EDL	00:22:03,776	00:22:04,544	| serial-s01-e11 |	They killed
EDL	00:22:05,056	00:22:05,568	| serial-s01-e11 |	Because
EDL	00:22:07,104	00:22:08,384	| serial-s01-e11 |	Something happens
EDL	00:22:08,384	00:22:09,408	| serial-s01-e11 |	Pushes them over the edge
EDL	00:22:10,688	00:22:14,784	| serial-s01-e11 |	In other words murder isn't usually strictly speaking planned event
EDL	00:22:15,296	00:22:17,088	| serial-s01-e11 |	A lot of people who know it
EDL	00:22:17,600	00:22:21,696	| serial-s01-e11 |	They can't get their heads around the idea that an unplanned to kill hay
EDL	00:22:21,696	00:22:22,720	| serial-s01-e11 |	I hear it all the time
EDL	00:22:23,488	00:22:25,792	| serial-s01-e11 |	Here's his old Woodlawn classmate Peter Billingsley
EDL	00:22:26,304	00:22:28,864	| serial-s01-e11 |	I still I still the whole idea premeditation just doesn't fit
EDL	00:22:29,888	00:22:30,656	| serial-s01-e11 |	Trodden
EDL	00:22:31,168	00:22:33,216	| serial-s01-e11 |	No it doesn't fit it all
EDL	00:22:33,216	00:22:33,984	| serial-s01-e11 |	But
EDL	00:22:33,984	00:22:34,496	| serial-s01-e11 |	I don't know
EDL	00:22:37,056	00:22:37,568	| serial-s01-e11 |	The first one
EDL	00:22:38,080	00:22:39,360	| serial-s01-e11 |	Coasterra some plant
EDL	00:22:39,872	00:22:42,432	| serial-s01-e11 |	Matt is but I'm sure this was not a planned murder
EDL	00:22:42,944	00:22:46,272	| serial-s01-e11 |	That's Jane Efron who taught Hannah Dunne English at Woodlawn
EDL	00:22:46,272	00:22:47,552	| serial-s01-e11 |	Her father was a cop
EDL	00:22:47,552	00:22:48,576	| serial-s01-e11 |	Icon
EDL	00:22:48,576	00:22:51,904	| serial-s01-e11 |	By that because that destroys everything
EDL	00:22:52,416	00:22:55,744	| serial-s01-e11 |	That I feel about these kids so I absolutely
EDL	00:22:56,256	00:22:57,024	| serial-s01-e11 |	I think it was
EDL	00:22:57,536	00:23:00,096	| serial-s01-e11 |	Passion overdose of emotion
EDL	00:23:00,864	00:23:02,400	| serial-s01-e11 |	Of Love jealousy
EDL	00:23:02,912	00:23:03,936	| serial-s01-e11 |	Resentment
EDL	00:23:03,936	00:23:04,960	| serial-s01-e11 |	All of those things
EDL	00:23:05,984	00:23:07,520	| serial-s01-e11 |	It sneaks in on you
EDL	00:23:07,520	00:23:09,824	| serial-s01-e11 |	Dominate your thinking and you can't get away from it
EDL	00:23:11,360	00:23:12,128	| serial-s01-e11 |	But that's
EDL	00:23:12,128	00:23:13,664	| serial-s01-e11 |	Uncomfortable thinking
EDL	00:23:14,432	00:23:17,504	| serial-s01-e11 |	Premeditated murder
EDL	00:23:19,808	00:23:26,208	| serial-s01-e11 |	Can otherwise seemingly normal kid
EDL	00:23:26,208	00:23:27,232	| serial-s01-e11 |	Up and do something like this
EDL	00:23:28,000	00:23:29,280	| serial-s01-e11 |	Play something like this
EDL	00:23:29,280	00:23:30,560	| serial-s01-e11 |	Or even do it impulsively
EDL	00:23:31,072	00:23:35,680	| serial-s01-e11 |	Is snapping a thing people say that all the time also
EDL	00:23:36,192	00:23:37,216	| serial-s01-e11 |	Snap
EDL	00:23:37,216	00:23:37,984	| serial-s01-e11 |	People
EDL	00:23:38,496	00:23:39,264	| serial-s01-e11 |	Sometimes we lose
EDL	00:23:39,776	00:23:41,056	| serial-s01-e11 |	And when they lose it
EDL	00:23:41,056	00:23:42,080	| serial-s01-e11 |	It's not always
EDL	00:23:42,592	00:23:43,104	| serial-s01-e11 |	01
EDL	00:23:44,128	00:23:45,920	| serial-s01-e11 |	I've seen a lot of cases in which
EDL	00:23:45,920	00:23:47,200	| serial-s01-e11 |	People have
EDL	00:23:47,200	00:23:48,224	| serial-s01-e11 |	Over
EDL	00:23:48,224	00:23:50,528	| serial-s01-e11 |	A relatively short period
EDL	00:23:50,528	00:23:51,040	| serial-s01-e11 |	Time
EDL	00:23:52,320	00:23:52,832	| serial-s01-e11 |	Nurse
EDL	00:23:53,344	00:23:54,368	| serial-s01-e11 |	Feelings of
EDL	00:23:55,136	00:23:56,160	| serial-s01-e11 |	Rejection
EDL	00:23:56,672	00:23:57,184	| serial-s01-e11 |	Or
EDL	00:23:58,208	00:23:58,976	| serial-s01-e11 |	Anger
EDL	00:23:58,976	00:24:00,000	| serial-s01-e11 |	Or hostility
EDL	00:24:00,512	00:24:02,048	| serial-s01-e11 |	And they slowly
EDL	00:24:02,048	00:24:02,816	| serial-s01-e11 |	Risen
EDL	00:24:02,816	00:24:03,584	| serial-s01-e11 |	To the point
EDL	00:24:03,584	00:24:05,120	| serial-s01-e11 |	At which individual
EDL	00:24:05,120	00:24:06,144	| serial-s01-e11 |	Decides to kill somebody
EDL	00:24:06,656	00:24:08,448	| serial-s01-e11 |	Those feelings Zimmer
EDL	00:24:08,448	00:24:09,216	| serial-s01-e11 |	For a while
EDL	00:24:09,728	00:24:10,496	| serial-s01-e11 |	And
EDL	00:24:10,496	00:24:11,776	| serial-s01-e11 |	What is a thot
EDL	00:24:12,800	00:24:13,568	| serial-s01-e11 |	Maybe I should
EDL	00:24:13,568	00:24:14,080	| serial-s01-e11 |	Children's purse
EDL	00:24:15,104	00:24:16,896	| serial-s01-e11 |	I'm not going to kill this person
EDL	00:24:17,408	00:24:18,688	| serial-s01-e11 |	I want to kill this person
EDL	00:24:19,200	00:24:20,480	| serial-s01-e11 |	What if I did
EDL	00:24:22,528	00:24:24,320	| serial-s01-e11 |	And the person thinks about it
EDL	00:24:25,344	00:24:26,880	| serial-s01-e11 |	And then maybe confronts the other
EDL	00:24:27,648	00:24:28,416	| serial-s01-e11 |	The person who
EDL	00:24:29,440	00:24:31,232	| serial-s01-e11 |	Frustration V anger
EDL	00:24:31,232	00:24:32,000	| serial-s01-e11 |	And then
EDL	00:24:34,048	00:24:35,072	| serial-s01-e11 |	The victim
EDL	00:24:35,072	00:24:36,608	| serial-s01-e11 |	Her would-be victim
EDL	00:24:36,608	00:24:38,144	| serial-s01-e11 |	Says or does something
EDL	00:24:38,656	00:24:39,168	| serial-s01-e11 |	The triggers
EDL	00:24:40,192	00:24:40,960	| serial-s01-e11 |	Provokes
EDL	00:24:40,960	00:24:41,984	| serial-s01-e11 |	The ultimate killing
EDL	00:24:42,752	00:24:44,032	| serial-s01-e11 |	Looks looks
EDL	00:24:45,824	00:24:46,336	| serial-s01-e11 |	Premeditated
EDL	00:24:46,848	00:24:49,920	| serial-s01-e11 |	I'm not sure that really is premeditated in the sense that
EDL	00:24:49,920	00:24:50,944	| serial-s01-e11 |	We normally think of it
EDL	00:24:51,456	00:24:52,224	| serial-s01-e11 |	It doesn't have to
EDL	00:24:52,224	00:24:53,248	| serial-s01-e11 |	To be like
EDL	00:24:53,248	00:24:55,808	| serial-s01-e11 |	Sudden impulse to violence
EDL	00:24:57,088	00:24:58,368	| serial-s01-e11 |	So that was news to me
EDL	00:24:58,368	00:25:00,160	| serial-s01-e11 |	But there's a sort of liminal phase
EDL	00:25:00,160	00:25:01,952	| serial-s01-e11 |	A simmering contemplation
EDL	00:25:02,464	00:25:03,744	| serial-s01-e11 |	What if I kill this person
EDL	00:25:04,256	00:25:09,120	| serial-s01-e11 |	And that can take the place of actual cognizant planning that end up in the same result
EDL	00:25:10,400	00:25:12,960	| serial-s01-e11 |	Considered in my morici moments
EDL	00:25:13,472	00:25:15,008	| serial-s01-e11 |	Is weather
EDL	00:25:15,008	00:25:16,032	| serial-s01-e11 |	But doesn't know he did it
EDL	00:25:16,800	00:25:18,592	| serial-s01-e11 |	I'm not the only person is entertain that one
EDL	00:25:19,104	00:25:20,640	| serial-s01-e11 |	Here's an honest friend Laura
EDL	00:25:20,640	00:25:24,224	| serial-s01-e11 |	I mean I remember the cops on me sometimes they have murderers
EDL	00:25:24,224	00:25:30,112	| serial-s01-e11 |	Standing with a knife in their hand next to the body saying to them that they didn't do it because you're
EDL	00:25:30,112	00:25:31,904	| serial-s01-e11 |	Brain goes into the shock
EDL	00:25:32,416	00:25:33,184	| serial-s01-e11 |	And it shuts down
EDL	00:25:33,952	00:25:35,488	| serial-s01-e11 |	That's like what maybe
EDL	00:25:36,000	00:25:36,768	| serial-s01-e11 |	That happened
EDL	00:25:36,768	00:25:39,072	| serial-s01-e11 |	Maybe it was an accident maybe you got mad
EDL	00:25:39,584	00:25:41,376	| serial-s01-e11 |	7 to get mad
EDL	00:25:41,376	00:25:41,888	| serial-s01-e11 |	Maybe
EDL	00:25:43,424	00:25:45,728	| serial-s01-e11 |	Maybe he lost it for a moment
EDL	00:25:46,240	00:25:47,520	| serial-s01-e11 |	Yeah and it was an act
EDL	00:25:48,800	00:25:51,616	| serial-s01-e11 |	Apparently this is not as outlandish as it might sound
EDL	00:25:52,128	00:25:55,200	| serial-s01-e11 |	People can go into a dissociative state
EDL	00:25:55,712	00:25:56,480	| serial-s01-e11 |	Where
EDL	00:25:56,480	00:25:57,504	| serial-s01-e11 |	They're really
EDL	00:25:58,016	00:25:59,296	| serial-s01-e11 |	Psychologically not
EDL	00:26:00,576	00:26:01,600	| serial-s01-e11 |	Where they are physical
EDL	00:26:02,624	00:26:04,160	| serial-s01-e11 |	Probably half of the people
EDL	00:26:04,928	00:26:06,464	| serial-s01-e11 |	Have evaluated who killed
EDL	00:26:06,976	00:26:07,744	| serial-s01-e11 |	Other
EDL	00:26:07,744	00:26:08,768	| serial-s01-e11 |	Human beings
EDL	00:26:09,280	00:26:12,096	| serial-s01-e11 |	Have some degree of amnesia
EDL	00:26:12,096	00:26:13,120	| serial-s01-e11 |	For what they've done
EDL	00:26:13,888	00:26:15,168	| serial-s01-e11 |	Did you say have
EDL	00:26:15,168	00:26:17,216	| serial-s01-e11 |	Half the people
EDL	00:26:17,216	00:26:18,240	| serial-s01-e11 |	And it's
EDL	00:26:18,240	00:26:21,568	| serial-s01-e11 |	It's not total Amnesia usually although I've seen some people
EDL	00:26:21,568	00:26:22,848	| serial-s01-e11 |	Whoever completes
EDL	00:26:22,848	00:26:23,872	| serial-s01-e11 |	Amnesia
EDL	00:26:23,872	00:26:24,896	| serial-s01-e11 |	For killing
EDL	00:26:25,408	00:26:25,920	| serial-s01-e11 |	But
EDL	00:26:26,944	00:26:28,480	| serial-s01-e11 |	You can be partly
EDL	00:26:28,480	00:26:32,320	| serial-s01-e11 |	I don't really recall the details I don't recall doing this
EDL	00:26:33,088	00:26:36,160	| serial-s01-e11 |	Because literally like the memory isn't in there
EDL	00:26:36,160	00:26:37,952	| serial-s01-e11 |	Brain anymore or
EDL	00:26:37,952	00:26:40,000	| serial-s01-e11 |	Or it never was in their brain or
EDL	00:26:40,000	00:26:42,304	| serial-s01-e11 |	Yeah I don't think we know the mechanism
EDL	00:26:42,816	00:26:43,840	| serial-s01-e11 |	By which
EDL	00:26:43,840	00:26:44,864	| serial-s01-e11 |	This kind of
EDL	00:26:44,864	00:26:47,680	| serial-s01-e11 |	Denial or Amnesia or combination works but
EDL	00:26:49,216	00:26:53,056	| serial-s01-e11 |	In the cases that I've been involved in where people have had some kind of
EDL	00:26:53,056	00:26:55,872	| serial-s01-e11 |	Amnesia or partial Amnesia or denial
EDL	00:26:56,896	00:26:58,432	| serial-s01-e11 |	It doesn't last forever
EDL	00:26:59,200	00:27:00,992	| serial-s01-e11 |	It's it's very difficult
EDL	00:27:00,992	00:27:02,784	| serial-s01-e11 |	To maintain that cam
EDL	00:27:03,296	00:27:03,808	| serial-s01-e11 |	Sade
EDL	00:27:05,856	00:27:08,672	| serial-s01-e11 |	What I find is it overtime people do
EDL	00:27:08,672	00:27:09,952	| serial-s01-e11 |	Recover traces
EDL	00:27:10,464	00:27:13,280	| serial-s01-e11 |	Of what happened and
EDL	00:27:13,280	00:27:14,560	| serial-s01-e11 |	They know what happened
EDL	00:27:15,584	00:27:17,376	| serial-s01-e11 |	What about 15 people who has
EDL	00:27:18,656	00:27:19,936	| serial-s01-e11 |	Genuinely snapped
EDL	00:27:20,448	00:27:21,216	| serial-s01-e11 |	And who
EDL	00:27:22,496	00:27:23,776	| serial-s01-e11 |	Committed a homicide
EDL	00:27:23,776	00:27:24,800	| serial-s01-e11 |	And then
EDL	00:27:24,800	00:27:26,592	| serial-s01-e11 |	They realize what they've done
EDL	00:27:27,104	00:27:28,896	| serial-s01-e11 |	Any immediate reaction
EDL	00:27:28,896	00:27:30,176	| serial-s01-e11 |	For most people
EDL	00:27:30,176	00:27:30,944	| serial-s01-e11 |	His
EDL	00:27:30,944	00:27:31,968	| serial-s01-e11 |	Oh my God
EDL	00:27:32,736	00:27:33,760	| serial-s01-e11 |	Look what I've done
EDL	00:27:34,272	00:27:35,808	| serial-s01-e11 |	And what am I going to do about it
EDL	00:27:36,576	00:27:38,368	| serial-s01-e11 |	I got to figure out some way to cover this up
EDL	00:27:39,648	00:27:40,672	| serial-s01-e11 |	Do you think it's
EDL	00:27:40,672	00:27:44,000	| serial-s01-e11 |	Is there another scenario where are you
EDL	00:27:44,512	00:27:49,376	| serial-s01-e11 |	It starts out as a lie as assertive cognizant lie like I didn't do this had nothing to do with this
EDL	00:27:49,888	00:27:52,192	| serial-s01-e11 |	And then over time
EDL	00:27:52,192	00:27:55,264	| serial-s01-e11 |	You truly believe that lie like you view kind of
EDL	00:27:56,288	00:27:57,056	| serial-s01-e11 |	Erase
EDL	00:27:57,568	00:27:58,336	| serial-s01-e11 |	Erase
EDL	00:27:58,336	00:28:00,128	| serial-s01-e11 |	The fact that you're lying and it just
EDL	00:28:00,128	00:28:00,640	| serial-s01-e11 |	Becomes
EDL	00:28:01,152	00:28:02,944	| serial-s01-e11 |	The truth of it for you
EDL	00:28:03,456	00:28:09,344	| serial-s01-e11 |	I think that happens I haven't seen that happen and homicide cases but I certainly seen it happened
EDL	00:28:10,368	00:28:11,904	| serial-s01-e11 |	Ordinary wife
EDL	00:28:11,904	00:28:13,440	| serial-s01-e11 |	Less often in homicides
EDL	00:28:13,440	00:28:17,024	| serial-s01-e11 |	Yeah I haven't even seen that and it's probably just because
EDL	00:28:19,072	00:28:23,424	| serial-s01-e11 |	And in most homicide cases the evidence is pretty overwhelming
EDL	00:28:23,936	00:28:24,704	| serial-s01-e11 |	That
EDL	00:28:24,704	00:28:25,728	| serial-s01-e11 |	You did it
EDL	00:28:29,312	00:28:35,712	| serial-s01-e11 |	Off the top of my head I can think of five different people in the story who other people have told me they think are either
EDL	00:28:35,712	00:28:37,760	| serial-s01-e11 |	Pathological Liars are psychopaths
EDL	00:28:38,272	00:28:39,808	| serial-s01-e11 |	Russian trust anything they say
EDL	00:28:40,832	00:28:43,392	| serial-s01-e11 |	The term psychopath gets thrown around so easily
EDL	00:28:43,904	00:28:47,488	| serial-s01-e11 |	The kind of catch-all term for cold hearted and calculating killer
EDL	00:28:48,768	00:28:51,840	| serial-s01-e11 |	If it non did this and if you did it the way Jay tells it
EDL	00:28:52,608	00:28:54,144	| serial-s01-e11 |	He is so cold hearted
EDL	00:28:54,912	00:28:57,472	| serial-s01-e11 |	Tell the cops that announces to him
EDL	00:28:57,472	00:29:01,056	| serial-s01-e11 |	Motherfukers referring to like hugs and bugs and stuff
EDL	00:29:01,056	00:29:02,592	| serial-s01-e11 |	Think of hardcore
EDL	00:29:02,592	00:29:04,640	| serial-s01-e11 |	But he just killed a person with his bare hands
EDL	00:29:06,688	00:29:07,712	| serial-s01-e11 |	Lebanon said that
EDL	00:29:08,224	00:29:13,088	| serial-s01-e11 |	Does that mean the 15 years since has been this very very long con
EDL	00:29:13,088	00:29:17,952	| serial-s01-e11 |	What is calculating enough to only pretend to be the normal sounding person he is with me on the phone
EDL	00:29:19,232	00:29:24,096	| serial-s01-e11 |	A psychopath usually means a person who has little or no conscience
EDL	00:29:24,096	00:29:25,376	| serial-s01-e11 |	Is glib
EDL	00:29:25,376	00:29:28,192	| serial-s01-e11 |	You can't empathize or relate to other people's feelings
EDL	00:29:28,960	00:29:31,008	| serial-s01-e11 |	They can read other people very well
EDL	00:29:31,008	00:29:32,800	| serial-s01-e11 |	But they don't have genuine empathy
EDL	00:29:33,312	00:29:34,080	| serial-s01-e11 |	Another
EDL	00:29:34,080	00:29:35,872	| serial-s01-e11 |	Factor to be sure
EDL	00:29:35,872	00:29:36,640	| serial-s01-e11 |	Is
EDL	00:29:36,640	00:29:38,176	| serial-s01-e11 |	This
EDL	00:29:38,176	00:29:39,200	| serial-s01-e11 |	What's
EDL	00:29:39,200	00:29:42,784	| serial-s01-e11 |	Known in the profession is superficial charm
EDL	00:29:44,064	00:29:45,344	| serial-s01-e11 |	These are people who
EDL	00:29:45,856	00:29:46,880	| serial-s01-e11 |	Come across
EDL	00:29:46,880	00:29:48,160	| serial-s01-e11 |	Very smoothly
EDL	00:29:48,672	00:29:51,744	| serial-s01-e11 |	Effectively manipulate other people
EDL	00:29:51,744	00:29:54,304	| serial-s01-e11 |	And manipulate them without them knowing it very often
EDL	00:29:57,120	00:29:58,912	| serial-s01-e11 |	Now I'm running through my head
EDL	00:29:58,912	00:29:59,424	| serial-s01-e11 |	Everything you just said
EDL	00:30:01,216	00:30:06,592	| serial-s01-e11 |	And some of it maybe another stuff
EDL	00:30:07,872	00:30:08,640	| serial-s01-e11 |	I mean
EDL	00:30:09,152	00:30:11,712	| serial-s01-e11 |	It really does seem like an on
EDL	00:30:11,712	00:30:12,992	| serial-s01-e11 |	Is is like
EDL	00:30:14,528	00:30:15,296	| serial-s01-e11 |	Really
EDL	00:30:16,064	00:30:17,600	| serial-s01-e11 |	Functioning really well
EDL	00:30:17,600	00:30:18,368	| serial-s01-e11 |	Minister
EDL	00:30:18,880	00:30:20,672	| serial-s01-e11 |	Fine in prison like he's
EDL	00:30:21,440	00:30:22,720	| serial-s01-e11 |	Season 3
EDL	00:30:22,720	00:30:25,024	| serial-s01-e11 |	Adaptable and he's always had like a
EDL	00:30:25,536	00:30:29,376	| serial-s01-e11 |	Job with responsibilities and he's not cutting into he's not been
EDL	00:30:29,376	00:30:32,448	| serial-s01-e11 |	Disciplined really ever except for having a cell phone
EDL	00:30:34,752	00:30:38,848	| serial-s01-e11 |	In like doesn't appear to have any kind of antisocial
EDL	00:30:39,872	00:30:40,896	| serial-s01-e11 |	Behaviorism
EDL	00:30:41,408	00:30:46,528	| serial-s01-e11 |	Friends he's got he's maintained his relationships outside the prison with his family and With Friends
EDL	00:30:46,528	00:30:47,552	| serial-s01-e11 |	Certain friends
EDL	00:30:48,576	00:30:49,856	| serial-s01-e11 |	I mean is that
EDL	00:30:49,856	00:30:52,416	| serial-s01-e11 |	Something to taken that I should be taking into account
EDL	00:30:55,232	00:30:56,000	| serial-s01-e11 |	I think so
EDL	00:31:00,096	00:31:00,864	| serial-s01-e11 |	Certainly
EDL	00:31:01,376	00:31:02,144	| serial-s01-e11 |	Cuts against
EDL	00:31:03,936	00:31:06,240	| serial-s01-e11 |	Theory that he's a psychopath
EDL	00:31:07,008	00:31:08,032	| serial-s01-e11 |	Arteries
EDL	00:31:08,032	00:31:08,800	| serial-s01-e11 |	Some kind of
EDL	00:31:10,592	00:31:12,384	| serial-s01-e11 |	Pathological person
EDL	00:31:13,408	00:31:14,688	| serial-s01-e11 |	But it doesn't rule it out
EDL	00:31:15,712	00:31:19,552	| serial-s01-e11 |	And the fact is most psychopaths are killers
EDL	00:31:19,552	00:31:21,600	| serial-s01-e11 |	And most Killers aren't Psychopaths
EDL	00:31:22,880	00:31:26,720	| serial-s01-e11 |	There's a there's a very limited overlap between those two spheres
EDL	00:31:28,000	00:31:34,144	| serial-s01-e11 |	Finally I asked you why should I be influenced by the fact that has so consistently maintained his innocence all these years
EDL	00:31:34,912	00:31:36,448	| serial-s01-e11 |	His experience
EDL	00:31:36,448	00:31:38,240	| serial-s01-e11 |	People who are wrongfully convicted
EDL	00:31:38,240	00:31:40,032	| serial-s01-e11 |	Always maintained their innocence
EDL	00:31:40,032	00:31:42,592	| serial-s01-e11 |	Even when it hurts them like in sentencing or parole
EDL	00:31:43,616	00:31:46,944	| serial-s01-e11 |	On the other hand he said just cuz you said you didn't do it
EDL	00:31:46,944	00:31:47,968	| serial-s01-e11 |	In four decades
EDL	00:31:48,480	00:31:49,504	| serial-s01-e11 |	Doesn't mean you didn't do it
EDL	00:31:50,528	00:31:51,808	| serial-s01-e11 |	But just aren't any rules for
EDL	00:31:53,856	00:31:56,416	| serial-s01-e11 |	Here's what I take away from this conversation with Charles Ewing
EDL	00:31:57,184	00:31:58,976	| serial-s01-e11 |	I don't think that is a psychopath
EDL	00:31:58,976	00:31:59,488	| serial-s01-e11 |	I just don't
EDL	00:32:00,000	00:32:02,304	| serial-s01-e11 |	I think he has empathy I think he has real feelings
EDL	00:32:02,816	00:32:06,656	| serial-s01-e11 |	Because I've heard and seen him demonstrate empathy and emotion
EDL	00:32:06,656	00:32:08,192	| serial-s01-e11 |	Towards me and towards other people
EDL	00:32:08,960	00:32:11,264	| serial-s01-e11 |	He is able to imagine how someone else feels
EDL	00:32:12,288	00:32:14,592	| serial-s01-e11 |	Options it's a toss-up
EDL	00:32:15,360	00:32:21,248	| serial-s01-e11 |	State of Amnesia and denial and then supplanted that with actual lying
EDL	00:32:21,248	00:32:22,272	| serial-s01-e11 |	It's possible
EDL	00:32:23,040	00:32:28,672	| serial-s01-e11 |	Could've had simmering feelings of anger and resentment that then boiled over in a not quite by accident way
EDL	00:32:29,184	00:32:29,952	| serial-s01-e11 |	It's possible
EDL	00:32:30,720	00:32:32,000	| serial-s01-e11 |	Could he be truly innocent
EDL	00:32:32,768	00:32:33,536	| serial-s01-e11 |	It's possible
EDL	00:32:34,816	00:32:37,120	| serial-s01-e11 |	He said he's often asked on the stand
EDL	00:32:37,120	00:32:39,424	| serial-s01-e11 |	How do you know this person isn't lying to you
EDL	00:32:39,424	00:32:41,216	| serial-s01-e11 |	What is the answer he said is always the same
EDL	00:32:41,728	00:32:42,240	| serial-s01-e11 |	I don't know
EDL	00:32:43,008	00:32:45,056	| serial-s01-e11 |	In the course of his career he's been fooled
EDL	00:32:50,688	00:32:57,088	| serial-s01-e11 |	A handful of people who are listening to the story
EDL	00:32:57,088	00:33:01,952	| serial-s01-e11 |	One thing they think makes a non look guilty is the way he talks about our brother doesn't talk about
EDL	00:33:01,952	00:33:03,744	| serial-s01-e11 |	Other people involved in the case
EDL	00:33:03,744	00:33:04,768	| serial-s01-e11 |	Especially J
EDL	00:33:05,536	00:33:08,608	| serial-s01-e11 |	But if you were really innocent we would hear him being matter
EDL	00:33:09,376	00:33:11,168	| serial-s01-e11 |	I know we talked about this
EDL	00:33:11,168	00:33:12,960	| serial-s01-e11 |	Why doesn't he sound more mad
EDL	00:33:12,960	00:33:15,264	| serial-s01-e11 |	But there's another factor I haven't mentioned
EDL	00:33:15,264	00:33:18,080	| serial-s01-e11 |	And that is as a defense attorneys explain to me
EDL	00:33:18,080	00:33:21,664	| serial-s01-e11 |	No good can come and harm can come
EDL	00:33:22,176	00:33:26,528	| serial-s01-e11 |	Attempting to contact or influence people on the outside for connected to his case
EDL	00:33:27,040	00:33:28,832	| serial-s01-e11 |	That's kind of inmate Behavior 101
EDL	00:33:30,112	00:33:32,928	| serial-s01-e11 |	Biggest what's a Cathy changed her story
EDL	00:33:32,928	00:33:35,232	| serial-s01-e11 |	Send me remember something exculpatory for Adnan
EDL	00:33:36,000	00:33:39,328	| serial-s01-e11 |	I'm in the state found out that Adnan had been writing to Kathy
EDL	00:33:39,840	00:33:41,120	| serial-s01-e11 |	Or threatening cat
EDL	00:33:41,120	00:33:41,888	| serial-s01-e11 |	He somehow
EDL	00:33:41,888	00:33:44,448	| serial-s01-e11 |	Talking smack about a podcast
EDL	00:33:45,216	00:33:49,824	| serial-s01-e11 |	By the state to challenge the validity of Kathy's new information
EDL	00:33:51,104	00:33:55,200	| serial-s01-e11 |	Anon is a smart guy he's been an inmate for 15 years he knows the deal
EDL	00:33:55,968	00:34:00,064	| serial-s01-e11 |	He also knows there's nothing he can do to change other people's minds about him
EDL	00:34:00,064	00:34:02,368	| serial-s01-e11 |	If a person genuinely doesn't think that I feel something
EDL	00:34:03,904	00:34:04,672	| serial-s01-e11 |	Put me in prison
EDL	00:34:05,184	00:34:05,696	| serial-s01-e11 |	Then
EDL	00:34:06,208	00:34:07,488	| serial-s01-e11 |	Me saying it
EDL	00:34:07,488	00:34:09,024	| serial-s01-e11 |	It really has no validity
EDL	00:34:09,792	00:34:10,816	| serial-s01-e11 |	In my eyes anyway
EDL	00:34:12,096	00:34:15,168	| serial-s01-e11 |	You know how do you think I did it
EDL	00:34:16,192	00:34:17,472	| serial-s01-e11 |	And if you think that I did it then
EDL	00:34:17,984	00:34:19,776	| serial-s01-e11 |	You can assume cuz I'm a normal
EDL	00:34:21,568	00:34:22,336	| serial-s01-e11 |	Unexpected
EDL	00:34:22,336	00:34:23,104	| serial-s01-e11 |	The monster
EDL	00:34:23,104	00:34:25,152	| serial-s01-e11 |	And they don't find that when x 8, expect
EDL	00:34:26,176	00:34:27,456	| serial-s01-e11 |	Or they don't find that
EDL	00:34:27,456	00:34:27,968	| serial-s01-e11 |	They don't know what to say
EDL	00:34:28,480	00:34:30,528	| serial-s01-e11 |	And the reality of it is I'm just a normal person
EDL	00:34:31,040	00:34:33,856	| serial-s01-e11 |	I know but I think actually
EDL	00:34:34,368	00:34:36,928	| serial-s01-e11 |	That's that's right but I think also what
EDL	00:34:36,928	00:34:42,048	| serial-s01-e11 |	People do is they put themselves immediately in your position and think what would I do
EDL	00:34:42,048	00:34:45,120	| serial-s01-e11 |	How would I be feeling how would I be asked if someone if I thought
EDL	00:34:45,632	00:34:51,264	| serial-s01-e11 |	You know someone had done me wrong and put me here and I would be screaming to the rooftops and they're not hearing you do that
EDL	00:34:51,264	00:34:52,032	| serial-s01-e11 |	System one
EDL	00:34:53,056	00:34:57,664	| serial-s01-e11 |	I mean it is really nothing to say if someone can't imagine how I feel this. There's no need for me
EDL	00:34:59,968	00:35:03,296	| serial-s01-e11 |	I mean it is what it is
EDL	00:35:07,904	00:35:10,464	| serial-s01-e11 |	I think it's a trap
EDL	00:35:10,464	00:35:11,744	| serial-s01-e11 |	To try to convince people
EDL	00:35:13,024	00:35:17,376	| serial-s01-e11 |	A few weeks ago after these rumors started surfacing I got a letter in the mail from a non
EDL	00:35:18,144	00:35:19,424	| serial-s01-e11 |	It was 18
EDL	00:35:19,424	00:35:20,960	| serial-s01-e11 |	Typed single-spaced pages
EDL	00:35:21,728	00:35:24,032	| serial-s01-e11 |	He gave me his reluctant permission to talk about it
EDL	00:35:26,080	00:35:27,104	| serial-s01-e11 |	His religion
EDL	00:35:27,104	00:35:29,408	| serial-s01-e11 |	His case how he's managed over the past 15 years
EDL	00:35:29,920	00:35:30,944	| serial-s01-e11 |	What's a good letter
EDL	00:35:30,944	00:35:31,968	| serial-s01-e11 |	Is it good writer
EDL	00:35:31,968	00:35:35,040	| serial-s01-e11 |	But it's song from pole to pole from distrust
EDL	00:35:35,040	00:35:36,064	| serial-s01-e11 |	Gratitude
EDL	00:35:36,064	00:35:36,832	| serial-s01-e11 |	Fusion
EDL	00:35:37,344	00:35:40,672	| serial-s01-e11 |	Anon is obviously aware of this podcast that it's out in the world
EDL	00:35:41,184	00:35:44,000	| serial-s01-e11 |	Negatale that my story had messed with his equilibrium
EDL	00:35:45,280	00:35:51,424	| serial-s01-e11 |	What is convicted of murder he said the biggest shock for him was that people thought he was capable of this hideous thing that people do
EDL	00:35:53,216	00:35:57,568	| serial-s01-e11 |	As I look back now he wrote I realized there were only three things I wanted after I was convicted
EDL	00:35:57,568	00:35:59,360	| serial-s01-e11 |	To stay close to my family
EDL	00:35:59,360	00:36:00,384	| serial-s01-e11 |	Prove my innocence
EDL	00:36:00,896	00:36:03,456	| serial-s01-e11 |	I just seen as a person again not a monster
EDL	00:36:04,224	00:36:05,504	| serial-s01-e11 |	The third one he says he's mad at
EDL	00:36:06,016	00:36:06,784	| serial-s01-e11 |	Inside prison
EDL	00:36:07,808	00:36:10,368	| serial-s01-e11 |	People here know me as a stand-up guy
EDL	00:36:10,368	00:36:11,648	| serial-s01-e11 |	Guards inmates
EDL	00:36:11,648	00:36:15,744	| serial-s01-e11 |	Staff has been around for 15 years I've seen me everyday
EDL	00:36:15,744	00:36:18,048	| serial-s01-e11 |	Recognize me as someone whose word can be trusted
EDL	00:36:18,816	00:36:22,656	| serial-s01-e11 |	I guess what I'm trying to say is that I was able to find a peace of mind in prison
EDL	00:36:22,656	00:36:23,936	| serial-s01-e11 |	But I lost at my trial
EDL	00:36:25,984	00:36:28,544	| serial-s01-e11 |	And now I come along as Robbie is best
EDL	00:36:28,544	00:36:29,056	| serial-s01-e11 |	Not his
EDL	00:36:29,568	00:36:31,360	| serial-s01-e11 |	And yank the store open again
EDL	00:36:31,360	00:36:34,688	| serial-s01-e11 |	To the outside world and to all its doubts about a nun's integrity
EDL	00:36:35,456	00:36:38,272	| serial-s01-e11 |	Stirring up the most painful possible questions
EDL	00:36:38,272	00:36:39,808	| serial-s01-e11 |	About whether he's a monster
EDL	00:36:40,320	00:36:41,600	| serial-s01-e11 |	It's his nightmare basically
EDL	00:36:42,112	00:36:44,672	| serial-s01-e11 |	Accused of manipulating everyone around him
EDL	00:36:45,952	00:36:48,768	| serial-s01-e11 |	Of course I had a sense of this feeling from him now and then
EDL	00:36:48,768	00:36:50,048	| serial-s01-e11 |	Over the years that we've been talkin
EDL	00:36:52,608	00:36:55,168	| serial-s01-e11 |	But in 40 hours of taped conversations
EDL	00:36:55,168	00:36:56,704	| serial-s01-e11 |	He was weighing every word
EDL	00:36:57,216	00:36:59,264	| serial-s01-e11 |	His goal was to keep it all business
EDL	00:36:59,264	00:37:02,592	| serial-s01-e11 |	Evaluate his case based on the evidence of loan
EDL	00:37:02,592	00:37:03,872	| serial-s01-e11 |	Not on his personality
EDL	00:37:04,384	00:37:10,016	| serial-s01-e11 |	I didn't want to do anything that could even remotely seem like I was trying to befriend you or Curry favor with you
EDL	00:37:10,016	00:37:15,648	| serial-s01-e11 |	I didn't want anyone to ever be able to accuse me of trying to ingratiate myself with you or manipulate you
EDL	00:37:15,648	00:37:16,160	| serial-s01-e11 |	SoundCloud
EDL	00:37:16,928	00:37:18,976	| serial-s01-e11 |	And having to do that
EDL	00:37:20,256	00:37:21,536	| serial-s01-e11 |	I had a rough year
EDL	00:37:21,536	00:37:25,120	| serial-s01-e11 |	My stepfather died in April then my father died two months later
EDL	00:37:25,632	00:37:26,400	| serial-s01-e11 |	And I knew that
EDL	00:37:27,168	00:37:30,240	| serial-s01-e11 |	Cuz I had to stick to what I know
EDL	00:37:30,752	00:37:35,360	| serial-s01-e11 |	Can you imagine what it's like to be afraid to show compassion to someone at a fear they won't believe you
EDL	00:37:35,872	00:37:36,896	| serial-s01-e11 |	I was so ashamed of that
EDL	00:37:38,688	00:37:44,832	| serial-s01-e11 |	And this second-guessing this monitoring of everything he says to me and therefore to the outside world
EDL	00:37:44,832	00:37:47,392	| serial-s01-e11 |	About anything really but especially about his case
EDL	00:37:47,904	00:37:49,952	| serial-s01-e11 |	He writes in his letter but it's crazy making
EDL	00:37:50,720	00:37:57,120	| serial-s01-e11 |	I'm always over-thinking analyzing what I say how it sounds and the fact that people always think I'm lying
EDL	00:37:57,120	00:38:00,448	| serial-s01-e11 |	All this thinking is to protect myself from being hurt
EDL	00:38:00,960	00:38:03,008	| serial-s01-e11 |	Not from being accused of his murder
EDL	00:38:03,008	00:38:06,080	| serial-s01-e11 |	But for being accused of being manipulative or lying
EDL	00:38:06,080	00:38:09,664	| serial-s01-e11 |	And I know it's crazy I know I'm paranoid but I can never shake it
EDL	00:38:10,176	00:38:13,760	| serial-s01-e11 |	Cuz no matter what I do or how careful I am it always comes back
EDL	00:38:15,040	00:38:17,600	| serial-s01-e11 |	I guess the only thing I could ask you to do is
EDL	00:38:17,600	00:38:19,904	| serial-s01-e11 |	If none of this makes any sense to you
EDL	00:38:19,904	00:38:20,928	| serial-s01-e11 |	Just read it again
EDL	00:38:21,440	00:38:24,768	| serial-s01-e11 |	Except this time please imagine that I really am innocent
EDL	00:38:25,280	00:38:26,816	| serial-s01-e11 |	And then maybe it'll make sense to you
EDL	00:38:29,632	00:38:34,240	| serial-s01-e11 |	At this point he wrote it doesn't matter to me how your story portrays me guilty or innocent
EDL	00:38:34,752	00:38:36,032	| serial-s01-e11 |	I just want it to be over
EDL	00:38:37,312	00:38:37,824	| serial-s01-e11 |	It will be
