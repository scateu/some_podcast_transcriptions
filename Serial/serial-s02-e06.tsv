EDL	00:03:15,072	00:03:16,096	| serial-s02-e06 |	Just about the deployment
EDL	00:03:29,408	00:03:32,480	| serial-s02-e06 |	I need to go back and explain to you where it began
EDL	00:03:35,040	00:03:41,440	| serial-s02-e06 |	From This American Life and WBEZ Chicago its serial
EDL	00:03:41,440	00:03:42,976	| serial-s02-e06 |	One story told week by week
EDL	00:03:42,976	00:03:44,256	| serial-s02-e06 |	I'm Sara Canning

EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:57,568	| serial-s02-e06 |	But in the next two episodes we are going to zoom back in so you can understand what dollar landmark and I
EDL	00:03:57,568	00:03:59,104	| serial-s02-e06 |	I came to understand about bow
EDL	00:03:59,616	00:04:01,920	| serial-s02-e06 |	Whether he told the truth about what he did
EDL	00:04:01,920	00:04:03,712	| serial-s02-e06 |	And what does truth be told
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:05,760	| serial-s02-e06 |	Because those are two different questions
EDL	00:04:10,112	00:04:12,928	| serial-s02-e06 |	What is the things that's interesting to me about bow
EDL	00:04:12,928	00:04:15,744	| serial-s02-e06 |	Is Eddie Brooks is cardinal rule of the military
EDL	00:04:15,744	00:04:16,768	| serial-s02-e06 |	He left his unit
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:17,536	| serial-s02-e06 |	Walked away from his
EDL	00:04:18,559	00:04:22,399	| serial-s02-e06 |	But at the same time he was completely devoted to being a good soldier
EDL	00:04:22,399	00:04:24,703	| serial-s02-e06 |	And up until the day he left he was a good soldier
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:29,567	| serial-s02-e06 |	At the military hearing his former weapons squad leader guy named Greg Leatherman
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:33,407	| serial-s02-e06 |	So the leadership you should do this thing sort of like fantasy football like a mock draft
EDL	00:04:33,919	00:04:37,247	| serial-s02-e06 |	If you could form a squad from anyone in the company who would you choose
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:43,135	| serial-s02-e06 |	And first pick you know Sergeant Bergdahl was going to be the first pick for everyone almost every time
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:44,671	| serial-s02-e06 |	He said he was a great Soldier
EDL	00:04:45,439	00:04:51,839	| serial-s02-e06 |	He did things like study the ranger handbook which is something we were all supposed to do but none of us actually did you look through
EDL	00:04:51,839	00:04:54,911	| serial-s02-e06 |	The way you get to know some say yeah I look at it it's Jason fry
EDL	00:04:54,911	00:04:56,447	| serial-s02-e06 |	Using Bose platoon they were friends
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:05:00,799	| serial-s02-e06 |	The ranger handbook is a pocket guide for soldiers on tactics and techniques
EDL	00:05:01,311	00:05:07,711	| serial-s02-e06 |	He come back he highlighted you look at it and study it and Leadership saw that and they were like well you know this guy's trying
EDL	00:05:07,711	00:05:10,527	| serial-s02-e06 |	He cares about his job he cares about what he's doing
EDL	00:05:11,039	00:05:11,807	| serial-s02-e06 |	And
EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:14,111	| serial-s02-e06 |	I think that's
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:18,975	| serial-s02-e06 |	Pet significant as far as understanding but he isn't a person who
EDL	00:05:19,743	00:05:21,023	| serial-s02-e06 |	Carelessly does something
EDL	00:05:21,535	00:05:23,839	| serial-s02-e06 |	Back then school with special forces

EDL	00:08:17,407	00:08:18,431	| serial-s02-e06 |	Bring his pipe
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:22,527	| serial-s02-e06 |	So you know even though I don't smoke there and you know I'm going out now
EDL	00:08:22,527	00:08:24,319	| serial-s02-e06 |	Deal with the guys because
EDL	00:08:24,831	00:08:27,647	| serial-s02-e06 |	If you look at the cigarette
EDL	00:08:30,463	00:08:31,999	| serial-s02-e06 |	Bonding
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:36,351	| serial-s02-e06 |	But he was participating
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:37,887	| serial-s02-e06 |	With an anthropological band
EDL	00:08:39,423	00:08:43,263	| serial-s02-e06 |	Probably be the first to admit that he had a bit of a 10-year for social interaction some
EDL	00:08:44,031	00:08:45,567	| serial-s02-e06 |	Not with everyone but with some
EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:50,431	| serial-s02-e06 |	1 * Akbar I was talking about wanting to travel around Europe go to Amsterdam
EDL	00:08:50,431	00:08:52,479	| serial-s02-e06 |	For all the reasons a young man would want to go to amps
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:54,783	| serial-s02-e06 |	Whose contribution
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:58,623	| serial-s02-e06 |	He talked about Amsterdam's major exports and the financial stability of the Netherlands
EDL	00:08:59,647	00:09:06,047	| serial-s02-e06 |	Yeah cuz I got to do that weird like you would tell stories like that or talked about women and he's like
EDL	00:09:06,047	00:09:07,071	| serial-s02-e06 |	Make a factory renewed
EDL	00:09:07,839	00:09:09,375	| serial-s02-e06 |	What was a factor of endued
EDL	00:09:09,887	00:09:10,655	| serial-s02-e06 |	The problem was
EDL	00:09:10,655	00:09:12,703	| serial-s02-e06 |	He wasn't always great in the moment
EDL	00:09:12,703	00:09:14,751	| serial-s02-e06 |	At sorting out what was fact and what was it
EDL	00:09:19,615	00:09:22,943	| serial-s02-e06 |	First time in the Army started out okay
EDL	00:09:22,943	00:09:25,247	| serial-s02-e06 |	Get specific ideas about leadership
EDL	00:09:25,247	00:09:26,271	| serial-s02-e06 |	About how you practice it
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:30,623	| serial-s02-e06 |	And in basic training at Fort Benning Georgia both found what he was looking for
EDL	00:09:31,135	00:09:34,975	| serial-s02-e06 |	Senior drill sergeant who is everything he felt like a military leader should be
EDL	00:09:41,887	00:09:43,935	| serial-s02-e06 |	Yeah
EDL	00:10:01,087	00:10:04,159	| serial-s02-e06 |	Full size of everyone he came into contact with in the army
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:08,511	| serial-s02-e06 |	Nice things to say about the confidence of some of his platoon mates or
EDL	00:10:08,511	00:10:09,279	| serial-s02-e06 |	Couple of the Sergeants
EDL	00:10:09,791	00:10:13,631	| serial-s02-e06 |	As far as I was concerned not one leader especially the guys up the chain
EDL	00:10:13,631	00:10:15,423	| serial-s02-e06 |	Hold a candle to the senior drill sergeant
EDL	00:10:16,703	00:10:18,495	| serial-s02-e06 |	Like I told General.
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:24,127	| serial-s02-e06 |	Guardian Afghanistan
EDL	00:10:31,039	00:10:33,087	| serial-s02-e06 |	Log back in my memory
EDL	00:10:33,599	00:10:35,903	| serial-s02-e06 |	A worrisome catalog began to compile
EDL	00:10:36,415	00:10:37,951	| serial-s02-e06 |	Heifers just a comment here there
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:41,535	| serial-s02-e06 |	We got to his unit in Alaska where the first of the five-oh-first
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:42,303	| serial-s02-e06 |	Based
EDL	00:10:42,303	00:10:44,351	| serial-s02-e06 |	Someone suggested belt lock up his stuff
EDL	00:10:44,351	00:10:45,375	| serial-s02-e06 |	Because otherwise I might get Swype
EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:46,911	| serial-s02-e06 |	Advice to a new car
EDL	00:10:47,679	00:10:48,703	| serial-s02-e06 |	The both thought
EDL	00:10:48,703	00:10:50,495	| serial-s02-e06 |	How am I supposed to go onto a Battlefield
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:52,543	| serial-s02-e06 |	I can't even trust these guys here
EDL	00:10:53,311	00:10:56,383	| serial-s02-e06 |	All those years later he remembered it and he told it to General Dollar
EDL	00:10:57,663	00:10:59,967	| serial-s02-e06 |	Then there was a comment by the command sergeant major
EDL	00:10:59,967	00:11:00,479	| serial-s02-e06 |	Ken Wolfe
EDL	00:11:00,991	00:11:04,575	| serial-s02-e06 |	Prior to deployment wolf did a full formal inspection of the battalion
EDL	00:11:05,087	00:11:08,159	| serial-s02-e06 |	While I was at it he explained to them what the mission would be in Afghanistan
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:09,695	| serial-s02-e06 |	Early sweat it wouldn't be
EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:11,999	| serial-s02-e06 |	And basically gave
EDL	00:11:11,999	00:11:15,327	| serial-s02-e06 |	The same speech are the same spill
EDL	00:11:15,327	00:11:16,351	| serial-s02-e06 |	To all 14
EDL	00:11:17,375	00:11:18,399	| serial-s02-e06 |	Which was
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:21,215	| serial-s02-e06 |	Hey we're not going here to rape kill pillage
EDL	00:11:21,215	00:11:21,727	| serial-s02-e06 |	Burn
EDL	00:11:23,007	00:11:25,567	| serial-s02-e06 |	It we're doing just the opposite of that
EDL	00:11:27,871	00:11:29,919	| serial-s02-e06 |	And I said I know lots of you guys
EDL	00:11:30,431	00:11:32,223	| serial-s02-e06 |	Join the Army to do that
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:33,759	| serial-s02-e06 |	And everybody
EDL	00:11:34,271	00:11:35,295	| serial-s02-e06 |	In the organization
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:39,391	| serial-s02-e06 |	Found the humor
EDL	00:11:39,391	00:11:39,903	| serial-s02-e06 |	In that
EDL	00:11:40,415	00:11:42,463	| serial-s02-e06 |	Not Bow he did not find the humor in that
EDL	00:11:43,231	00:11:46,047	| serial-s02-e06 |	Wilfit joke that he join back in 83
EDL	00:11:46,047	00:11:47,839	| serial-s02-e06 |	The rape kill pillage and burn also
EDL	00:11:48,351	00:11:51,423	| serial-s02-e06 |	Even if he understood it was intended as a joke
EDL	00:11:51,423	00:11:52,447	| serial-s02-e06 |	He did not think it was funny
EDL	00:11:52,959	00:11:53,983	| serial-s02-e06 |	You find it distressing
EDL	00:11:54,495	00:11:56,031	| serial-s02-e06 |	He told all he was taken aback
EDL	00:11:58,847	00:12:00,639	| serial-s02-e06 |	In early 2009
EDL	00:12:00,639	00:12:03,455	| serial-s02-e06 |	Who sent an email from Alaska to his family and friends
EDL	00:12:03,967	00:12:09,343	| serial-s02-e06 |	Call my deployment dates to Afghanistan have been set to the 9th or 10th of March so the countdown has started
EDL	00:12:09,855	00:12:13,183	| serial-s02-e06 |	I'm looking forward to the next year of learning and challenges
EDL	00:12:17,535	00:12:20,607	| serial-s02-e06 |	He rode marched in a pair of new boots trying to break them in
EDL	00:12:20,607	00:12:25,215	| serial-s02-e06 |	I got a blister on his left foot that turned into a serious staph infection had to go to the
EDL	00:12:26,495	00:12:29,055	| serial-s02-e06 |	Tri-State back on what's called rear D rear detachment
EDL	00:12:29,823	00:12:31,871	| serial-s02-e06 |	But almost everyone else shipped off

EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:36,223	| serial-s02-e06 |	When they land
EDL	00:12:36,223	00:12:37,759	| serial-s02-e06 |	Spring of 2009
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:40,063	| serial-s02-e06 |	Was a turning point for US forces there
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:45,695	| serial-s02-e06 |	The Taliban and other anti-government groups had pushed back into the country in a big way
EDL	00:12:45,695	00:12:51,071	| serial-s02-e06 |	There were Taliban Shadow governors in 33 as a country's 34 provinces
EDL	00:12:51,071	00:12:53,887	| serial-s02-e06 |	Casualties
EDL	00:12:53,887	00:12:56,191	| serial-s02-e06 |	Almost every measure we were losing
EDL	00:12:57,215	00:13:03,615	| serial-s02-e06 |	President Obama had ordered a review of the war when he came into office that year and by the end of March in a speech he declare
EDL	00:13:03,615	00:13:10,015	| serial-s02-e06 |	Play the situation quote increasingly perilous on quote we've been focused as a country and as a military on a
EDL	00:13:10,015	00:13:10,783	| serial-s02-e06 |	Iraq
EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:14,111	| serial-s02-e06 |	Now he said we be turning our attention back to Afghanistan
EDL	00:13:14,111	00:13:16,671	| serial-s02-e06 |	In the next year we more than double our troop numbers there
EDL	00:13:18,207	00:13:24,607	| serial-s02-e06 |	To meet The Surge the Army was scrambling for recruits issuing waivers to people who might not have qualified a few years earlier
EDL	00:13:24,607	00:13:31,007	| serial-s02-e06 |	And units like the first of the five-oh-first bows Battalion that had just done a 15-month tour in Iraq
EDL	00:13:31,007	00:13:36,895	| serial-s02-e06 |	We're coming home absorbing new recruits and turning around and heading back into war this time to Afghanistan
EDL	00:13:37,663	00:13:43,807	| serial-s02-e06 |	The day after Obama made his increasingly perilous speech those Battalion officially began its mission in Afghanistan
EDL	00:13:45,343	00:13:47,647	| serial-s02-e06 |	And that mission was counterinsurgency
EDL	00:13:47,647	00:13:48,927	| serial-s02-e06 |	Coin pusher
EDL	00:13:48,927	00:13:51,487	| serial-s02-e06 |	General David Petraeus had embraced the doctrine
EDL	00:13:51,999	00:13:55,583	| serial-s02-e06 |	In 2006 he co-wrote a new counterinsurgency manual for the Army
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:13:57,119	| serial-s02-e06 |	Explained
EDL	00:13:57,119	00:13:58,911	| serial-s02-e06 |	Koi means you're not just going to be fighting
EDL	00:13:59,423	00:14:03,263	| serial-s02-e06 |	Soldiers and Marines are expected to be Nation Builders as well as Warriors
EDL	00:14:06,591	00:14:09,663	| serial-s02-e06 |	Study of coin in Afghanistan was to be back the enemy
EDL	00:14:09,663	00:14:14,015	| serial-s02-e06 |	And at the same time train the Afghan Security Forces to take over the fight themselves
EDL	00:14:14,527	00:14:16,319	| serial-s02-e06 |	And very important
EDL	00:14:16,319	00:14:19,135	| serial-s02-e06 |	To build support among the people for the Afghan government
EDL	00:14:19,903	00:14:20,927	| serial-s02-e06 |	Try to win them over
EDL	00:14:20,927	00:14:23,487	| serial-s02-e06 |	Shore up the economy the infrastructure
EDL	00:14:23,487	00:14:25,279	| serial-s02-e06 |	So that they'll turn away from the insurgents

EDL	00:14:35,007	00:14:38,079	| serial-s02-e06 |	At one end are the people who are for the cause
EDL	00:14:38,079	00:14:40,127	| serial-s02-e06 |	Are the other other people who are against the cause
EDL	00:14:40,639	00:14:43,199	| serial-s02-e06 |	Everything in between was the quote uncommitted middle
EDL	00:14:43,711	00:14:46,271	| serial-s02-e06 |	Those for the people we wanted to pull over to our side
EDL	00:14:47,039	00:14:50,367	| serial-s02-e06 |	Basically the first few months all we are doing was
EDL	00:14:50,879	00:14:52,415	| serial-s02-e06 |	Making sure
EDL	00:14:52,415	00:14:54,975	| serial-s02-e06 |	Direct routes to other fobs were

EDL	00:14:56,767	00:14:58,815	| serial-s02-e06 |	And kind of showing

EDL	00:15:01,631	00:15:05,727	| serial-s02-e06 |	Making yourself known I guess to the townspeople for the first few months
EDL	00:15:05,727	00:15:07,263	| serial-s02-e06 |	That Zack borrow
EDL	00:15:07,263	00:15:11,103	| serial-s02-e06 |	Any uncertainty in his voice about what exactly they were doing
EDL	00:15:11,103	00:15:12,639	| serial-s02-e06 |	A lot of the soldiers felt that way
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:16,991	| serial-s02-e06 |	I got in contact with a lot of these guys through marks company page one by the way
EDL	00:15:16,991	00:15:17,759	| serial-s02-e06 |	Super helpful

EDL	00:15:21,087	00:15:23,903	| serial-s02-e06 |	They might backup Afghan police and submission
EDL	00:15:23,903	00:15:25,439	| serial-s02-e06 |	Are they help rebuild a hospital
EDL	00:15:25,951	00:15:27,999	| serial-s02-e06 |	But other stuff seems fuzzier
EDL	00:15:27,999	00:15:32,095	| serial-s02-e06 |	They're doing a lot of handing out bag of salt things of ghee
EDL	00:15:32,095	00:15:34,655	| serial-s02-e06 |	Bags of rice we would hand out crayons for
EDL	00:15:34,655	00:15:35,423	| serial-s02-e06 |	For the kids

EDL	00:16:34,815	00:16:39,423	| serial-s02-e06 |	About two months after Bose platoon deployed on May 13th 2009
EDL	00:16:39,423	00:16:41,471	| serial-s02-e06 |	Finally joined up with them at fob sharana
EDL	00:16:42,239	00:16:43,519	| serial-s02-e06 |	Chain cross brought him to the barracks
EDL	00:16:44,031	00:16:45,823	| serial-s02-e06 |	But I could definitely pick up on his disappointment
EDL	00:16:46,335	00:16:46,847	| serial-s02-e06 |	He realize
EDL	00:16:47,871	00:16:49,663	| serial-s02-e06 |	What we're doing where we're living Cafe

EDL	00:17:19,871	00:17:21,407	| serial-s02-e06 |	It was like a box spring was just the
EDL	00:17:22,431	00:17:23,967	| serial-s02-e06 |	Metal coils going across the
EDL	00:17:23,967	00:17:25,247	| serial-s02-e06 |	Wooden frame of the bed
EDL	00:17:25,759	00:17:26,783	| serial-s02-e06 |	Leslie on that
EDL	00:17:27,807	00:17:29,343	| serial-s02-e06 |	He was wearing a knives
EDL	00:17:29,343	00:17:30,623	| serial-s02-e06 |	She's big and not in the big Knife Guy
EDL	00:17:31,135	00:17:31,903	| serial-s02-e06 |	He slept
EDL	00:17:31,903	00:17:32,671	| serial-s02-e06 |	He hiked
EDL	00:17:32,671	00:17:33,439	| serial-s02-e06 |	Tomahawk
EDL	00:17:33,439	00:17:33,951	| serial-s02-e06 |	I slept with
EDL	00:17:34,975	00:17:35,999	| serial-s02-e06 |	When where's the tomahawk
EDL	00:17:36,511	00:17:37,791	| serial-s02-e06 |	Is challenge Jess holding it
EDL	00:17:38,559	00:17:42,143	| serial-s02-e06 |	I wanted to be a security contractor after
EDL	00:17:44,703	00:17:48,543	| serial-s02-e06 |	Special Forces
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:50,591	| serial-s02-e06 |	He didn't want that movie version of the military
EDL	00:17:54,431	00:17:56,735	| serial-s02-e06 |	Moment of adrenaline I wanted that moment
EDL	00:17:57,247	00:17:57,759	| serial-s02-e06 |	You know
EDL	00:18:00,319	00:18:01,343	| serial-s02-e06 |	Your contacts
EDL	00:18:01,855	00:18:03,647	| serial-s02-e06 |	I'm getting gun fights
EDL	00:18:11,583	00:18:12,095	| serial-s02-e06 |	Yeah
EDL	00:18:17,727	00:18:21,823	| serial-s02-e06 |	Less than a week after Bo arrived at his base his platoon did see action
EDL	00:18:22,335	00:18:24,895	| serial-s02-e06 |	Kona mountain plateau
EDL	00:18:24,895	00:18:31,039	| serial-s02-e06 |	And this incident and it's aftermath became the first solid building block in Buzz argument for triggering a dust one
EDL	00:18:31,551	00:18:33,343	| serial-s02-e06 |	They went on a mission to Amna
EDL	00:18:33,343	00:18:35,391	| serial-s02-e06 |	A district Center up in the mountains
EDL	00:18:35,391	00:18:40,767	| serial-s02-e06 |	I spoke to a bunch of the soldiers who were there and they all said it was the scariest thing that happened during their deployment
EDL	00:18:41,279	00:18:45,887	| serial-s02-e06 |	They've been caught up in the middle of the night to help out another Convoy that it hit an ID
EDL	00:18:45,887	00:18:50,239	| serial-s02-e06 |	That first time boy had been trying to help Afghan Security Forces up and Amna
EDL	00:18:50,239	00:18:52,031	| serial-s02-e06 |	Did recently come under Fire
EDL	00:18:52,031	00:18:57,151	| serial-s02-e06 |	But they had no idea up there and so now both Splatoon was going to recover the disabled vehicle
EDL	00:18:57,151	00:18:58,431	| serial-s02-e06 |	This was like our first
EDL	00:18:58,431	00:19:02,015	| serial-s02-e06 |	Mission like we're going somewhere we're doing something
EDL	00:19:02,015	00:19:03,295	| serial-s02-e06 |	Does Josh quarter
EDL	00:19:03,295	00:19:05,855	| serial-s02-e06 |	It was a mission that was supposed to take maybe eight hours
EDL	00:19:06,367	00:19:09,183	| serial-s02-e06 |	To get up to Amna that have to drive up to the plateau
EDL	00:19:09,183	00:19:11,231	| serial-s02-e06 |	Adjust the drive itself is heroin
EDL	00:19:11,743	00:19:13,791	| serial-s02-e06 |	The road isn't much bigger than a goat path
EDL	00:19:14,303	00:19:17,119	| serial-s02-e06 |	There's a steep drop off the side there's no room for error
EDL	00:19:17,631	00:19:21,471	| serial-s02-e06 |	And they're driving a huge trucks brand new mine-resistant trucks
EDL	00:19:21,983	00:19:23,775	| serial-s02-e06 |	Just a giant tank
EDL	00:19:25,311	00:19:30,431	| serial-s02-e06 |	Play the best description I could give but it was a really nice tank it had like leather seats and air conditioning
EDL	00:19:30,431	00:19:32,479	| serial-s02-e06 |	And since like all the
EDL	00:19:32,479	00:19:35,295	| serial-s02-e06 |	All the new stuff cuz we just literally got them
EDL	00:19:35,295	00:19:38,111	| serial-s02-e06 |	How does a dog sound like a goat path though
EDL	00:19:38,111	00:19:43,999	| serial-s02-e06 |	Well honestly a little bit better than you might expect we didn't know
EDL	00:19:43,999	00:19:48,607	| serial-s02-e06 |	Cuz we just we were brand-new to him cuz we were driving home these before that so
EDL	00:19:49,119	00:19:53,215	| serial-s02-e06 |	We're driving up this mountain and the truck right in front of me
EDL	00:19:53,727	00:19:56,031	| serial-s02-e06 |	On the last visit the second-to-last vehicle
EDL	00:19:56,543	00:19:57,823	| serial-s02-e06 |	Just explode
EDL	00:19:57,823	00:20:00,383	| serial-s02-e06 |	Austin Lanford was in the same truck as Josh
EDL	00:20:00,383	00:20:02,943	| serial-s02-e06 |	And then it just disappeared in the dust
EDL	00:20:02,943	00:20:07,807	| serial-s02-e06 |	Like I didn't see any more I was like did the truck just fall off the cliff like is it going like
EDL	00:20:07,807	00:20:08,831	| serial-s02-e06 |	We started
EDL	00:20:08,831	00:20:10,111	| serial-s02-e06 |	Trying to call
EDL	00:20:10,111	00:20:14,207	| serial-s02-e06 |	Them and be like hey are you okay are you there like where what's going on
EDL	00:20:14,719	00:20:17,535	| serial-s02-e06 |	And then like pieces of the truck fell on our truck
EDL	00:20:18,303	00:20:19,327	| serial-s02-e06 |	But they were okay
EDL	00:20:20,095	00:20:22,655	| serial-s02-e06 |	That's the beauty of these massive ungainly vehicles
EDL	00:20:23,167	00:20:24,447	| serial-s02-e06 |	The generic name is mrap
EDL	00:20:24,959	00:20:26,495	| serial-s02-e06 |	Mine-resistant ambush-protected
EDL	00:20:27,007	00:20:29,567	| serial-s02-e06 |	You can survive these IED explosion if you're inside
EDL	00:20:30,335	00:20:33,663	| serial-s02-e06 |	Now this mrap is severely damaged and axle is broken
EDL	00:20:34,175	00:20:36,991	| serial-s02-e06 |	Until they have to drag it the rest of the way up the mountain
EDL	00:20:36,991	00:20:41,087	| serial-s02-e06 |	Because you can't just ditch yet you never leave Army equipment in the battlefield if you can help it
EDL	00:20:41,087	00:20:41,855	| serial-s02-e06 |	Even if it's broken
EDL	00:20:42,623	00:20:45,951	| serial-s02-e06 |	An mrap has sophisticated systems in it you don't want the enemy to get those
EDL	00:20:46,463	00:20:47,999	| serial-s02-e06 |	Orgies the track for propaganda
EDL	00:20:48,767	00:20:51,839	| serial-s02-e06 |	Austin's driving the mrap behind the one that got blown up
EDL	00:20:52,351	00:20:58,495	| serial-s02-e06 |	They make everyone but him get out of his vehicle and it'll be ready to jump out in case your mrap goes over the cliff
EDL	00:20:59,263	00:21:01,311	| serial-s02-e06 |	Or if it disabled and rap falls back on you
EDL	00:21:02,335	00:21:02,847	| serial-s02-e06 |	Is terrified
EDL	00:21:03,615	00:21:04,639	| serial-s02-e06 |	But they managed it
EDL	00:21:04,639	00:21:06,943	| serial-s02-e06 |	If all the disabled and wrap the rest of the way up
EDL	00:21:06,943	00:21:07,967	| serial-s02-e06 |	District Center
EDL	00:21:08,479	00:21:12,575	| serial-s02-e06 |	What are the kind of Fort up on the plateau where some Afghan Security forces are stationed
EDL	00:21:13,087	00:21:15,647	| serial-s02-e06 |	They've been attacked by Taliban a couple of days earlier
EDL	00:21:16,416	00:21:17,184	| serial-s02-e06 |	Josh Gordon
EDL	00:21:17,184	00:21:21,280	| serial-s02-e06 |	This was like the first time that I saw something that I was like this place
EDL	00:21:22,304	00:21:23,328	| serial-s02-e06 |	It's f***** up
EDL	00:21:24,096	00:21:25,120	| serial-s02-e06 |	Bad
EDL	00:21:25,120	00:21:25,888	| serial-s02-e06 |	There's just
EDL	00:21:25,888	00:21:28,192	| serial-s02-e06 |	Bullet holes all through the walls there's
EDL	00:21:29,472	00:21:31,776	| serial-s02-e06 |	Kohl's from where RPGs hit
EDL	00:21:31,776	00:21:33,824	| serial-s02-e06 |	And like rockets were hitting them
EDL	00:21:33,824	00:21:36,128	| serial-s02-e06 |	Their towers were like worn down
EDL	00:21:36,128	00:21:40,480	| serial-s02-e06 |	Because they've been inspiring so many machine gun rounds that like the concrete was chipping away
EDL	00:21:41,248	00:21:43,296	| serial-s02-e06 |	And you just like oh my God this is
EDL	00:21:44,576	00:21:45,344	| serial-s02-e06 |	Serious
EDL	00:21:45,856	00:21:48,928	| serial-s02-e06 |	They came to rescue another vehicle and now they need rescuing
EDL	00:21:49,952	00:21:51,488	| serial-s02-e06 |	They spend the night in their trucks
EDL	00:21:51,488	00:21:54,304	| serial-s02-e06 |	They don't trust the Afghan Security Guys first of all
EDL	00:21:54,304	00:21:57,888	| serial-s02-e06 |	A second if a firefight starts they don't want to be trapped in a building
EDL	00:21:57,888	00:21:58,912	| serial-s02-e06 |	I want to be able to drive away
EDL	00:21:59,680	00:22:01,216	| serial-s02-e06 |	So they're nervous at first night
EDL	00:22:01,984	00:22:07,872	| serial-s02-e06 |	When they finally walk around they realize pretty quickly that the people up there done that don't want anything to do with them
EDL	00:22:08,384	00:22:09,664	| serial-s02-e06 |	Have no interest in interacting
EDL	00:22:10,432	00:22:11,200	| serial-s02-e06 |	It's tense
EDL	00:22:12,480	00:22:16,064	| serial-s02-e06 |	Pulling guard shifts in spending a ton of time crammed in their trucks
EDL	00:22:17,344	00:22:23,488	| serial-s02-e06 |	Yeah I can leave it to your imagination imagine guys with all full battle rattle on sitting in the extremely close
EDL	00:22:29,632	00:22:36,032	| serial-s02-e06 |	They're trying to sleep in contorted positions all your gear made it so you couldn't really fit in your seat if you were lucky enough to get
EDL	00:22:36,032	00:22:36,544	| serial-s02-e06 |	Odyssey
EDL	00:22:37,056	00:22:43,456	| serial-s02-e06 |	During the day they're so hot I'm bored so where they used in MRE box and caps from water bottles to play chess
EDL	00:22:43,456	00:22:49,856	| serial-s02-e06 |	Checkers undersupplied in every way it was just the most miserable place ever we
EDL	00:22:49,856	00:22:52,416	| serial-s02-e06 |	I had nothing and I I smoke so
EDL	00:22:52,416	00:22:58,816	| serial-s02-e06 |	We ran out of cigarettes we had like no chewing tobacco we had nothing they actually had to drop food and water
EDL	00:22:58,816	00:23:01,120	| serial-s02-e06 |	Water with airplanes because
EDL	00:23:01,120	00:23:02,912	| serial-s02-e06 |	They couldn't get to us
EDL	00:23:02,912	00:23:07,520	| serial-s02-e06 |	We didn't bring razors nobody had any changes of clothes
EDL	00:23:07,520	00:23:08,288	| serial-s02-e06 |	So
EDL	00:23:08,288	00:23:14,688	| serial-s02-e06 |	The first thing you said was we had no razors the last thing you would think about is like
EDL	00:23:14,688	00:23:21,088	| serial-s02-e06 |	Is that a thing it is a thing actually it's not okay
EDL	00:23:21,088	00:23:24,416	| serial-s02-e06 |	For the Army people to be growing a beard
EDL	00:23:24,416	00:23:30,816	| serial-s02-e06 |	You're aware all the time like yeah I got to shave I got to shave a goatee
EDL	00:23:30,816	00:23:32,096	| serial-s02-e06 |	Going to say like
EDL	00:23:32,096	00:23:38,496	| serial-s02-e06 |	Are they going to say I'm stupid because I didn't bring a razor or they can get pissed at us or thinking that like what's going to happen
EDL	00:23:38,496	00:23:44,896	| serial-s02-e06 |	Days are going by like nothing's happening the whole time they're trying to
EDL	00:23:44,896	00:23:49,248	| serial-s02-e06 |	Communicate with their commanders trying to figure out what they're supposed to do with these broken vehicles
EDL	00:23:50,784	00:23:53,088	| serial-s02-e06 |	Emacs in particular were valuable
EDL	00:23:53,088	00:23:58,464	| serial-s02-e06 |	Until they came along u.s. soldiers were getting killed and maimed by the hundreds because of IEDs in Iraq and Afghanistan
EDL	00:23:59,232	00:24:00,512	| serial-s02-e06 |	The arm wraps for the solution
EDL	00:24:01,024	00:24:02,816	| serial-s02-e06 |	I got you so much safer than a Humvee
EDL	00:24:03,584	00:24:05,632	| serial-s02-e06 |	By the time I got to Afghanistan
EDL	00:24:05,632	00:24:08,960	| serial-s02-e06 |	If soldiers were moving around on land they were pretty much in an mrap
EDL	00:24:09,472	00:24:11,520	| serial-s02-e06 |	But there weren't all that many of them yet
EDL	00:24:11,520	00:24:13,056	| serial-s02-e06 |	And they got blown up a lot
EDL	00:24:13,056	00:24:16,128	| serial-s02-e06 |	You could Frankenstein them back together if you had the right parts
EDL	00:24:16,128	00:24:21,248	| serial-s02-e06 |	But because they've been rushed into production by the dod and suppliers had scramble to get them to Market
EDL	00:24:21,248	00:24:24,832	| serial-s02-e06 |	Get something like four different models in circulation at any one time
EDL	00:24:25,344	00:24:27,392	| serial-s02-e06 |	All of which needed their own parts
EDL	00:24:27,392	00:24:28,928	| serial-s02-e06 |	You couldn't necessarily mix and match
EDL	00:24:29,440	00:24:33,280	| serial-s02-e06 |	So even a couple of blown-up ones on top of a plateau card value
EDL	00:24:34,560	00:24:37,888	| serial-s02-e06 |	Splatoon likely didn't know all the ins and outs of why they couldn't just
EDL	00:24:37,888	00:24:39,680	| serial-s02-e06 |	Explode the things on site and go home
EDL	00:24:40,192	00:24:45,568	| serial-s02-e06 |	All I knew was that they were waiting what seemed too preposterously long time for someone higher up to come up with a plan
EDL	00:24:46,336	00:24:51,456	| serial-s02-e06 |	Were they going to send a wrecker up there with a platoon going to have to drag these disabled monsters back down the mountain
EDL	00:24:51,968	00:24:54,784	| serial-s02-e06 |	They had a mechanic up there with them but he was stomped
EDL	00:24:54,784	00:24:57,600	| serial-s02-e06 |	I try to communicate the situation back to their Commanders
EDL	00:24:57,600	00:24:58,624	| serial-s02-e06 |	It's not going well
EDL	00:24:59,136	00:25:00,928	| serial-s02-e06 |	Sony we had the mechanic there
EDL	00:25:00,928	00:25:01,696	| serial-s02-e06 |	And they said
EDL	00:25:02,464	00:25:04,000	| serial-s02-e06 |	Send us a list of the parts
EDL	00:25:04,000	00:25:05,024	| serial-s02-e06 |	That you need to fix it
EDL	00:25:07,328	00:25:09,888	| serial-s02-e06 |	And so the mechanic gets on there and he says
EDL	00:25:09,888	00:25:10,656	| serial-s02-e06 |	Did
EDL	00:25:10,656	00:25:12,704	| serial-s02-e06 |	There's no it's not going to get fixed
EDL	00:25:12,704	00:25:13,728	| serial-s02-e06 |	The mechanics
EDL	00:25:13,728	00:25:15,008	| serial-s02-e06 |	Sergeant
EDL	00:25:15,008	00:25:17,568	| serial-s02-e06 |	Calling down the radio in town saying
EDL	00:25:17,568	00:25:18,336	| serial-s02-e06 |	The truck
EDL	00:25:18,336	00:25:19,360	| serial-s02-e06 |	Is blowing up
EDL	00:25:19,360	00:25:20,384	| serial-s02-e06 |	We can't fix it
EDL	00:25:21,152	00:25:22,176	| serial-s02-e06 |	And
EDL	00:25:22,176	00:25:23,456	| serial-s02-e06 |	And then command says why not
EDL	00:25:24,480	00:25:27,040	| serial-s02-e06 |	And in each other like what
EDL	00:25:27,552	00:25:29,344	| serial-s02-e06 |	We literally have the Jack the thing off
EDL	00:25:29,856	00:25:32,928	| serial-s02-e06 |	Try and change out a tire the mechanic sitting there
EDL	00:25:32,928	00:25:34,464	| serial-s02-e06 |	Amused look on his face
EDL	00:25:36,000	00:25:36,512	| serial-s02-e06 |	Going
EDL	00:25:37,024	00:25:38,816	| serial-s02-e06 |	You're not driving this thing off the mountain
EDL	00:25:39,328	00:25:40,608	| serial-s02-e06 |	It's been blown up
EDL	00:25:40,608	00:25:41,888	| serial-s02-e06 |	We
EDL	00:25:41,888	00:25:44,192	| serial-s02-e06 |	All felt like why are we up here
EDL	00:25:44,704	00:25:45,984	| serial-s02-e06 |	What is going on
EDL	00:25:45,984	00:25:49,568	| serial-s02-e06 |	They call the combat veterans the ones that have been there for
EDL	00:25:49,568	00:25:54,176	| serial-s02-e06 |	A lot longer in the Army we're all scratching their heads nobody understood why we were doing this
EDL	00:25:54,944	00:25:56,736	| serial-s02-e06 |	Eventually I'm about day 5
EDL	00:25:56,736	00:25:57,760	| serial-s02-e06 |	They told to head home
EDL	00:25:58,272	00:26:00,064	| serial-s02-e06 |	Another team will come and deal with the mrap
EDL	00:26:01,088	00:26:04,160	| serial-s02-e06 |	They're also instructed to take a different route back down the mountain
EDL	00:26:04,928	00:26:06,464	| serial-s02-e06 |	The pastor of Village
EDL	00:26:06,464	00:26:06,976	| serial-s02-e06 |	It's bad
EDL	00:26:07,488	00:26:10,048	| serial-s02-e06 |	Shane cross said it was military age men
EDL	00:26:10,048	00:26:10,816	| serial-s02-e06 |	No kids
EDL	00:26:10,816	00:26:13,120	| serial-s02-e06 |	I'll just stop and stare the Convoy
EDL	00:26:13,632	00:26:18,752	| serial-s02-e06 |	We passed some cattle by themselves and a burning like it was a smoldering campfire by self
EDL	00:26:19,520	00:26:24,128	| serial-s02-e06 |	I try not to sign also of welders unintended cattle unattended fire that was going
EDL	00:26:24,128	00:26:25,920	| serial-s02-e06 |	As in people booked and got out of there
EDL	00:26:26,432	00:26:29,248	| serial-s02-e06 |	I have this terrible feeling that we are about to get
EDL	00:26:29,248	00:26:31,808	| serial-s02-e06 |	Blown up or shot at Austin Lanford
EDL	00:26:32,320	00:26:34,624	| serial-s02-e06 |	Suddenly there's an IED explosion
EDL	00:26:34,624	00:26:36,672	| serial-s02-e06 |	Another truck hit and disabled
EDL	00:26:36,672	00:26:38,464	| serial-s02-e06 |	Well once again
EDL	00:26:38,464	00:26:39,744	| serial-s02-e06 |	That truck gets blown up
EDL	00:26:39,744	00:26:40,512	| serial-s02-e06 |	Right in front of me
EDL	00:26:41,280	00:26:42,816	| serial-s02-e06 |	We are like all right
EDL	00:26:42,816	00:26:45,120	| serial-s02-e06 |	Well we got to go assess the situation
EDL	00:26:45,632	00:26:48,704	| serial-s02-e06 |	So we get out an EOD guy gets out to
EDL	00:26:48,704	00:26:51,264	| serial-s02-e06 |	Explosive Ordnance disposal
EDL	00:26:51,264	00:26:51,776	| serial-s02-e06 |	Edamame
EDL	00:26:53,056	00:26:53,824	| serial-s02-e06 |	Is Josh
EDL	00:26:53,824	00:26:56,896	| serial-s02-e06 |	And so that you'll die without their sleeping with his little Minesweeper
EDL	00:26:56,896	00:26:58,432	| serial-s02-e06 |	And he comes across something
EDL	00:26:58,432	00:26:59,456	| serial-s02-e06 |	And
EDL	00:26:59,456	00:27:00,480	| serial-s02-e06 |	He picks it up
EDL	00:27:02,016	00:27:03,296	| serial-s02-e06 |	He starts pulling on it
EDL	00:27:03,296	00:27:04,064	| serial-s02-e06 |	And it's like
EDL	00:27:04,832	00:27:05,600	| serial-s02-e06 |	It's like a
EDL	00:27:06,368	00:27:07,392	| serial-s02-e06 |	A wire
EDL	00:27:07,392	00:27:10,720	| serial-s02-e06 |	I got buried wire and so you picking it up and sees it's like
EDL	00:27:10,720	00:27:12,000	| serial-s02-e06 |	String tied into the woods
EDL	00:27:12,512	00:27:15,584	| serial-s02-e06 |	And then he was going to drop it and goes oh s***
EDL	00:27:15,584	00:27:17,120	| serial-s02-e06 |	My first reaction was
EDL	00:27:17,888	00:27:20,192	| serial-s02-e06 |	That I cocked my machine gun
EDL	00:27:20,192	00:27:22,752	| serial-s02-e06 |	And I said out loud
EDL	00:27:22,752	00:27:24,288	| serial-s02-e06 |	I said let's do this
EDL	00:27:27,104	00:27:31,456	| serial-s02-e06 |	Great cliche I understand that but that was exactly what I did
EDL	00:27:31,456	00:27:32,992	| serial-s02-e06 |	That's exactly what I did I'm like
EDL	00:27:32,992	00:27:34,272	| serial-s02-e06 |	This is going down
EDL	00:27:34,272	00:27:37,088	| serial-s02-e06 |	There's not any way that we're not about to get attacked
EDL	00:27:37,600	00:27:38,880	| serial-s02-e06 |	It was so obvious
EDL	00:27:38,880	00:27:40,928	| serial-s02-e06 |	Okay let's do this
EDL	00:27:42,464	00:27:45,280	| serial-s02-e06 |	An RPG game like flying by us and
EDL	00:27:45,792	00:27:52,192	| serial-s02-e06 |	On the ground in front of us and right then like it scared the crap out of me because then
EDL	00:27:52,192	00:27:53,984	| serial-s02-e06 |	Gun started firing like
EDL	00:27:53,984	00:27:59,360	| serial-s02-e06 |	Immediately I get up and I freaking started sprinting towards the truck trying to find cover
EDL	00:27:59,872	00:28:05,760	| serial-s02-e06 |	This is what's called a complex attack they've been waiting for the Convoy to pass by this way
EDL	00:28:05,760	00:28:08,576	| serial-s02-e06 |	Now it's a mess of gunfire and explosions
EDL	00:28:08,576	00:28:11,648	| serial-s02-e06 |	Josh is a gunner so he's up in the chart of his truck
EDL	00:28:11,648	00:28:13,440	| serial-s02-e06 |	People below or calling out targets
EDL	00:28:13,440	00:28:17,280	| serial-s02-e06 |	13286
EDL	00:28:17,280	00:28:19,328	| serial-s02-e06 |	The attack is coming from everywhere
EDL	00:28:19,328	00:28:25,216	| serial-s02-e06 |	My platoon Sergeant gets in the truck and punching me on my ass and telling me to keep firing
EDL	00:28:25,728	00:28:27,264	| serial-s02-e06 |	So
EDL	00:28:27,264	00:28:33,664	| serial-s02-e06 |	You know I went through like 400 rounds initially and I keep firing keep firing keep firing and I don't I don't let up
EDL	00:28:33,664	00:28:36,736	| serial-s02-e06 |	Who was also a gunner but he wasn't in the turd of his truck
EDL	00:28:36,736	00:28:38,272	| serial-s02-e06 |	Zac farro was up there
EDL	00:28:38,272	00:28:43,136	| serial-s02-e06 |	Immediately Zack's gun jammed so bohan's his weapon up all the saw
EDL	00:28:43,136	00:28:44,160	| serial-s02-e06 |	Zach starts firing
EDL	00:28:51,072	00:28:53,120	| serial-s02-e06 |	Another guy no hands up his saw
EDL	00:28:53,120	00:28:54,912	| serial-s02-e06 |	The third weapon works
EDL	00:28:55,424	00:29:01,568	| serial-s02-e06 |	Convoy needs to get out of this Ravine they're trapped in but now they've got this disabled truck which they need to tow out
EDL	00:29:02,336	00:29:07,968	| serial-s02-e06 |	So the platoon leader JP Billings jumps out of his truck to hook up a cable Shane was the gunner in that truck
EDL	00:29:08,736	00:29:10,272	| serial-s02-e06 |	He is he is y'all. Cover me
EDL	00:29:10,272	00:29:11,808	| serial-s02-e06 |	NEOS Adorn jumps out
EDL	00:29:11,808	00:29:12,320	| serial-s02-e06 |	It runs often
EDL	00:29:13,344	00:29:17,184	| serial-s02-e06 |	Macros are there really big heart also I can't see but here and
EDL	00:29:18,208	00:29:20,768	| serial-s02-e06 |	And here kid run off the truck behind us
EDL	00:29:20,768	00:29:22,816	| serial-s02-e06 |	Grab the cable hook to the hookah bar truck
EDL	00:29:22,816	00:29:23,584	| serial-s02-e06 |	And then rang
EDL	00:29:23,584	00:29:24,352	| serial-s02-e06 |	Climb back inside
EDL	00:29:25,632	00:29:28,192	| serial-s02-e06 |	I could see him if he would hit mud all over him
EDL	00:29:28,960	00:29:32,800	| serial-s02-e06 |	House Plaza mud from like Venom around hitting the dirt and slinging mud on to him
EDL	00:29:33,312	00:29:34,848	| serial-s02-e06 |	Oh my God
EDL	00:29:34,848	00:29:39,200	| serial-s02-e06 |	The inside he's TLC on go go for a hour drive
EDL	00:29:39,968	00:29:43,296	| serial-s02-e06 |	He yells office in Truckee says don't you ever let me do something like that again
EDL	00:29:44,576	00:29:46,112	| serial-s02-e06 |	It's our desire floor is it
EDL	00:29:46,112	00:29:46,624	| serial-s02-e06 |	And a cable snap
EDL	00:29:47,648	00:29:51,232	| serial-s02-e06 |	Intemperance calls out cover made out of vehicle again
EDL	00:29:52,000	00:29:53,792	| serial-s02-e06 |	Twice Billings goes out there
EDL	00:29:53,792	00:29:55,328	| serial-s02-e06 |	Second time to Cable holds
EDL	00:29:55,328	00:29:55,840	| serial-s02-e06 |	They move out
EDL	00:29:56,352	00:29:57,376	| serial-s02-e06 |	Air support Moves In
EDL	00:29:57,888	00:30:00,960	| serial-s02-e06 |	Incredibly no one from their unit got hurt during the firefight
EDL	00:30:01,728	00:30:05,824	| serial-s02-e06 |	One soldier who was there said that by the end he heard that up to 10 Taliban have been killed
EDL	00:30:06,848	00:30:09,664	| serial-s02-e06 |	Splatoon eventually limbs home back to the fob
EDL	00:30:09,664	00:30:12,224	| serial-s02-e06 |	The Emirates are all banged up flat tires in Vallejo
EDL	00:30:14,016	00:30:18,368	| serial-s02-e06 |	Here's my phone remembers about what happened when they pulled back into the wire after Amna
EDL	00:30:19,136	00:30:20,672	| serial-s02-e06 |	We get to the wire entrance
EDL	00:30:21,440	00:30:24,256	| serial-s02-e06 |	Commander standing there waiting for us
EDL	00:30:30,400	00:30:31,936	| serial-s02-e06 |	The grounds
EDL	00:30:31,936	00:30:38,336	| serial-s02-e06 |	Battalion Commander said something.
EDL	00:30:38,336	00:30:44,736	| serial-s02-e06 |	Did a good job out there I'm glad to see you back at congratulations anyone out there and proud of you
EDL	00:30:44,736	00:30:51,136	| serial-s02-e06 |	How are you feeling how's everything going he didn't say anything like that his concern was not anywhere close to
EDL	00:30:51,136	00:30:56,256	| serial-s02-e06 |	Hey how's the men's well-being doing how are my men were out there in a war zone
EDL	00:30:56,256	00:30:57,792	| serial-s02-e06 |	Didn't say anything like that
EDL	00:31:01,632	00:31:07,264	| serial-s02-e06 |	It's the ground in the first thing that comes out of our Battalion Commander whose mouth is what you couldn't shave
EDL	00:31:09,568	00:31:12,384	| serial-s02-e06 |	Who's usually pretty measure the way he talks to Mark in the phone calls
EDL	00:31:12,896	00:31:17,248	| serial-s02-e06 |	But whenever he talks about this incident whenever you talked at all about the Battalion Commander
EDL	00:31:17,248	00:31:18,784	| serial-s02-e06 |	Lieutenant Colonel Clint Baker
EDL	00:31:18,784	00:31:20,576	| serial-s02-e06 |	Spoken barely tapped out his anger
EDL	00:31:21,088	00:31:24,672	| serial-s02-e06 |	He goes on and on about the Shaving comment which he heard about second hand
EDL	00:31:25,184	00:31:26,976	| serial-s02-e06 |	Are you serious
EDL	00:31:28,000	00:31:34,400	| serial-s02-e06 |	We get back here and now we have to go shave
EDL	00:31:34,400	00:31:37,984	| serial-s02-e06 |	6 days movie
EDL	00:31:38,496	00:31:39,776	| serial-s02-e06 |	Because some jackass
EDL	00:31:46,944	00:31:49,760	| serial-s02-e06 |	Dave
EDL	00:31:50,528	00:31:53,344	| serial-s02-e06 |	Also but they shook it off
EDL	00:31:53,856	00:31:55,904	| serial-s02-e06 |	And then I allow guys carry to put a
EDL	00:31:56,672	00:32:00,512	| serial-s02-e06 |	I like a disposable razor and just stuck it on their kit on their chest a thing
EDL	00:32:02,048	00:32:02,816	| serial-s02-e06 |	That's like a
EDL	00:32:03,328	00:32:05,120	| serial-s02-e06 |	Nothing where I can shave anytime I need to
EDL	00:32:05,632	00:32:06,912	| serial-s02-e06 |	So is like a little
EDL	00:32:06,912	00:32:07,424	| serial-s02-e06 |	Yeah
EDL	00:32:08,448	00:32:11,776	| serial-s02-e06 |	I was noticing the same thing as the other guys were
EDL	00:32:11,776	00:32:13,568	| serial-s02-e06 |	He's getting mad at the same things they were
EDL	00:32:14,336	00:32:17,152	| serial-s02-e06 |	Other guys might b**** about something and then flush it away
EDL	00:32:17,664	00:32:19,712	| serial-s02-e06 |	These things were sticking
EDL	00:32:19,712	00:32:23,040	| serial-s02-e06 |	Attaching two other incidents he'd already lodged in his memory
EDL	00:32:23,040	00:32:24,064	| serial-s02-e06 |	Starting in Alaska
EDL	00:32:24,576	00:32:27,136	| serial-s02-e06 |	Like pieces of a puzzle only he was putting together
EDL	00:32:28,160	00:32:31,488	| serial-s02-e06 |	In the phone calls Mark comes back again and again to Amna
EDL	00:32:31,488	00:32:34,304	| serial-s02-e06 |	Trying to fit correctly into bows overall argument
EDL	00:32:34,304	00:32:37,120	| serial-s02-e06 |	When you say the problem is you're talking specifically about
EDL	00:32:37,888	00:32:39,424	| serial-s02-e06 |	Putting people at risk
EDL	00:32:39,936	00:32:40,704	| serial-s02-e06 |	4
EDL	00:32:41,472	00:32:42,752	| serial-s02-e06 |	Things like retrieving
EDL	00:32:43,264	00:32:46,592	| serial-s02-e06 |	Broken equipment or are you talking about
EDL	00:32:47,104	00:32:49,408	| serial-s02-e06 |	Cuz I don't know I'm not sure
EDL	00:32:49,408	00:32:49,920	| serial-s02-e06 |	Yeah
EDL	00:32:56,064	00:33:01,440	| serial-s02-e06 |	The most obvious complaint a soldier might have about Amna would be exactly what Mark is getting at
EDL	00:33:01,952	00:33:07,328	| serial-s02-e06 |	But it sounds like a wrongheaded Dangerous Mission and it's just luck that no one from his platoon. Hurt or killed
EDL	00:33:08,096	00:33:10,656	| serial-s02-e06 |	What would makes both Furious about the sauna incident
EDL	00:33:10,656	00:33:14,496	| serial-s02-e06 |	Wasn't so much the crappy communication between the mechanics of the Commanders
EDL	00:33:14,496	00:33:16,544	| serial-s02-e06 |	Or the being stranded for days
EDL	00:33:16,544	00:33:21,408	| serial-s02-e06 |	Or their unfortunate route home which clearly the enemy had had ample time to plan for
EDL	00:33:21,920	00:33:22,944	| serial-s02-e06 |	More than all that
EDL	00:33:23,456	00:33:24,480	| serial-s02-e06 |	It was a shaving thing
EDL	00:33:25,504	00:33:27,808	| serial-s02-e06 |	Yes and it was scary
EDL	00:33:27,808	00:33:31,904	| serial-s02-e06 |	When they come home the Battalion Commander doesn't acknowledge the scariness
EDL	00:33:32,416	00:33:36,768	| serial-s02-e06 |	Moreover to bow at least he seems unconcerned about the welfare of his men
EDL	00:33:36,768	00:33:39,328	| serial-s02-e06 |	That's what starts to feel scary
EDL	00:33:39,328	00:33:40,864	| serial-s02-e06 |	Maybe they're not in safe hands
EDL	00:33:42,400	00:33:44,448	| serial-s02-e06 |	An interesting Lee confusingly
EDL	00:33:44,448	00:33:47,520	| serial-s02-e06 |	But was also complaining at the time that they were playing it Tuesday
EDL	00:33:48,544	00:33:54,176	| serial-s02-e06 |	It was miserable but it was all so exciting especially for the new guys in the platoon who hadn't been in a wreck before
EDL	00:33:54,688	00:33:57,504	| serial-s02-e06 |	Something happened and they survived and bonded over it
EDL	00:33:58,272	00:33:59,552	| serial-s02-e06 |	Bodensteiner Sharon that
EDL	00:34:00,320	00:34:01,600	| serial-s02-e06 |	He hadn't fired his weapon
EDL	00:34:02,112	00:34:05,696	| serial-s02-e06 |	In an email to a friend who sent the day they got back from Mom. He wrote quote
EDL	00:34:05,696	00:34:07,232	| serial-s02-e06 |	I sat there and watched
EDL	00:34:07,232	00:34:13,376	| serial-s02-e06 |	There was nothing else I was allowed to do unquote he added but Afghanistan mountains are really beautiful
EDL	00:34:19,520	00:34:23,360	| serial-s02-e06 |	Josh Carter says he noticed something shift in bow after they got back from Moana
EDL	00:34:23,872	00:34:24,640	| serial-s02-e06 |	The tone change
EDL	00:34:25,408	00:34:28,480	| serial-s02-e06 |	I was in the truck with him a few of the missions after that
EDL	00:34:28,992	00:34:29,504	| serial-s02-e06 |	And
EDL	00:34:30,528	00:34:33,344	| serial-s02-e06 |	She was talking to one of the guys down below on the truck
EDL	00:34:34,368	00:34:39,744	| serial-s02-e06 |	And if they were to everybody's talking about the firefight and everything like that
EDL	00:34:39,744	00:34:40,768	| serial-s02-e06 |	Cuz that's like
EDL	00:34:40,768	00:34:46,144	| serial-s02-e06 |	The most significant thing that happened on deployment so of course everybody talks about it over and over again
EDL	00:34:48,192	00:34:48,960	| serial-s02-e06 |	And he
EDL	00:34:49,984	00:34:51,520	| serial-s02-e06 |	During the conversation
EDL	00:34:52,544	00:34:53,056	| serial-s02-e06 |	Said
EDL	00:34:53,824	00:34:55,360	| serial-s02-e06 |	All that stuff is just Bullshit
EDL	00:34:56,384	00:34:57,408	| serial-s02-e06 |	And like
EDL	00:34:58,432	00:34:59,968	| serial-s02-e06 |	What what's b******* about it
EDL	00:35:00,480	00:35:01,248	| serial-s02-e06 |	He's like
EDL	00:35:01,760	00:35:03,808	| serial-s02-e06 |	We should have gone out there and we should
EDL	00:35:04,320	00:35:05,856	| serial-s02-e06 |	Killed every single one of those guys
EDL	00:35:07,648	00:35:12,000	| serial-s02-e06 |	We shouldn't we should like he thought we were being cowards cuz we had no trucks and
EDL	00:35:12,512	00:35:15,584	| serial-s02-e06 |	We didn't go out there and do that and he's like well we go to these villages
EDL	00:35:15,584	00:35:17,120	| serial-s02-e06 |	And we hand out these
EDL	00:35:18,144	00:35:19,936	| serial-s02-e06 |	Blankets and all the stuff
EDL	00:35:19,936	00:35:21,984	| serial-s02-e06 |	We shouldn't be doing that we should be out there
EDL	00:35:22,496	00:35:25,312	| serial-s02-e06 |	Just killing these people who are shooting at us
EDL	00:35:25,312	00:35:26,848	| serial-s02-e06 |	Chinese people who are
EDL	00:35:27,360	00:35:30,688	| serial-s02-e06 |	Just don't care about Afghan people showing the bad guys
EDL	00:35:31,200	00:35:33,248	| serial-s02-e06 |	Then enemy he says at that point he's like
EDL	00:35:34,784	00:35:37,600	| serial-s02-e06 |	Our whole entire the whole entire Army is just
EDL	00:35:37,600	00:35:38,112	| serial-s02-e06 |	Pussies
EDL	00:35:38,880	00:35:39,904	| serial-s02-e06 |	Everyone's a pussy
EDL	00:35:39,904	00:35:41,696	| serial-s02-e06 |	Because we don't go out there and we don't
EDL	00:35:42,976	00:35:44,256	| serial-s02-e06 |	Kill the enemy
EDL	00:35:44,256	00:35:45,536	| serial-s02-e06 |	Like we're supposed to
EDL	00:35:46,560	00:35:49,376	| serial-s02-e06 |	I don't know if Josh's quotes are precisely accurate
EDL	00:35:49,376	00:35:51,936	| serial-s02-e06 |	But other guys have told me both sad versions of this sentiment
EDL	00:35:52,960	00:35:55,008	| serial-s02-e06 |	And it's true and understandable
EDL	00:35:55,008	00:35:58,592	| serial-s02-e06 |	The botox to Mark about a bunch of different feelings he had about the war
EDL	00:35:59,104	00:36:00,384	| serial-s02-e06 |	Wanting more action
EDL	00:36:00,384	00:36:03,200	| serial-s02-e06 |	But also feeling that they should be doing coin better
EDL	00:36:03,200	00:36:07,552	| serial-s02-e06 |	Should be working harder to engage with local Afghans taking every opportunity to talk to them
EDL	00:36:08,064	00:36:10,880	| serial-s02-e06 |	And he says he felt like and then a lot of guys felt like
EDL	00:36:11,392	00:36:13,440	| serial-s02-e06 |	Whatever it is we're doing over here
EDL	00:36:13,440	00:36:14,976	| serial-s02-e06 |	It's not helping regular Afghan
EDL	00:36:16,000	00:36:17,280	| serial-s02-e06 |	Everybody was saying
EDL	00:36:30,848	00:36:31,872	| serial-s02-e06 |	What we're doing here
EDL	00:36:35,200	00:36:36,992	| serial-s02-e06 |	All right
EDL	00:36:37,504	00:36:40,576	| serial-s02-e06 |	So I want to take a minute here just to stare at that notion
EDL	00:36:40,576	00:36:42,112	| serial-s02-e06 |	What is b*******
EDL	00:36:42,624	00:36:49,024	| serial-s02-e06 |	Respirometer for that is Jason Dempsey PhD he was in office
EDL	00:36:49,024	00:36:51,072	| serial-s02-e06 |	Easter at the Battalion and Brigade level
EDL	00:36:51,072	00:36:53,120	| serial-s02-e06 |	Any detours in both Iraq and Afghanistan
EDL	00:36:53,888	00:36:54,912	| serial-s02-e06 |	It was Irwin bullet missing
EDL	00:36:55,680	00:36:59,520	| serial-s02-e06 |	It was back in 2012 as a combat advisor to the Afghans
EDL	00:36:59,520	00:37:02,080	| serial-s02-e06 |	And then again in 2014 to see how that was going
EDL	00:37:02,848	00:37:04,384	| serial-s02-e06 |	So he's got a lot of perspective
EDL	00:37:04,896	00:37:07,712	| serial-s02-e06 |	I asked Jason was the mission b*******
EDL	00:37:09,504	00:37:15,904	| serial-s02-e06 |	The problem he said is that the Army said it was doing coin it planned its Mission and operations in Iraq and Afghanistan
EDL	00:37:15,904	00:37:17,440	| serial-s02-e06 |	As if it were doing coin
EDL	00:37:17,952	00:37:20,000	| serial-s02-e06 |	But it never fully committed to coin
EDL	00:37:21,024	00:37:24,608	| serial-s02-e06 |	Because we're going to work you've got to commit to a place for decades right
EDL	00:37:24,608	00:37:26,144	| serial-s02-e06 |	Probably 30-40 years
EDL	00:37:27,168	00:37:29,216	| serial-s02-e06 |	If you want to drive political change
EDL	00:37:29,216	00:37:33,056	| serial-s02-e06 |	You have to have people out there long enough to understand the politics of the place they're in
EDL	00:37:34,080	00:37:38,432	| serial-s02-e06 |	Jason said you can't rotate units in and out in 7 or 12 month increments
EDL	00:37:38,432	00:37:38,944	| serial-s02-e06 |	Unexpected
EDL	00:37:39,968	00:37:42,784	| serial-s02-e06 |	Are you really effective from
EDL	00:37:42,784	00:37:43,808	| serial-s02-e06 |	13259
EDL	00:37:44,832	00:37:48,672	| serial-s02-e06 |	Cuz you're just figuring it out but I prefer your rocking and rolling
EDL	00:37:48,672	00:37:50,208	| serial-s02-e06 |	You're really doing great things for 6
EDL	00:37:51,488	00:37:53,792	| serial-s02-e06 |	And then you're transitioning out for those last three months
EDL	00:37:54,304	00:37:55,584	| serial-s02-e06 |	And then whether or not
EDL	00:37:55,584	00:37:59,936	| serial-s02-e06 |	The lessons momentum you learned in those six months get carried on you might as well roll a dice
EDL	00:37:59,936	00:38:00,704	| serial-s02-e06 |	Really
EDL	00:38:00,704	00:38:02,496	| serial-s02-e06 |	I don't know that cuz another unit coming in
EDL	00:38:03,776	00:38:08,896	| serial-s02-e06 |	Play Mary not share your vision even if they do share your vision they spend the first three months confused themselves
EDL	00:38:09,408	00:38:13,248	| serial-s02-e06 |	The Army didn't really train units like bows for coin in Afghanistan
EDL	00:38:13,248	00:38:14,528	| serial-s02-e06 |	Jason said they couldn't
EDL	00:38:14,528	00:38:15,296	| serial-s02-e06 |	Not the time allowed
EDL	00:38:16,320	00:38:20,672	| serial-s02-e06 |	He said he and other soldiers were basically told if you make their lives better they'll support you
EDL	00:38:21,440	00:38:26,560	| serial-s02-e06 |	Sou nicastro Afghanistan but it doesn't really understand the society there who's who
EDL	00:38:26,560	00:38:30,400	| serial-s02-e06 |	What the power dynamics are the tribes the families the alliance's the ethnic groups
EDL	00:38:31,168	00:38:35,264	| serial-s02-e06 |	The whole root system of a country that's pretty much been at War on and off for 30 years
EDL	00:38:35,776	00:38:39,616	| serial-s02-e06 |	As you pump down and try to convey your message of Goodwill on the ground
EDL	00:38:39,616	00:38:40,640	| serial-s02-e06 |	It doesn't translate very well
EDL	00:38:41,152	00:38:42,432	| serial-s02-e06 |	If you're young
EDL	00:38:42,432	00:38:46,528	| serial-s02-e06 |	American freight company Commander or platoon leader you walk into
EDL	00:38:46,528	00:38:49,088	| serial-s02-e06 |	Your typical Afghan Village Circa 2009
EDL	00:38:49,088	00:38:50,624	| serial-s02-e06 |	And an elder approaches
EDL	00:38:52,416	00:38:53,440	| serial-s02-e06 |	What's up you guys doing here
EDL	00:38:54,464	00:38:56,512	| serial-s02-e06 |	Your average young lieutenant or captain
EDL	00:38:57,792	00:38:59,072	| serial-s02-e06 |	Where to make your life better
EDL	00:39:00,352	00:39:03,680	| serial-s02-e06 |	We want to build some roads you want to connect to the central government we want
EDL	00:39:04,192	00:39:07,776	| serial-s02-e06 |	And we just want to improve your life make sure your kids go to school
EDL	00:39:10,080	00:39:11,360	| serial-s02-e06 |	Camille
EDL	00:39:11,872	00:39:14,432	| serial-s02-e06 |	That is mine is like horseshit the Stooges lion
EDL	00:39:14,432	00:39:15,200	| serial-s02-e06 |	Jewish teeth
EDL	00:39:15,200	00:39:18,016	| serial-s02-e06 |	Who the f*** comes to Afghanistan to make my life better
EDL	00:39:18,784	00:39:20,576	| serial-s02-e06 |	It's an absurd notion
EDL	00:39:20,576	00:39:21,344	| serial-s02-e06 |	In the mind of this app
EDL	00:39:22,112	00:39:22,880	| serial-s02-e06 |	That
EDL	00:39:22,880	00:39:26,208	| serial-s02-e06 |	United States of America would send people around the world just a bill
EDL	00:39:26,208	00:39:26,976	| serial-s02-e06 |	Rhodes
EDL	00:39:26,976	00:39:27,744	| serial-s02-e06 |	Look like
EDL	00:39:28,768	00:39:33,376	| serial-s02-e06 |	Today at Kansas okay that's cool thanks guys going to meet you wash the way goes back to the Village
EDL	00:39:34,400	00:39:35,680	| serial-s02-e06 |	Say you should hear it
EDL	00:39:35,680	00:39:36,704	| serial-s02-e06 |	What does marigold mean
EDL	00:39:37,984	00:39:39,776	| serial-s02-e06 |	Glad to hear
EDL	00:39:40,288	00:39:42,336	| serial-s02-e06 |	In their communion sitting there and then
EDL	00:39:42,336	00:39:44,128	| serial-s02-e06 |	The hair cuz I hate Islam
EDL	00:39:45,664	00:39:47,968	| serial-s02-e06 |	Among those two messages for average Afghan
EDL	00:39:48,992	00:39:52,832	| serial-s02-e06 |	The idea that were there cuz I hate Islam is much more rational
EDL	00:39:52,832	00:39:55,392	| serial-s02-e06 |	Write for them it's just they're more prone to believe it
EDL	00:39:55,904	00:39:57,696	| serial-s02-e06 |	When we say we're here
EDL	00:39:58,720	00:40:00,768	| serial-s02-e06 |	We re saying to them
EDL	00:40:00,768	00:40:02,304	| serial-s02-e06 |	Without young Lieutenant going to say
EDL	00:40:03,584	00:40:07,680	| serial-s02-e06 |	We want to we want to get you on our side so that we together can
EDL	00:40:08,192	00:40:09,216	| serial-s02-e06 |	Get rid of
EDL	00:40:09,216	00:40:12,288	| serial-s02-e06 |	The Taliban in foreign fighters in the arms that are coming in
EDL	00:40:12,288	00:40:18,688	| serial-s02-e06 |	Or they just saying to know we just want to give you rice and gold Road
EDL	00:40:18,688	00:40:21,760	| serial-s02-e06 |	It's in our interest for you guys to be
EDL	00:40:23,296	00:40:24,320	| serial-s02-e06 |	Supporting our mission
EDL	00:40:24,832	00:40:26,112	| serial-s02-e06 |	It's a valid point
EDL	00:40:26,112	00:40:28,672	| serial-s02-e06 |	And a lot of times that would get lost though at the
EDL	00:40:29,184	00:40:29,952	| serial-s02-e06 |	Beijing level
EDL	00:40:30,720	00:40:36,864	| serial-s02-e06 |	Loss of the platoon level because if the soldiers don't know who's supporting them who's supporting the Taliban and why
EDL	00:40:37,632	00:40:39,680	| serial-s02-e06 |	Then of course the messaging is pretty crude
EDL	00:40:39,680	00:40:46,080	| serial-s02-e06 |	Is we never really understood all these overlapping power structures and incentives and relationships that
EDL	00:40:46,080	00:40:46,848	| serial-s02-e06 |	Pre-existed us
EDL	00:40:47,872	00:40:50,944	| serial-s02-e06 |	We never one that wanted to understand what the Afghan for actually
EDL	00:40:50,944	00:40:51,712	| serial-s02-e06 |	Doing
EDL	00:40:51,712	00:40:55,040	| serial-s02-e06 |	We just want to go to walk in and say Here's a template for how you should run an army
EDL	00:40:55,552	00:40:56,064	| serial-s02-e06 |	Go for it
EDL	00:40:56,576	00:41:02,976	| serial-s02-e06 |	Getting hands dirty roses show you how we do
EDL	00:41:02,976	00:41:05,280	| serial-s02-e06 |	Great way to show you how much we do
EDL	00:41:05,280	00:41:07,072	| serial-s02-e06 |	And then if you don't end up doing that
EDL	00:41:07,072	00:41:10,912	| serial-s02-e06 |	It must not be because of Any structural issues underneath must be because you just don't care
EDL	00:41:11,680	00:41:17,824	| serial-s02-e06 |	And that's probably the most infuriating thing about all this is we have an entire generation of army folks
EDL	00:41:17,824	00:41:19,616	| serial-s02-e06 |	Marines Etc have gone through
EDL	00:41:20,640	00:41:22,432	| serial-s02-e06 |	And at the end of a deployment of
EDL	00:41:23,712	00:41:24,992	| serial-s02-e06 |	The Afghans just don't care about the
EDL	00:41:24,992	00:41:25,504	| serial-s02-e06 |	This fight as much as
EDL	00:41:26,784	00:41:28,576	| serial-s02-e06 |	Which is quite possibly the most
EDL	00:41:28,576	00:41:29,856	| serial-s02-e06 |	Preposterous thing you can say
EDL	00:41:30,624	00:41:31,136	| serial-s02-e06 |	The warning
EDL	00:41:31,648	00:41:32,928	| serial-s02-e06 |	They don't care about it
EDL	00:41:32,928	00:41:33,440	| serial-s02-e06 |	As much as we
EDL	00:41:34,464	00:41:35,232	| serial-s02-e06 |	Ground is
EDL	00:41:36,256	00:41:37,792	| serial-s02-e06 |	They're fighting their struggle
EDL	00:41:39,072	00:41:40,352	| serial-s02-e06 |	We're fighting hours
EDL	00:41:40,864	00:41:43,680	| serial-s02-e06 |	And we never bothered it's okay to these two things actually overlap
EDL	00:41:45,216	00:41:50,336	| serial-s02-e06 |	In November of 2009 then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton got a memo to the same effect
EDL	00:41:51,104	00:41:54,175	| serial-s02-e06 |	It's inside an email recently released by the state department
EDL	00:41:54,687	00:41:57,247	| serial-s02-e06 |	It's notes from a conversation and advisor clintons had
EDL	00:41:57,759	00:41:59,295	| serial-s02-e06 |	The guy named Bill Murray
EDL	00:41:59,295	00:42:03,903	| serial-s02-e06 |	He'd had a long and distinguished career at the CIA Heaven station Chief in Pakistan in the 90s
EDL	00:42:04,415	00:42:06,719	| serial-s02-e06 |	And all that apparently after starring in the movie Stripes
EDL	00:42:07,999	00:42:11,583	| serial-s02-e06 |	Anyway CIA Bill Murray said the same thing Jason is saying
EDL	00:42:11,583	00:42:14,399	| serial-s02-e06 |	There's a giant protracted misunderstanding going on
EDL	00:42:15,167	00:42:17,215	| serial-s02-e06 |	Teena Marie did not mince words
EDL	00:42:17,215	00:42:19,775	| serial-s02-e06 |	The memories almost like an urgent overseas Telegram
EDL	00:42:20,543	00:42:22,847	| serial-s02-e06 |	We are literally fighting the people
EDL	00:42:22,847	00:42:24,639	| serial-s02-e06 |	They think we are fighting Islam
EDL	00:42:24,639	00:42:26,687	| serial-s02-e06 |	The problem is not the number of troops
EDL	00:42:26,687	00:42:27,967	| serial-s02-e06 |	It's a failed mission
EDL	00:42:27,967	00:42:30,015	| serial-s02-e06 |	The Afghans believe we are there to stay
EDL	00:42:30,527	00:42:32,319	| serial-s02-e06 |	This is the thing they will never accept
EDL	00:42:32,831	00:42:37,183	| serial-s02-e06 |	They will allow armies to go through and even stay for a few years but not stay forever
EDL	00:42:37,183	00:42:38,719	| serial-s02-e06 |	I don't see how to make this work
EDL	00:42:40,255	00:42:42,047	| serial-s02-e06 |	Murray's overall advice
EDL	00:42:42,047	00:42:43,071	| serial-s02-e06 |	Bed and coin
EDL	00:42:43,839	00:42:50,239	| serial-s02-e06 |	Don't try to build the Afghan Nation or restructure society stop talking about democracy they don't care
EDL	00:42:50,239	00:42:53,055	| serial-s02-e06 |	Tell them you want to get Bin Laden and then get out
EDL	00:42:53,567	00:42:55,615	| serial-s02-e06 |	Inside the Army leadership though
EDL	00:42:55,615	00:42:56,639	| serial-s02-e06 |	Message was very different
EDL	00:42:57,151	00:42:58,943	| serial-s02-e06 |	It was we can do this
EDL	00:42:58,943	00:43:03,551	| serial-s02-e06 |	We keep trying we just need more time more money more men
EDL	00:43:08,927	00:43:12,511	| serial-s02-e06 |	Of course phone is platoon mates didn't have all this perspective
EDL	00:43:12,511	00:43:18,143	| serial-s02-e06 |	They might wonder whether what they were doing was worthwhile but mostly they were just doing their jobs doing what they were told
EDL	00:43:18,655	00:43:20,703	| serial-s02-e06 |	Knowing it was sometimes or often sucky
EDL	00:43:21,727	00:43:25,055	| serial-s02-e06 |	Right after I was sent with his platoon to mess
EDL	00:43:25,055	00:43:27,359	| serial-s02-e06 |	The little Outpost 20 miles south of Bob Serrano
EDL	00:43:27,871	00:43:29,663	| serial-s02-e06 |	Messed with deliver the rest of boast
EDL	00:43:29,663	00:43:30,175	| serial-s02-e06 |	Complaints
EDL	00:43:31,199	00:43:35,039	| serial-s02-e06 |	The messed Mission fit in exactly 2 Petraeus is coin idea
EDL	00:43:35,039	00:43:36,831	| serial-s02-e06 |	To get soldiers off the fob
EDL	00:43:36,831	00:43:39,647	| serial-s02-e06 |	Out into other more remote parts of Afghanistan
EDL	00:43:39,647	00:43:41,183	| serial-s02-e06 |	To work with and train local
EDL	00:43:41,183	00:43:41,695	| serial-s02-e06 |	Security Forces
EDL	00:43:42,719	00:43:44,255	| serial-s02-e06 |	When bo4 scotomas
EDL	00:43:44,255	00:43:46,047	| serial-s02-e06 |	In late May of 2009
EDL	00:43:46,047	00:43:48,607	| serial-s02-e06 |	There wasn't much of anything on top of the hill there
EDL	00:43:48,607	00:43:51,935	| serial-s02-e06 |	It was a cemetery and a tiny little bunker fortified with sandbag
EDL	00:43:52,703	00:43:54,495	| serial-s02-e06 |	So we're on this observation post
EDL	00:43:55,007	00:43:57,567	| serial-s02-e06 |	And they put pics of us up there the first night
EDL	00:43:58,335	00:43:59,359	| serial-s02-e06 |	Swell the first night
EDL	00:44:00,127	00:44:03,455	| serial-s02-e06 |	That Foxhole was big enough for two guys to be Undercover
EDL	00:44:04,991	00:44:05,759	| serial-s02-e06 |	So that's
EDL	00:44:05,759	00:44:06,527	| serial-s02-e06 |	Or guys
EDL	00:44:07,551	00:44:09,599	| serial-s02-e06 |	Sleeping out on a bare Hill
EDL	00:44:10,111	00:44:10,879	| serial-s02-e06 |	With a town
EDL	00:44:11,647	00:44:12,927	| serial-s02-e06 |	That is probably
EDL	00:44:14,207	00:44:15,743	| serial-s02-e06 |	Maybe 75 yards away
EDL	00:44:16,767	00:44:18,303	| serial-s02-e06 |	The bottom of this little Hill
EDL	00:44:19,327	00:44:20,607	| serial-s02-e06 |	Anybody could have
EDL	00:44:20,607	00:44:22,655	| serial-s02-e06 |	With that pillow
EDL	00:44:23,679	00:44:24,959	| serial-s02-e06 |	With an rpk
EDL	00:44:24,959	00:44:25,983	| serial-s02-e06 |	In
EDL	00:44:25,983	00:44:27,263	| serial-s02-e06 |	More than likely would have gotten
EDL	00:44:28,287	00:44:30,079	| serial-s02-e06 |	And this wasn't considered the
EDL	00:44:30,079	00:44:30,591	| serial-s02-e06 |	Security risk
EDL	00:44:31,103	00:44:32,895	| serial-s02-e06 |	This wasn't considered a safety
EDL	00:44:34,431	00:44:36,479	| serial-s02-e06 |	You know by the guys who put us up there
EDL	00:44:37,503	00:44:40,063	| serial-s02-e06 |	The sergeant that were up there made a call
EDL	00:44:40,063	00:44:41,599	| serial-s02-e06 |	Start digging a bigger hole
EDL	00:44:42,111	00:44:43,647	| serial-s02-e06 |	So that we can fortify the position
EDL	00:44:44,927	00:44:45,695	| serial-s02-e06 |	Here we are
EDL	00:44:46,207	00:44:49,535	| serial-s02-e06 |	Digging this hole in the middle of the Heat
EDL	00:44:49,535	00:44:50,559	| serial-s02-e06 |	Wave
EDL	00:44:50,559	00:44:51,327	| serial-s02-e06 |	The summer
EDL	00:44:52,351	00:44:54,399	| serial-s02-e06 |	And they called down
EDL	00:44:54,911	00:44:57,471	| serial-s02-e06 |	Staff score guidance on uniform
EDL	00:44:58,239	00:45:01,055	| serial-s02-e06 |	In other words are we allowed to take off some of our stuff
EDL	00:45:01,055	00:45:02,335	| serial-s02-e06 |	Best helmets
EDL	00:45:02,335	00:45:04,383	| serial-s02-e06 |	While we dig this hole in the punishing Heat
EDL	00:45:04,895	00:45:08,735	| serial-s02-e06 |	Members of getting a vague answer that amounted to yes
EDL	00:45:09,503	00:45:15,135	| serial-s02-e06 |	Greg weatherman who was in charge up there on the hill told doll that he did remember calling for instruction on uniform
EDL	00:45:15,135	00:45:17,951	| serial-s02-e06 |	We could see down below and they didn't have their gear on
EDL	00:45:18,463	00:45:21,791	| serial-s02-e06 |	Ask the commander when we are digging if we can take our gear off
EDL	00:45:22,559	00:45:25,887	| serial-s02-e06 |	He replied that as long as we were working on digging it should be fine I'm quote
EDL	00:45:26,655	00:45:30,751	| serial-s02-e06 |	Not all that uncommon for soldiers to do this by the way Ben the uniform rules a little
EDL	00:45:31,263	00:45:33,311	| serial-s02-e06 |	Austin Lanford wasn't messed to
EDL	00:45:33,311	00:45:37,407	| serial-s02-e06 |	He wasn't up above but he was doing similar work down below where the trucks were
EDL	00:45:38,175	00:45:39,455	| serial-s02-e06 |	Darrell Hanson was there as well
EDL	00:45:40,223	00:45:43,295	| serial-s02-e06 |	It was hot it was extremely extremely hot
EDL	00:45:43,295	00:45:47,135	| serial-s02-e06 |	And we're digging into a mountain full of rock so
EDL	00:45:47,135	00:45:50,975	| serial-s02-e06 |	You can either be in long sleeves pants and
EDL	00:45:50,975	00:45:53,023	| serial-s02-e06 |	Like the full kit
EDL	00:45:53,535	00:45:54,303	| serial-s02-e06 |	And die
EDL	00:45:54,815	00:45:56,863	| serial-s02-e06 |	Or you can drop load and
EDL	00:45:57,375	00:46:01,983	| serial-s02-e06 |	Do it how you have to do it to get it done as fast as you can because time is of the essence
EDL	00:46:02,751	00:46:03,519	| serial-s02-e06 |	And so
EDL	00:46:04,031	00:46:05,055	| serial-s02-e06 |	You decide to
EDL	00:46:05,055	00:46:06,591	| serial-s02-e06 |	Put your sleeves up
EDL	00:46:06,591	00:46:11,711	| serial-s02-e06 |	You decide to take her helmet off and maybe put a bandana on to keep your sweat out of your face
EDL	00:46:12,735	00:46:14,783	| serial-s02-e06 |	And maybe you unblock your boots
EDL	00:46:15,295	00:46:15,807	| serial-s02-e06 |	Cuz
EDL	00:46:16,319	00:46:16,831	| serial-s02-e06 |	You're hot
EDL	00:46:18,111	00:46:21,439	| serial-s02-e06 |	So here we are trying to fortify this because the first night we slept out on
EDL	00:46:22,719	00:46:23,231	| serial-s02-e06 |	Open
EDL	00:46:25,791	00:46:29,631	| serial-s02-e06 |	And so Here Comes This BC
EDL	00:46:29,631	00:46:30,143	| serial-s02-e06 |	Clint Baker
EDL	00:46:30,655	00:46:31,679	| serial-s02-e06 |	Key of the Shaving remark
EDL	00:46:32,191	00:46:34,239	| serial-s02-e06 |	Of course Baker sees them out of uniform
EDL	00:46:34,751	00:46:36,799	| serial-s02-e06 |	And you come running up that hill by himself
EDL	00:46:37,823	00:46:39,871	| serial-s02-e06 |	With Afghan governor and his Entourage
EDL	00:46:40,639	00:46:41,663	| serial-s02-e06 |	He gets up to the hill
EDL	00:46:42,687	00:46:46,271	| serial-s02-e06 |	It doesn't stop to talk to anybody doesn't stop to ask what's going on
EDL	00:46:47,039	00:46:49,343	| serial-s02-e06 |	All he does is he gets in the face
EDL	00:46:49,343	00:46:51,903	| serial-s02-e06 |	Of the sergeant there doesn't give him a chance
EDL	00:46:51,903	00:46:55,743	| serial-s02-e06 |	To explain fully what's going on nothing but aggression
EDL	00:46:55,743	00:46:58,815	| serial-s02-e06 |	And he literally went up pesto
EDL	00:46:58,815	00:47:01,375	| serial-s02-e06 |	Priceless chestplate up against the other sergeant
EDL	00:47:01,887	00:47:03,935	| serial-s02-e06 |	Like trying to get into his face
EDL	00:47:04,703	00:47:07,263	| serial-s02-e06 |	And you can see nothing but
EDL	00:47:07,263	00:47:10,079	| serial-s02-e06 |	LED turns around and throw the floor shaking
EDL	00:47:10,079	00:47:10,847	| serial-s02-e06 |	Tantrum
EDL	00:47:11,615	00:47:17,759	| serial-s02-e06 |	Configure told General doll he remember the incident and said he was quote putting on a bit of an ax to drive a point home
EDL	00:47:17,759	00:47:18,271	| serial-s02-e06 |	Unquote
EDL	00:47:18,783	00:47:19,551	| serial-s02-e06 |	Tell
EDL	00:47:19,551	00:47:21,855	| serial-s02-e06 |	That reprimand might have been the end of it
EDL	00:47:21,855	00:47:25,183	| serial-s02-e06 |	Except there was a photographer hanging around the platoon at that time
EDL	00:47:25,695	00:47:27,487	| serial-s02-e06 |	Sean Smith of the Guardian newspaper
EDL	00:47:27,999	00:47:32,351	| serial-s02-e06 |	And he published a bunch of photos online above and the others not in their proper uniform
EDL	00:47:32,863	00:47:34,655	| serial-s02-e06 |	And that sent the commanders through the roof
EDL	00:47:46,175	00:47:48,223	| serial-s02-e06 |	Call
EDL	00:47:48,735	00:47:55,135	| serial-s02-e06 |	Will you guys you guys are as bad as child
EDL	00:47:55,135	00:47:57,183	| serial-s02-e06 |	If you'd murdered
EDL	00:47:57,183	00:48:01,535	| serial-s02-e06 |	Village in Vietnam
EDL	00:48:01,535	00:48:04,351	| serial-s02-e06 |	Where is it why would you say that that's ridiculous
EDL	00:48:04,863	00:48:07,423	| serial-s02-e06 |	Because we
EDL	00:48:07,423	00:48:09,215	| serial-s02-e06 |	Yeah we we were
EDL	00:48:09,215	00:48:12,799	| serial-s02-e06 |	A little idea
EDL	00:48:20,479	00:48:24,831	| serial-s02-e06 |	When I first heard those account which again he was hearing second-hand since he wasn't in the room
EDL	00:48:25,343	00:48:26,623	| serial-s02-e06 |	I didn't quite believe it
EDL	00:48:26,623	00:48:28,927	| serial-s02-e06 |	I mean I believe they got chewed out but not to that.
EDL	00:48:29,439	00:48:30,463	| serial-s02-e06 |	I figured he was exaggerated
EDL	00:48:31,487	00:48:35,327	| serial-s02-e06 |	Carol Baker didn't respond to my request for an interview which I'm not surprised by
EDL	00:48:35,327	00:48:37,375	| serial-s02-e06 |	Until likely be involved in both court-martial
EDL	00:48:37,375	00:48:37,887	| serial-s02-e06 |	Proceeding
EDL	00:48:38,399	00:48:39,935	| serial-s02-e06 |	But I asked him about it
EDL	00:48:39,935	00:48:41,471	| serial-s02-e06 |	He was Colonel Baker's number two
EDL	00:48:41,983	00:48:44,031	| serial-s02-e06 |	It seems Kenny all the time about the photos to
EDL	00:48:44,543	00:48:46,335	| serial-s02-e06 |	Explain that yes indeed
EDL	00:48:46,335	00:48:47,615	| serial-s02-e06 |	This was a very big deal
EDL	00:48:48,895	00:48:51,455	| serial-s02-e06 |	Can you drop the guardian photographer at mess
EDL	00:48:51,455	00:48:52,991	| serial-s02-e06 |	And then kept driving further south
EDL	00:48:53,503	00:48:57,087	| serial-s02-e06 |	He was at another command center down there when someone showed him the photos
EDL	00:48:57,087	00:48:58,879	| serial-s02-e06 |	I interviewed Ken over the phone
EDL	00:48:58,879	00:49:01,439	| serial-s02-e06 |	If if we could ever find those photos
EDL	00:49:01,951	00:49:03,487	| serial-s02-e06 |	I'm pulling back up
EDL	00:49:03,487	00:49:06,559	| serial-s02-e06 |	Mishima shadam actually I just see like
EDL	00:49:06,559	00:49:07,327	| serial-s02-e06 |	Guys
EDL	00:49:07,327	00:49:13,215	| serial-s02-e06 |	Cheetah weapons at 1
EDL	00:49:14,495	00:49:16,031	| serial-s02-e06 |	Do you see by your body armor on
EDL	00:49:16,543	00:49:21,151	| serial-s02-e06 |	What does burning body armor look like except
EDL	00:49:21,151	00:49:25,503	| serial-s02-e06 |	Like if you see the video games
EDL	00:49:25,503	00:49:27,551	| serial-s02-e06 |	No I see guys
EDL	00:49:27,551	00:49:29,087	| serial-s02-e06 |	She guys with helmets on
EDL	00:49:30,367	00:49:35,487	| serial-s02-e06 |	Nobody knows a helmet on see a bunch of guys waiting to get f****** killed
EDL	00:49:35,487	00:49:36,767	| serial-s02-e06 |	That's what you see
EDL	00:49:38,047	00:49:40,095	| serial-s02-e06 |	The other thing that made Ken crazy
EDL	00:49:40,095	00:49:45,983	| serial-s02-e06 |	Was the way the weapons looked in the photos machine guns pointing up in the air not on tripods like they should be
EDL	00:49:45,983	00:49:51,359	| serial-s02-e06 |	I do look very hard at the photos even find the offending guns but Ken took it all in right away
EDL	00:49:51,871	00:49:53,407	| serial-s02-e06 |	Scarves on people's heads
EDL	00:49:53,407	00:49:56,479	| serial-s02-e06 |	And then there's Bergdahl standing off
EDL	00:49:56,479	00:50:02,879	| serial-s02-e06 |	Toot to the right and go with the pipe with a pipe
EDL	00:50:02,879	00:50:03,903	| serial-s02-e06 |	This is the one where I said
EDL	00:50:04,415	00:50:08,511	| serial-s02-e06 |	I don't want to see more this f****** Lawrence of Arabia ship
EDL	00:50:09,791	00:50:15,167	| serial-s02-e06 |	Old points out to mark that pipes actually have a longer richer place in military history than cigarettes
EDL	00:50:15,167	00:50:16,191	| serial-s02-e06 |	General Patton
EDL	00:50:17,215	00:50:20,543	| serial-s02-e06 |	Anyway to can the whole scene screams lack of discipline
EDL	00:50:20,543	00:50:22,079	| serial-s02-e06 |	Alarm Bells went off
EDL	00:50:22,079	00:50:24,383	| serial-s02-e06 |	If you guys aren't following the basic rules
EDL	00:50:24,383	00:50:26,687	| serial-s02-e06 |	How can I be trusted when a bigger problem comes along
EDL	00:50:27,711	00:50:32,319	| serial-s02-e06 |	Prior to deployment Hannah sergeants had come up with uniform rules they all agreed to enforce
EDL	00:50:33,087	00:50:34,367	| serial-s02-e06 |	And now there were saying
EDL	00:50:34,367	00:50:36,927	| serial-s02-e06 |	I know it's against the rules but
EDL	00:50:36,927	00:50:37,951	| serial-s02-e06 |	But you know what
EDL	00:50:38,719	00:50:39,231	| serial-s02-e06 |	I think
EDL	00:50:39,743	00:50:40,511	| serial-s02-e06 |	I know better
EDL	00:50:41,535	00:50:42,047	| serial-s02-e06 |	I don't care
EDL	00:50:42,559	00:50:43,839	| serial-s02-e06 |	So do whatever the f*** you
EDL	00:50:44,607	00:50:47,423	| serial-s02-e06 |	I see and that's the breakdown in discipline in fact
EDL	00:50:47,935	00:50:49,983	| serial-s02-e06 |	Is it right thing whatever the f*** you want
EDL	00:50:49,983	00:50:52,543	| serial-s02-e06 |	Write 15 people in my life go ahead
EDL	00:50:54,079	00:50:56,127	| serial-s02-e06 |	Like if you go right there
EDL	00:50:56,639	00:50:57,663	| serial-s02-e06 |	You go you go there
EDL	00:50:58,175	00:50:58,687	| serial-s02-e06 |	In your head
EDL	00:51:03,551	00:51:05,855	| serial-s02-e06 |	Now do I think these guys are ever going to let you know
EDL	00:51:06,367	00:51:08,671	| serial-s02-e06 |	15 Afghans in a room and shoot him
EDL	00:51:08,671	00:51:10,463	| serial-s02-e06 |	No not at all
EDL	00:51:10,463	00:51:11,231	| serial-s02-e06 |	But
EDL	00:51:11,231	00:51:12,511	| serial-s02-e06 |	I surely didn't want to
EDL	00:51:13,279	00:51:17,375	| serial-s02-e06 |	To let it start and then this is early in the deployment I mean this is May
EDL	00:51:17,375	00:51:18,399	| serial-s02-e06 |	Yeah right
EDL	00:51:19,423	00:51:20,191	| serial-s02-e06 |	Right
EDL	00:51:20,191	00:51:22,239	| serial-s02-e06 |	Okay we've decided
EDL	00:51:22,239	00:51:24,543	| serial-s02-e06 |	We're just going to do whatever we want
EDL	00:51:27,359	00:51:28,127	| serial-s02-e06 |	So
EDL	00:51:28,127	00:51:29,663	| serial-s02-e06 |	I'd wager bow heard what he heard
EDL	00:51:30,175	00:51:30,687	| serial-s02-e06 |	Neligh
EDL	00:51:31,199	00:51:33,503	| serial-s02-e06 |	And it was fun of you wasn't singular
EDL	00:51:33,503	00:51:36,319	| serial-s02-e06 |	That leadership genuinely consider this worthy of punishment
EDL	00:51:37,087	00:51:38,367	| serial-s02-e06 |	After the photo thing
EDL	00:51:38,367	00:51:39,647	| serial-s02-e06 |	3 people got in big trouble
EDL	00:51:40,159	00:51:41,951	| serial-s02-e06 |	Greg Leatherman was demoted
EDL	00:51:41,951	00:51:44,767	| serial-s02-e06 |	And two other sergeants were moved sideways out of the platoon
EDL	00:51:48,351	00:51:49,631	| serial-s02-e06 |	Tok Baker
EDL	00:51:49,631	00:51:50,399	| serial-s02-e06 |	I turned against them
EDL	00:51:50,911	00:51:52,447	| serial-s02-e06 |	He was going out of his way
EDL	00:51:52,959	00:51:56,799	| serial-s02-e06 |	Everything is miserable as possible in an unnecessary way
EDL	00:51:58,335	00:51:59,615	| serial-s02-e06 |	What I thought
EDL	00:52:00,383	00:52:03,199	| serial-s02-e06 |	And I saw the effect that had on the everybody
EDL	00:52:04,479	00:52:08,063	| serial-s02-e06 |	I guess you weren't the only guy that felt that way obviously
EDL	00:52:12,159	00:52:18,047	| serial-s02-e06 |	I was the one of many who thought it was a complete joke
EDL	00:52:18,559	00:52:22,399	| serial-s02-e06 |	You were just going I can't believe this is happening
EDL	00:52:22,399	00:52:23,679	| serial-s02-e06 |	I was mad about it I was
EDL	00:52:24,191	00:52:26,495	| serial-s02-e06 |	So that was the stupidest thing I've ever heard like
EDL	00:52:27,519	00:52:29,567	| serial-s02-e06 |	We're out here doing what you tell us to do like
EDL	00:52:30,591	00:52:32,383	| serial-s02-e06 |	I didn't understand
EDL	00:52:32,383	00:52:34,431	| serial-s02-e06 |	Why is Austin
EDL	00:52:34,431	00:52:38,527	| serial-s02-e06 |	Can the other guys didn't like that they never got to explain why they were out of uniform
EDL	00:52:38,527	00:52:42,623	| serial-s02-e06 |	Commanders reaction had less to do with the actual in fractions
EDL	00:52:42,623	00:52:46,207	| serial-s02-e06 |	And more to do with the fact that photographic evidence of them was on a website
EDL	00:52:46,207	00:52:47,487	| serial-s02-e06 |	Making the army look bad
EDL	00:52:47,487	00:52:48,255	| serial-s02-e06 |	I can leadership
EDL	00:52:49,535	00:52:52,095	| serial-s02-e06 |	Johansen said it felt like they were being judged unfairly
EDL	00:52:52,607	00:52:53,631	| serial-s02-e06 |	Off of
EDL	00:52:54,399	00:52:55,679	| serial-s02-e06 |	Picture
EDL	00:52:55,679	00:52:57,727	| serial-s02-e06 |	You know they had no idea what we're about
EDL	00:52:58,495	00:53:01,055	| serial-s02-e06 |	And higher so worried about
EDL	00:53:01,055	00:53:03,615	| serial-s02-e06 |	The way we look at our unprofessionalism
EDL	00:53:03,615	00:53:05,151	| serial-s02-e06 |	Not knowing
EDL	00:53:05,151	00:53:11,551	| serial-s02-e06 |	What the atmosphere is like what the actual Opie is like flies circularly constantly a hundred
EDL	00:53:11,551	00:53:14,879	| serial-s02-e06 |	10 degrees no hot food no hot shower
EDL	00:53:14,879	00:53:16,927	| serial-s02-e06 |	Getting shot at
EDL	00:53:19,743	00:53:20,511	| serial-s02-e06 |	Kind of
EDL	00:53:21,791	00:53:22,303	| serial-s02-e06 |	Ruined it
EDL	00:53:22,815	00:53:25,887	| serial-s02-e06 |	Ruin the feeling Daryl had that they were really good platoon
EDL	00:53:25,887	00:53:27,423	| serial-s02-e06 |	They were doing a good job
EDL	00:53:27,423	00:53:29,215	| serial-s02-e06 |	The punishments messed with morale
EDL	00:53:34,335	00:53:40,735	| serial-s02-e06 |	This is when those level of discontent boils over bodensee the commander
EDL	00:53:40,735	00:53:41,759	| serial-s02-e06 |	Actions of corrective
EDL	00:53:41,759	00:53:43,807	| serial-s02-e06 |	Is Autumn is punitive and where is
EDL	00:53:43,807	00:53:44,319	| serial-s02-e06 |	Irrational
EDL	00:53:45,087	00:53:46,111	| serial-s02-e06 |	Basically
EDL	00:53:47,135	00:53:49,183	| serial-s02-e06 |	Things are falling apart
EDL	00:53:49,951	00:53:52,255	| serial-s02-e06 |	You've been carrying around these worries for months he said
EDL	00:53:53,023	00:53:54,559	| serial-s02-e06 |	The Omni mission of course
EDL	00:53:54,559	00:53:56,607	| serial-s02-e06 |	Also talked to Mark and a doll
EDL	00:53:56,607	00:54:00,191	| serial-s02-e06 |	About a couple of incidents where he felt like privates were being ganged up on
EDL	00:54:00,191	00:54:02,495	| serial-s02-e06 |	Ncos raising them about their personal lives
EDL	00:54:02,495	00:54:03,519	| serial-s02-e06 |	Who's offended by that
EDL	00:54:04,287	00:54:07,359	| serial-s02-e06 |	But the uniform debacle and the photographs and Baker's freak out
EDL	00:54:08,127	00:54:09,919	| serial-s02-e06 |	Turbo that was the last straw
EDL	00:54:12,223	00:54:13,503	| serial-s02-e06 |	I ended up doing what I did
EDL	00:54:14,271	00:54:15,039	| serial-s02-e06 |	Because
EDL	00:54:15,551	00:54:17,087	| serial-s02-e06 |	He was out of control
EDL	00:54:22,207	00:54:28,351	| serial-s02-e06 |	I wouldn't put it past
EDL	00:54:29,375	00:54:31,423	| serial-s02-e06 |	Because the other person
EDL	00:54:36,543	00:54:38,079	| serial-s02-e06 |	IDK yet
EDL	00:54:40,383	00:54:43,967	| serial-s02-e06 |	He said his fear essentially was that Clint Baker would try to get rid of them
EDL	00:54:44,479	00:54:46,271	| serial-s02-e06 |	Maybe by sending them on a suicide mission
EDL	00:54:47,039	00:54:48,319	| serial-s02-e06 |	But they might get killed
EDL	00:54:48,319	00:54:49,599	| serial-s02-e06 |	Simply because he didn't like them
EDL	00:54:50,879	00:54:54,719	| serial-s02-e06 |	Botal General doll quote what could happen is this Battalion Commander
EDL	00:54:54,719	00:54:56,255	| serial-s02-e06 |	CS my platoon
EDL	00:54:56,255	00:54:58,047	| serial-s02-e06 |	As a stain on his reputation
EDL	00:54:58,815	00:55:02,143	| serial-s02-e06 |	Now sending us on a suicide mission wouldn't be the first in military history
EDL	00:55:02,655	00:55:07,775	| serial-s02-e06 |	Somebody doing somebody giving out an order on personal agendas or off of personal grievances
EDL	00:55:07,775	00:55:09,823	| serial-s02-e06 |	It is not going to be a first in military history
EDL	00:55:10,591	00:55:12,383	| serial-s02-e06 |	So worst case scenario what happens
EDL	00:55:13,919	00:55:14,687	| serial-s02-e06 |	Bizarre threat
EDL	00:55:15,711	00:55:18,015	| serial-s02-e06 |	And I saw that somebody needed to do something about it
EDL	00:55:18,527	00:55:21,599	| serial-s02-e06 |	Somebody had to do something that called the situation into check
