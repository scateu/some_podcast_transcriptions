EDL	00:01:52,128	00:01:55,968	| serial-s02-e01 |	One guy says something in Pashto which is translated on screen as

EDL	00:08:57,087	00:08:57,855	| serial-s02-e01 |	And what's become of that
EDL	00:08:58,623	00:09:03,999	| serial-s02-e01 |	Which is understandable considering that any one piece of the story could keep a person's mind turning
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:10,655	| serial-s02-e01 |	Right now Bo is waiting to see if the Army is going to drop the charges against him or take them all the way to court-martial trial
EDL	00:09:11,167	00:09:12,447	| serial-s02-e01 |	Or something in between
EDL	00:09:13,215	00:09:17,823	| serial-s02-e01 |	And then there's the stunning fact the bow was held by the Taliban for almost 5 years
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:19,871	| serial-s02-e01 |	Pause on that for a second
EDL	00:09:20,639	00:09:21,919	| serial-s02-e01 |	5 years
EDL	00:09:21,919	00:09:22,687	| serial-s02-e01 |	Alone
EDL	00:09:23,199	00:09:29,343	| serial-s02-e01 |	That's longer than any American has ever been held by the Taliban longer than any American has survived being held by the Taliban
EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:31,647	| serial-s02-e01 |	You can't speak Pashto
EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:34,463	| serial-s02-e01 |	The people handling him for the most part didn't speak English
EDL	00:09:34,463	00:09:37,279	| serial-s02-e01 |	So for five years but can really talk to anyone
EDL	00:09:37,791	00:09:40,095	| serial-s02-e01 |	And then here he is and he's calls with Mark
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:42,399	| serial-s02-e01 |	Annies describing things vividly
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:43,679	| serial-s02-e01 |	Indescribable
EDL	00:09:44,191	00:09:49,823	| serial-s02-e01 |	Square one point they told me that they kind of had you in a really dark room almost sound like a basement like
EDL	00:09:49,823	00:09:50,847	| serial-s02-e01 |	Where there is no light
EDL	00:09:53,919	00:09:55,455	| serial-s02-e01 |	There's a few rooms like that
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:09:55,967	| serial-s02-e01 |	Yeah
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:10:02,111	| serial-s02-e01 |	How do I explain to a person
EDL	00:10:03,903	00:10:05,951	| serial-s02-e01 |	Standing in an empty
EDL	00:10:24,383	00:10:26,943	| serial-s02-e01 |	Remembering
EDL	00:10:29,247	00:10:32,831	| serial-s02-e01 |	I get that feeling that word is on the tip of your tongue
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:41,791	| serial-s02-e01 |	And I couldn't do anything
EDL	00:10:47,935	00:10:48,703	| serial-s02-e01 |	Yeah
EDL	00:10:49,215	00:10:51,519	| serial-s02-e01 |	To the point where you just want to scream
EDL	00:11:10,207	00:11:15,839	| serial-s02-e01 |	Is the entire world out there
EDL	00:11:16,607	00:11:19,167	| serial-s02-e01 |	That you're trying to breathe
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:23,775	| serial-s02-e01 |	Release that you're trying to get everything is beyond that door
EDL	00:11:30,687	00:11:32,735	| serial-s02-e01 |	On the other side of the door was relief
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:33,247	| serial-s02-e01 |	Course
EDL	00:11:33,759	00:11:39,135	| serial-s02-e01 |	But also all the various people and systems that have kicked into action after but went missing
EDL	00:11:39,135	00:11:41,951	| serial-s02-e01 |	Both parents and his friends back in Idaho
EDL	00:11:41,951	00:11:44,255	| serial-s02-e01 |	Military Intelligence analyst
EDL	00:11:44,255	00:11:45,023	| serial-s02-e01 |	Diplomat
EDL	00:11:45,023	00:11:47,071	| serial-s02-e01 |	Secret meetings with the Taliban
EDL	00:11:47,071	00:11:50,911	| serial-s02-e01 |	The briefers at Guantanamo Bay State Department the White House
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:55,775	| serial-s02-e01 |	At some point after I've been reporting out all these various threads of both story
EDL	00:11:56,287	00:12:01,919	| serial-s02-e01 |	Interviewing lots of people at length about low and about what he did in the consequences of what he did
EDL	00:12:02,431	00:12:04,991	| serial-s02-e01 |	This children's book I used to read my kids popped into my head
EDL	00:12:05,503	00:12:06,271	| serial-s02-e01 |	It's called Zoom
EDL	00:12:06,783	00:12:08,831	| serial-s02-e01 |	There are no words it's just pictures
EDL	00:12:08,831	00:12:10,879	| serial-s02-e01 |	It starts with these pointy red shapes
EDL	00:12:11,903	00:12:15,231	| serial-s02-e01 |	The next page you realize those shapes are Rooster's comb
EDL	00:12:15,231	00:12:18,815	| serial-s02-e01 |	Next page zoom out you see the rooster is standing on a fence
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:20,095	| serial-s02-e01 |	Two little kids watching him
EDL	00:12:20,863	00:12:23,423	| serial-s02-e01 |	Next page to Matt again they're in a farmhouse
EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:27,775	| serial-s02-e01 |	And then Zoom further you realize that all of it the rooster the kids The Farmhouse
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:30,591	| serial-s02-e01 |	Toys being played with by another child
EDL	00:12:30,591	00:12:36,735	| serial-s02-e01 |	And at that whole scene is actually an ad in a magazine in the magazine is in the lap of someone napping on a deck chair
EDL	00:12:36,735	00:12:37,247	| serial-s02-e01 |	And so on
EDL	00:12:38,015	00:12:42,111	| serial-s02-e01 |	Out-and-out exhumes the aperture of the thing getting wider and wider
EDL	00:12:42,111	00:12:45,183	| serial-s02-e01 |	Until the original image is so far away it's unseeable
EDL	00:12:45,695	00:12:47,999	| serial-s02-e01 |	That's what the story of Bowe Bergdahl is like
EDL	00:12:47,999	00:12:50,303	| serial-s02-e01 |	This one idiosyncratic guy
EDL	00:12:50,303	00:12:52,863	| serial-s02-e01 |	Make a radical decision at the age of 23
EDL	00:12:52,863	00:12:53,887	| serial-s02-e01 |	To walk away
EDL	00:12:53,887	00:12:54,911	| serial-s02-e01 |	Into Afghanistan
EDL	00:12:55,423	00:12:57,471	| serial-s02-e01 |	And the consequences of that decision
EDL	00:12:57,471	00:12:58,495	| serial-s02-e01 |	They spin out
EDL	00:12:58,495	00:12:59,775	| serial-s02-e01 |	Wider and wider
EDL	00:12:59,775	00:13:01,055	| serial-s02-e01 |	And it'll return your surprise
EDL	00:13:01,567	00:13:02,335	| serial-s02-e01 |	Picture changes
EDL	00:13:03,103	00:13:04,127	| serial-s02-e01 |	To get the full picture
EDL	00:13:04,639	00:13:06,687	| serial-s02-e01 |	You need to go very very small
EDL	00:13:06,687	00:13:07,967	| serial-s02-e01 |	Is one person's life
EDL	00:13:08,479	00:13:10,271	| serial-s02-e01 |	And also very very big
EDL	00:13:10,271	00:13:11,551	| serial-s02-e01 |	The war in Afghanistan
EDL	00:13:12,319	00:13:13,855	| serial-s02-e01 |	Don't even really knows who he has
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:15,903	| serial-s02-e01 |	And nobody knows why he did it
EDL	00:13:16,671	00:13:20,255	| serial-s02-e01 |	Who's filmmaker Mark boal and his tape that got me interested in all this
EDL	00:13:20,255	00:13:22,047	| serial-s02-e01 |	We were talking the other day on the phone
EDL	00:13:22,047	00:13:24,095	| serial-s02-e01 |	About what got him interested in BO
EDL	00:13:24,095	00:13:25,375	| serial-s02-e01 |	Heyser cycle
EDL	00:13:25,375	00:13:31,007	| serial-s02-e01 |	Mysterious
EDL	00:13:32,543	00:13:36,383	| serial-s02-e01 |	Military perspective from the people's perspective is
EDL	00:13:36,383	00:13:40,223	| serial-s02-e01 |	Unforgettable walking
EDL	00:13:40,223	00:13:42,015	| serial-s02-e01 |	Blocking off and leaving his post
EDL	00:13:44,063	00:13:46,111	| serial-s02-e01 |	It's not that simple because she
EDL	00:13:46,111	00:13:47,903	| serial-s02-e01 |	Guys that you did for a lily
EDL	00:13:48,671	00:13:49,951	| serial-s02-e01 |	That's really good reason
EDL	00:13:49,951	00:13:51,999	| serial-s02-e01 |	Psych the most important for Foundry
EDL	00:13:54,559	00:13:56,863	| serial-s02-e01 |	So how do you judge something like that how do you judge him
EDL	00:14:04,031	00:14:08,127	| serial-s02-e01 |	For this story we've teamed up with Mark and his production company page 1
EDL	00:14:08,127	00:14:12,735	| serial-s02-e01 |	They come to us saying all this reporting on the story and we also got this tape
EDL	00:14:12,735	00:14:13,759	| serial-s02-e01 |	Do you think you might want to listen
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:16,831	| serial-s02-e01 |	And yes we did and we are kind of Blown Away
EDL	00:14:16,831	00:14:18,111	| serial-s02-e01 |	Until we begin working with them
EDL	00:14:18,879	00:14:23,999	| serial-s02-e01 |	They share their research with us and also put us in touch with many of their sources especially soldiers
EDL	00:14:23,999	00:14:26,047	| serial-s02-e01 |	We don't have anything to do with their movie
EDL	00:14:26,047	00:14:28,863	| serial-s02-e01 |	Mark and Paige 1rr partners for season 2
EDL	00:14:29,375	00:14:33,471	| serial-s02-e01 |	You might hear Mark and me talking from time to time during the course of the season so we can compare notes
EDL	00:14:34,239	00:14:40,383	| serial-s02-e01 |	Bo Bergdahl is currently an active-duty Soldier he's got a clerical job at his base in San Antonio Texas
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:42,175	| serial-s02-e01 |	Were you waiting on his legal situation
EDL	00:14:42,687	00:14:44,991	| serial-s02-e01 |	Again isn't talking to the Press
EDL	00:14:44,991	00:14:48,319	| serial-s02-e01 |	But he did give us permission to use the taped phone calls with Mark
EDL	00:14:50,367	00:14:51,903	| serial-s02-e01 |	So let's start at the beginning
EDL	00:14:52,671	00:14:53,695	| serial-s02-e01 |	Why do you do it
EDL	00:14:53,695	00:14:55,231	| serial-s02-e01 |	Why believe his Platoon
EDL	00:14:55,999	00:14:57,279	| serial-s02-e01 |	That's where Mark started to
EDL	00:15:01,119	00:15:01,887	| serial-s02-e01 |	Story
EDL	00:15:02,399	00:15:06,239	| serial-s02-e01 |	Well give me give me the give me the 30 second version First
EDL	00:15:07,007	00:15:09,311	| serial-s02-e01 |	This is for Mark's first tape phone call with bow
EDL	00:15:10,079	00:15:11,103	| serial-s02-e01 |	30 second version
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:14,687	| serial-s02-e01 |	Now you know what this one is right
EDL	00:15:15,967	00:15:16,479	| serial-s02-e01 |	But what is
EDL	00:15:21,087	00:15:23,391	| serial-s02-e01 |	Dustwun stands for Duty status
EDL	00:15:23,391	00:15:24,671	| serial-s02-e01 |	Whereabouts unknown
EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:26,719	| serial-s02-e01 |	Is the Army's version of Man Overboard
EDL	00:15:27,231	00:15:30,815	| serial-s02-e01 |	This one is the radio signal that put out over the radio when they
EDL	00:15:33,119	00:15:33,631	| serial-s02-e01 |	Okay
EDL	00:15:37,471	00:15:37,983	| serial-s02-e01 |	Right
EDL	00:15:38,495	00:15:41,823	| serial-s02-e01 |	Who says what he was trying to do was to cause a dust one
EDL	00:15:42,335	00:15:44,127	| serial-s02-e01 |	Which already set them apart
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:50,015	| serial-s02-e01 |	Because it means Bo doesn't fit into any of the AWOL or desertion scenarios were used to hearing
EDL	00:15:50,015	00:15:51,295	| serial-s02-e01 |	He wasn't cavorting
EDL	00:15:51,295	00:15:53,087	| serial-s02-e01 |	Wasn't drunk or goofing off
EDL	00:15:53,087	00:15:55,903	| serial-s02-e01 |	Drop his weapon and flee in the middle of a firefight
EDL	00:15:56,415	00:15:59,743	| serial-s02-e01 |	You didn't decide in a burst of Panic or confusion to go Walkabout
EDL	00:16:00,767	00:16:01,791	| serial-s02-e01 |	Instead
EDL	00:16:01,791	00:16:03,583	| serial-s02-e01 |	Slow simmering and methodical
EDL	00:16:04,095	00:16:05,375	| serial-s02-e01 |	Oh formulated a plan
EDL	00:16:06,399	00:16:07,679	| serial-s02-e01 |	He would create a crisis
EDL	00:16:07,679	00:16:08,703	| serial-s02-e01 |	A dust one
EDL	00:16:08,703	00:16:11,007	| serial-s02-e01 |	In order to call attention to another crisis
EDL	00:16:12,287	00:16:14,335	| serial-s02-e01 |	Bo says he had serious concerns
EDL	00:16:14,335	00:16:18,943	| serial-s02-e01 |	Concerns that began back in basic training in which persisted throughout his deployment in Afghanistan
EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:21,759	| serial-s02-e01 |	Regarding bad leadership within his unit
EDL	00:16:24,575	00:16:27,135	| serial-s02-e01 |	Call my first unit all the way up
EDL	00:16:27,135	00:16:28,415	| serial-s02-e01 |	Understand
EDL	00:16:32,255	00:16:33,279	| serial-s02-e01 |	Basically
EDL	00:16:37,375	00:16:39,167	| serial-s02-e01 |	Next to me
EDL	00:16:40,447	00:16:41,215	| serial-s02-e01 |	Literally
EDL	00:16:43,007	00:16:45,823	| serial-s02-e01 |	Something seriously going wrong
EDL	00:16:48,639	00:16:52,991	| serial-s02-e01 |	This is a big point of conflict may be b-big point of conflict in both story
EDL	00:16:53,503	00:16:56,831	| serial-s02-e01 |	The question generally of Bose true motives for leaving his post
EDL	00:16:57,343	00:17:02,719	| serial-s02-e01 |	I specifically whether his description of what was happening around him is accurate or believable
EDL	00:17:02,719	00:17:06,047	| serial-s02-e01 |	Because of course this explanation could be a story he invent it
EDL	00:17:06,047	00:17:08,863	| serial-s02-e01 |	You could argue that he did have five years to come up with it
EDL	00:17:08,863	00:17:12,447	| serial-s02-e01 |	Or he could be expressing the genuine beliefs of a whistleblower
EDL	00:17:12,959	00:17:19,359	| serial-s02-e01 |	Or the truth could be something else entirely and I'm definitely going to get into that precisely what Beau says he was
EDL	00:17:19,359	00:17:21,919	| serial-s02-e01 |	Seen during his deployment and how he reacted to it
EDL	00:17:22,431	00:17:25,759	| serial-s02-e01 |	Throw that will make more sense once you know more about Bo himself
EDL	00:17:25,759	00:17:30,623	| serial-s02-e01 |	So for now I'm going to jump over that and just give you the Bare Bones of what Beau says
EDL	00:17:30,623	00:17:32,415	| serial-s02-e01 |	And that is
EDL	00:17:32,415	00:17:37,023	| serial-s02-e01 |	He was so alarmed by what he considered crappy and potentially dangerous leadership
EDL	00:17:37,023	00:17:37,791	| serial-s02-e01 |	3 needed to ask
EDL	00:17:38,303	00:17:40,863	| serial-s02-e01 |	He needed to let his command know at the highest level
EDL	00:17:45,983	00:17:46,495	| serial-s02-e01 |	Course
EDL	00:17:47,007	00:17:50,335	| serial-s02-e01 |	Going to take me serious
EDL	00:17:54,175	00:17:54,687	| serial-s02-e01 |	Right
EDL	00:17:55,199	00:17:56,991	| serial-s02-e01 |	Those solution is the best one
EDL	00:17:57,759	00:18:01,343	| serial-s02-e01 |	At the time that a tiny Outpost known as Opie mask

EDL	00:26:23,104	00:26:27,200	| serial-s02-e01 |	Money talks about it now he'll sometimes acknowledge the wrongheadedness of it
EDL	00:26:27,200	00:26:29,248	| serial-s02-e01 |	Eddie overestimated his ability
EDL	00:26:29,248	00:26:33,088	| serial-s02-e01 |	He wasn't aware of the other ways he could have registered concerns about leadership
EDL	00:26:33,856	00:26:36,416	| serial-s02-e01 |	But there was this other idea but was testing out
EDL	00:26:36,928	00:26:40,256	| serial-s02-e01 |	Yes he says he wanted to bring attention to the plight of his platoon
EDL	00:26:40,768	00:26:43,328	| serial-s02-e01 |	He also admits that his plan was part Crucible

EDL	00:27:54,752	00:28:00,896	| serial-s02-e01 |	Because it was a combination of situation

EDL	00:28:44,160	00:28:47,744	| serial-s02-e01 |	He steps down and shakes Bose little tent which is right near the mrap
EDL	00:28:47,744	00:28:48,768	| serial-s02-e01 |	To wake him up for Duty

EDL	00:28:54,912	00:28:56,704	| serial-s02-e01 |	And then opened is 10
EDL	00:28:56,704	00:28:58,752	| serial-s02-e01 |	And he wasn't in there so I was like okay well
EDL	00:28:59,264	00:29:01,568	| serial-s02-e01 |	He probably went to the bathroom or something

EDL	00:29:18,464	00:29:20,512	| serial-s02-e01 |	Thought was he might be up there
EDL	00:29:21,024	00:29:24,352	| serial-s02-e01 |	So I radioed up to the opiates that has Bergdahl there
EDL	00:29:24,352	00:29:26,144	| serial-s02-e01 |	They said no poor does not appear
EDL	00:29:26,656	00:29:31,520	| serial-s02-e01 |	Set an alert Shane cross since he's buddies with bow and now Shane starts looking
EDL	00:29:31,520	00:29:33,056	| serial-s02-e01 |	So I got up and I said yeah I'll get him
EDL	00:29:33,824	00:29:34,848	| serial-s02-e01 |	I looked around and
EDL	00:29:34,848	00:29:37,408	| serial-s02-e01 |	Program from a little bit inside of their trucks
EDL	00:29:37,920	00:29:38,688	| serial-s02-e01 |	A few

EDL	00:29:44,576	00:29:47,392	| serial-s02-e01 |	After taking too much traffic I started to get concerned
EDL	00:29:48,160	00:29:48,672	| serial-s02-e01 |	And
EDL	00:29:49,440	00:29:50,208	| serial-s02-e01 |	That's what I

EDL	00:29:55,840	00:29:56,864	| serial-s02-e01 |	But what happened
EDL	00:29:57,632	00:29:58,400	| serial-s02-e01 |	Then it was gone
EDL	00:29:59,424	00:30:00,448	| serial-s02-e01 |	Who was the piano
EDL	00:30:01,216	00:30:01,984	| serial-s02-e01 |	Lieutenant Billings
EDL	00:30:03,008	00:30:06,336	| serial-s02-e01 |	John Billings was the pl the platoon leader
EDL	00:30:06,336	00:30:11,200	| serial-s02-e01 |	He testified at a military hearing that he thought Shane and Austin and the other guys were just messing with him
EDL	00:30:11,712	00:30:12,736	| serial-s02-e01 |	He said he thought quote
EDL	00:30:13,248	00:30:16,832	| serial-s02-e01 |	They just want to see me get all spazzed out freaked out you know call her headquarters
EDL	00:30:18,368	00:30:21,952	| serial-s02-e01 |	Instead Billings realizes with horror that it's real
EDL	00:30:21,952	00:30:23,744	| serial-s02-e01 |	Freaks out and calls her headquarters
EDL	00:30:24,768	00:30:29,120	| serial-s02-e01 |	He told an army prosecutor that he felt a quote internal franticness unquote
EDL	00:30:29,120	00:30:30,144	| serial-s02-e01 |	I can't find this guy
EDL	00:30:30,912	00:30:34,496	| serial-s02-e01 |	It types out a message to his company Commander back of Toronto to the effect of
EDL	00:30:34,496	00:30:35,520	| serial-s02-e01 |	We're not up
EDL	00:30:35,520	00:30:37,568	| serial-s02-e01 |	Meaning not 100% accounted for
EDL	00:30:38,336	00:30:39,360	| serial-s02-e01 |	I have a missing Soldier
EDL	00:30:40,640	00:30:42,176	| serial-s02-e01 |	At the other end of that message
EDL	00:30:42,176	00:30:43,968	| serial-s02-e01 |	Is Captain silvino s silvino
EDL	00:30:43,968	00:30:46,784	| serial-s02-e01 |	Look again there's got to be a mistake
EDL	00:30:47,552	00:30:48,320	| serial-s02-e01 |	Billings right back
EDL	00:30:48,832	00:30:49,856	| serial-s02-e01 |	Not a mistake
EDL	00:30:50,624	00:30:52,672	| serial-s02-e01 |	Sophie knows that's the best one in motion
EDL	00:30:52,672	00:30:53,952	| serial-s02-e01 |	Justin Theroux had planned
EDL	00:30:55,488	00:30:59,072	| serial-s02-e01 |	The new start circulating at the opp obviously then back up
EDL	00:30:59,072	00:31:02,144	| serial-s02-e01 |	Five of the chain of command and then all over Afghanistan
EDL	00:31:02,912	00:31:06,240	| serial-s02-e01 |	Those fellow soldiers immediately try to piece together what it happened
EDL	00:31:06,752	00:31:08,032	| serial-s02-e01 |	Here's Austin Lanford
EDL	00:31:08,032	00:31:10,080	| serial-s02-e01 |	The guy who bow is supposed to relieve from guard Duty
EDL	00:31:11,104	00:31:12,640	| serial-s02-e01 |	I knew in my mind
EDL	00:31:13,152	00:31:13,920	| serial-s02-e01 |	That
EDL	00:31:13,920	00:31:15,456	| serial-s02-e01 |	He had nobody came in until
EDL	00:31:16,992	00:31:21,088	| serial-s02-e01 |	Cuz it ain't they would have either been seeing they would have been able to get through the concertina wire
EDL	00:31:22,368	00:31:23,904	| serial-s02-e01 |	She would have fought back
EDL	00:31:23,904	00:31:24,416	| serial-s02-e01 |	Like
EDL	00:31:26,720	00:31:29,280	| serial-s02-e01 |	I didn't imagine him being taken as an option
EDL	00:31:30,560	00:31:36,960	| serial-s02-e01 |	And he left behind all his sensitive items in a nice neat little items meaning that's Mark McCrory serial number
EDL	00:31:36,960	00:31:38,240	| serial-s02-e01 |	Gear that would be a problem
EDL	00:31:38,240	00:31:38,752	| serial-s02-e01 |	His weapon
EDL	00:31:39,264	00:31:40,544	| serial-s02-e01 |	The laser for his weapon
EDL	00:31:40,544	00:31:41,312	| serial-s02-e01 |	Optic
EDL	00:31:42,080	00:31:42,592	| serial-s02-e01 |	Is night update
EDL	00:31:43,104	00:31:44,640	| serial-s02-e01 |	Stuff like that
EDL	00:31:44,640	00:31:48,736	| serial-s02-e01 |	A big problem if it went missing you left it in a nice neat little pile with a note
EDL	00:31:48,736	00:31:51,552	| serial-s02-e01 |	Of course mixed in with the facts there's just a ton of conjecture
EDL	00:31:52,064	00:31:56,672	| serial-s02-e01 |	Princeton's there's actually no evidence but left a note and Bone self says he didn't leave one
EDL	00:31:56,672	00:31:58,976	| serial-s02-e01 |	It's not clear to me where that detail came from
EDL	00:31:59,488	00:32:03,072	| serial-s02-e01 |	Other people said but I've been acting too cozy with the Afghan National Police guys
EDL	00:32:03,584	00:32:07,680	| serial-s02-e01 |	The way that he been talking to the locals in the way that he been
EDL	00:32:07,680	00:32:09,728	| serial-s02-e01 |	You know he's been showing up late to guard shift
EDL	00:32:10,496	00:32:13,568	| serial-s02-e01 |	Because he was busy talking to the locals
EDL	00:32:13,568	00:32:14,848	| serial-s02-e01 |	Does Josh quarter
EDL	00:32:14,848	00:32:16,128	| serial-s02-e01 |	Here's Darrell Hanson
EDL	00:32:16,128	00:32:17,920	| serial-s02-e01 |	Is guesses were expensive
EDL	00:32:17,920	00:32:21,504	| serial-s02-e01 |	We're like Manatee like CIA or what I mean does he like this
EDL	00:32:21,504	00:32:27,904	| serial-s02-e01 |	Crazy like mole was the discussion yeah like what were you guys thinking
EDL	00:32:27,904	00:32:28,928	| serial-s02-e01 |	What were you thinking that I've
EDL	00:32:29,440	00:32:31,744	| serial-s02-e01 |	I mean those are the things I like
EDL	00:32:32,256	00:32:33,536	| serial-s02-e01 |	Schedule complete lunatic
EDL	00:32:34,048	00:32:35,584	| serial-s02-e01 |	Or is he like CIA
EDL	00:32:36,352	00:32:38,656	| serial-s02-e01 |	Like we're trying to like we can figure it out you know
EDL	00:32:39,424	00:32:44,288	| serial-s02-e01 |	Some of these guys they'd seen so many strange and terrible things on deployments
EDL	00:32:44,800	00:32:46,592	| serial-s02-e01 |	But this was unheard of
EDL	00:32:47,616	00:32:54,016	| serial-s02-e01 |	I talked to Josh and Ben and another bandag I'm calling Scott's not his real name and Ken and John and Jace
EDL	00:32:54,016	00:32:56,832	| serial-s02-e01 |	Jason and Mark and Zach and Austin and Shane and Daryl
EDL	00:32:57,600	00:33:01,696	| serial-s02-e01 |	They remember bow differently they remember what happened after he left
EDL	00:33:01,696	00:33:02,208	| serial-s02-e01 |	Differently
EDL	00:33:02,720	00:33:04,000	| serial-s02-e01 |	The different feelings about it
EDL	00:33:04,512	00:33:06,304	| serial-s02-e01 |	They do not speak with one voice
EDL	00:33:06,816	00:33:10,912	| serial-s02-e01 |	A to a man they said they were gobsmacked when they heard someone was missing
EDL	00:33:11,424	00:33:12,448	| serial-s02-e01 |	And now it's like
EDL	00:33:13,216	00:33:14,496	| serial-s02-e01 |	This is got to be a drill
EDL	00:33:15,008	00:33:17,056	| serial-s02-e01 |	Holy crap like this is a

EDL	00:33:20,896	00:33:23,712	| serial-s02-e01 |	What is the craziest thing I could ever happen
EDL	00:33:23,712	00:33:25,504	| serial-s02-e01 |	Because it was so ludicrous
EDL	00:33:25,504	00:33:28,320	| serial-s02-e01 |	Set the time to think about it like what do you mean cuz nobody walks off
EDL	00:33:28,832	00:33:30,880	| serial-s02-e01 |	Nobody walks off of Bob
EDL	00:33:30,880	00:33:32,672	| serial-s02-e01 |	R&R a
EDL	00:33:32,672	00:33:34,720	| serial-s02-e01 |	Not even a Bobby
EDL	00:33:34,720	00:33:37,536	| serial-s02-e01 |	A combat Outpost where you going to go
EDL	00:33:39,328	00:33:44,704	| serial-s02-e01 |	I mean it's not like you can go hide out you know what the mall or something I mean that there is nowhere but Taliban
EDL	00:33:48,032	00:33:51,616	| serial-s02-e01 |	One of those friends told me that he was always a meticulous packer
EDL	00:33:51,616	00:33:54,944	| serial-s02-e01 |	This trip from Mass to sharana was no exception
EDL	00:33:54,944	00:33:58,528	| serial-s02-e01 |	Who's got his wallet and his camera he always had his camera on him

EDL	00:34:33,856	00:34:36,672	| serial-s02-e01 |	Sometime after midnight on June 30th

EDL	00:34:40,256	00:34:45,376	| serial-s02-e01 |	X over The concertina wire in a spot where someone had thrown a plastic crate down on top of it

EDL	00:34:49,728	00:34:51,520	| serial-s02-e01 |	Knowing it's a blind spot for them
EDL	00:34:51,520	00:34:54,336	| serial-s02-e01 |	Blade for one thing so people are probably tired
EDL	00:34:54,848	00:35:01,248	| serial-s02-e01 |	And if they're looking at it all they're looking into the distance not directly below them plus the Afghans don't have night vision gear
EDL	00:35:01,248	00:35:02,016	| serial-s02-e01 |	There anyway
EDL	00:35:02,016	00:35:08,416	| serial-s02-e01 |	Once he clears. He'll he heads Northwest toward the town of Malak passes to school there
EDL	00:35:08,416	00:35:10,464	| serial-s02-e01 |	Until finally he's out in open desert
EDL	00:35:10,976	00:35:12,256	| serial-s02-e01 |	And that's when it hit some
EDL	00:35:13,024	00:35:15,328	| serial-s02-e01 |	He suddenly feels the magnitude of what he's done
EDL	00:35:16,352	00:35:19,680	| serial-s02-e01 |	Basically what I decided to do about first plane was
EDL	00:35:19,680	00:35:21,728	| serial-s02-e01 |	Go from point A to point B
EDL	00:35:23,520	00:35:25,312	| serial-s02-e01 |	However 20 minutes out
EDL	00:35:31,456	00:35:35,552	| serial-s02-e01 |	When I get back to the everything
EDL	00:35:36,064	00:35:40,928	| serial-s02-e01 |	Can I use that was going to happen what time
EDL	00:35:40,928	00:35:42,464	| serial-s02-e01 |	Yeah
EDL	00:35:44,512	00:35:47,584	| serial-s02-e01 |	Not bad but I did not really do something.
EDL	00:35:48,608	00:35:50,912	| serial-s02-e01 |	Also he's profoundly scared
EDL	00:35:51,936	00:35:55,776	| serial-s02-e01 |	He's a world away from anything he knows in a country whose culture is
EDL	00:35:55,776	00:35:58,336	| serial-s02-e01 |	Is alien to him or people want to kill him
EDL	00:35:58,848	00:36:01,408	| serial-s02-e01 |	And he's outside the wire in the dark
EDL	00:36:02,688	00:36:06,272	| serial-s02-e01 |	When I picture him standing there I imagine a free-floating astronaut
EDL	00:36:06,272	00:36:08,576	| serial-s02-e01 |	No comforting tether attaching him to the Mothership
EDL	00:36:09,856	00:36:13,184	| serial-s02-e01 |	The thought crosses Bo's mind to just go back to the Opie
EDL	00:36:13,952	00:36:15,744	| serial-s02-e01 |	But he's not at all sure he could sneak back in
EDL	00:36:16,256	00:36:19,584	| serial-s02-e01 |	After all the guys there are watching for people coming toward them
EDL	00:36:20,096	00:36:21,632	| serial-s02-e01 |	And they're Manning big machine gun
EDL	00:36:22,144	00:36:22,912	| serial-s02-e01 |	He might get shot
EDL	00:36:24,192	00:36:27,520	| serial-s02-e01 |	Instead both figures he's just got to clench his jaw and go for it
EDL	00:36:28,288	00:36:32,896	| serial-s02-e01 |	Here again he makes a decision that is not the one you expect or at least not the one I would have
EDL	00:36:33,664	00:36:36,992	| serial-s02-e01 |	Because not only does he keep going but he Alters his plan
EDL	00:36:37,504	00:36:38,528	| serial-s02-e01 |	Complicated
EDL	00:36:38,528	00:36:40,832	| serial-s02-e01 |	Makes it a little grander and more ambitious
EDL	00:36:42,112	00:36:46,208	| serial-s02-e01 |	In hopes of mitigating the momentous trouble he now realizes he's in
EDL	00:36:46,208	00:36:50,048	| serial-s02-e01 |	Go figure is I'll try to arrive back at the fob with some extra thing
EDL	00:36:50,048	00:36:50,560	| serial-s02-e01 |	I guess
EDL	00:36:51,072	00:36:52,864	| serial-s02-e01 |	In the form of valuable Intel
EDL	00:36:53,632	00:36:57,728	| serial-s02-e01 |	He knew that on the road from five strata to Okemos there sometimes IDs
EDL	00:36:58,240	00:37:01,824	| serial-s02-e01 |	It heard someplace that the guys were planting ideas we're doing it at night
EDL	00:37:02,592	00:37:05,408	| serial-s02-e01 |	So he decides he'll make like a special forces guy
EDL	00:37:05,408	00:37:09,504	| serial-s02-e01 |	And try to catch someone planting an ID you're about to plant ID
EDL	00:37:09,504	00:37:13,344	| serial-s02-e01 |	I look for flashlights bobbing up and down listen for the crackle of radios
EDL	00:37:13,856	00:37:20,000	| serial-s02-e01 |	I would have been if I had seen somebody in the Darkness
EDL	00:37:21,280	00:37:23,584	| serial-s02-e01 |	Call Lake Wylie
EDL	00:37:24,608	00:37:26,144	| serial-s02-e01 |	In the morning
EDL	00:37:39,456	00:37:44,576	| serial-s02-e01 |	You left your position but I also got this information so
EDL	00:37:44,576	00:37:49,184	| serial-s02-e01 |	What are you going to do I have this information of this person who was book
EDL	00:37:51,232	00:37:54,304	| serial-s02-e01 |	Would be like justifiable like
EDL	00:37:55,072	00:38:00,192	| serial-s02-e01 |	He left his phone
EDL	00:38:04,288	00:38:08,896	| serial-s02-e01 |	Deal with
EDL	00:38:09,408	00:38:11,200	| serial-s02-e01 |	Basically hurricane
EDL	00:38:17,856	00:38:21,184	| serial-s02-e01 |	Up until this point both has he been walking in open Terrain
EDL	00:38:21,184	00:38:23,232	| serial-s02-e01 |	Between the road and a swell of hills
EDL	00:38:24,000	00:38:26,304	| serial-s02-e01 |	His idea was to make a slight detour
EDL	00:38:26,304	00:38:28,352	| serial-s02-e01 |	To shift a bit more toward the Hills
EDL	00:38:28,352	00:38:29,120	| serial-s02-e01 |	For some houses were
EDL	00:38:29,632	00:38:33,984	| serial-s02-e01 |	Thinking he'd have a better chance they're catching someone moving around in the dark unawares
EDL	00:38:34,752	00:38:36,544	| serial-s02-e01 |	Before he knows it he's in the house
EDL	00:38:37,312	00:38:39,616	| serial-s02-e01 |	He says he got completely Tangled in there
EDL	00:38:39,616	00:38:41,152	| serial-s02-e01 |	Forgot to check his compass
EDL	00:38:41,152	00:38:42,176	| serial-s02-e01 |	For 2 hours
EDL	00:38:42,176	00:38:43,200	| serial-s02-e01 |	Which is a rookie move
EDL	00:38:43,712	00:38:47,552	| serial-s02-e01 |	And so what was meant to be a slight detour turn into a major detour
EDL	00:38:48,320	00:38:51,392	| serial-s02-e01 |	By the time in straighten himself out and gotten out of the Hills
EDL	00:38:51,392	00:38:53,440	| serial-s02-e01 |	It's lost valuable time
EDL	00:38:53,440	00:38:54,208	| serial-s02-e01 |	The next morning
EDL	00:38:56,256	00:38:56,768	| serial-s02-e01 |	Workouts
EDL	00:38:59,328	00:39:02,144	| serial-s02-e01 |	By the time the sun was up bow is an open desert

EDL	00:39:12,128	00:39:15,200	| serial-s02-e01 |	And what happened some dudes drove up and just nag you or what
EDL	00:39:23,392	00:39:23,904	| serial-s02-e01 |	Baby
EDL	00:39:29,024	00:39:30,304	| serial-s02-e01 |	White motorcycles
EDL	00:39:40,800	00:39:42,080	| serial-s02-e01 |	Was a bigger one that was
EDL	00:39:42,080	00:39:46,688	| serial-s02-e01 |	7.62 7.62 x 41
EDL	00:39:48,992	00:39:50,016	| serial-s02-e01 |	I get one of those
EDL	00:39:50,016	00:39:52,832	| serial-s02-e01 |	They were driving along the road and I have
EDL	00:39:55,136	00:39:57,952	| serial-s02-e01 |	I'm off I can't tell you how they started
EDL	00:39:58,464	00:40:00,256	| serial-s02-e01 |	I don't I don't know they just
EDL	00:40:00,256	00:40:02,816	| serial-s02-e01 |	Deviated they turn off the road
EDL	00:40:03,328	00:40:04,352	| serial-s02-e01 |	Endured meaning
EDL	00:40:04,864	00:40:06,144	| serial-s02-e01 |	Maybe they were just
EDL	00:40:06,912	00:40:10,240	| serial-s02-e01 |	Maybe they just saw somebody walking through the desert they wanted to
EDL	00:40:16,896	00:40:18,944	| serial-s02-e01 |	Open
EDL	00:40:20,992	00:40:22,784	| serial-s02-e01 |	And I'm not about that run
EDL	00:40:24,576	00:40:25,600	| serial-s02-e01 |	Yeah
EDL	00:40:29,184	00:40:31,488	| serial-s02-e01 |	7 guys with AK-47
EDL	00:40:31,488	00:40:33,792	| serial-s02-e01 |	And they just pulled up and
EDL	00:40:36,352	00:40:38,144	| serial-s02-e01 |	What they said you fought like crazy
EDL	00:40:42,752	00:40:45,312	| serial-s02-e01 |	I'm not stupid enough to try and fight off
EDL	00:40:51,712	00:40:53,760	| serial-s02-e01 |	So did they basically just tie your hands and
EDL	00:40:54,272	00:40:55,808	| serial-s02-e01 |	Tasha on the back of one of the
