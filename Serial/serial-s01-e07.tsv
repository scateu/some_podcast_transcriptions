EDL	00:00:57,088	00:01:00,416	| serial-s01-e07 |	Hainan I remember he's talking to a girl
EDL	00:01:00,416	00:01:02,976	| serial-s01-e07 |	On the phone with her so I can read minutes
EDL	00:01:04,000	00:01:07,072	| serial-s01-e07 |	I just remember he had told my daughter he had seen
EDL	00:01:08,864	00:01:12,960	| serial-s01-e07 |	Cuz of the body of a girl in the back of such are the trunk of some vehicle
EDL	00:01:13,728	00:01:20,128	| serial-s01-e07 |	I think the guy's name was maybe Adnan
EDL	00:01:20,128	00:01:26,528	| serial-s01-e07 |	Global Tel Link prepaid call from
EDL	00:01:26,528	00:01:32,672	| serial-s01-e07 |	Maryland Correctional Facility
EDL	00:01:38,816	00:01:45,216	| serial-s01-e07 |	From This American Life and WBEZ Chicago its serial one story
EDL	00:01:45,216	00:01:47,008	| serial-s01-e07 |	I told week by week I'm Sarah Koenig
EDL	00:01:50,848	00:01:53,920	| serial-s01-e07 |	I heard about this other case of a kid named Justin wolf
EDL	00:01:54,432	00:02:00,320	| serial-s01-e07 |	Actually passing I can't remember how he heard about it. A lot of different stuff in prison
EDL	00:02:00,832	00:02:07,232	| serial-s01-e07 |	Talking about the cell records and how they were used in a non case in a non said that in this other case of just
EDL	00:02:07,232	00:02:10,304	| serial-s01-e07 |	Sell records had also been used against him
EDL	00:02:10,304	00:02:13,376	| serial-s01-e07 |	But then Justin Wilson conviction was overturned
EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:14,912	| serial-s01-e07 |	In part because of the cell record
EDL	00:02:16,192	00:02:19,264	| serial-s01-e07 |	So I looked at this case of Justin Wolfe just to see
EDL	00:02:19,264	00:02:24,128	| serial-s01-e07 |	I have to say it's sort of uncanny how many similarities there are with add-ons case
EDL	00:02:24,896	00:02:26,688	| serial-s01-e07 |	All young people first of all
EDL	00:02:26,688	00:02:30,016	| serial-s01-e07 |	Justin Wolfe was a Suburban kid 18 football player
EDL	00:02:30,528	00:02:34,624	| serial-s01-e07 |	People thought of him as a good kid though he was selling pot and hanging around with some tougher types
EDL	00:02:35,392	00:02:37,440	| serial-s01-e07 |	Does next Hearts different obviously
EDL	00:02:37,440	00:02:42,048	| serial-s01-e07 |	He was convicted in the 2001 murder of a drug dealer who was shot nine times
EDL	00:02:42,816	00:02:44,864	| serial-s01-e07 |	Justin Wolfe was not the shooter
EDL	00:02:44,864	00:02:48,704	| serial-s01-e07 |	The shooter was a slightly older friend of wolves Barber
EDL	00:02:48,704	00:02:52,032	| serial-s01-e07 |	Who got a deal in exchange for testifying against Justin Wolfe
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:57,152	| serial-s01-e07 |	Owen Barber told the cops that Justin wasn't hired him to kill the drug dealer
EDL	00:02:57,152	00:02:58,944	| serial-s01-e07 |	What was sentenced to death in Virginia
EDL	00:02:59,712	00:03:06,112	| serial-s01-e07 |	Wolf trial attorney later gave up his law license after the bar had initiated disciplinary charges against him for
EDL	00:03:06,112	00:03:07,648	| serial-s01-e07 |	This is the technical term
EDL	00:03:07,648	00:03:08,928	| serial-s01-e07 |	Being a crappy lawyer
EDL	00:03:09,696	00:03:11,744	| serial-s01-e07 |	And there was a witness who was never heard from
EDL	00:03:15,328	00:03:17,632	| serial-s01-e07 |	Anyhow eventually Owen Barbara mercante
EDL	00:03:18,144	00:03:20,704	| serial-s01-e07 |	He said Justin Wolfe had nothing to do with a murder
EDL	00:03:20,704	00:03:23,520	| serial-s01-e07 |	He'd only implicated wolf to avoid a death sentence for himself
EDL	00:03:26,592	00:03:32,480	| serial-s01-e07 |	Let me talk to the lawyer who helped figure out the flaws in the state's case against Justin Wolfe
EDL	00:03:32,992	00:03:37,600	| serial-s01-e07 |	Maybe she has some tips about how we should be looking at the cell records differently in Adnan case
EDL	00:03:38,880	00:03:41,184	| serial-s01-e07 |	I looked her up her name is Deirdre Enright
EDL	00:03:41,184	00:03:43,744	| serial-s01-e07 |	And she works at the University of Virginia school of law
EDL	00:03:44,256	00:03:50,656	| serial-s01-e07 |	She runs their Innocence Project Clinic their Innocence Project
EDL	00:03:50,656	00:03:51,936	| serial-s01-e07 |	Someone's been wrongfully convicted
EDL	00:03:52,448	00:03:55,520	| serial-s01-e07 |	I called her and asked how she dealt with the cell records in the Justin Wolfe case
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:03:58,592	| serial-s01-e07 |	And she was kind of so-so on that topic
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:04:00,896	| serial-s01-e07 |	She gave me a couple of names to try
EDL	00:04:01,920	00:04:04,992	| serial-s01-e07 |	Batman on every other topic I found her so help
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:11,392	| serial-s01-e07 |	She started asking me about anons case and I ended up sending her a summary I'd made of the detective's report
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:15,232	| serial-s01-e07 |	The next time we talk I asked if she'd mind going to a studio
EDL	00:04:15,744	00:04:17,791	| serial-s01-e07 |	Hey you know I read
EDL	00:04:17,791	00:04:18,303	| serial-s01-e07 |	Your
EDL	00:04:18,815	00:04:20,095	| serial-s01-e07 |	Synopsis of your
EDL	00:04:20,095	00:04:22,655	| serial-s01-e07 |	To jump right into your case okay if I have a million questions
EDL	00:04:24,447	00:04:25,983	| serial-s01-e07 |	Very very thin
EDL	00:04:28,031	00:04:28,799	| serial-s01-e07 |	Yeah
EDL	00:04:30,079	00:04:31,359	| serial-s01-e07 |	After I started reading all this
EDL	00:04:31,359	00:04:32,639	| serial-s01-e07 |	Although what you had
EDL	00:04:32,639	00:04:33,663	| serial-s01-e07 |	I started thinking
EDL	00:04:33,663	00:04:35,199	| serial-s01-e07 |	So everybody here is in high school
EDL	00:04:35,711	00:04:36,479	| serial-s01-e07 |	Right
EDL	00:04:36,479	00:04:37,759	| serial-s01-e07 |	And why is done
EDL	00:04:39,295	00:04:40,575	| serial-s01-e07 |	Doesn't appear to be
EDL	00:04:40,575	00:04:41,343	| serial-s01-e07 |	Interest anyone
EDL	00:04:42,623	00:04:48,255	| serial-s01-e07 |	Done with his new boyfriend to the police considered his Alibi Ironclad he was working at LensCrafters all day
EDL	00:04:48,767	00:04:50,815	| serial-s01-e07 |	See this is how it is with Deirdre
EDL	00:04:50,815	00:04:54,143	| serial-s01-e07 |	A conversation with her never seems to begin exactly
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:56,959	| serial-s01-e07 |	It's already there ongoing her thoughts
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:05:00,287	| serial-s01-e07 |	Turning and you just kind of join in when you're ready and hope you can keep up
EDL	00:05:00,799	00:05:03,615	| serial-s01-e07 |	She's not a small talker or a beat around the bushes
EDL	00:05:03,615	00:05:05,919	| serial-s01-e07 |	You discuss whatever it is you came to discuss
EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:08,223	| serial-s01-e07 |	Looking it squarely in the face
EDL	00:05:08,223	00:05:09,503	| serial-s01-e07 |	She has no time for bulshit
EDL	00:05:10,271	00:05:14,367	| serial-s01-e07 |	And not because she's about anything but because she actually has no time
EDL	00:05:14,367	00:05:17,439	| serial-s01-e07 |	She's one of the busiest and most curious people I've ever met
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:22,815	| serial-s01-e07 |	You know when you first talk to me about this case the first thing I thought is okay do we have a jailhouse informant
EDL	00:05:23,327	00:05:25,375	| serial-s01-e07 |	Do we have a person
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:29,215	| serial-s01-e07 |	Got way too sweet of a deal
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:34,591	| serial-s01-e07 |	What when I read through your police notes your summary of your police notes
EDL	00:05:34,591	00:05:36,383	| serial-s01-e07 |	I just kept going back to motive
EDL	00:05:36,895	00:05:40,479	| serial-s01-e07 |	Hunting that's a big black hole for me I still don't understand
EDL	00:05:40,991	00:05:41,503	| serial-s01-e07 |	Why
EDL	00:05:42,271	00:05:44,063	| serial-s01-e07 |	You want this girl's dad
EDL	00:05:44,575	00:05:50,975	| serial-s01-e07 |	Because she broke up with you people break up with people all the time prayer and I can't and I'm a little concerned
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:57,375	| serial-s01-e07 |	What about racial profiling here you know in other words
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:06:00,447	| serial-s01-e07 |	Right and people are saying you know his
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:01,727	| serial-s01-e07 |	Darkside
EDL	00:06:01,727	00:06:03,007	| serial-s01-e07 |	And his
EDL	00:06:03,007	00:06:05,311	| serial-s01-e07 |	You know there was some notation about he was very
EDL	00:06:05,823	00:06:06,335	| serial-s01-e07 |	Trolling
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:10,175	| serial-s01-e07 |	And I thought I wonder if he was really very controlling
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:14,527	| serial-s01-e07 |	So there's that
EDL	00:06:15,551	00:06:17,343	| serial-s01-e07 |	Then a little bit I had a
EDL	00:06:17,855	00:06:20,159	| serial-s01-e07 |	The cell phone thing for us and Justin Wolfe is
EDL	00:06:20,671	00:06:23,231	| serial-s01-e07 |	That they used to the cell phone records
EDL	00:06:23,231	00:06:23,743	| serial-s01-e07 |	Say
EDL	00:06:25,791	00:06:28,095	| serial-s01-e07 |	Cabin out the period of time
EDL	00:06:28,095	00:06:28,863	| serial-s01-e07 |	When
EDL	00:06:28,863	00:06:32,959	| serial-s01-e07 |	The shooter is driving to the place where the victim is
EDL	00:06:32,959	00:06:35,007	| serial-s01-e07 |	And shooting him and then coming back
EDL	00:06:35,519	00:06:41,407	| serial-s01-e07 |	And so they they put those up on a board in the courtroom and take a look at this he calls him right before he
EDL	00:06:41,919	00:06:44,479	| serial-s01-e07 |	Commits the murder and he calls him right after he commits the murder
EDL	00:06:44,991	00:06:45,759	| serial-s01-e07 |	You know
EDL	00:06:45,759	00:06:46,527	| serial-s01-e07 |	But
EDL	00:06:46,527	00:06:52,159	| serial-s01-e07 |	And then you get everybody's phone records write all these kids that are buying pot smoking pot selling pot
EDL	00:06:52,671	00:06:54,463	| serial-s01-e07 |	And everybody's calling each other
EDL	00:06:54,463	00:06:55,743	| serial-s01-e07 |	All the time
EDL	00:06:56,255	00:06:56,767	| serial-s01-e07 |	So
EDL	00:06:57,279	00:06:59,071	| serial-s01-e07 |	It's a venue stop and stand back and say
EDL	00:07:00,095	00:07:05,727	| serial-s01-e07 |	Also what are they trying to say that Justin wolf in these kids he's a upper-middle-class kids
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:07,775	| serial-s01-e07 |	Are so stupid
EDL	00:07:07,775	00:07:08,543	| serial-s01-e07 |	That they
EDL	00:07:09,055	00:07:12,383	| serial-s01-e07 |	Get in the car and call and say okay I'm on my way to murder him
EDL	00:07:12,383	00:07:17,247	| serial-s01-e07 |	Okay I just murdered him I'm coming back now I just weren't you know what I mean like
EDL	00:07:17,759	00:07:19,039	| serial-s01-e07 |	Who does that
EDL	00:07:19,039	00:07:21,087	| serial-s01-e07 |	It's so you know now all these Witnesses
EDL	00:07:21,087	00:07:24,415	| serial-s01-e07 |	Oh no we were just calling each other to buy pot
EDL	00:07:25,183	00:07:26,463	| serial-s01-e07 |	Those calls
EDL	00:07:26,463	00:07:29,535	| serial-s01-e07 |	Bitter infused with meaning by the prosecution
EDL	00:07:29,535	00:07:32,095	| serial-s01-e07 |	Siri have no meaning in space
EDL	00:07:32,607	00:07:35,679	| serial-s01-e07 |	Show me itsfunneh like you get kisses like Anna's case
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:37,215	| serial-s01-e07 |	I feel like
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:40,287	| serial-s01-e07 |	From what I can tell
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:47,967	| serial-s01-e07 |	You know there's nuts for gross negligence or or malfeasance or something on the part of the detectives or the
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:51,039	| serial-s01-e07 |	State Attorney's Office like everyone seems to be doing their job
EDL	00:07:52,319	00:07:54,367	| serial-s01-e07 |	Responsibly
EDL	00:07:54,367	00:07:56,671	| serial-s01-e07 |	Just doesn't seem like there's an obvious like
EDL	00:07:56,671	00:08:01,535	| serial-s01-e07 |	Never looked at the new boyfriend they never questioned the guy who found the button
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:05,887	| serial-s01-e07 |	A nun on himself is not sad
EDL	00:08:05,887	00:08:08,703	| serial-s01-e07 |	Buying anything super useful to say like
EDL	00:08:09,215	00:08:13,567	| serial-s01-e07 |	Here's why I can prove I didn't do this like he has set out front like I can't
EDL	00:08:14,335	00:08:15,359	| serial-s01-e07 |	Give you
EDL	00:08:15,359	00:08:16,127	| serial-s01-e07 |	Like some
EDL	00:08:16,127	00:08:20,223	| serial-s01-e07 |	Clenching piece of information or evidence that's going to solve this like I wish I could
EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:22,271	| serial-s01-e07 |	Cobra Kai just don't have it like I don't know
EDL	00:08:23,551	00:08:24,575	| serial-s01-e07 |	I don't know how to
EDL	00:08:24,575	00:08:25,343	| serial-s01-e07 |	Prove this
EDL	00:08:26,111	00:08:28,671	| serial-s01-e07 |	You know that's a that's why I love hearing that
EDL	00:08:28,671	00:08:29,951	| serial-s01-e07 |	Because
EDL	00:08:29,951	00:08:33,279	| serial-s01-e07 |	Somewhere along the line I started realizing that when you have an innocent client
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:36,863	| serial-s01-e07 |	They are the least helpful people in the whole world
EDL	00:08:38,911	00:08:40,447	| serial-s01-e07 |	They don't know they don't
EDL	00:08:40,447	00:08:41,471	| serial-s01-e07 |	They have no idea
EDL	00:08:41,983	00:08:46,079	| serial-s01-e07 |	You like as soon as I realized I have an innocent client and that's a situation that I think like
EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:47,615	| serial-s01-e07 |	Okay well I'll talk to you again when I solved
EDL	00:08:48,127	00:08:50,175	| serial-s01-e07 |	Because I'm not going to need you here
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:52,223	| serial-s01-e07 |	Cuz what's happening with unknown is where
EDL	00:08:53,759	00:08:56,063	| serial-s01-e07 |	Find something out that looks kind of bad for him
EDL	00:08:56,575	00:08:58,367	| serial-s01-e07 |	And I'll come to him with it and be like
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:09:03,487	| serial-s01-e07 |	Why it does seem like you maybe made this phone call
EDL	00:09:03,487	00:09:06,815	| serial-s01-e07 |	In the middle of the afternoon at a time when you're saying you were a track
EDL	00:09:06,815	00:09:10,911	| serial-s01-e07 |	But the phone number is to someone who only you know and Jay didn't know
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:17,311	| serial-s01-e07 |	And so like there's this phone call with this girl Nisha and it it's like this glaring thing to me in the middle of the phone records
EDL	00:09:17,311	00:09:20,895	| serial-s01-e07 |	I'm like that's the one that kind of looks bad for you
EDL	00:09:20,895	00:09:22,943	| serial-s01-e07 |	Explain that to me how do you explain that
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:26,527	| serial-s01-e07 |	And then his his answer is
EDL	00:09:27,039	00:09:33,439	| serial-s01-e07 |	Had a melee or not so satisfying where he's like I don't I can't explain it like maybe it was a butt dial and like
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:34,719	| serial-s01-e07 |	The machine picked up and I'm like
EDL	00:09:34,719	00:09:36,767	| serial-s01-e07 |	But she's had to find that there's no machine on it
EDL	00:09:37,279	00:09:42,143	| serial-s01-e07 |	And he's like I don't know I don't know what to tell you but like I didn't I didn't have the felt like I was a track
EDL	00:09:42,655	00:09:44,959	| serial-s01-e07 |	And I'm just like I want to be like
EDL	00:09:46,751	00:09:48,543	| serial-s01-e07 |	You should have an anime cake
EDL	00:09:48,543	00:09:49,823	| serial-s01-e07 |	What's not surprising
EDL	00:09:50,335	00:09:51,359	| serial-s01-e07 |	Not at all
EDL	00:09:51,871	00:09:58,015	| serial-s01-e07 |	So there was a case that I had the federal capital murder case right where my client Daryl rice right
EDL	00:09:58,527	00:10:01,343	| serial-s01-e07 |	Is charged with killing two women hikers in the
EDL	00:10:01,343	00:10:03,391	| serial-s01-e07 |	Shenandoah National Park in blah blah blah
EDL	00:10:03,391	00:10:05,183	| serial-s01-e07 |	They filed a motion saying
EDL	00:10:05,183	00:10:06,463	| serial-s01-e07 |	The motive in this case
EDL	00:10:06,463	00:10:08,255	| serial-s01-e07 |	It was hatred it was
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:10,559	| serial-s01-e07 |	He hated lesbians that's why he murdered these two women
EDL	00:10:11,071	00:10:14,655	| serial-s01-e07 |	So Daryl rice was easy for me not in the beginning because
EDL	00:10:15,167	00:10:16,447	| serial-s01-e07 |	His answers
EDL	00:10:16,447	00:10:18,239	| serial-s01-e07 |	Self-serving and help
EDL	00:10:18,751	00:10:19,775	| serial-s01-e07 |	The way you think
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:21,823	| serial-s01-e07 |	He's had time to think about
EDL	00:10:22,335	00:10:23,103	| serial-s01-e07 |	Why
EDL	00:10:23,103	00:10:24,639	| serial-s01-e07 |	Why doesn't have a better answer than that
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:25,919	| serial-s01-e07 |	And then
EDL	00:10:25,919	00:10:27,455	| serial-s01-e07 |	I started to realize
EDL	00:10:27,455	00:10:28,479	| serial-s01-e07 |	Because
EDL	00:10:28,479	00:10:30,015	| serial-s01-e07 |	He hasn't been thinking about this
EDL	00:10:30,527	00:10:32,319	| serial-s01-e07 |	Because you didn't murder anybody
EDL	00:10:32,319	00:10:32,831	| serial-s01-e07 |	And so
EDL	00:10:33,599	00:10:36,159	| serial-s01-e07 |	It's like I remember one day I had in there map
EDL	00:10:36,159	00:10:37,183	| serial-s01-e07 |	Straight to show him
EDL	00:10:39,743	00:10:43,327	| serial-s01-e07 |	Like where the crime scene was versus where the lodge was first
EDL	00:10:43,327	00:10:45,119	| serial-s01-e07 |	2 square mile marker 42 points
EDL	00:10:45,631	00:10:49,471	| serial-s01-e07 |	And so I put I put this all out on the table and get my reading glasses
EDL	00:10:49,983	00:10:55,103	| serial-s01-e07 |	And then I said so when you would Camp there can you show me where you were and then he was like
EDL	00:10:55,615	00:10:56,895	| serial-s01-e07 |	Okay well I didn't
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:10:59,711	| serial-s01-e07 |	I didn't Camp there I buy wild ride bikes
EDL	00:10:59,711	00:11:00,991	| serial-s01-e07 |	There in a horse sound like
EDL	00:11:01,503	00:11:02,783	| serial-s01-e07 |	Okay well whatever you know
EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:04,831	| serial-s01-e07 |	It's whatever you're in the park
EDL	00:11:06,111	00:11:07,903	| serial-s01-e07 |	In relation to the crime scene
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:09,439	| serial-s01-e07 |	And then he
EDL	00:11:09,439	00:11:12,255	| serial-s01-e07 |	Look at me it was so simple it and but he said
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:16,095	| serial-s01-e07 |	I don't I don't know where the crime scene was
EDL	00:11:16,095	00:11:17,119	| serial-s01-e07 |	So can you
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:17,887	| serial-s01-e07 |	Show me that
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:19,423	| serial-s01-e07 |	And I remember thinking
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:20,703	| serial-s01-e07 |	Course
EDL	00:11:20,703	00:11:22,239	| serial-s01-e07 |	I'm like everybody else
EDL	00:11:22,239	00:11:23,775	| serial-s01-e07 |	I think he knows
EDL	00:11:23,775	00:11:25,055	| serial-s01-e07 |	Christine is right
EDL	00:11:25,055	00:11:31,455	| serial-s01-e07 |	How many likes do you only take on cases where it's super clear to everyone involved like on your side of the bed
EDL	00:11:31,455	00:11:32,223	| serial-s01-e07 |	Your side of the bar
EDL	00:11:35,039	00:11:36,063	| serial-s01-e07 |	That that
EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:38,879	| serial-s01-e07 |	This person isn't innocent of wrongfully convicted
EDL	00:11:38,879	00:11:42,719	| serial-s01-e07 |	Or do you take cases where like you really don't know and you start down a road in like
EDL	00:11:43,231	00:11:49,631	| serial-s01-e07 |	Three quarter staircase it turns out he probably did it so let's not take on that one or do you are you only working with cases where you're pretty sure from the
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:50,399	| serial-s01-e07 |	The get-go
EDL	00:11:50,399	00:11:54,495	| serial-s01-e07 |	Because we're the people that decide whether
EDL	00:11:54,495	00:11:56,287	| serial-s01-e07 |	It's going to be it's going to go or not
EDL	00:11:58,335	00:12:00,639	| serial-s01-e07 |	Ecos every different way
EDL	00:12:00,639	00:12:03,967	| serial-s01-e07 |	Right sometimes we start down the road and
EDL	00:12:03,967	00:12:04,991	| serial-s01-e07 |	Very quickly
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:07,039	| serial-s01-e07 |	We talked to four Witnesses all of whom say
EDL	00:12:07,039	00:12:07,807	| serial-s01-e07 |	Nose apps
EDL	00:12:07,807	00:12:08,575	| serial-s01-e07 |	Vim
EDL	00:12:08,575	00:12:10,623	| serial-s01-e07 |	They have no reason to lie you know
EDL	00:12:10,623	00:12:13,439	| serial-s01-e07 |	We did not we quickly realized okay we're being happy
EDL	00:12:15,487	00:12:16,767	| serial-s01-e07 |	We are in the weeds
EDL	00:12:17,279	00:12:19,071	| serial-s01-e07 |	About a lot of things
EDL	00:12:19,071	00:12:21,887	| serial-s01-e07 |	For a long time until we figured it out to like today
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:24,447	| serial-s01-e07 |	We had team meetings for R4
EDL	00:12:24,447	00:12:25,215	| serial-s01-e07 |	Clinic KC
EDL	00:12:25,983	00:12:27,519	| serial-s01-e07 |	And those are for cases
EDL	00:12:27,519	00:12:28,543	| serial-s01-e07 |	You know two of them
EDL	00:12:29,055	00:12:31,615	| serial-s01-e07 |	Are sure already two of them were just
EDL	00:12:32,127	00:12:35,199	| serial-s01-e07 |	Trying to figure it out but you're not going to a jury
EDL	00:12:36,479	00:12:40,831	| serial-s01-e07 |	You know that's relatively unusual and I'm assuming you went to a jury because he was saying I didn't do that
EDL	00:12:41,343	00:12:42,111	| serial-s01-e07 |	Right
EDL	00:12:42,111	00:12:43,391	| serial-s01-e07 |	Right
EDL	00:12:43,391	00:12:46,207	| serial-s01-e07 |	Enzo sometimes people say I did some of the
EDL	00:12:46,207	00:12:47,487	| serial-s01-e07 |	But I didn't do all of this
EDL	00:12:47,487	00:12:49,535	| serial-s01-e07 |	So I'm going to trial but he wasn't saying that
EDL	00:12:50,047	00:12:52,607	| serial-s01-e07 |	Yeah he's always
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:54,143	| serial-s01-e07 |	Right
EDL	00:12:54,655	00:12:55,423	| serial-s01-e07 |	Which
EDL	00:12:55,423	00:12:58,495	| serial-s01-e07 |	I don't know people let you know a lot of her so they're all guilty they're all.
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:13:02,591	| serial-s01-e07 |	Generally feel like especially for most of my
EDL	00:13:02,591	00:13:05,151	| serial-s01-e07 |	Career I was dealing with people and I wasn't
EDL	00:13:05,151	00:13:06,943	| serial-s01-e07 |	A directorate in Innocence Project
EDL	00:13:07,455	00:13:10,783	| serial-s01-e07 |	And I had a very clear sense of which of my clients did what
EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:12,831	| serial-s01-e07 |	And that's because they told me it's like
EDL	00:13:13,343	00:13:17,951	| serial-s01-e07 |	So I put some stock in people saying I didn't do it and staying
EDL	00:13:18,463	00:13:19,487	| serial-s01-e07 |	With that
EDL	00:13:21,279	00:13:22,047	| serial-s01-e07 |	Yeah now
EDL	00:13:22,559	00:13:25,887	| serial-s01-e07 |	Some people would say I'm naive but I also think like
EDL	00:13:25,887	00:13:29,471	| serial-s01-e07 |	I've been doing this work for a really long time I don't think naive is a good word for me
EDL	00:13:31,007	00:13:33,055	| serial-s01-e07 |	You know what I mean I mean
EDL	00:13:34,847	00:13:37,151	| serial-s01-e07 |	I feel like I'm
EDL	00:13:37,919	00:13:40,735	| serial-s01-e07 |	Because I feel like I'm having this experience where
EDL	00:13:41,247	00:13:44,063	| serial-s01-e07 |	I'll read something or I'll do an interview and I'm like
EDL	00:13:44,063	00:13:45,087	| serial-s01-e07 |	Yeah there's no way
EDL	00:13:45,599	00:13:49,439	| serial-s01-e07 |	It just doesn't add up it doesn't add up and then I'll send in the very next day I'm like
EDL	00:13:49,439	00:13:50,207	| serial-s01-e07 |	My God
EDL	00:13:50,207	00:13:51,487	| serial-s01-e07 |	Oh my God
EDL	00:13:51,487	00:13:52,511	| serial-s01-e07 |	Look at the phone call Tanisha
EDL	00:13:53,023	00:13:55,071	| serial-s01-e07 |	Yes or like
EDL	00:13:55,071	00:14:01,471	| serial-s01-e07 |	You know this friend said that he you know behave this way during a relationship at this other girl I just talked to you last night
EDL	00:14:01,471	00:14:04,287	| serial-s01-e07 |	It was like he was really overbearing and possessive
EDL	00:14:04,287	00:14:05,823	| serial-s01-e07 |	My God maybe you didn't know
EDL	00:14:06,335	00:14:08,639	| serial-s01-e07 |	Do you have that like this is that
EDL	00:14:08,639	00:14:09,663	| serial-s01-e07 |	Still happen to you or do you just
EDL	00:14:11,199	00:14:13,247	| serial-s01-e07 |	I know I know actually teach that
EDL	00:14:14,015	00:14:16,063	| serial-s01-e07 |	I tell people all the time
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:21,183	| serial-s01-e07 |	You are you are juggling and everything's in the air and your Frozen
EDL	00:14:21,183	00:14:21,951	| serial-s01-e07 |	And
EDL	00:14:21,951	00:14:24,767	| serial-s01-e07 |	You have to stay there until your
EDL	00:14:24,767	00:14:26,559	| serial-s01-e07 |	Just you've eliminated
EDL	00:14:26,559	00:14:27,071	| serial-s01-e07 |	Quest
EDL	00:14:28,095	00:14:32,191	| serial-s01-e07 |	Because if you if you come down or catch one and get attached to it
EDL	00:14:32,191	00:14:34,751	| serial-s01-e07 |	You're going to make the same mistakes that law enforcement do
EDL	00:14:35,263	00:14:37,823	| serial-s01-e07 |	And I think to when you keep going like
EDL	00:14:38,591	00:14:40,383	| serial-s01-e07 |	What happens to me is that
EDL	00:14:40,895	00:14:42,431	| serial-s01-e07 |	I reach a Tipping Point
EDL	00:14:42,943	00:14:44,479	| serial-s01-e07 |	I have answered
EDL	00:14:44,991	00:14:46,015	| serial-s01-e07 |	To my satisfaction
EDL	00:14:46,015	00:14:48,063	| serial-s01-e07 |	And I have answers for everything
EDL	00:14:48,575	00:14:49,343	| serial-s01-e07 |	And
EDL	00:14:49,343	00:14:51,647	| serial-s01-e07 |	Am I answers are better
EDL	00:14:51,647	00:14:52,671	| serial-s01-e07 |	Then 1/4
EDL	00:14:52,671	00:14:53,183	| serial-s01-e07 |	Dancers
EDL	00:14:53,695	00:14:56,255	| serial-s01-e07 |	So when I read what you've given me I just think
EDL	00:14:57,279	00:14:58,815	| serial-s01-e07 |	You guys just don't have it
EDL	00:14:59,327	00:15:00,351	| serial-s01-e07 |	You just didn't
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:05,471	| serial-s01-e07 |	Nobody's really doing anything bad ever eaten people are trying to run down their leaves and talk to people
EDL	00:15:05,471	00:15:08,799	| serial-s01-e07 |	But they don't have enough to go forward but they do anyhow
EDL	00:15:08,799	00:15:09,567	| serial-s01-e07 |	Right
EDL	00:15:09,567	00:15:15,199	| serial-s01-e07 |	So people so you've got bad feelings and you've got Jay changing a story you know like
EDL	00:15:15,199	00:15:18,783	| serial-s01-e07 |	I look at this is this is just the case that wasn't ready to be brought
EDL	00:15:18,783	00:15:21,087	| serial-s01-e07 |	You don't have enough to put Adnan away
EDL	00:15:21,087	00:15:22,879	| serial-s01-e07 |	Not to not to me
EDL	00:15:22,879	00:15:23,391	| serial-s01-e07 |	You don't
EDL	00:15:23,903	00:15:27,999	| serial-s01-e07 |	Put him away means
EDL	00:15:28,511	00:15:34,143	| serial-s01-e07 |	Well and yeah and they would say yes and I would say no and I and the reason I say that is because I look at this and think
EDL	00:15:34,655	00:15:37,215	| serial-s01-e07 |	Law enforcement and prosecutors and defense attorneys
EDL	00:15:39,263	00:15:43,103	| serial-s01-e07 |	We all react like if a jury will convict then that's fine
EDL	00:15:43,615	00:15:44,639	| serial-s01-e07 |	And I think
EDL	00:15:45,151	00:15:47,967	| serial-s01-e07 |	Those of us who know a good case from a bad case
EDL	00:15:47,967	00:15:52,831	| serial-s01-e07 |	Should know that even if we can get a jury to convict it doesn't mean we necessarily should ask them to do that
EDL	00:15:54,623	00:15:55,903	| serial-s01-e07 |	Is the
EDL	00:15:55,903	00:16:02,303	| serial-s01-e07 |	So are you not does it not happen to any more where you're just like one day you things like
EDL	00:16:02,303	00:16:03,839	| serial-s01-e07 |	For the first
EDL	00:16:04,351	00:16:05,887	| serial-s01-e07 |	However many months
EDL	00:16:06,399	00:16:08,191	| serial-s01-e07 |	Ranking of the Air Force
EDL	00:16:08,191	00:16:10,239	| serial-s01-e07 |	Oh no it's not him
EDL	00:16:10,239	00:16:11,263	| serial-s01-e07 |	But
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:15,103	| serial-s01-e07 |	In order to revisit it in any kind of
EDL	00:16:15,103	00:16:17,407	| serial-s01-e07 |	Careful way you have to revisit everything
EDL	00:16:18,175	00:16:20,479	| serial-s01-e07 |	Brighten the good in the bad and whatever
EDL	00:16:20,479	00:16:21,759	| serial-s01-e07 |	And look at it with
EDL	00:16:21,759	00:16:23,295	| serial-s01-e07 |	And eyebrow up
EDL	00:16:25,087	00:16:31,487	| serial-s01-e07 |	And sometimes it's going to stay exactly the way it is and it's unsatisfying
EDL	00:16:31,487	00:16:32,767	| serial-s01-e07 |	I'm going to get through all this and just be like
EDL	00:16:34,559	00:16:38,143	| serial-s01-e07 |	Yeah an end you might and I can't pretend that that
EDL	00:16:38,911	00:16:43,263	| serial-s01-e07 |	I just thought of something that I think we should do unless you don't want to do it and you can just think about this
EDL	00:16:44,031	00:16:45,823	| serial-s01-e07 |	So just today
EDL	00:16:45,823	00:16:49,919	| serial-s01-e07 |	One of my teams and it's one of my better teams because it's a kid who
EDL	00:16:49,919	00:16:53,247	| serial-s01-e07 |	Law student who has summered at the FBI
EDL	00:16:54,783	00:16:59,391	| serial-s01-e07 |	And it's going to work for the US attorney so he doesn't have my treehugger
EDL	00:16:59,391	00:17:00,159	| serial-s01-e07 |	You know
EDL	00:17:00,159	00:17:01,439	| serial-s01-e07 |	Everyone's innocent
EDL	00:17:01,439	00:17:02,463	| serial-s01-e07 |	Instagram
EDL	00:17:02,463	00:17:05,535	| serial-s01-e07 |	But he's a really hard worker and he has a team
EDL	00:17:05,535	00:17:07,583	| serial-s01-e07 |	And we just closed their case
EDL	00:17:08,351	00:17:13,983	| serial-s01-e07 |	And he came to me tonight and said are you going to find me another good case and I said yeah let me flip through tonight and see what we got
EDL	00:17:13,983	00:17:15,519	| serial-s01-e07 |	I'm sitting here thinking
EDL	00:17:15,519	00:17:16,031	| serial-s01-e07 |	Wait
EDL	00:17:16,799	00:17:18,591	| serial-s01-e07 |	You should assign them
EDL	00:17:19,615	00:17:20,383	| serial-s01-e07 |	Oh my God
EDL	00:17:20,895	00:17:21,919	| serial-s01-e07 |	Right
EDL	00:17:22,943	00:17:24,479	| serial-s01-e07 |	That's really
EDL	00:17:24,479	00:17:28,063	| serial-s01-e07 |	YG I literally just sitting here thinking
EDL	00:17:28,063	00:17:29,599	| serial-s01-e07 |	You know it's a lot of legwork
EDL	00:17:30,111	00:17:33,439	| serial-s01-e07 |	If we had a team of five students we could get those things done
EDL	00:17:33,951	00:17:34,719	| serial-s01-e07 |	You know
EDL	00:17:34,719	00:17:36,511	| serial-s01-e07 |	With people that are being supervised
EDL	00:17:36,511	00:17:37,279	| serial-s01-e07 |	So think about that
EDL	00:17:38,303	00:17:39,327	| serial-s01-e07 |	I'm totally hooked
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:53,151	| serial-s01-e07 |	I did think about it
EDL	00:17:53,151	00:17:54,175	| serial-s01-e07 |	I said yes
EDL	00:17:54,175	00:17:54,687	| serial-s01-e07 |	Go ahead
EDL	00:17:56,735	00:18:01,087	| serial-s01-e07 |	My job unlike theirs is not to figure out if or how I can exonerate at 9
EDL	00:18:01,087	00:18:05,695	| serial-s01-e07 |	But sure if I wanted to take a look at the case on their own of course I welcome that
EDL	00:18:05,695	00:18:08,767	| serial-s01-e07 |	Many more sets of eyes some fresh some jaded
EDL	00:18:08,767	00:18:10,559	| serial-s01-e07 |	Could only be helpful it seemed to me
EDL	00:18:11,327	00:18:13,887	| serial-s01-e07 |	Went down to Charlottesville to see how they were getting along
EDL	00:18:14,911	00:18:17,983	| serial-s01-e07 |	Here is the sound of a law clinic getting ready to consider a new case
EDL	00:18:21,055	00:18:24,383	| serial-s01-e07 |	Got the scanner scanning it's little Skinner hard out
EDL	00:18:24,383	00:18:27,455	| serial-s01-e07 |	Man by anyone Deirdre can grab her students mostly
EDL	00:18:27,967	00:18:30,783	| serial-s01-e07 |	Couple of orchids come by the office she gets one of her daughters canning
EDL	00:18:31,807	00:18:37,183	| serial-s01-e07 |	You said the scanner smells good
EDL	00:18:37,183	00:18:39,231	| serial-s01-e07 |	And I don't have to know what laundry smells like
EDL	00:18:39,743	00:18:40,511	| serial-s01-e07 |	That's Deirdre
EDL	00:18:41,023	00:18:44,095	| serial-s01-e07 |	So now what we do usually in when we are cases
EDL	00:18:44,095	00:18:45,119	| serial-s01-e07 |	Is we collect
EDL	00:18:45,119	00:18:48,959	| serial-s01-e07 |	What Mom has with inmate has what is in the court file
EDL	00:18:48,959	00:18:49,471	| serial-s01-e07 |	What
EDL	00:18:51,007	00:18:54,079	| serial-s01-e07 |	Paper everywhere that's what we do is collect all the paper
EDL	00:18:54,079	00:18:55,871	| serial-s01-e07 |	And then do exactly what they're doing
EDL	00:18:55,871	00:18:56,383	| serial-s01-e07 |	And then
EDL	00:18:57,151	00:18:59,967	| serial-s01-e07 |	Put the team in we say take a weekend and read it all
EDL	00:19:01,247	00:19:05,343	| serial-s01-e07 |	Post-conviction work often involves going back and looking at physical evidence in a case
EDL	00:19:05,855	00:19:09,695	| serial-s01-e07 |	Some Innocence Project only work with cases that have DNA evidence for instance
EDL	00:19:10,207	00:19:14,303	| serial-s01-e07 |	Children's Group isn't one of those but still she'll definitely take it if she can get it
EDL	00:19:14,815	00:19:19,167	| serial-s01-e07 |	1 point deer Teresa print out of an email regarding evidence in anons case
EDL	00:19:19,679	00:19:24,543	| serial-s01-e07 |	So this is an email in 2008 from the Baltimore Police
EDL	00:19:24,543	00:19:25,567	| serial-s01-e07 |	Saying
EDL	00:19:25,567	00:19:26,079	| serial-s01-e07 |	That
EDL	00:19:26,591	00:19:29,919	| serial-s01-e07 |	He believes items from this case have been destroyed
EDL	00:19:29,919	00:19:32,223	| serial-s01-e07 |	But he doesn't have a document saying that that
EDL	00:19:32,223	00:19:34,527	| serial-s01-e07 |	Is true so we can't be 100% sure
EDL	00:19:34,527	00:19:36,831	| serial-s01-e07 |	And he's the evidence control unit
EDL	00:19:37,855	00:19:38,367	| serial-s01-e07 |	Person
EDL	00:19:40,415	00:19:40,927	| serial-s01-e07 |	So
EDL	00:19:42,463	00:19:43,743	| serial-s01-e07 |	Yeah that's not good
EDL	00:19:45,023	00:19:47,071	| serial-s01-e07 |	I think there's two things to think about there's a
EDL	00:19:47,839	00:19:49,119	| serial-s01-e07 |	That usually
EDL	00:19:49,119	00:19:51,167	| serial-s01-e07 |	In every state about evidence retention
EDL	00:19:51,935	00:19:55,007	| serial-s01-e07 |	And you can't destroy evidence until the case is over and done with
EDL	00:19:55,519	00:19:56,799	| serial-s01-e07 |	Doesn't mean they
EDL	00:19:56,799	00:19:57,823	| serial-s01-e07 |	Always honored
EDL	00:19:57,823	00:19:59,359	| serial-s01-e07 |	The other thing I'm thinking about is
EDL	00:19:59,871	00:20:02,175	| serial-s01-e07 |	I can tell you the number of faces where somebody says
EDL	00:20:02,943	00:20:04,223	| serial-s01-e07 |	I think it's gone
EDL	00:20:04,223	00:20:05,503	| serial-s01-e07 |	And then you go
EDL	00:20:05,503	00:20:06,783	| serial-s01-e07 |	And you be annoying
EDL	00:20:06,783	00:20:08,319	| serial-s01-e07 |	And you poke around and say
EDL	00:20:08,319	00:20:09,599	| serial-s01-e07 |	Can I come back there and look
EDL	00:20:09,599	00:20:10,111	| serial-s01-e07 |	And they say
EDL	00:20:10,879	00:20:12,927	| serial-s01-e07 |	Okay will look and then
EDL	00:20:13,439	00:20:14,207	| serial-s01-e07 |	Like
EDL	00:20:14,207	00:20:14,719	| serial-s01-e07 |	So
EDL	00:20:15,231	00:20:15,743	| serial-s01-e07 |	Not Fade Away
EDL	00:20:18,559	00:20:19,839	| serial-s01-e07 |	You see how I refused
EDL	00:20:19,839	00:20:20,607	| serial-s01-e07 |	Except
EDL	00:20:20,607	00:20:21,119	| serial-s01-e07 |	Anyting
EDL	00:20:22,655	00:20:26,495	| serial-s01-e07 |	It's true I can't think of anyone more optimistic than Deirdre
EDL	00:20:27,007	00:20:30,335	| serial-s01-e07 |	Which I don't know I would have guessed that after doing this kind of work
EDL	00:20:30,335	00:20:31,103	| serial-s01-e07 |	For decades
EDL	00:20:31,103	00:20:35,967	| serial-s01-e07 |	Annoying how rare it is to reverse a conviction you naturally settle in as a pessimist
EDL	00:20:36,735	00:20:40,575	| serial-s01-e07 |	The opposite is true that because your chances are so low
EDL	00:20:40,575	00:20:43,647	| serial-s01-e07 |	You have to look on the bright side in order to do this work at all
EDL	00:20:43,647	00:20:44,927	| serial-s01-e07 |	Otherwise you can function
EDL	00:20:46,463	00:20:50,047	| serial-s01-e07 |	Students digest this massive amount of paper
EDL	00:20:50,047	00:20:52,095	| serial-s01-e07 |	The next step is decide what they've got on their hands
EDL	00:20:52,607	00:20:54,399	| serial-s01-e07 |	First thing they do says Deirdre
EDL	00:20:54,399	00:20:56,703	| serial-s01-e07 |	It's a given on back the presumption of innocence
EDL	00:20:57,471	00:20:59,519	| serial-s01-e07 |	It's kind of profound saying when you think about it
EDL	00:21:00,031	00:21:02,591	| serial-s01-e07 |	It's supposed to happen the first time around a trial
EDL	00:21:03,103	00:21:06,175	| serial-s01-e07 |	Seems like no one in the profession really believes that it does
EDL	00:21:06,175	00:21:11,551	| serial-s01-e07 |	Because you can't help it as a juror you figure the guy sitting behind the defense table must have done something wrong
EDL	00:21:12,319	00:21:14,367	| serial-s01-e07 |	So dear just team starts with the premise
EDL	00:21:14,367	00:21:15,647	| serial-s01-e07 |	But he didn't do it
EDL	00:21:15,647	00:21:17,184	| serial-s01-e07 |	And then they see where that rotates them
EDL	00:21:17,952	00:21:21,536	| serial-s01-e07 |	If they think maybe it down really is innocent
EDL	00:21:21,536	00:21:24,608	| serial-s01-e07 |	Figure out if there's any way they can prove that in court
EDL	00:21:25,120	00:21:26,912	| serial-s01-e07 |	Definitely
EDL	00:21:27,424	00:21:31,008	| serial-s01-e07 |	Because the evidence is gone the people won't change their minds
EDL	00:21:31,008	00:21:33,056	| serial-s01-e07 |	There's no legal remedy
EDL	00:21:33,568	00:21:37,664	| serial-s01-e07 |	It's just those things are just after time those things are usually
EDL	00:21:38,176	00:21:38,944	| serial-s01-e07 |	Harder to get to
EDL	00:21:39,968	00:21:41,504	| serial-s01-e07 |	As a legal question
EDL	00:21:41,504	00:21:43,808	| serial-s01-e07 |	Deirdre says they should only have to prove
EDL	00:21:43,808	00:21:45,344	| serial-s01-e07 |	Anon isn't there guy
EDL	00:21:45,344	00:21:46,112	| serial-s01-e07 |	He's not the Killer
EDL	00:21:46,880	00:21:52,000	| serial-s01-e07 |	But as a practical matter she said their chances are much better if they can go a step further
EDL	00:21:52,000	00:21:53,024	| serial-s01-e07 |	State of the State
EDL	00:21:53,024	00:21:55,072	| serial-s01-e07 |	Not only is this not your guy
EDL	00:21:55,072	00:21:56,864	| serial-s01-e07 |	We can tell you who is your guy
EDL	00:21:57,376	00:22:00,448	| serial-s01-e07 |	The truth is when you can give the answer of who it is
EDL	00:22:00,960	00:22:03,520	| serial-s01-e07 |	It makes it a whole lot easier on everybody else
EDL	00:22:03,520	00:22:06,336	| serial-s01-e07 |	To walk away and do the things no one ever wants
EDL	00:22:06,336	00:22:07,104	| serial-s01-e07 |	To do
EDL	00:22:07,104	00:22:09,920	| serial-s01-e07 |	And usually there's some logical
EDL	00:22:09,920	00:22:11,200	| serial-s01-e07 |	Explanation right
EDL	00:22:11,712	00:22:16,320	| serial-s01-e07 |	There is a guy there is somebody who's motivated to somebody who hated hey like
EDL	00:22:16,832	00:22:17,856	| serial-s01-e07 |	Usually there's something
EDL	00:22:18,880	00:22:21,696	| serial-s01-e07 |	You don't have to but I always help people
EDL	00:22:21,696	00:22:22,208	| serial-s01-e07 |	You have to
EDL	00:22:23,232	00:22:28,864	| serial-s01-e07 |	Of course after looking everything over and her team might well decide that maybe it is guilty
EDL	00:22:29,376	00:22:32,192	| serial-s01-e07 |	In which case they would quietly pack up the files
EDL	00:22:32,192	00:22:33,216	| serial-s01-e07 |	I just keep their mouth shut
EDL	00:22:33,984	00:22:36,288	| serial-s01-e07 |	But what I'm saying is like I could happen
EDL	00:22:36,288	00:22:40,384	| serial-s01-e07 |	You could look at it and be like
EDL	00:22:41,408	00:22:43,712	| serial-s01-e07 |	To me I mean not to the world
EDL	00:22:44,224	00:22:44,992	| serial-s01-e07 |	Right I would say it
EDL	00:22:45,504	00:22:46,784	| serial-s01-e07 |	I would say.
EDL	00:22:46,784	00:22:47,552	| serial-s01-e07 |	But I wouldn't say it to
EDL	00:22:57,280	00:23:03,680	| serial-s01-e07 |	4 weeks later I check back in with your for students
EDL	00:23:03,680	00:23:08,032	| serial-s01-e07 |	Read through all the files if you guys think I'm not guilty
EDL	00:23:10,592	00:23:12,896	| serial-s01-e07 |	No I wouldn't I wouldn't have been able to find
EDL	00:23:12,896	00:23:13,920	| serial-s01-e07 |	Guilty with this
EDL	00:23:16,992	00:23:18,272	| serial-s01-e07 |	This is one of the things that was
EDL	00:23:18,784	00:23:23,904	| serial-s01-e07 |	Very hot when I first started reading this case was how precisely he was convicted under this
EDL	00:23:23,904	00:23:24,928	| serial-s01-e07 |	Material
EDL	00:23:25,952	00:23:26,464	| serial-s01-e07 |	But now
EDL	00:23:26,976	00:23:29,024	| serial-s01-e07 |	Do not see him as being guilty of this
EDL	00:23:30,048	00:23:33,120	| serial-s01-e07 |	I was just at this point knowing what I know I would say
EDL	00:23:33,632	00:23:37,984	| serial-s01-e07 |	I guess I have to put them in the person of interest category because he was an old boyfriend
EDL	00:23:39,264	00:23:44,384	| serial-s01-e07 |	Even that I would think like that but I see no evidence that he was mad mountains of Reasonable Doubt
EDL	00:23:50,272	00:23:52,320	| serial-s01-e07 |	Surprise me
EDL	00:23:52,320	00:23:55,136	| serial-s01-e07 |	At least one or two of them would end up on the fence
EDL	00:23:55,136	00:23:56,928	| serial-s01-e07 |	They all sounded so forthright
EDL	00:23:57,696	00:24:01,280	| serial-s01-e07 |	They said the things that trouble with the same things that trouble me
EDL	00:24:01,280	00:24:07,168	| serial-s01-e07 |	Shifting statements to police and how the cell tower information didn't fully match Jays narrative
EDL	00:24:07,936	00:24:11,776	| serial-s01-e07 |	But the other stuff AC is done with stuff I hadn't paid much attention to it all
EDL	00:24:11,776	00:24:12,800	| serial-s01-e07 |	The forensic report
EDL	00:24:13,312	00:24:15,616	| serial-s01-e07 |	Relative lack of forensic reports
EDL	00:24:16,128	00:24:16,640	| serial-s01-e07 |	This is Katie
EDL	00:24:17,152	00:24:21,248	| serial-s01-e07 |	Because in our files we have a lot of things evidence they collected that said off
EDL	00:24:21,248	00:24:25,344	| serial-s01-e07 |	We don't have reports for everything and we are curious about the results that we
EDL	00:24:25,856	00:24:27,648	| serial-s01-e07 |	Don't have and whether or not
EDL	00:24:27,648	00:24:29,184	| serial-s01-e07 |	Does exhaustion
EDL	00:24:29,184	00:24:30,720	| serial-s01-e07 |	That's why they're not in the files that we have
EDL	00:24:31,744	00:24:33,280	| serial-s01-e07 |	The liquor bottle for 1
EDL	00:24:33,280	00:24:38,144	| serial-s01-e07 |	That bottle of Coronet vsq Brandy that was on right near his body
EDL	00:24:38,144	00:24:44,544	| serial-s01-e07 |	It says they recovered nucleated epithelial cells from the mouth of the bottle and from the cap
EDL	00:24:44,544	00:24:49,920	| serial-s01-e07 |	But that's all it just says quote retained for future possible analysis unquote
EDL	00:24:49,920	00:24:51,712	| serial-s01-e07 |	But the future never came
EDL	00:24:51,712	00:24:53,760	| serial-s01-e07 |	They never tested those cells for DNA
EDL	00:24:53,760	00:24:57,088	| serial-s01-e07 |	Like a report on the fibers
EDL	00:24:57,088	00:25:03,488	| serial-s01-e07 |	Two fibers one reddish that was found near his head was fluorescent blue it's a little hard to tell
EDL	00:25:03,488	00:25:09,888	| serial-s01-e07 |	That was found underneath her in the soil didn't think they were tested against enough samples
EDL	00:25:09,888	00:25:12,960	| serial-s01-e07 |	They weren't test against the rope that was also found right near the body
EDL	00:25:13,472	00:25:14,496	| serial-s01-e07 |	I would think that you would
EDL	00:25:15,264	00:25:20,384	| serial-s01-e07 |	Be able to compare the fibers to the Roper compare the fibrous to whatever you can get your hands on and
EDL	00:25:21,920	00:25:25,248	| serial-s01-e07 |	And I didn't actually see that ever get tested the fibers were
EDL	00:25:26,784	00:25:32,928	| serial-s01-e07 |	Some things but nothing nothing came back of significance and then the fibers just fact of the fibers just kind of went away
EDL	00:25:35,232	00:25:38,560	| serial-s01-e07 |	As for the Rope which from a photo looks like a laundry line
EDL	00:25:39,072	00:25:41,120	| serial-s01-e07 |	It wasn't tested at all for anything
EDL	00:25:41,888	00:25:43,936	| serial-s01-e07 |	Deirdre says that kind of thing happens a lot
EDL	00:25:43,936	00:25:47,008	| serial-s01-e07 |	Investigators will say
EDL	00:25:47,008	00:25:48,032	| serial-s01-e07 |	Not relevant
EDL	00:25:48,032	00:25:50,336	| serial-s01-e07 |	It's not connected to what happened so there's no point in testing
EDL	00:25:51,104	00:25:52,384	| serial-s01-e07 |	So another case that I had
EDL	00:25:52,896	00:25:57,504	| serial-s01-e07 |	Anything that didn't match the the purpose or the suspect that they had
EDL	00:25:57,504	00:25:59,040	| serial-s01-e07 |	They just ignored it right
EDL	00:25:59,040	00:26:05,184	| serial-s01-e07 |	And they would say well that's that's outside the crime scene that's really not inside the crime scene so those beer cans over there where
EDL	00:26:06,720	00:26:08,512	| serial-s01-e07 |	Too far away we're going to call that outside the clients
EDL	00:26:09,024	00:26:11,584	| serial-s01-e07 |	And when I talk to DNA experts about that
EDL	00:26:12,096	00:26:12,864	| serial-s01-e07 |	They were saying
EDL	00:26:13,376	00:26:16,192	| serial-s01-e07 |	Yeah I mean if you swab that and you get some
EDL	00:26:16,192	00:26:17,728	| serial-s01-e07 |	Some skin cells are
EDL	00:26:18,240	00:26:18,752	| serial-s01-e07 |	Saliva
EDL	00:26:19,264	00:26:22,592	| serial-s01-e07 |	And it's just randomly get no hit on anybody will then it's
EDL	00:26:22,592	00:26:23,872	| serial-s01-e07 |	Then it's neither here nor there
EDL	00:26:24,384	00:26:25,408	| serial-s01-e07 |	But they were saying
EDL	00:26:25,408	00:26:29,248	| serial-s01-e07 |	But if you if you put it in and you get a hit on a serial killer
EDL	00:26:29,248	00:26:35,136	| serial-s01-e07 |	Sprite or one of two other people who killed Asian women within a year in Baltimore
EDL	00:26:35,136	00:26:35,904	| serial-s01-e07 |	Well now we've got
EDL	00:26:36,416	00:26:38,464	| serial-s01-e07 |	Enough to charge and convict somebody
EDL	00:26:38,464	00:26:39,232	| serial-s01-e07 |	So
EDL	00:26:39,232	00:26:42,816	| serial-s01-e07 |	What you call relevant and irrelevant you can only do once you have a test result
EDL	00:26:43,840	00:26:49,216	| serial-s01-e07 |	Finally and Katie and Mario were all confused by the swabs that were taken from his body
EDL	00:26:49,984	00:26:52,544	| serial-s01-e07 |	The medical examiner had done what's known as a perk
EDL	00:26:52,544	00:26:54,592	| serial-s01-e07 |	Cat stands for physical evidence
EDL	00:26:54,592	00:26:55,360	| serial-s01-e07 |	Recovery kit
EDL	00:26:55,360	00:26:57,408	| serial-s01-e07 |	The standard procedure in a rape case
EDL	00:26:57,408	00:26:58,944	| serial-s01-e07 |	But it's also down in some murder case
EDL	00:26:59,968	00:27:02,528	| serial-s01-e07 |	There was no evidence he was sexually assaulted
EDL	00:27:03,040	00:27:04,576	| serial-s01-e07 |	But they did the swabs just the same
EDL	00:27:05,088	00:27:09,696	| serial-s01-e07 |	The medical examiner's report says they came back quote- for spermatozoa
EDL	00:27:10,208	00:27:10,976	| serial-s01-e07 |	But that's about it
EDL	00:27:11,744	00:27:16,352	| serial-s01-e07 |	Which seems very thin to Deirdre that these swabs weren't examined for thoroughly
EDL	00:27:16,352	00:27:19,424	| serial-s01-e07 |	But they were never tested for DNA which is just weird
EDL	00:27:19,424	00:27:19,936	| serial-s01-e07 |	That's just
EDL	00:27:20,448	00:27:24,288	| serial-s01-e07 |	That seems very strange to me in a case like that seems very strange and you
EDL	00:27:24,800	00:27:27,872	| serial-s01-e07 |	You almost always submit that for DNA test
EDL	00:27:27,872	00:27:31,968	| serial-s01-e07 |	And that's what we're not seeing is a lab report that says
EDL	00:27:31,968	00:27:34,528	| serial-s01-e07 |	You know if it came back and that's the other
EDL	00:27:34,528	00:27:36,320	| serial-s01-e07 |	Loosey-goosey about whether it's
EDL	00:27:38,880	00:27:41,696	| serial-s01-e07 |	Not Jay not Adnan you know
EDL	00:27:41,696	00:27:42,720	| serial-s01-e07 |	That's strange
EDL	00:27:43,488	00:27:44,256	| serial-s01-e07 |	Right
EDL	00:27:44,256	00:27:45,536	| serial-s01-e07 |	So okay
EDL	00:27:45,536	00:27:46,304	| serial-s01-e07 |	So so
EDL	00:27:46,304	00:27:48,096	| serial-s01-e07 |	Is that something that you guys
EDL	00:27:49,120	00:27:49,632	| serial-s01-e07 |	Wood
EDL	00:27:50,656	00:27:51,424	| serial-s01-e07 |	Want to get to
EDL	00:27:51,424	00:27:52,192	| serial-s01-e07 |	Tested
EDL	00:27:52,192	00:27:53,216	| serial-s01-e07 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:27:53,984	00:27:57,312	| serial-s01-e07 |	Yes it didn't correct me if I'm wrong but this certainly seems to be
EDL	00:27:57,824	00:27:58,848	| serial-s01-e07 |	Quite a bit to get started
EDL	00:27:59,616	00:28:00,640	| serial-s01-e07 |	Do you have any
EDL	00:28:01,152	00:28:02,688	| serial-s01-e07 |	Metric of how
EDL	00:28:03,200	00:28:04,224	| serial-s01-e07 |	Hopeful
EDL	00:28:04,224	00:28:05,248	| serial-s01-e07 |	/ hopeless
EDL	00:28:05,760	00:28:07,040	| serial-s01-e07 |	This one looks
EDL	00:28:07,808	00:28:09,088	| serial-s01-e07 |	Point in terms of
EDL	00:28:09,088	00:28:11,392	| serial-s01-e07 |	Finding out something useful and usable
EDL	00:28:12,160	00:28:13,952	| serial-s01-e07 |	Mario shaking his head
EDL	00:28:13,952	00:28:16,256	| serial-s01-e07 |	That's because he's a pro-government
EDL	00:28:16,256	00:28:19,072	| serial-s01-e07 |	Right-wing Republican operative
EDL	00:28:23,168	00:28:25,984	| serial-s01-e07 |	I checked with Mario he said it was fine
EDL	00:28:26,752	00:28:27,520	| serial-s01-e07 |	You know
EDL	00:28:27,520	00:28:29,056	| serial-s01-e07 |	It's always an outside shot
EDL	00:28:29,568	00:28:30,080	| serial-s01-e07 |	Always
EDL	00:28:30,592	00:28:34,688	| serial-s01-e07 |	But there's enough here is what I guess what I'm saying is there's enough here that you
EDL	00:28:36,992	00:28:39,552	| serial-s01-e07 |	I think it's worth asking these questions
EDL	00:28:39,552	00:28:42,624	| serial-s01-e07 |	You don't even like you guys independently feel like
EDL	00:28:42,624	00:28:43,392	| serial-s01-e07 |	Know something when
EDL	00:28:43,904	00:28:45,952	| serial-s01-e07 |	Or is this just like
EDL	00:28:46,976	00:28:50,048	| serial-s01-e07 |	Well we're sort of humor and show the reporter
EDL	00:28:50,560	00:28:55,424	| serial-s01-e07 |	No I would I would I would look at this as this I would have a team on this case saying
EDL	00:28:55,424	00:28:55,936	| serial-s01-e07 |	Keep going
EDL	00:28:56,960	00:28:57,472	| serial-s01-e07 |	I say
EDL	00:29:01,056	00:29:03,104	| serial-s01-e07 |	They all seem so hopeful
EDL	00:29:03,104	00:29:05,664	| serial-s01-e07 |	So sure that with enough digging they're going to shake something loose
EDL	00:29:06,176	00:29:08,224	| serial-s01-e07 |	Skeptical
EDL	00:29:08,224	00:29:14,624	| serial-s01-e07 |	I felt like I did in that same mindset for so many months and I haven't found anything that absolutely tip the scale
EDL	00:29:14,624	00:29:15,136	| serial-s01-e07 |	Favor
EDL	00:29:15,904	00:29:17,184	| serial-s01-e07 |	Noticed
EDL	00:29:17,952	00:29:20,512	| serial-s01-e07 |	There are you sound really down on Adnan today
EDL	00:29:22,304	00:29:27,680	| serial-s01-e07 |	I don't know yeah you're sometimes I'm totally with them
EDL	00:29:27,680	00:29:28,960	| serial-s01-e07 |	And then other times I'm like
EDL	00:29:31,520	00:29:32,032	| serial-s01-e07 |	Why
EDL	00:29:32,544	00:29:35,104	| serial-s01-e07 |	I can't remember anything why does nothing
EDL	00:29:36,384	00:29:39,712	| serial-s01-e07 |	I don't know that
EDL	00:29:39,712	00:29:40,736	| serial-s01-e07 |	Of all days
EDL	00:29:41,504	00:29:44,576	| serial-s01-e07 |	You knew it was important that you got a call from a cop that day
EDL	00:29:44,576	00:29:46,112	| serial-s01-e07 |	Asking where your ex girlfriend was
EDL	00:29:47,136	00:29:48,160	| serial-s01-e07 |	Surely
EDL	00:29:48,160	00:29:49,440	| serial-s01-e07 |	You must have gone over it
EDL	00:29:50,464	00:29:51,488	| serial-s01-e07 |	Before 6 weeks
EDL	00:29:52,000	00:29:52,512	| serial-s01-e07 |	Had passed
EDL	00:29:53,280	00:29:53,792	| serial-s01-e07 |	Surely
EDL	00:29:55,328	00:29:56,608	| serial-s01-e07 |	I don't have that reacts
EDL	00:29:57,120	00:29:58,144	| serial-s01-e07 |	But I see what you
EDL	00:30:01,984	00:30:03,520	| serial-s01-e07 |	And then I just am aware of like
EDL	00:30:04,288	00:30:08,128	| serial-s01-e07 |	What if he is this amazing sociopath and not just like I'm being played
EDL	00:30:08,640	00:30:09,664	| serial-s01-e07 |	When I don't get that
EDL	00:30:10,176	00:30:10,944	| serial-s01-e07 |	Sense
EDL	00:30:11,968	00:30:13,504	| serial-s01-e07 |	Really Charming he's
EDL	00:30:13,504	00:30:14,528	| serial-s01-e07 |	Really smart
EDL	00:30:15,040	00:30:15,808	| serial-s01-e07 |	He's really
EDL	00:30:17,088	00:30:17,856	| serial-s01-e07 |	Funny
EDL	00:30:17,856	00:30:21,440	| serial-s01-e07 |	And you're like yeah
EDL	00:30:21,952	00:30:24,000	| serial-s01-e07 |	Here's where I go with that like
EDL	00:30:24,000	00:30:25,280	| serial-s01-e07 |	In my 20
EDL	00:30:25,792	00:30:26,560	| serial-s01-e07 |	How I'm sick
EDL	00:30:26,560	00:30:27,584	| serial-s01-e07 |	6 years of doing this
EDL	00:30:29,376	00:30:30,400	| serial-s01-e07 |	Frey for associate
EDL	00:30:31,168	00:30:32,448	| serial-s01-e07 |	Cuz I never get those
EDL	00:30:33,216	00:30:36,800	| serial-s01-e07 |	I get the innocent ones as I get these dumb
EDL	00:30:36,800	00:30:40,640	| serial-s01-e07 |	So me and my friend smoke crack for 3 days and we drink 5 bottles of
EDL	00:30:40,640	00:30:42,432	| serial-s01-e07 |	Whatever and then we got a plan
EDL	00:30:43,200	00:30:44,992	| serial-s01-e07 |	That's who I get all the time
EDL	00:30:45,504	00:30:47,040	| serial-s01-e07 |	So I think like
EDL	00:30:47,040	00:30:50,112	| serial-s01-e07 |	The odds of you getting the Charming sociopath you're just not that lucky
EDL	00:30:51,392	00:30:54,208	| serial-s01-e07 |	Very few times if I had a client and the ones
EDL	00:30:54,208	00:30:55,744	| serial-s01-e07 |	Really did it end
EDL	00:30:56,256	00:30:58,560	| serial-s01-e07 |	Date they have serious metal
EDL	00:30:58,560	00:31:00,096	| serial-s01-e07 |	Issues and there are not
EDL	00:31:00,096	00:31:01,632	| serial-s01-e07 |	Sociopathy there
EDL	00:31:01,632	00:31:05,472	| serial-s01-e07 |	Schizophrenia or florid psychosis because of a
EDL	00:31:05,472	00:31:05,984	| serial-s01-e07 |	Whatever
EDL	00:31:07,264	00:31:07,776	| serial-s01-e07 |	I just think
EDL	00:31:08,544	00:31:09,312	| serial-s01-e07 |	The odds of
EDL	00:31:09,824	00:31:13,920	| serial-s01-e07 |	Him being that and no one having detected any signs of it until
EDL	00:31:13,920	00:31:14,688	| serial-s01-e07 |	The Kills
EDL	00:31:14,688	00:31:15,456	| serial-s01-e07 |	His girlfriend
EDL	00:31:15,968	00:31:17,248	| serial-s01-e07 |	So he's moved on
EDL	00:31:17,248	00:31:17,760	| serial-s01-e07 |	From
EDL	00:31:20,064	00:31:23,136	| serial-s01-e07 |	Deirdre and her gang they're going to stick with stuff they can bring to a quart
EDL	00:31:23,648	00:31:24,672	| serial-s01-e07 |	Friends mostly
EDL	00:31:25,440	00:31:28,000	| serial-s01-e07 |	Another explanation is
EDL	00:31:28,000	00:31:28,768	| serial-s01-e07 |	Entirely
EDL	00:31:28,768	00:31:31,584	| serial-s01-e07 |	They did not had nothing to do with this at all
EDL	00:31:31,584	00:31:33,376	| serial-s01-e07 |	Maybe it was a serial killer
EDL	00:31:33,376	00:31:35,424	| serial-s01-e07 |	Maybe there's a clue from another Baltimore Cold Case
