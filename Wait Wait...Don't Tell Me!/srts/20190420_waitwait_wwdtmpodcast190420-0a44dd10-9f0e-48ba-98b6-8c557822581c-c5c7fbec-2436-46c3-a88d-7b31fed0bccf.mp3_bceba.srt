Birds are chirping and it's time to take a moment

45
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,392
To enjoy this

46
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:34,976
Spring because pretty soon the only Seasons we will have will be summer

47
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:36,000
Summer 2

48
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,024
Mega summer

49
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,816
And everything is on fire

50
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:41,120
So while we can

51
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:42,400
You still go outside without

52
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,424
What's putting on

53
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,216
Fiat 500 sunscreen

54
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:47,520
We're breathing in some fresh air

55
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,568
Taking a week off from the news

56
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,592
Instead

57
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,640
We're going to listen back to some segments

58
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:53,920
We love

59
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,968
Let's read with an interview with my

60
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:56,736
Second favor

61
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:57,760
William Shatner

62
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,296
Who joined us back in December

63
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,576
Peter tried not to

64
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:01,344
Geek out

65
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,624
And failed

66
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:05,440
So when I was a kid I loved Star Trek

67
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,208
The original

68
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:07,744
I loved it so much

69
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,024
That I used to dream

70
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,048
Crewmember

71
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,328
The Enterprise

72
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,096
Sure guys they got

73
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:14,400
The trouble with a blue shirt maybe even a yellow shirt

74
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,192
And I will get it

75
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:28,992
I have ambition but that's my job

76
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:33,344
This isn't how I thought it would go but I dreamed in those days that I would someday get to talk to Kathy

77
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,112
Dunkirk himself

78
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,648
Will now find out if that's

79
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:38,208
As good as I dreamed it would be because William Shatner

80
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,232
Has a new album

81
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,256
Christmas songs out in

82
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,024

I'm really excited to be on because I've got to tell you

85
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:56,128
Listen to the program over the years

86
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:59,712
It's one of my favorites driving somewhere on the Saturday afternoon

87
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:04,064
Wait wait don't tell me I can't tell you what it means to me to know that you

88
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,344
Listen to me

89
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,624
After I spent so many happy

90
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,392
Towers Watson

91
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:14,048
Yes but I didn't know it was you all right

92
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,840
You become quite a recording

93
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:20,448
Sorry I have I've got the two records it to albums out this year

94
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:25,824
A country music album and this Christmas album that we've called Shatner Claus

95
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:31,968
Now you're singing career if I may be so

96
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,736
So bald

97
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:35,552
Begin with the record that you put out when you're playing captain

98
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,320
Back in the six

99
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:37,856
Pants for men

100
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,160
I've listened to the whole thing

101
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:46,048
Wow cities where you did that that eventually

102
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,072
The infamous version

103
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,608
Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds

104
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:51,168
As I'm sure you know this

105
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:51,936
Became

106
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,216
Shall we put it

107
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,752
A novelty song

108
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:55,776
After a while

109
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:58,080
Ends and subjective of much amused

110
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:02,688
I believe the word derision is

111
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,712
And was that hard

112
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,504
For you to deal with with that became like a

113
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,528
Hilariously funny thing

114
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,832
We sharing back

115
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:09,600
It does

116
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:15,488
Cinder the area of the perception of silly

117
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,375
But as the singing William Shatner

118
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:26,495
We all know the famous sketch you did on Saturday Night Live where you're at

119
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,287
Star Trek

120
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:29,567
Express

121
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,103
Some shall we say in page

122
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,127
Witty remark

123
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,431
Was that reflecting your experience

124
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,015
No it was meant as a joke and I'm sorry

125
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:44,415
Did you took it too seriously that you moved out of your parents apartment

126
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,351
It's all right

127
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:59,263
I was going to talk to my mother

128
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,127
I know that there has been

129
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,151
There's been so many

130
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,431
Versions of Star Trek

131
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,455
The best one

132
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:12,831
That a lot of people spend their time arguing over which Captain was better I

133
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:13,855
To me believe it was

134
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:19,743
I don't know what the argument is about actually

135
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:24,095
Direct development directions I get together with the other actors

136
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,119
Whatever hash this out

137
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:25,887
Yes

138
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,679
Several blows

139
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:33,567
I think everybody thinks that the best tonight I just leave them in

140
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,847
There

141
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:37,663
Quandary I don't want to disturb you there

142
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,943
Metal

143
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,247
Stability

144
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:43,039
That so many people have done over the years

145
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,831
Is they do their William Shatner

146
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,135
Yes I have done

147
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,815
Can't how can I change the face of the

148
00:05:55,583 --> 00:06:01,727
In the face of the Earth

149
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:05,567
By popular demand you're being requested to do the invitation

150
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:09,151
Are the only thing I can think of to do

151
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,431
Is the episode

152
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,199
Where are you

Fighting the yang

159

Specifically one emanating from the behind

384
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:43,007
A Scottish darts player Gary The Flying Scotsman

385
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,591
In a post-match debrief

386
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,359
After being

387
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:50,687
Blown out in a match 10 to

388
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,455
Wesley

389
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,247
Sparky harms Anderson

390
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,527
Dutch rival

391
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:59,391
Accuse the two-time PDC world champion of releasing something a little stronger

392
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,927
That his signature smooth

393
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,695
Throw

394
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,999
All to gain the upper hand on.

395
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:08,863
Anderson stonetree deny the allegation instead turning the accusation back

396
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:09,887
On his wife

397
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,191
I swear on my children's lives

398
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:12,959
You said it was not

399
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:13,727
My fault he said

400
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:16,799
Even breezily relied on the classic he who smelt it

401
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:20,895
Delta defense

402
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:24,735
Anderson the winner went on to describe the smell as

403
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:25,759
Eggs

404
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,295
Rotten egg

405
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:31,647
But he insisted the stink hadn't come from him

406
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:35,231
I water expense came from it'll take awhile to

407
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:35,999
How to dispose

408
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,815
Tom's presumably supposing a mean stink eye

409
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,911
Told Dutch TV channel all cl7

410
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,447
It'll take me two nights

411
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,727
Delete the smell from my nose

412
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,943
A gaseous controversy

413
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,247
Between two players at the Grand Slam of darts

414
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,015
You're next

415
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,039
Story of the dark

416
00:17:59,295 --> 00:17:59,807
Debacle

417
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:03,135
Everyone at the international darts

418
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:03,903
Championship

419
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:04,927
Was impressed by one of

420
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,207
The first American women

421
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,767
Doctor Shreveport

422

424
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,911
Who was competing while wearing a classic

425
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:15,679
The Cornhuskers

426
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,703
Farmer's overalls

427
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:17,727
And plaid shirt

428
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:18,495
With farm girl

429
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,567
The British tabloids called her doctor

430
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,335
Pippy long.

431
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,943
The semi-final round started like any other

432
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,735
Dr. gertsen and her Challenger

433
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,015
Charles cook walked out

434
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:30,783
And shook hands

435
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:33,343
By the second round Charles cook was

436
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,367
Visibly sweating

437
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,903
And also whispering to

438
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,183
Each dark before you through the

439
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,719
His last

440
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,743
Sixth Rose mist

441
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:40,767
The target entirely

442
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,815
Things look good for the America

443
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,887
But then her behavior also became erratic

444
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,167
Stargazing annies

445
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:47,935
Dark

446
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:48,959
Turn them around

447
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,263
Touching the point with her thumb and then

448
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,287
Theme surprise

449
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,055
It's time that

450
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:53,823
Hayward shark

451
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,871
Finally the match

452
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,151
Was called on account of both

453
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,431
Contestants not being able

454
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:02,271
Finally the disorientated dr. guertin and minutes

455
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:05,087
She laid her hands and hallucinogenic

456
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:05,855
Frogg Toggs

457
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:09,439
She made in the lab in order to get an edge on her opponent

458
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,743
Sadly the antidote she created for

459
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,767
Herself didn't work

460
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:13,791
Xfinity home

461
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,327
In her last statement

462
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,863
Before being disqualified

463
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,143
An ordered off of Venus

464
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,167
He said

465
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:21,215
Sometimes dark go on the target

466
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,263
Sometimes it's hard to come to you

467
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,287
Sometimes I can

468
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,055
Can hear my own

469
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:27,359
Smell go Cornhuskers

470
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:34,015
In America

471
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:36,831
Tried to use frog or toad toxins

472
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:41,695
To defeat a republic but it backfired your last story of some Bullseye be asked

473
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:42,719
Tom Papa

474
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,511
B28

475
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,279
18 Grand

476
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,047
Slam of darts

477
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,327
Text was not without controversy

478
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,631
For the first time in

479
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,399
Storied history

480
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,191
The games with a focus

481
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,471
Animal rights protest

482
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,263
Who are contending

483
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,799
The Dart Association

484
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,335
Is promoting animal cruelty

485
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,615
By continuing

486
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,639
To use the term

487
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,663
Bullseye

488
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:08,319
A crowd of protesters heckled attendees are they entered the building

489
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,111
Holding up signs that read

490
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,903
Stick a dart in your own eye

491
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:15,231
What did the bull do to you

492
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,535
And Trump suck

493
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,423
A spokesman for safe

494
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:27,263
The save animals from exploitation organization

495
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:31,359
Set a time for the community to stop using the defenseless

496
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,383
Has its place

497
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:34,687
We went for the fox Hunters

498
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:38,527
We're eliminating the bullseye and we're coming after the flea circus neck

499
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:44,415
Jonathan haskel the head of the National Guard Association seemed genuinely

500
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,695
Perplexed by the protest

501
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:50,047
We've had complaints before but mainly about our drinking and our hygiene

502
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,351
This is a new one to me

503
00:20:54,143 --> 00:21:00,287
Alright what event is happening at a major darts tournament

504
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:01,823

505
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:04,639
Bim adewunmi one competitor

506
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:07,455
Saying that the guy who beat him got a

507
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:08,735
Unfair advantage

508
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:15,135
From Brian Babylon how an American competitor tried to use toad box

509
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,184
To hallucinate

510
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,464
Her way to Victory

511
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:19,488
Or

512
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:22,304
From Tom Papa How are animal rights

Well I think I'm going to go with

519
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,688
Why why are you choosing

520
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,224
Farts are hilarious

521
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,256
Story and to bring you the real story what happened in

522
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,024
The darts tournament

523
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:53,792
We spoke to a Jenny

524
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:56,608
There was a really strong fellow

525
00:21:56,864 --> 00:22:03,008
Fart in the air while he's inside with Larry so I can get my chainsaw

526
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,544
Steelers Sports

527
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,336
Reporter for the Washington Post

528
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,128
With great seriousness

529
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,152
About

530
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,176
The Dark Spark

531
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:21,440
You got it right you are correct

532
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:27,840
The voice on your voicemail

533
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,888
Bye-bye

534
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:49,344
Long before the fictional newscasters on

535
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,112
On Fox News

536
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,672
There is a fictional newscast

537
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,952
Esther Murphy Brown

538
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:56,000
The Incredibles Candice Bergen

539
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:58,048
Brought Murphy Brown to life for 11

540
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:00,864
7 seasons and she joined us on stage at Carnegie Hall

541
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,632
Back into

542
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:04,192
The show would never have been brought back

543
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:04,960
If

544
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:07,520
The election had turned out the way we want

545
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:14,176
Ribs if Hillary Clinton

546
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:16,992
President we would never have brought the show back

547
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:20,832
So what do you know Donald Trump created a job

548
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:27,232
That's right

549
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:31,072
Murphy Brown is not very happy with

550
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:31,840
With the current president

551
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:34,912
Oh well we got it really isn't the man

552
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:36,192
Is a gift

553
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,520
Everyday

554
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,288
It is a gift

555
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,056
It really is

556
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:47,712
I don't know how many

557
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,760
People who are fans of you now know this

558
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:51,040
But you were in fact

559
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:53,344
An extraordinary famous child

560
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,160
Because your father was one of the most famous Americans alive

561
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,184
Edgar Bergen

562
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,976
I don't think it was that

563
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,256
Famous but he was

564
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,024
I think it's

565
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,936
But your father again for those who don't know was the world's most famous and successful ventriloquy

566
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:09,472
They had a dummy Charlie McCarthy

567
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,824
And he was also a famous ventriloquist on radio

568
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:20,480
Yes

569
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:22,272
I've seen archival film of

570
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:28,672
Your father doing is acting just like people say I have a face for radio he was a ventriloquist 2 rating

571
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:29,952
Did you grow up

572
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:34,304
Really in there in your early years thinking that you were Charlie McCarthy

573
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,072
Sister

574
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,864
Oh yes

575
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,144
I was always

576
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,424
Call Charlie McCarthy

577
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,448
Sister

578
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:43,264
But but he was Far More Than A

579
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,032
My brother he was

580
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,568
We was like ahead of

581
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:47,616
Space in our house

582
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:49,408
And yellow room next to mine

583
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:53,760
And every now and then my father would bring him out and we would just kind of sits and

584
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:57,600
Once I mean a man wants we would have been the breakfast room he would put

585
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:59,904
Charlie on one knee and me on the other end

586
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,464
When he would

587
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:08,864
Squeeze my neck it meant that I should move my mouth

588
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,168
He would put you on a me and treat you as if

589
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:13,216
If you were another ventriloquist dummy

590
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:19,872
That's correct gif

591
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,712
In the 90s

592
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,992
Who starred in Murphy Brown

593
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:30,368
Which is much as any other sort of Sycamore TV show exemplified the nine

594
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,672
Is it would like The Dominic Show and of course

595
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:35,744
It became quite political when Dan Quayle famously went to

596
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,280
Not you but your

597
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,048
Character

598
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,584
Did he know

599
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:46,496
Did it was a fictional character never seen the show

600
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:48,032
But he was savvy

601
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,824
Lately his handlers

602
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,896
Had taken the line about Murphy out of his speech

603
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:53,920
And he

604
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:55,712
Reinserted at end

605
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:56,480
Did the speech

606
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:58,784
And that's all anybody talked about

607
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,088
I remember the entire 6 months

608
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,112
What's of the campaign

609
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,648

On the front page of every paper was in every

611
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:09,024
Political cartoon every editorial

612
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,560
It just didn't let up

613
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,656
Time for

614
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:16,960

I didn't say please don't I just didn't

623
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:35,648

Trippy

637
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:30,944
Let's just say

638
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:37,344
It was a medium I was very comfortable

639
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:41,696
Well

640
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:47,328
Candice Bergen we can talk to you all day but all right

641
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:50,912
But we have invited you here to play a game we're calling

642
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:53,472
Murphy Brown Murphy's Law

643
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:59,872
Murphy's Law of course as I'm sure you know the law of the universe that anything that can go wrong will go wrong

644
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:03,712
We're going to ask you three questions about examples

645
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:05,248
Murphy's Law in effect

646
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:07,296
Did you get to write you want a prize one of my list

647
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:09,344
The voice of their choice on their voicemail

648
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,880
Billy was Candice Bergen playing

649
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:12,672
Dylan

650
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:13,696
New York

651
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:22,656
McDonald's

652
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,680
Corporate web page

653
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:26,496
To help with employees eat better

654
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:28,800
But they had to take it down after what

655
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:29,824
Inevitably

656
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,104
Happened a

657
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,944
The employees all gained an average of 20 pounds over 6 months

658
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,480
Beat It

659
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:40,064
Illustrated the concept of poor nutrition with a picture

660
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,600
Of a McDonald's meal

661
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:45,184
Or see it encourage people to go out and eat

662
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,464
At Burger King

663
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:50,048
I would say this because they gained

664
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,328
2025

665
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:53,376
McDonald's gave its employees

666
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:56,448
Nutrition advice and they all followed it and they all ballooned like

667
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:58,752
Will duct isn't that what happen

668
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:01,568
Not in this case what happened was

669
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:06,944
They live the webpage they commissioned to illustrate good eating habits use the picture of the McDonald's

670
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,784
Cheeseburger in french fries

671
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:15,136
Kill the McDonald's corporation

00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:21,536
It's not a problem here Bill Hillman was gored by a bull in Spain bad enough but

673
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:24,096
But it happened shortly after he did what

674
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:27,168
Hey was arrested for 27 different incidents

675
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,704

679
00:29:57,376 --> 00:30:00,448
A big game hunter in Zimbabwe was killed last year

680
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:06,080
When what happens if a zebra caught sight of a zebra print bikini briefs and thought he was alive on mail

681
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:11,456
Be one of his fellow Hunters mistook him for a quote balding lion

682
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:15,040
Horsey he shot an elephant and the Elephant

683
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,064
Fell on him

684
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:22,464
I guess the elephant fell on

685
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,072
At least one of them died happy

686
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:31,168
How did Candice Bergen do on AR quiz

00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:42,432

Chicago

729
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:29,952
Thank you so much we are taking the week off to me

Some fresh air

732
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:36,608
Fresh Air View heard Terry gross's interview with Conan O'Brien

Wow that is definitely true we still had a pretty good time with us back in January

735
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:46,848
Let's listen

736
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:48,896
I was a young writer turn alive

737
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:51,456
And I was the writer that was kind of known

738
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:54,016
To sort of perform my sketches

739
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:56,576
Three other writers and I perform them

740
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:59,136
For people when I get them laughing

741
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:02,976
I think Lorne Michaels notice that I left on a live I went onto the

742
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:03,744
The Simpsons

743
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,280
And I work there for a

744
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,560
About a year-and-a-half

745
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:07,328
2 years

746
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,096
When

747
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:10,144
Lorne Michaels was charged with

748
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,192
Who's the new guy is going to replace Letterman

749
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,472
End

750
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:15,008
He said you know I was just

751
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:15,776
Conan

752
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,312
He's got something

753
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,592
And

754
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:20,896
They looked into it and it turns out I really

755
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:21,664
We didn't have any

756
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:26,528
But I fooled them and here we are all these years later

757
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:29,088
It must have been crazy those first years

758
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,880
Because you know you weren't a stand-up you didn't

759
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:31,648
The following is

760
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:32,672
Performing you were thrown

761

ResCare you're nervous

763
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:37,536
I was diluted

764
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:41,888
There's nothing like delusion

765
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:42,912
There's nothing like

766
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:49,568
If you think you can't do something convinced yourself that you can and I did have a few drinks and go do it

767
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:50,336
MOHAI

768
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:56,736
Mow how dare you speak to me directly right now

769
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:08,256
Bill would you ask Conan late night show hosts

770
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:10,560
When they get home a lot of time

771
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:14,144
Remember who was a guest earlier that day at the taping

772
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:18,496
How many shows did you ask him about that can you remember the guests

773
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,288
The show that night

774
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:21,824
Oh that's a relief

775
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:29,504
Yes. You know what's funny to most points

776
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:30,528
No

777
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:32,832
You do the show and it becomes

778
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:36,416
You're feeling the moment when you're doing it and I like in the hole

779
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,696
Experience and I'm actually not eat

780
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:38,720
Even kidding about this

781
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:39,744
I think everyone's

782
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,512
Probably

783
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,536
Familiarity

784
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:43,584
Famous toy the Etch-a-Sketch

785
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,352
Yesware

786
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,632
You turn the knobs

787
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:46,656
To create

788
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:47,424
Picture you

789
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,752
Create something and then you just shake it and it's gone and you start again

790
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:52,544
Everyday I come in

791
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,336
And I learn everything I can

792
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:55,616
That I need to know

793
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:56,640
For that show

794
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:59,200
And I learned it to the best that I can and I can

795
00:34:59,456 --> 00:34:59,968
And tell you everything

796
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:00,736
Think about the cats

797
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,528
Play everything about the comedy

798
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,064
The minute it's over

799
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,088
I shake

800
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,112
Beatrice catch

801
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:07,648
And all of it's gone

802
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:08,928
And I go home and I

803
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:09,696
I don't know what

804
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:12,256
I've done 4000 hours

805
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:14,304

I know everything

816
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:39,136
Really that's a bold statement

817
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,184
There's not a thing you can ask

818
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:43,232
About hot cocoa

819
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:48,608
But I do not know well I am interested in what's going to happen now because we have in fact prepared three questions for you

820
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,888
About hot

821
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:51,680
Coco

822
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:53,216
You want a price one of our listeners

On their voicemail

825
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,312
Are you ready to do this

826
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:01,920
I was born ready who is Conan O'Brien playing for Raleigh North Carolina

Chris Kresser

829
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:06,528
You think it's just what kids drink instead of coffee but hot cocoa

830
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:07,552
Can change your life

831
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,368
As it did for whom a Bernie Madoff

832
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,928
Who after he was convicted and imprisoned for

833
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:13,952
Defraud quote

834
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:15,488
Corner to the prison Market

835
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:16,768
On Swiss Miss hot chocolate

836
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:22,144
Be Jeff Bezos who's first internet business was delivering steaming cups of hot chocolate

837
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:24,448
The people suffering through the Seattle winter

838
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:28,032
Orsi Eric McMillan who was inspired to invent

839
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,568
The kids ball pit

840
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,360
By looking at mini marshmallows

841
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,384
Floating in his

842
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,432
Hot chocolate

843
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:35,712
You're very

844
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:38,016
Peter

845
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:41,856
I want to say this one more time

846
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:46,208
It was actually a was Bernie Madoff

847
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,768
I'd like to

848
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:57,728
Noah apparently you Noah born trailer is born trailer and is apparently made of made very well for himself in

849
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:58,496
Prison

850
00:36:58,752 --> 00:36:59,776
With the Swiss Miss

851
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:01,056
Hot chocolate

852
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:04,128
Yeah you know why I got that one wrong

853
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:04,896
Believe

854
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:07,968
In our penal reform system and I don't poop

855
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:13,088
I'm shocked that they would let Bernie Madoff do that so in a way I'm counting that answer is

856
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:16,672
I like your company

857
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:19,744
People really really love Coco

858
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,536
A lot so much of it at one time

859
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:23,072
People were doing what

860
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:23,840
Amex

861
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:24,864
Protein powder in

862
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:25,632
End of Coco

863
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:27,680
So it would be the only thing that ever happened

864
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,520
Be snorting lines of cocoa powder like Coke

865
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:33,312
Orsi's trying to have a trans

866
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:35,360
Infused into their body instead of blood

867
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,640
Answer is

868
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,432
Snorting

869
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,712
Cocaine

870
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:42,272
Will cocoa as cocaine

871
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,344
Sorry I slept there

872
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,648
Yeah I heart

873
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,232
Answer is be snorting cocoa

874
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:57,888
Snorting chocolate was championed by a Belgian

875
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:59,680
Chocolate who invented a little device that

876
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:00,704
Cocoa powder

877
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:03,264
I know that engineer and I work with him

878
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,080
Have you tried the snorting coke

879
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:09,408
I guess I have it's fantastic there's an incredible High

880
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:12,224
It lasts for about 20 minutes

881
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:17,088
And then you have to cough out the marshmallows but

882
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:19,136
The wonderful experience

883
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:23,744
When you wake up you're wearing German shorts I don't know why

884
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:26,560
All right let's go so you can get this right

885
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:30,656
For True chocolate lovers there's a pill created by a French scientist

886
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:31,424
Which Resort

887
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,448
$13 a bottle

888
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,728
Will do what

889
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:36,288
Hey make anything you eat including meat

890
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:37,056
Taste like

891
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,104
B make your farts

892
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:39,872
Smell like

893
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:42,688
4C it gives you chocolate dandruff

894
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:44,992
Instead of dry skin you shed chocolate

895
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,528
The answer is a

896
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:48,832
Your answer is a that makes anything you eat

897
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:53,440
Sweet like chocolate

898
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:54,976
Yes

899
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:57,024
Chocolate chocolate chocolate

900
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,072
It's B

901
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,632
I'm sorry

902
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:02,912
But yes

903
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:03,936
The idea is

904
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:05,728
It's a little pill and you take it

905
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:06,752
If you take it

906
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:10,336
Your farts smell like chocolate option

907
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,896
You know what I'm going to tell you something I didn't go for that

908
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:18,272
Because it's scatological I don't work blue I didn't realize this was

909
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:19,552
Is that kind of show

910
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:25,184
But I guess it's all about farts now

911
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,512
With you and I hope you're proud of yourself

912
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,816

00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:10,400
Put it on the side of a building

949
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:18,848
Lake Theater

950
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:20,128
Himself and his new wife

951
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:22,688
42 ft High each of them

952
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:26,016
Rebuilding loans in New York

953
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:32,672
Harry macklowe is now divorced and happily remarried and what better way to celebrate than rub it in everybody's face

954
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,536
What they found out that he's not legally allowed to rub things in other people's faces

955
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:42,144
Photos of himself and his bride

956
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,704
On the sides of one of his Park Avenue buildings

957
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:51,616
He said quote since I wasn't getting married during the summer in the Hamptons it wasn't able to hire an airplane with a banner to go up and down

958
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:52,640
Down the shore line

959
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:55,711
The Hamptons losses are game the pictures are big enough

960
00:41:56,223 --> 00:42:02,367
So you can see the realization in the new mrs. Mac close eyes that this maybe wasn't a good idea

961
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:08,767
What sounds like he's definitely over is at

962
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:20,031

00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,863
Join this on stage

976
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:47,423
When we went down to Orlando in November

977
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:48,703
Peter Looks So Thai

978
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:49,471
Tiny neck

Converse of the like the basketball stuff

980
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:58,431
How is it that someone

981
00:42:59,199 --> 00:42:59,711
The size of the

982
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:00,735
The Statue of Liberty

983
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:03,551
Is a small forward

984
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:06,111
I would like to think of myself as a

985
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:09,183
The powerful small forward of a mixture of

986
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:12,255
A couple of

987
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:13,023
Yeah yeah

988
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:14,303
I was kind of like a lot of

989
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:15,327
Maybe a hyphen

990
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:19,679
Is the power forward more of a ball hog

991
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:21,471
It sounds like a small forward as nice

992
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:25,311
When it comes to rebounding yes

993
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:27,359
Ball hog

994
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:30,687
It says you like to be

995
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,759
Apparently your father play

00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:36,063

1001
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:43,999
He plays in them

1002
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:45,279

Gruesome

1008
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:02,943
Forest View trash talk

1009
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:08,575
Alright tell me something

1010
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,623
It's kind of like the

1011
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:11,647
Saying I'm the younger

1012
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:12,927
Right so

1013
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:15,487
Just by Nature on the most annoying

1014
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:23,935
Yeah

1015
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:24,703

00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:27,007
Do you like it leave your NBA contract out

1017
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:30,591
The table

00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:40,063
Oh some money fell out of my pocket

1019
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:43,391
For your enthusiasm for the slam dunk

1020
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:44,415
Yes yes

1021
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:48,767
You did you did a slam dunk and what you vaulted

1022
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:51,583
On top of and then over

1023
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:52,351
The mascot

1024
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:57,727
And you just you just going to stand there and I'm going to jump up

1025
00:44:57,983 --> 00:45:00,031
Put my hands on your head and go over you and

1026
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:01,311
You're going to hold up the ball and

1027
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:02,335
The mascot was like

1028
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:08,223
Is actually

1029
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:08,991
It is really funny

1030
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:09,759
Because

Who is head

1036
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:22,559

When I was practice

1038
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,119
Who sang I couldn't get the grip of

1039
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:25,887
The ball right

Stuff

1042
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:33,823
Buddy you might need to take the Stars off your head

1043
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:37,919
And he's really going to take one for the team music player

1044
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:40,223
We did it and I got the dunk

1045
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:42,527
The sadness

1046
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:05,567

Tampa Florida

1056

Okay portable

1057
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:40,127
One of the great magicians of the late 19th century was

1058
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:40,895
Harry

1059
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:41,663
Color

1060
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:44,479
How did Keller learn to do his greatest trick

1061
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,527
The levitating woman was it a

1062
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:47,551
If he was a practicing

1063
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:48,319
Buddhist wheel

1064
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:49,343
Enlightenment

1065
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:51,391
Was given control over gravity

1066
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:55,743
Be he tired of the woman to a thousand trained fleas who

1067
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:56,511
The flu or upward

1068
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:01,119
4C he walked up on stage while another magician was doing

1069
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:02,399
The Trek ran around back to

1070
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:03,167
To see what was done

1071
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:04,447
And then ran away

1072
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:11,615
I'm going to go with the latter

1073
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:15,455
Pretty daring how you get to be a legend of magic

1074
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:20,319
Alright second as well another great Magician of that Golden Era of magic was

1075
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:21,599
Was Carter the Great

1076
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:22,623
And one of his

1077
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:23,391
Famous tricks

1078
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:24,415
Was which of these

1079
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:26,463
The magical divorce

1080
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:28,767
A trick in which he made his own wife this

1081
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:30,559
Sapir

1082
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:32,351
Be the disappearing theater

1083
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:33,631
How much the entire audio

1084
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:34,399
And found itself

1085
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:36,703
Suddenly vacant lot sitting on their butts

1086
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:40,799
4C the vaguely disquieting meal

1087
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:42,079
In which Carter age

1088
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:43,103
An ear of corn

1089
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:44,127
Raw

1090
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:47,455
I think I'm going to go with B

1091
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:51,039
It would be the disappearing theater all the sudden everybody was out there sitting in there about 2.

1092
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:53,087
That's the one that's the one

1093
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:53,855
Skip it

1094
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:57,439
I'm sadly he missed his shot now I'm afraid

1095
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:59,231
It was actually the magical divorce

1096
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:00,767
He made his wife disappear

1097
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:02,047
His wife eventually

1098
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:03,327
Decided that wasn't funny

1099
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:10,495
Check to the Phantom bride

1109
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:31,743
