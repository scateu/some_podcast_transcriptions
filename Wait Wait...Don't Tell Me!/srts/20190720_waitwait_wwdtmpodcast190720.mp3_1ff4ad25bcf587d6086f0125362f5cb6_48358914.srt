In the foot

111
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,303
The thing is is that

112
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,607
Three of the women

113
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:53,887

That was really ugly.

127
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,887
The fact is

128
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,679
You got to get the president this

129
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:30,239

When you are 30 years old

150
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,767
The images were all a

151
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,047
Springerle realistic

152
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,327
They could replace

153
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,607
The previous technology

154
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,375
For finding out

155
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,399
Look like old

156
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,423
Looking at you

157
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,191
Your parents

158
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:37,311
What does it mean if you run the photo through the app

159
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,335
And you just get back up

160
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,359
Picture of a coffin

161
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:47,295
What I like your cuz I want to marry a guy who's like 30 years older than me.

162
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:54,463
So I'm going to upload all my faceapp photos onto my dating profile so he'll be like oh nice old lady just like me

But here's the thing

166
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,935
And you might have heard this too

167
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:06,239
It turns out the app was made by

168
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,519
Russian programmer

169
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:12,383
The Democrats led by Chuck Schumer advise people to delete the app immediately and make sense

170
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,663
The Dems need

171
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,431
To stop it

172
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:17,759
The Russians use that old face technology and Joe Biden

173
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,807
It'll just be a picture of a handful of dust

174
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,135
And sadly they already got to Bernie

175
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,719
Your last quote

176
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,511
Is about a big shake-up

Buy movies

178
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,607
Who cares if it's a woman

179
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:34,911
As long as she still drinks martinis

180
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,447
Kills bad guys

181
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,471

James Bond or technically agents oo7 but that doesn't matter because

190
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,815
Cuz no one cares less

191
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,351

He would always video conferencing

Contacted by reporters

384
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:37,887
Some staff mentioned seeing a surfboard in the background

385
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:41,215
A nosing that in hindsight it was unlikely he was using

386
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,239
To surf

How to resign was

418
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:41,375
One week after foxhoven sent an agency-wide email

Reminding employees to Mark Tupac's birthday

420

00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:22,335
You can talk you can talk you can picture you can talk you can talk all you want but it's different

431
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:37,439
Jerry foxhoven fired from job in the Iowa state government because apparently I have his overly enthusiastic capricia

432
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,975
Creation of Tupac Shakur

433
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:42,303
Your last story of a dishonorable discharge comes from Alonzo

434
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,071
Boden

435
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,119
Jerry foxhoven loves Iowa

00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:47,167
He Loves Us State cities

437
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,191

00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,727
The fields the highways

439
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,519
He loves I was human

440
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,055
And he loves providing them

441
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:53,823
Services

442
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,359
Which is good because

443
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:57,151
Is the Iowa state director of

444
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:57,919
Human Services

445
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,711
But there was one problem

446
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,247
Jerry foxhoven

447
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,271
Heat score

448
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:05,343
It started with a Facebook page

449
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,367
Recalled corn

450
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,647
What is a devil's brain

451
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:10,719
Jerry posted all the reason

452
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:13,023
Since he hates corn it gets caught in your teeth

453
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,303
It's hard to the Jets

454
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,095
Corn on the cob is a

455
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,631
Sloppy mess on your finger

456
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:20,447
The page grew in popularity

457
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,471
What other haters

458
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,239
Chiming in

459
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:25,055
An unpopped popcorn cracked my tooth

460
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:27,359
If I want to know what I ate the night with

461
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,639
Before I keep a diary

462
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:38,879
It even. Political with a tax on ethanol fuel subsidies or the corn lobbies influences on Congo

463
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,439
The problem with this is Facebook

464
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,207
Is public

465
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:45,279
And when corn Farmers saw the page they went straight to the governor

466
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:48,095
You can't be coming over the corn state in Havasu

467
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:48,863
Senior point

468
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:49,887
I hate corn

469
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,703
Rebecca Shields a reporter from the Iowa Gazette

470
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,983
Asphalt Tobin

471
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,007
Why the hatred

472
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:55,775
Corn

473
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,311
Beethoven said

474
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,103
Can you eat corn everyday is a

475
00:19:59,359 --> 00:19:59,871
Child in

476
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,407
I just got so sick of it

477
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,943
He thought it would be funny to

478
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,479
After that

479
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,247
Sportage join

480
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,015
When is Paige

481
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,295
Became a real thing and it

482
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,319
Spun out of his car

483
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,087
Control

484
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,367
He sighed

485
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:12,159
I guess in the end

486
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,183
Korn one

487
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,743
All right

488
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:22,143
It really is a guy named Jerry foxhoven really is 56 years old and he really

489
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,423
Weather this week

490
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:25,727
The head of Human Services for the state of Iowa

491
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,007
Why

492
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:29,311
Was he fired was it because

493
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:33,407
From maid he didn't actually live in or at ever been to Iowa

494
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,967
From Morocco

495
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:36,991
Overt

496
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:40,319
And perhaps over enthusiasm for the rapper

497
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,343
Tupac Shakur

498
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,111
Or

499
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:42,879
From

500
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,159
Alonzo

501
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:44,927
He just

502
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,463
Heated corn too much

503
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:48,767
Which of these are the real reasons

504
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:49,535
We Believe

505
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,559
For his termination

506
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,375
I'll have to be more raucous

507
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:59,775
Story story of the complete Yasmin for Tupac Shakur

508
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:04,383
Alright you picked his now it's amazing because we were able to get in touch

509
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,919

In question

511
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:07,967
Himself

512
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:13,599
My favorite song by Tupac

513
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:17,440
That was Jerry foxhoven he loves Tupac Shakur

514
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:21,280
Almost as much as he used to love Iowa state bureaucracy

515
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:25,632
Congratulations you got it right

516
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:32,288

00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:51,488
And now the game where we ask people who've been through a lot

520
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:52,512
To go through

521
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:53,536
Thing else

522
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:58,656
Not my job Piper Kerman was a happy-go-lucky young woman when she just happened

523
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,448
Happily go to Europe

524
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,728
Put some drug money

525
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,008
And got unlucky

526
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,848
Ended up serving a year in a women's prison but you know all that

527
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:09,152
Because she wrote a book about her experience

528
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:12,480
It's called Orange is the New Black which was adapted into the hit next

529
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,248
Flick series

530
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:17,088
Can I spend more time in prison here in Ohio teaching writing to inmates

531
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:19,392
Piper Kerman welcome to wait wait don't tell me

532
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:31,680
Have you put away is it is it all is it all right that we tell people that you're here in Ohio are you still on the Run

533
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,960
I mean I don't know what your status

534
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:36,288
I am not on the lam and I yeah I've been living

535
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,568
When you're in Ohio for all

536
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,592
5 years

537
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,712
Fantastic and end

538
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:45,248
Believe everybody knows your

539
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,016
Story but maybe not

540
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:50,368
You were a young woman living in Soviet a fancy free

541
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,904
This is back in the early 90s

542
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,696
And you had a friend

543
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:57,024
Who asked you to do this are into bringing some money

544
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,304
Which was ill-gotten

545
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:00,864
She asked me to carry a bag of money from

546
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,888
Chicago to Brussels

547
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,752
Write what you did yes I did and and just to be clear you knew this was not like

548
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:09,568
Legit

549
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:11,872
And you did that

550
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:13,920
And then you extricated yourself

551
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:17,504
From that delicious Japan that life but then some years later there was a knock on your door

552
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,552
Many years later the sundress

553
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,320
It was actually.

554
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:22,624
As a metaphor

555
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,392
All right

556
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:25,952
And to make a long and ultimately profit

557
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,256
You are ended up

558
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,792
Pleading guilty to charges

559
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:30,560
What is money laundering

560
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,864
And went off to Danbury State Prison

561
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,400
Yes Federal

562
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,168
Federal Prison

563
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:38,496
The book obviously is in

564
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:39,264
Is a memoir

565
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,288
It's nonfiction

566
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,336
They took some liberties

567
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:46,432
The book is a true story and the

568
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:48,480
The show takes the book

569
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,760
Put in a blender and put the

570
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:50,528
A lot of other

571
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:55,904

572
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:57,696
Fan of the

Okay where and all the people all the wonderful

575
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:03,584
Back in prison

576
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,376
Although now you were doing it as an instructor

577
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,168
And so what are you doing

578
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:07,936
It

579
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:09,728
Teach a true story

580
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:11,264
Braiding class

581
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,288
A class

582
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:13,824
Commanding right

583
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,616
True stories from their own life as

584
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:16,640
Flea memoir

585
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,176
And and

586
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:18,944
Where are you doing

587
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,992
I do that at the Ohio State

588
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,528
Reformatory for women

589
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:25,088
Which is right smack-dab in the

590
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:25,856
Middle of the state

591
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,648
And then at the Marion Correctional

592
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,184
From that

593
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,744
Liberty to the mende of your famous prison recipes

594
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,536
They were very interest

595
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:35,584
Cheesecake recipe actually at the men's

596
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,864
Facility the women all knew how to

597
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,448
Do it

598
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,216
Cooking with

599
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:43,520
Which I did not think was the thing that happened

600
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,800
In prison

601
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,336
Turns out the food in the chow hall

602
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:47,872
Pretty bad

603
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:48,640
Skills of the

604
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:49,920
Prisoners are much better

605
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:51,968
Other materials are kind of rough

606
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:57,088
To work

607
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,624
Exercise was

608
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,648
What are the few things youku

609
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:01,440
Could you to spend your time you ended up at least

610
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,720
The first looking pretty great

611
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:05,280
I ran a half-marathon when I was in

612
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:06,560
That's really boring

613
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:10,400
Where do you how do you run a half marathon

614
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:16,800
You run a half marathon around 1/4 Mile gravel track

615
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,592
Wow

616
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:20,384
So you but as you said

617
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,456
Chat with the food Hall was terrible so you started cooking for yourself how do you make a

618
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,224
Good cheesecake

619
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,552
To make a cheesecake in prison

620
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:29,088
Unidays

621
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,368
Tupperware bowl

622
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,904
You have to have that after

623
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,952
The commissary or borrowing

624
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,256
You make a cross out of

625
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,048
Smashed up graham crackers

626
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,584
Or Oreo.

627
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:45,728
You need some margarine that

628
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:46,496
You've stolen

629
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:47,520
From the chow hall

630
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:49,056
That is the only

631
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:50,336
Stolen ingredients

632
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:53,408
In this recipe which makes it novel and notable

633
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,736
And then for the filling

634
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,016
You take those

635
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,296
Cheeses that don't

636
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:00,576
Refrigerated

637
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,880
You need about a half a cup of pudding

638
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:03,904
You can usually get

639
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,464
And

640
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,000
User to beat those things

641
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:09,536
Viciously together

642
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:10,304
Shoulder cream

643
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:16,448
And then you get a beating on it down on the pudding and cheese

644
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:19,776
And you also start to add an inch

645
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,312
Tire thing of

646
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,080
Kimora

647
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:26,432
About yay tall I'm making I'm putting my hands about 8

648
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,456
10 more is the

649
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:30,784
Powdered powder substitute

650
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:35,392
You put that in there the whole can

651
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:38,464
Container you try not to think about what

652
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:44,864
What's going at what's in there right and you mix and you mix and then it actually what you have is kind of

653
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:46,912
Yes yes well

654
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:47,936
Then you take

655
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:48,960
The Plastics

656
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:49,984
Squeezed lemon

657
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,776
And you put I would

658
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:52,800
Is really most

659
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:53,568
Cast of The Lemon

660
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,104
Squeeze that in

661
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:55,872
What is a mix

662
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:59,200
And it tightens up I attribute whatever

663
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,224
Mysterious things are

664
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:00,992
Contained in

665
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,808
But

666
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:05,344
Remarkably like the tech

667
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,368
Picture of

668
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,392
A New York

669
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:10,464
Cheesecake

670
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,304
So it seems if you're in prison

671
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:20,704
You've got to get a Food Network show

672
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:26,080
Well Piper Kerman it is a pleasure to talk to you we have invited you here

673
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:28,384
Play a game that we're calling

674
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:30,432
Blunder

675
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,552
Do you busted and as we discussed serve time for money one

676
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:37,856
Wondering which made us wonder how much you know about the mortar

677
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,136
What kind of laundry

678
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:42,720
Questions about

679
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:43,488
What they call

680
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,280
Clothing laundering

681
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:49,888
They might like on our show on their voicemail

682
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,680
Bill who is Piper Kerman playing for

683
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:52,960
Sofia Carson

684
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:53,984
Ohio

685
00:27:54,496 --> 00:28:00,640
Who's here with her family today

686
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:06,784
Who's the first question American Pioneers had to bring invented way of dealing with dirty

687
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,064
He closed what was it a

688
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:10,112
Sticking them in the old face

689
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,392
Geyser in Yellowstone

690
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,696
And waiting for it to erupt

691
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:16,000
Be shooting their laundry

692
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:16,768
Tree with quotes

693
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,792
Soap shop

694
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:22,144
Or see just standing there a buffalo and blaming the animal

695
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:33,152
I'm going to go with Old Faithful you're exactly right

696
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:39,552
Direct flights for as they say they were to stick their laundry in the guys or wait for it to go up the laundry with blowout in the air they pick it up

697
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,856
That's what I was just absolutely

698
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,696
While he was writing Walden

699
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:48,256
Henry David Thoreau of course shot himself off

700
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,280
Civilization

701
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,048
That made

702
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:51,328
80s clothes

703
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,096
Kleen Def

704
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:53,632
What clever technique

705
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:54,912
Did Thoreau used

706
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:55,936
To get his clothes

707
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:56,704
Queen

708
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,240
During his year living at

709
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,544
Coat his clothes

710
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,312
Is in honey

711
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:02,592
Let the

712
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:03,360
The Bears

713
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,384
Lick them clean

714
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:08,224
He used his philosophical insights to

715
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,504
To convince the clothes

716
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,528
To turn away

717
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:11,296
From dirt

718
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:16,416
Or see he walked the mile into town and had his mom do it for

719
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:24,864
This is so easy

720
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:29,728
Walden isn't that far out of town they also brought food for

721
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:35,616
All right last question nowadays things of course in laundry as with everything else it's all high-tech

722
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:37,152
Astronauts on the international

723
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,176
Small space station

724
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:40,480
Do their laundry how

725
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:42,784
Buy laser

726
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:46,112
Be hanging them on a line outside

727
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:52,768
Or see loading their dirty laundry into a cargo spaceship and letting it burn up on

728
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:53,536
On re-entry

729
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:56,864
I think it's basically a virgin

730
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:58,400
Disposable underwear I'm going to go

731
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:05,056
You're exactly right there's no water up there it's much easier to bring up Fremont

732
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:08,640
Cargo ship hit the old laundry in the ship and let it burn up on me

733
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:10,176
You're exactly right

734
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:11,968
Billie Piper doing our quiz

Which sounds gross but when the entree every night is Larks tongues you want to drown it

816
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:54,432

Babe this week the website Lifehacker posted their advice for avoiding stress while fly

830
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,368
We all need that

00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,416
Their number one tip is what

832
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:38,208
Don't fit in the window

833
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,232
Really

834
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,256
Because

835
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:42,560
Did I do know that I was just air ticket

836
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:45,120
I did not know that it is the worst

837
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,656
Because it changes your voice

838
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:50,240
And this thing happened to me where I was sick and then I said to

839
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:53,824
Child sitting beside me I was stuck in the window so I said

840
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:54,848
I felt like I would

841
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:55,616
To be sick

842
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:56,896
As I said to the child

843
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:58,432
Give me can you just

844
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,480
Go to the

845
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:01,504
Interrelated

846
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:04,064
And then they took so long

847
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:10,464
With their iPad and their headphones

848
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:13,024
And then I turned to the times that I said

849
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:29,664
Who is that

850
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:35,552
On the kids on the front on my says somehow on the kids

851
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:40,928
Parents sitting behind me

852
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:47,328
I was really you know it was extraordinary I was almost

853
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:49,120
Charming

854
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:54,496
So what do you love

855
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:58,336
The question was what is the number one thing

856
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:00,640
Prey lovely relaxing easy

857
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:01,920
Don't eat pasta

858
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:05,504
Tempesto before you get it

859
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,624
Imma give you a hint this just doesn't sound crazy it's only crazy to anybody who's ever done

860
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:11,648
The third visor

861
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:14,976
I'll take a red-eye cigarette

862
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,256
School give it to whoever said it

863
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:21,120
11 p.m. gets in at 5 a.m.

864
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:21,888
Security lines

865
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:23,168
Shorter the tickets are cheaper

866
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:25,216
Play the more likely to be empty

867
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:29,056
But that's because no one else is stupid enough to take the red off

868
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:31,360
The main argument that was that you'll sleep better

869
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:32,896
Would make sense

870
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,432
Except for the fact

871
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:35,968
50 flight is named

872
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:37,248
After what happened

873
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:43,648
To you when you do not sleep that's why it's called that guy over right eye

874
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:49,280
Absolutely I think the thing to do is find out what flight made

875
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:55,680
Amazon at 9

876
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:11,552

884
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:29,216
It's like an hour

885
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:31,008

Well I work as a Forester but the dream is to be a stay-at-home mom

887
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:38,176
You work as a Forester

888
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:42,272
Isn't it usually the other way around the people that home with their cats wish they could be out in the forest

889
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:44,576
Maybe that might have to

890

A product currently known in the US as like what

The food

913
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:33,472
This food made of thin air has a consistency

914
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,008
They say similar to weed

915

Using electricity

923
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:50,624
Somehow creating edible protein

924
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:52,928
That gives you

925
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:57,280

Food of the people's hands
