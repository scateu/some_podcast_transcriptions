All right

56
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,848
Here is your first quote

57
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:57,408
Yes yes yes

58
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:16,864
Celebrating her 13th and final goal on Tuesday

59
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,912
She was a member of what team

60
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:26,080
Team USA soccer

61
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:29,408
Reigning Women's World Cup champions the US celebrated their

62
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,712
Return to the tournament by laying an absolute

63
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,248
Beat down on the Thailand

64
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,016
And team

65
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:38,624
Winning 13208 it would have been more but they missed the extra

66
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,928
The point

67
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,232
Now the US team

68
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,280
Was criticized not too much for running up the

69
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,048
Score but for

70
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:48,608
Celebrating a little too much

71
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:49,888
We don't know why

72
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:56,288
They're getting grief for all these celebrations we remember when the u.s. men celebrated their 13th World Cup goal 2

73
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,056
We just took them

74
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,080
8 world

75
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:08,320
That's true by the way the US women in their first game scored more goals in the u.s. men have since like

76
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,112
1996

77
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,696
I think I know enough about soccer the Third

78
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:14,464
Martinez a lot

79
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,000
13 is an awful lot

80
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,791
There a lot of soccer games that have only

81
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,583
There's a lot of soccer games

82
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,351
Let alone

83
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,399
Two or three was there a goalie

84
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:26,495
Yes

85
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:29,311
Did they cut to the poor Tide players every time

86
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,335
Usat

87
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:33,663
Especially the Tiger

88
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:36,991
Doorkeeper as that she

89
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,783
She look just look sadder and sadder in

90
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,807
Saturn

91
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:43,135
Didn't anybody else no one else Wonder rotate in like

92
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,671
After the 5th going to be like

93
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:50,047
You give it a try

94
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,839
That in a prior match

95
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:54,911
What they call a friendly IE in didn't count for anything

96
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,447
They beat

97
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:59,263
The Cambodian team 11 to 0

98
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,823
The American people

99
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:02,847
The cambodians

100
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:07,199
Let's play the Cambodia

101
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:10,015
All right and that your next quote is from the ladies

102
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:10,783
This person to leave

103
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:11,551
The White House

104
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,343
I showed up everyday

105
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,367
But I think

106
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:17,183
I did the very best job that I could

107
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,207
Perrin and the

108
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:18,975
The Onyx

109
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:25,631
Somebody just giving us one more lie for luck

110
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,239
As the president announced

111
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,031
She was leaving her job who is it

112
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,823
Bellasera hakkasan

113
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:40,479
Sarah Huckabee Sanders be leaving the

114
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:44,319
The White House by saying I'm resigning I never said I was resigning

115
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:49,439
Leaving on good terms

116
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,487
She said she was humbled to work with present

117
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,279
Did Trump quote the only president

118
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,071
The United States has ever had

119
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:06,079
However you feel about her actions I should say she was really really good at doing her job

120
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,359
Which was basically not

121
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,127
Doing her

122
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:08,895
Job

123
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:12,223
She really was

124
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,247
I could see right through

125
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,087
What's what's next

126
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:20,927
What is she says she's going to go spend more time with your family of course

127
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:24,255
She said she's going to go back to Arkansas to live with your parents Mike Huckabee

128
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,279
And Bernice and

129
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,727
She barely gave press brief

130
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:38,335
What was the crazy thing her job of courses

131
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,103
Just to take questions

132
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,127
The Price is Right

133
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,943
Share information from the White House with the American people

134
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,479
Who are media Representatives

135
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,759
And she ended

136
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,039
The daily White House Press

137
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,319
I think she hasn't had one

138
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,343
In about 95

139
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,111
5 days

140
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:52,927
By the end of her tenure all her official statements were just

141
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,023
Been there

142
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:59,583
4 months I think they finally like

143
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:02,399
Went to her bedroom and lifted up the couch covers

144
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,799
Great thing about this present easy has such

145
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,079
Big heart he likes

People that nobody

147
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:19,807
That's true

148
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,623

You know what went wrong those messages weren't gross enough

386
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,879
To be sufficiently offensive to Canadians

387
00:16:59,135 --> 00:16:59,647
Those bags

388
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,415

448
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:07,647
Of a environmental initiative that did not

457
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,055
Familiar with a true story

458
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:27,359
It's not to embarrass them

459
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:33,503
Just to remind them that they are other Alternatives rather than using a single-use plastic bag

460
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:39,903
That was David Lee when he the owner of East West Market in Vancouver

Steam

482
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:43,903
Wow so you were on the famous team that won in 99 with the Brandy chest

483
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,183
Final penalty kick

You got some pretty lips

493
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:10,527
What you're talking about we got to ask you about the topic of the week

494
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,807
Which was the American map

495
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,087
Against Thailand

496
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,159
First of all that was a little unusual right

497
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,696
It it was I mean

498
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:19,232
DIY Iris

499
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,792
Effects of the Thailand team that kept playing

500
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,072
Do you have

501
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,144
You know what's on fire by I will confess

502
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,192
Routing of course for the Uso

503
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,496
But I felt a little kitty

504
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:33,824
Fear the Titanic

505
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:38,176
Giving out gold

506
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:48,928
A bunch of balloons I was in

507
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:53,536
07 in Los de Brazil for nothing in the semi-finals with

508
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,072
Felt like it was 10 nothing

509
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:59,168
It's hard to be on the other side of it but like I said I

510
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:01,728
Respect Island except their heads up

511
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:04,032
Take a look at it that way and maybe forget about

512
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,056
Squash for now

513
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:09,664
Yeah that's not going to happen

514
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,944
What is it like

515
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:11,968
To be

516
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,248
American

517
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,576
Playing soccer and we all know soccer is not one of

518
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:17,344
The big Sports

519
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,112
Here in America

520
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,136
Mostly Americans

521
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:19,904
Don't care about soccer

522
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:24,256
Did he didn't like the Europeans and the Brazilians of the traditional soccer powers do they get

523
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,024
Frustrated because

524
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,048
This American tour

525
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:26,816
Thrashing them

526
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:29,376
I like it very much

527
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,728
I was just at the opening game

528
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,008
France against Korea

529
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:38,592
And there was other players from around the world that played during my time

530
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:39,616
Norwegian

531
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:46,528
French player in that was talking to the Norwegian and I was like we didn't like you and she's like we didn't like you

532
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:51,904
Was pretty Mutual playing but that's what's made it competitive that so many great rivalry and now we can sit in

533
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,928
Talk about it and

534
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:56,000
We learn to play the game and what

535
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:58,048
Another woman's game is going into now

536
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,584
Do you still dislike them a little bit

537
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:01,120
Oh yes

538
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,192
Do you know a lot of

539
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:04,960
Norwegian

540
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:05,728
Curse words

541
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:11,872
Yeah

542
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:12,640
Hidden curse words

543
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:16,224
Spiders that is there a

544
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:16,992
Difference between

545
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:19,808
Between the men's game in the women's game

546
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:24,416
Different styles of soccer do you see different things

547
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,184
If you know what to look for

548
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:29,792
That's the difference I would say right now.

549
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,840
Men are more dramatic

550
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:46,176
Emotional

551
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:48,224
Do your kids play soccer

552
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:51,296
They do a $2 and they both play soccer

553
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:57,440
So what kind of soccer mom are you

554
00:23:57,696 --> 00:24:02,048
Oh my goodness some days it's good some days is not good

555
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:05,888
Describe a bad day

556
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:06,656
So

557
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:09,216
I get to say the things

558
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:10,752
But sometimes I'm like

559
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:13,056
Oh my gosh I really want to say something right now but I

560
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,848
So wait a minute

561
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:15,872
You help

562
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:16,640
Coach

563
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,712
So that means there's a there's a coach

564
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:23,040
And this poor woman

565
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:28,672
A 23-year veteran

566
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:32,256
Of the US Women's team with two World Cup in two Olympic titles

567
