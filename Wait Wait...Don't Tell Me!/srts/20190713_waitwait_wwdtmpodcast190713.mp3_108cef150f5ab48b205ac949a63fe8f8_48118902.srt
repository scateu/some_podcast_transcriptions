Fear first quote here's the presidents

70
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:07,904
Speaking at the White House

71
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,928
What's on Thursday

72
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:12,256
Today I'm here to say we're not

73
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,024
Backing

74
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:13,792
Doubt

75
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:14,816
He said that

76
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,608
As he was backing down

77
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:21,472
Undemanding a question about citizenship

78
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,496
On what

79
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:23,776
The 20

80
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:24,800
20

81
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:31,456
That's exactly right there

82
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:33,504
Chip on to the census

83
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,272
For about a year

84
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:36,576
But the Supreme Court said they would not allow it

85
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:37,856
Because the White House

86
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,392
Lied about the reasons

87
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,672
For the question a little

88
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,696
To openly

89
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,256
The White House really shouldn't have gone with the class

90
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,560
Because our girlfriend in Canada

91
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:48,096
Wants us to

92
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,984
Supreme Court ruling against him made from angry but he was already angry at the census

93
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,544
Make some answer that impossible question

94
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,824
How many children do you

95
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:03,712
It was amazing because the Supreme Court

96
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,736
Set will you can't

97
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:05,504
Can't do this

98
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,808
And the rest of the government even

99
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:08,832
Commerce

100
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:11,136
What's the name of the Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross Asia known as

101
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:11,904
The Crypt Keeper

102
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:15,488
Even he was like

103
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,768
I'm standing there I thought wasn't

104
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:17,791
You killed

105
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:24,191
In Raiders of the Lost Ark

106
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:27,007
I know we can do it

107
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:30,335
Until probably the last week has been people trying to convince the

108
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,103
The president that you

109
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,639
You can't just ignore this

110
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,407
Supreme Court

111
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:36,991
He had plans though for the whole senses he wanted to redo the whole thing

112
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,015
Under race

113
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,039
The Trump census

114
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:41,087
Would have had only two options White

115
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,111
Loser

116
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:47,231
Can you only count your spouse if she's a 10

117
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:52,607
Well I'm sure that they probably had him take off the article and

118
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,375
Are you speaking about after

119
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,911
Americans usually refers to what

120
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,679
The blacks

121
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,959
So

122
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,263
He's got a backup plan is giving up the fight

123
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:02,847
Instead of the sentence he's just going to get Jeffrey Epstein to guess everyone's age

124
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:12,575
So we're going to go there and now we're going to quickly leave David

125
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:14,111
Here is your next quote

126
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,647
I deserve this

127
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:22,047
I deserve everything that was Megan Rapinoe she was swinging champagne from the bottle as she cell

128
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,839
Celebrated her team winning what

129
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,119
The world

130
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:31,519
Yes the Women's World Cup in soccer

131
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:35,359
In the final on Sunday it wasn't fair they were wearing their

132
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,895
Wooden shoes I mean really

133
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:40,735
And they came home to a ticker-tape parade in New York

134
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:45,087
Which is interesting because they don't have ticker tape anymore they use

135
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,647
Shredded and recycle paper that's good to know

136
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:51,487
All the time and effort you spend separating your paper recyclable

137
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:55,327
Is done so New Yorkers can throw it at people

138
00:05:55,583 --> 00:06:00,959
The women were honored with an Espy award Thursday for best team and they think the US soccer Federation

139
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,263
For supporting them 70% of the way

140
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:12,479
Did you get the World Cup every game

141
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,039
I went to the

142
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:15,807
Parade

143
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,599
And what was great was

144
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,367
After

145
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,903
The flood passing everything dealership

146
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,183
About complaint

147
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:30,655
Chili went out like this is great and said it was over like well that was terrible

148
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,191
Well I mean in the end

149
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,727
It leaves a mess

150
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:44,479
Going to the White House the White House as of course became a thing

151
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,271
Megan Rapinoe the star of the team

152
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,575
Chia preemptively refused

153
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,599
To go to the White House

154
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:50,879
Cobra course

155
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,927
It doesn't matter they're not going to be invited

156
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:57,535
Iarrapino said they'd be happy to go to the House of Representatives or two

157
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,303
The Senate

158
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,095
Or basically to the

159
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:06,495
To The Waffle House basically it is more likely that the entire team

160
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,031
Will show up at your house

161
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,311
Then the White House

162
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:16,223
Alright it's a little late for the 4th of July but it's exciting for next year's BBQ

163
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,831
It's an innovation that will revolutionize barbecues and wiener roast all over the

164
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,879
We talked to men and women across the

165
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,159
The country who are heavy

166
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,975
I'm tired of dealing with

167
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:27,743
The messy

168
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:30,815
That was somebody talkin about revolutionising

169
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,863
What condiment can

170
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,631
Container

171
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,167
I stink

172
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,703
Mustard

173
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,983
No it's so close

174
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:38,751
The other one

175
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:45,663
Revolutionize independent bottles for years

176
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,479
We have wrestled with the way to get ketchup out of a bottle when

177
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,271
When it clearly does not want to come out

178
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,807
But the problem has been solved

179
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:55,647
No longer will you struggle to get your ketchup out of the bottle thanks to a newly designed

180
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,183
It's called the

181
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:00,767
Standard inverted pouch named after a popular kangaroo sex

182
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,911
Don't get distracted this is important

183
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,679
Basically

184
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:08,959
A bag

185
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:09,983
With a cat

186
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,007
On the bottom

187
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,055
It looks like a fat

188
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:13,823
Toothpaste

189
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,615
So you squeeze out the ketchup

190
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,663
Onto your ketchup brush

191
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:23,807
And scrub your fries at least 30 seconds per so short

192
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:27,647
Do that well is there been moving to this up for a while so toothpaste is change

193
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,415
Is the sort of 2

194
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,183
With the cap on the body

195
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:32,767
And now they're going to it for everything in fact not just catch up

196
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:36,095
Oliver foods will soon be served in bags

197
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:36,863
The new packages

198
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,423
Will be used for sour cream & Yogurt

199
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,727
And guacamole all of which will soon be

200
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,519
Squeeze with great force right under your

00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:47,615
But this is kind of fun I mean a bladder of

202
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:54,015
Catch up I feel like

203
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:57,599
Can you pass the ketchup bladder

204
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,391
How did David do in Ark

205
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,671

3 right

207
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,583
And good luck to Kismet

208
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,607
Scourge of fashion

209

Thank you Peter take care

210
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,263
Write a panel that it's time for you to answer

211
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,799
Answer some questions about this week's news

212
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:19,871
Roxanne it's not just factories in cows that are

213
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,407
You know contributing to

214
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,431
Greenhouse

215
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,199
Gas

216
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:26,271
There's a new culprit adding to CO2 emissions what is it

217
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,855
Systemic or a one-off

218
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:36,255
It's it's absolutely systemic and you've done it and you probably did it today and you'll probably do it again before

219
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,023
For you go to bed

220
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:44,447
You need a hint okay if you learned about this because your dad forwarded it from his girlfriend

221
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,727
You're only making things worse

222
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,263
Will you forward

223
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:48,543
Beforward

224
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,591
Email emails

225
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:55,455
Yes the answer is email apparently are helping to warm the Earth

226
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:57,503
Only if I will

227
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:03,903
Apparently if you think about it we will sit around send emails all day that's what we do for all

228
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:06,207
That's all we do I don't know how anything else gets done

229
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,511
And the electricity

230
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,047
Needed to

231
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,839
Send an email has

232
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:12,863
A carbon copy

233
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:15,423
Somebody has to generate electricity

234
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,703
Not

235
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,471
Cutting back on

236
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:21,823
That's a great idea

237
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,151
Make you not use email because as they point out everything

238
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:28,223
Has a carbon cost for example if you decide to mail a letter

239
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:31,807
That's got a carbon footprint like 10 times the size

240
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:34,367
And smoke signals are a hundred times worse than that

241
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:35,903
Just wondering

242
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,927
A flake

243
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,207

248
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,607
Just wouldn't get away from the fire

249
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:50,751
Really Native American father says

250
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:58,943

The driveway but it's all an illusion

There's no actual driveway or garage

481
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:37,087
That was a 11 whose car was towed

482
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,391
When he parked in front of the face

483
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,671

And now the game where we invite very smart people on to play a game about dumb things

490
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,599
As we call it not my job

491
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:15,231
Jerry Fletcher grew up in Atlanta and wanted to be a rocket scientist most of us give that up

492
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,767
Once we learned it involves math

493
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:20,863
But she took to it infects you went to MIT

494
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:26,495
It and is now at 24 years old one of the lead engineer is building the rocket that hopefully will take some of us

495
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:27,775
Tamar's

496
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:30,079
He reflects you're welcome to wait wait don't tell me

497
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:37,247
Tell before we get to your current job did I get that

498
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,807
That right that you wanted to be a rocket scientist

499
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:40,831
From a very young age

500
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:43,647
Age of 11 I decided to be an heiress

501
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,183
Engineer

502
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,463
What inspired you to do that

503
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:49,279
So I actually had a program at my Elementary

504
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:53,119
School that introduce students to the fundamentals of aerospace engineering I know

505
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:53,887
That's ridiculous

506
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,191
The fourth grade I have

507
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:58,751
Wanting to be an aerospace engineer because of that

508
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:02,591
Wow Wow you went to MIT

509
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,639
And I thought that was pretty impressed

510
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:08,223
Nothing and we're told we are graduated with a 5.0 average

511
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,783
Yes it was very interesting

512
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:15,391
As far as we knew the scale goes up to 4

513
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:18,720
How did you manage that

514
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,512
So my parents always in

515
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,792
Encouragement

516
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,584
Research beyond what to expect

517
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:24,608
If you

518
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:28,192
So I just worked hard worked oh my God so many hours

519
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,472
Late late night

520
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:30,752
And I just made it happen

521
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:34,592
So even even frigid

522
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:42,272
You were you were like a nerd at MIT

523
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,880
Which is already nerd heaven

524
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,208
Keep forget balance I was still very involved in.

525
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:56,096
So many of the cultural group

526
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:00,704
Union also MIT University and also an actor

527
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,472
I can dance to

528
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:02,752
I tried to mix it up a little

529
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:06,592
Will you probably understood the Dynamics of the

530
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:07,360
The movement

531
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,112
The team like no you

532
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:21,184
You need a 25 degree angle at your knee

533
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:27,840
All of us has kids maybe droop airplanes and rocket ships I did that and maybe made paper airplane

534
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:28,608
Ranger models

535
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:32,192
But you're like you were not satisfied you wanted to make them out of like steel and make them

536
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:35,008
Apply exactly I'm one of them

537
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,032
For sure

538
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:41,152
Really

539
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:44,992
So you you were recruited by was a Boeing right out of readout

540
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,784
School rap you work for them before you can graduate

541
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:50,368
Tell us what your job is

542
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:52,416
So I'm a rocket

543
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:55,232
Structural engineer what that means is that I

544
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,512
Design various parts

545
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,792
Path of the rocket Annalise

546
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,072
And then I'm off

547
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,096
Manufacturing

548
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,400
Forget all of those parts

549
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,168
Together in

550
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,192
The rocket that you

551
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:06,752
Because your girl didn't make it to the curtain

552
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,200
Let me do that designing the rocket engines

553
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:19,040
Everybody told us that the rocket specifically that you're working on to design

554
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,576
Is the one that's going to go to Mars

555
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:22,368
Is that correct

556
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:26,208
To the Moon prayer that most recent charge

557
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,512
Hymn to the Moon

558
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:33,888
Take it like a pit stop

559
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:36,448
Before you hit Mars you go to the moon or what's going on there

560
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:37,984
Yes it will be

561
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,080
We creating a NASA Gateway in order to get ready for longer Mission such

562
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,640
Sing a habitat

563
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:48,224
Right they're going to do that first and then we'll go then we'll go on that then you're going to Mars

564
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:51,040
Personally care about Mars

565
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:54,880
I do I do I wanted to be very exciting does the point of it

566
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,160
Exploring the unknown

567
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:58,208
Are you guys going to go get the Rover back

568
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,912
Messes

569
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:09,984
You are a rocket science

570
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:10,752
That's literally

571
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,032
That is

572
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:14,080
The absolute cliche Forex

573
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,360
Extraordinarily smart

574
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:17,152
Like waiting in another phrase

575
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,176
It's not rocket science

576
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:22,784
So do you intimidate people when they find out what you do for a living

577
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:27,392
Well a little bit I guess by the title

578
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,928
But I assure them that

579
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,464
Many people can be

580
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,512
That's just not true

581
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:38,912
Very pretty to think

582
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:41,472
So and I want everybody be encouraged

583
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,360
Put know what your husband is an astrophysicist

584
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:49,408
That's right

585
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,456
Wait a minute

586
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:54,016
What's the Rockets

587
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,320
ACT test

588
00:24:56,576 --> 00:25:00,416
Exactly it's so cringy

589
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:03,232
That seems to me

590
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:05,024
Did it might provide

591
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,560
Cause for tension

592
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,472
He tested and it blows up

593
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,336
What year at home going to be like

594
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:20,384
I have to be really careful at my desire

595
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,664
Because I know that my husband

596
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,224
It's a lot of pressure

597
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,504
It is a lot of pressure

598
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:27,808
Do you ever say them do you want more

599
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:29,088
Coffee and he says yes

600
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:29,856
Sinuca what's

601
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:30,624

602
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:37,536
We do have those moments when you actually like me like you do.

603
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:39,072
Nerd humor with each other

604
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:40,608
Kind of a nerd humor

605
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:48,288
24 are already designing of the rocket that's going to go to Mars which I imagine would be

606
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,312
The Pinnacle of other

607
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:51,616
So do you have

608
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:54,176
Goals are something you want to do before you're finished

609
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:56,480
I do I'm a course I have my pass

610
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,808

Claimed as well do you want to design airplane

612
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:04,160
Any particular kind of airplanes

613
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:08,000
Oh I do love military aircraft that was the

614
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:10,304
Exact type of aircraft that I fell in love with

615
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:14,656
Really you were 11 year old girl and you love like fighter jets

616
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,568
Imagining you at the age of 11

617
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:24,896
Play playing with your friends and they're playing like with their dolls

618
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:26,432
And your jet comes in a

619
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:30,272
Pinstripe the Tea Party

620
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,088

Space Jam

632
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:02,784
Oh no

633
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:07,904
We're going to be three questions about that 1996 movie which starred Michael Jordan and Bugs Bunny

634
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:10,720
Sounds like 1 year old

635
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:15,840
That's not cool

636
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:20,192
If you get two questions right you win a prize one of our listeners Bill whose Tiara playing

Here is your first question

640
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:30,176
Space Jam with your huge success in 99

641
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,736
Its appeal is far-reaching

642
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:34,272
As proven by which of these

643
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,832
Say in an interview Neil Armstrong said

644
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,368
This movie is the greatest

645
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:40,160
Space thing ever done

646
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:43,488
Be there is a VHS copy of

647
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:48,096
The movie Space Jam enshrined in the North Korea International friendship Museum

648
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,376
You can pyongyang

He just like the vastness of space

652
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:02,432
I might need a little help here

653
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,968
I can sit the audience

654
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:04,736
Thinking

655
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:07,296

Bugs Bunny

662
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,712
He was invited to make a

663
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:39,040
Speech to the filmmakers when who were making Space Jam

664
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:39,808

Insulted the film with such Vigor he had to be escorted off the Warner Brothers lot

673

A genius

675
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:12,064
Hated the movie

676
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:16,672
Thought it disrespected his characters and made his feelings known and he had to be escorted off

677
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,208
Wow

678

00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:41,728
Mana 15 Taylor

748
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:43,264
You look for the summer had to Costco

749
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:45,056
If you need a valve beef

750
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:47,104
Chili for 399 also had to cop

751
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:52,992
The wholesalers a clothing department is booming no longer just purchased by customers

752
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:54,528
Who went overboard in the food court

753
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,808
Heated back up there

754
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,392
Stop

755
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:06,304
You don't have to buy the two rolls of toilet paper cuz when you have a hundred pairs of pants you don't need toilet paper

756
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:09,632
Pants on a roll

757
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:15,520
Most clothing chains are struggling because they're going to Amazon online shopping but Costco has seen a 9

758
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:18,592
Percent growth over the last few years in their clothing business

759
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:22,432
Maybe it's because Costco is just in-person Amazon or maybe because you

760
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:25,248
Can't find 90 cans of Vienna sausages at Nordstrom

761
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:27,552
Are there little

762
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:28,576
Sample pants

763
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:43,936
Call IHOP you been answer this question

764
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:47,008
Paula a lot of people using DNA testing service

765
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,896
Define long-lost relatives many of them turn out to be serial killers who knows

766
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:57,504
But who else is now using DNA to find their siblings cousins

767
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,272
I need a long long

768
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:03,136
In the road

769
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:05,184
I know but it isn't animal

770
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:07,488
Yes.

771
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:08,512
Very good

772
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:09,280
So stupid

773
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:13,888
Get out

774
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:17,984
Mutts

775
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:28,224
As you probably have been using DNA test for a while to check on their dogs

776
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,808
Greed and prove that is indeed and scientifically a very good dog

777
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,672
But now they're using the same technology to try to find the dogs relatives

778
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:40,256
Too many people are looking into their dogs big sad eyes and

779
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:42,304
You love to see your littermates

780
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:43,328
Wooden shoe

781
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,864
When the dog is really thinking

782
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,144
I love you

783
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,424
Because you are made of

784
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,192
Give meat

785
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:58,688
People now submitting these DNA samples and if they get a hit a match with another dog out there they are allowed to contact the other

786
00:34:58,944 --> 00:34:59,456
Other dogs owners

787
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,736
To arrange reunions

788
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:03,552
You know what I think dogs would like better

789
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:04,320
Tinder

790
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:09,952
Pictures of butts

791
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:16,352
And all the dogs are like

792
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:21,216
They can easily swipe it or we can do that

793
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:31,712
Oh man

794
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:35,808

Gave away his location when he did what

797
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:40,672
When you did

We did what

799
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,488
He gave away

800
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:45,792

Yes he did quite loudly

802
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,008
We don't know who the guy was or what he was wanted for

803
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:56,800
But the man was crouched

804
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:59,872
Hiding in some undisclosed location when he crowd

805
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:04,736
Disclosed it going to Taco Bell

806
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,832
He's not been arrested on drug charges proving whoever smelt it dealt

807
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:09,600
400g

808
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:10,368
Is a controlled substance

809
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:27,520
Coming up it's lightning fill in the blank but first it's the game where you have to listen for the rhyme if you'd like to plan are call and leave a message

810
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:28,544

Alright here is your neck

Limerick

In the one place where I can get

875
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:01,120
Cool there's more germs

876
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:02,656
That are rabid dogs

877
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:03,424
Drool

878
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:05,472
The Outlook is grim

879
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:06,752
So I'd rather not

880
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:07,520
Swim

881
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,056

Pool yes

886
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:18,784
Who could have guessed that public pools those brothy soup in which we soak our children

887
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,600
Could be spreading disease

888
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:22,880
TDCJ

889
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:24,928
Which it stands for children's diarrhea cops

890
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:31,328
Says there's an increasing number of illnesses that can be traced back to a parasite that seems to be

891
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:32,608
Flourishing in public pools

892
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,912
Pools reflection place to relax

In the summer heat in the answer to the question

894
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,728
How do you get pink eye

895
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:40,544
Here is your last limerick

896
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,592
In Tennessee

897
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:43,616
Scientists

Parallel world

900
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:47,200
Where in Morton

901
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,760
In a good upside down

902
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:51,552
Where are racing all from

903
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:53,344
We're hard at work

904
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:54,624
Building a

905
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,672
Yes portal

906
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:57,952
How did you get that

907
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:04,352
Scientists at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee

908
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:06,912
You're trying to open a portal to a parallel universe

909
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:09,728
It's kind of complicated but they're blasting

910
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:13,824
Tiny subatomic particles of the surface and depending on what happens they may get a glimpse

911
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,848
Set of parallel universe

912
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:16,896
Which has mirror images

913
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:18,176
Of the matter in ours

914
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:20,480
Except they're all the little particles

915
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:21,248
Have a little goatee

916
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:29,696
Scientists have attempted to build a door to an alternate universe for years but I won't I've only now figured it out

917
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:32,000
It's push not pull

918
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:40,704
Are there really scientist working on that there really are real

919
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:43,520
You're doing it wrong

920
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:44,288
Find a

921
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,312
Portal 2

922
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:46,848
Parallel universe

923
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:47,872
It's not even science

924
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:51,968
For god sakes high-energy physics is amazingly interesting science

925
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:52,736
There is no

926
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:53,504
Parallel you

927
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:59,904

928
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:02,720
Another place

929
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:08,864
Where someone is doing this right now

930
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,656
So you know I have three cats and I
