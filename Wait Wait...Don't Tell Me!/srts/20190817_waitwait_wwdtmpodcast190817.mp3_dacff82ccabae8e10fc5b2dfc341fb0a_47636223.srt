Right here

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,024
Turn the game back in the nineties

68
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,048
You never left

69
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,608
And this is why

70
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:23,008
I know why would I leave I always wondered about that because there's a there's a kind of cliche

71
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:23,776
In sports that

72
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:24,544
When somebody

73
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,312
You know

Jump 10 ft over the head of the guy coming in the second base and throw to first

00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,359
Did they come up to you and ask questions

Is be stagnating

112
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,327
Yeah there has to be some type of mood

113
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,607
It allows you to go left

114
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,375
After writing

115
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,911
And that that probably is

116
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,679
The one thing

117
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,471
When I talk to her

118
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,263
She guy

119
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:00,543

120
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,311
Movement

121
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,591
Cuz that's what allows you

122
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,687
That's right

123
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:07,967
Never flat

124
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:09,503
It's interesting because you mention

125
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,527
Virginia laws of physics

126
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,295

Your highlights

128
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,087
That was physically

129
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,647
Half of what I say

130
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,671
Couldn't be done

131
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,463
I always ask

132
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,255
Expression of of elite athletes like you

133
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,047
How young were you when you knew that

134
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,887
You know I don't know if you ever really knowing

135
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,911
Exactly when that

136
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:28,703
Was a kid I used

137
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,471
To lay on the floor

138
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:30,495
Roll the ball up to

139
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,287
The ball hitting

140
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,311
A hand without

141
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,591
Without seeing

142
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,615
I called my eyes

143
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,663
Hit it and got hit in the head

144
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,199
Yeah well I will happen

145
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:41,503
That's part of it but I also used

146
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,039
We have to pay for

147
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,831
I used to throw the ball up on

148
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,367
One sided

149
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,695
And run around to the other side

150
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,463
In Hope

151
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,487
Yeah

152
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,023
The ground

153
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,047
And people are sitting

154
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:54,815
You're wondering now

155
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:55,583
Yeah

156
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:56,607
Did you ever get there

157
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:57,887
Did you do it

158
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,727
I never did I never did

159
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:02,495
But it was

160
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,263
Was that type of

161
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,287
Termination

162
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,311
Yeah

163
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,079
That made me

164
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:12,735
I'm going to say again

165
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:15,039
Why can you play it just seems

166
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:15,807
Pure Magic

Natural ability

00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,879
That you could leap up in the air

170
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:19,647
Both feet

171
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,927

Was so toxic

257
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,935

Things from the movie pop up an unexpected

267
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:42,911

On the set of Wizard of

00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,199

Yeah she's a real succubus to this day

543
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,064
There's relief in that because they've done a study that shows

544
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,184

Oscar

552
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:45,248
But is it true that the thing that really sort of propelled you was the pitch

553
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:50,368
I think I should have had a really wide audience and as you say like this

554
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:52,160

563
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:13,408
I seen the two girls doing it on a YouTube video and I taught myself how to do it

564
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:15,968
Because I have too much free time on my hands

565
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:21,088

00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:46,688
Well I was looking at stomach related videos so I'm not sure how that's

575
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:48,992
Can I help

576
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:52,064
Yeah it was it was a video of a gang of stung

577
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,160
What were they doing

578
00:23:56,416 --> 00:24:01,024
They were scurrying across the front lawn and then they thought they heard something

579
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:05,120
And they all like almost started crying

580
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:07,424
Because you know that these were vile little creatures

581
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,960
Each other's backs

582
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:15,616
Do they do that like arrange themselves as I Care Central Point

583
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,640
Did it all directions

584
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:23,040
Really have it easy but

585
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:32,512
Pitch Perfect of course if you haven't seen it what is wrong with you let him tell him it is a movie about competitive

586
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,280
Acapella singing

587
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,072
Which is a real thing

588
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,096
In this world

589
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:42,496
Unfortunately I think it's pretty awesome

590
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,568
And ended your movies cuz they're 11

591
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:48,128
Three of them have they led to

592
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,920
Explosion a Revival acapella

593
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:53,248
Unfortunately yes

594
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:55,808
Do you spend some time with real acapella group

595
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:57,600
I actually didn't for

596
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:59,904
I actually had done before

597
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,928
Poor

598
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:05,536
So I went a friend kind of

599
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,864
Take me to an acapella competition

600
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,656
And I thought it was going to be very

601
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:11,936
Dorky and

602
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:16,032
And I ended up by the end of it I was like do you think we can go backstage and meet them

603
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:23,200
Party that they were throwing at their college I'm going to try to get to know them cuz

604
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:25,504
When you see somebody do something that

605
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,832
It's really impressive you know it doesn't matter if it's considered

606
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,368
You got really into it

607
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:32,160
Sure

608
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,440
Made out with a knock

609
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:35,488
Acapella member

610
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,512
College

611
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:39,840
Best night of my life

612
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:45,728
I wonder if ever like say it I could pillow cup

613
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:46,496
Petition

614
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:48,288
If anybody ever like

615
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:51,616
Whipped out a guitar or keyboard it just ruins it

616
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:55,712
Chicken food

617
00:25:55,968 --> 00:26:00,320
We we we we we wanted to do this with you just as a little sort of pulmonary for the real quiz

618
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,088
Which is

619
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,904
We were looking around it turns out that a lot of a cappella groups

620
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,184
Have really odd names

621
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:09,792
Just wanted to ask if you could tell the real ones

622
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:10,560
The fake ones

623
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:11,584
And it just received

624
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,608
How you doing this

625
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,680
So I'm just going to read the names you tell me if you think they're real or not

626
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:20,032
Oh I will have no idea but absolutely

627
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:27,200
Ohio University

628
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:34,624
That is very clever

629
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,440
No it is it's it's a big university

630
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:41,280
Sophie's voice

631
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:47,936
Not right not real no not real

632
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:50,240

633
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:51,520
Rhythm and Jews

634
00:26:54,336 --> 00:27:00,480
I love that I have bad reception in Chicago represents

635
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,040
Lana Kendrick

636
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:08,160
It is as delightful to talk to you as always imagined it would be and we have asked you to play a game

637
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,440
That we're calling

00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,208
Pitching

639
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,232
Perfect

640
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:15,072
As we have discussed you start on the Pitch Perfect movie so we thought we talked to you

641
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,864
About pitching perfectly

642
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,632
Specifically

643
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,168
A no-hitter

644
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:21,472
Thrown by Pittsburgh Pirate pitcher

645
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,240
DACA

646
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,520
Back in 1970

647
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:27,360
Answer questions about Dock Ellis no no

648
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:28,384
They called in the game

649
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,224
And you want a price one of our listeners the voice of their choice on their voicemail

650
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,760
Still who is Anna Kendrick playing

651
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:36,832
Shannon Durfee of Minneapolis Minnesota

652
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,392
Who's the first question Dock Ellis

653
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:43,744
Walked eight batters that day he hit one but he still did not get it up a hit

654
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,280
In a 9 Inning

655
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,048
Complete game

656
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:47,584
What made his

657
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,120
No hitters so unique

658
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:49,888
In the annals

659
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:50,656
A baseball

660
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:54,496
Was it a right-handed pitcher he threw this one was his left hand quote

661
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:55,520
Just for kicks

662
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:58,336
Because of the walks we actually lost

663
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,872
The game 1-0

664
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:03,968
Orsi's he was high on LSD the whole time

665
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:07,808
I mean I wish it was C but I guess I'll

666
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,600
Baby

667
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:15,744
Can you can you hear the shouts of all the middle-aged men listening to radio the radio right now who is showing the right answer

668
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:18,048
Can use cuz they're all saying it was

669
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:21,632
See ya this is one of the famous games.

670
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:22,656
Pitched a no-hitter

671
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:24,192
On LSD

672
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:28,544
You still have two more chances here so there's still a chance

673
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:33,664
As you can imagine pitching in the major league game while tripping on LSD has it

674
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,432
Challenges

675
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:41,344
Ella said that during the game he had to picture around which of these problems a believing the catcher was Richard Nixon

676
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:45,696
Be not being able to either

677
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:48,000
Feel or see either of his arms

678
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:52,352
Corsi constantly resisting the urge to take a bite of the ball with

679
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,888
Smelled like a hamburger

680
00:28:57,472 --> 00:29:00,544
It is a yes he

681
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:06,944
He says at one point he looked in and Richard Nixon was behind the plate and even

682
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,016
Where is the batter was Jimi Hendrix and he was swinging and Electric

683
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:12,064
Guitar

684
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,344
All right now

685
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,136
Dock Ellis as you can imagine

686
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:18,208
Did not limit his misbehavior to that one

687
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:20,000
Game later on in his career

688
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:22,816
The game against the Cincinnati Reds he attempted to do what

689
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,352
A picture underhanded

690
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,912
B roll the ball to the plate

691
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:28,192
Orsi

692
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,216
Hit with a pitch

693
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:29,984
Every

694
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,288
Single member of the opposing team

695
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,128

699
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:48,672
Throw a ball hit every single member of the opposing team

700
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:49,440
He

701
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:54,816
Hit three of them and then threw two balls over the heads of the next 2 and he was then removed

702
00:29:55,072 --> 00:30:01,216
From the gang of pretty interesting fellow

703
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:03,776

00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:17,920
What is it always seem self that way

759
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:23,296
What's a star athlete

760
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:24,832
Nelson nerd

761
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:28,160
Football round myself

762
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:35,328
Really I'm so uncomfortable that when you say you were a nerd what you like

763
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:43,264
When you say nerd what do you mean

764
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:44,544
Very quiet

765
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,592
Have very large

766
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,688
And really skinny

767
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:51,456
So

768
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,992
I would walk around with my hands

769
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:53,760
My pocket.

770
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,040
Time because everybody was

771
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,344

Telling me

773
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,672
Is it like you were embarrassed

774
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:01,696
As a kid

775
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:02,976
Because your hands

776
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:09,632
We're so large

777
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:10,656
All time Hall of Famer

778
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:11,424
You

779
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,704
Adidas football

780
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,472

781
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:19,872
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer

782

783
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:33,184
That is amazing

784
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,720
Can I tell you

785
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:36,256
Delighted to have

786
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:42,656
Incredibly large hands

787
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:51,360
I got one last question

788
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:54,176
It often the wide receivers lineup

789
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:54,944
Outside

790
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:58,272
In your office right across from

791
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,296
The safety or cornerback

792
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:00,064
Is going to be

793
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:00,832
Trying to cover you

794
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:02,624
Is what passes

795
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,648
Between you two guys

796
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,440
Cuz you're looking at him he's looking at you

797
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:09,024
And you and he knows he's going to try to stop you and you know he's not going to

798
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,816
I mean like trash talk

799
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:12,352
No I just look at the D

800
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:13,376
Tobacconist

801
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,312
Or Jerry Rice who's invited you here to play a game we're calling

802
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:23,360
Take a picture of antenna

803
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:30,016
Time for Hannah Montana

804
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:35,648
Reformed tandems with quarterback Joe Montana so we thought we'd ask you about that other great Montana

805
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:36,416
Hannah

806
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:41,792
You looking me with a look of confusion do you know who Hannah Montana was

807
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:44,096
The name Hannah Montana

808
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,120
Just so you know

809
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:46,400
With a fictional car

810
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:50,496
Played by the on the Disney Channel by the very real Miley Cyrus

811
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,848
The TV show about a young girl who had a normal life but her other life was being pumped

812
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:56,896
What's the plot of show

813
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:59,200
So we're going to ask you three questions about that

814
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:05,600
And if you get two of them

815
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:18,400
Are your absolute confidence you're not fidgeting in your chair looking for an exit

816
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:31,200
Who is Jerry Rice playing for

817
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,208
Let's do it alright

818
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:47,328
When Disney was created with your back then they considered a bunch of names based on place names

819
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,120
Hannah Montana

820
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:50,656
Thought of the name Alexis

821
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:51,424
Texas

822
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,216
Why couldn't they use that one

823
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:57,312
Hey the state of Texas charges royalties for any commercial use of its name

824
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:00,896
B cast member Moises Arias had a thick

825
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,688
Stiliyan accent and he pronounces

826
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:03,712
Alexis Texas

827
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,576
Alexis Texas is the name of a well-known adult film

828
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:29,056
Yeah it was he elected

829
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:33,664
The Texas they were afraid what would happen when kid fans of the show where they Google the name Alexis

830
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:37,504
I got that one right

831
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:49,024
Hannah Montana was a big hit man for some years influenced many artists and performers such as who may

832
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,560
Actor Eli Roth

833
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:53,120

834
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:54,144
Stone Cold

835
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,704
Killer in the movie Inglorious Bastards because you said

836
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,752

Beat performance artist Marina Abramovic

838
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:05,664
Hearing one Hannah Montana song conceived

839
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:06,688
The artist is

840
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:07,456
Present

841
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,480

946
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:00,319
That would mean that I would have

947
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:06,207
Today and the players have to be smart so we're not messenger

948
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:07,231
Tempo Style

949
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:08,511
Do players like

950
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:10,303
Playing for you because of that or is it exist

951
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,071
Exhausting

952
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:18,495
There's been something to happen like that and obviously I've been to different cities

953
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:20,287
I've been fired a few times so

954
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:23,103
No no

955
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:25,151
Don't like being fired then like when you get it

956
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:30,527
No they get me fired

957
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:32,831
Well that definitely is interesting because you're

958
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:33,599
Coaching

959
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:35,647
Incredibly well-paid

960
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:37,951
Credibly talented athlete

961
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:39,231
Who have been at the

962
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:40,511
The Pinnacle of their sport

963
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:41,791
For probably the entire career

964
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:43,327
Like everybody in the NBA

965
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,351
For the Superstar

966
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:47,423
How do you

967
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,191
Handle

968
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:49,215
People like that

969
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:50,751
Who are the stars of The League

970
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:54,335
Well there's a lot of groveling and begging and

971
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:57,407
Completing rice exam that you need to have to

972
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:58,431
Psychological

973
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:04,831
Ecotechne James Harden say or Chris Paul both Superstar

974
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:08,159
If you want them to do something they're not doing

975
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:10,463
Or you want them to do something better or different

976
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:11,487
How do you do that

977
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:15,071
We work together and get my experience in there and we

978
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:18,143
We're very analytic base now so a lot of it is

979
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:18,911
Data

980
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:20,191
Driven where they can

981
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:21,471
See that it makes sense

982
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:24,031
Give me an example of a time where

983
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:24,799
The problem

984
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:26,079
Is soft by data

985
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:32,479
Will you have a player that shoots primarily two-point shots and says 3-point shot sorry I'm not going

986
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:36,319
I can show him some the data that

987
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:38,367
Shooting that shot there is not his

988
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:39,391
Affectiva shooting

989
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:41,183
3 points you have to change your name

990
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:42,975
They don't know that

991
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:49,631
Points is taking about 20 second about 20 years for the NBA

992
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:52,959
Wait a minute

993
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:54,239
Touch

994
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:55,775

995
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:56,543

996
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:02,943
Dusklight shards you probably heard of us

997
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:04,735
I didn't name the team

998
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:09,343
We have Scouts are most tonight we lost the game

999
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:13,439
This week by 49 points do you have any

1000
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:15,743
Any advice for us is how to be a better

1001
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:24,447
Start score more points with three points more than two points

1002
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:29,311
The biggest cliche of every sports movie any of us have ever seen

1003
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:31,359
It is the halftime motivation

1004
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:35,455
Speak

1005
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:42,879

1006
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:44,159
