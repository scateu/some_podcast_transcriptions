But it is

26
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:49,408
Time to admit

27

00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,055
And realize how much he had

383

Taking his wife and properly

384
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,639
Furnished home for granted

Catastrophe cast

Connect story of an unlikely injury comes from Royal Blood

394
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,215
Volleyball is what nudist

395
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:13,983
Play

396
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:19,871
It's a big nudist thing you see a bunch of naked people and you wonder what's up

397
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:23,199
Then you say they're playing volleyball and you go all afternoon

398
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:27,039
But golf

399
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,343
Nudist playing golf

400
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,623
It don't seem nice

401
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,439
Now it has happened

402
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:34,719
The first

403
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,487
Nude

404
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,511
Golf day

405
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:37,791
Set a course

406
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,327
In Northern Australia

407
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:42,655
Organized by 69 year-old Brian to

408
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,775
Shoes and hat and nothing else

409
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,871
Put another connotation on how you're swinging

410
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:56,223
Jack Jenkins

411
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:58,015
30 golfers took part

412
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,807
Only one suffered an injury

413
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:02,879
Bitten by scandalized wombat

414
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,439
Ball in the wrong hole

415
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:12,095
I know this fellow just didn't want to use a cart so he carried his bag of clubs over his Bear show

416
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,399
Kind of bad

417
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:18,239
Put another connotation on how's it hanging

418
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:31,039
Shape shoulder from a nudist golf event in Australia last story of a boo-boo in the news comes from Luke

419
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:38,975
Doctors at Kindred Hospital in Brea California listed Kevin dodrill in satisfactory condition this week

420
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:41,791
With a broken leg and Radial fracture

421
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,839
But they say things could have been much

422
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:47,423
Worse after he raced through a 4 way stop on his bike

423
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:49,727
And collided with a UPS truck

424
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:52,799
His family says things went about as they were

425
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:53,567
Expecting

426
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:59,455
Considering he was riding a Peloton stationary bicycle heat modified to take on the street

427
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:03,807
The bike was a birthday present to Dodgeville from his wife and

428
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,575
And kids

429
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:07,647
And he admits having been a little confused when he first unpacked

430
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,415
The gift

431
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:09,951
Well I didn't realize it was

432
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:12,767
The stationary bike at first he told the brave post this

433
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:13,535
Dispatch

434
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:17,887
And since I've already thrown out the assembly directions long before trying to put it together

435
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:21,727
I just figured it was some kind of weird because I got a screaming deal on or something

436
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:26,591
Dodge will solve the problem by latching two of his daughters light up

437
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,615
Heely sneakers

438
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:33,759
To the underside of the back of the bike and then unsheathing the giant heavy front wheel from its frame

439
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:36,319
So we could sort of just roll on the ground

440
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,647
The biggest problem is those things actually come with brake

441
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,439
Said dodrill from his hospital bed

442
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:49,119
So I brought some barbecue tongs with me I figured I can kind of pinch the front wheel try to slow down

443
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,679
For what can only be described as

444
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:52,959
Is obvious reasons

445
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,239
The plan failed

446
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:59,103
Dodge roll dough is not ready to admit defeat

447
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:04,479
Telling his family he just needs a Saturday where he and his buddies Dale and Pat can get under the hood of that thing

448
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:11,135
I don't have it working again in no time at all right

449
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:14,719

I do want to ask you

510
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:12,640
So 20 years ago NPR started this show

511
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:17,504
And you guys were I don't know the backbone of NPR serious reputation what did you think of it

00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:19,296

And I don't know if the listening public Knows Best

516
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,256
But

517
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:32,352
Everybody in NPR most especially Nina and Robert but not only them

518
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:34,656
Actually have tremendous sense of humor

519
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,680
A Nintendo

520
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:39,008
I know that you wish you could indulge it more on the air

521
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,056
So we wanted to ask you now

522
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:47,456
Go back to some stories and see if there's anything you wish you had been able to say how many people have a job

523
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:53,856
Bob to keep us from saying what we might say

524
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:58,720
That's right I was in that what happened

525
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,512
Hosting All Things Considered

526
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:04,864
And I somebody handed me live on the air

527
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,400
What I was supposed to

528
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:09,472
Play the intro to a Robert krulwich piece

529
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:11,264
And their hands had moved

530
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,544
On the typewriter

531
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,080
And so that

532
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:20,480
It was chipperish the only thing wrong with the copy

533
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:25,856
And I had not at that point then a lot of

534
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:29,440
And I looked and I said I can't read this

535
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:33,280
And pointed is the booth to play the pig

536
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:35,072
He was in the

537
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:41,728
News director or vice president for news or whatever bloody title that gave you in those days

538
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:43,008
Called me to his office

539
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:43,776
Yes

540
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:44,800
And he could

541
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,336
Barely

542
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:48,128
Induct my reprimand

543
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,712
Because he was laughing so hard

544
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:55,296
And I figure what what should I have done

545
00:24:55,808 --> 00:25:01,952
And he said you could have said we're having technical difficulties

546
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:05,536
Do you have hear me

547
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:06,560

Drummer Peter Criss

821
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,112
It's really wasn't into this project

822
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,392
Explain it was

823
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,160
Because

824
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,440
Was it a

825
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:46,720
He thought it was beneath his

826
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:47,744

Be he didn't like the idea of killing the robots be

830
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:55,680
Because quote they may be artificial

831
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:56,704
But their feelings

832
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:58,240
Orsi

833
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,008

It is sadly wasn't

839
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:14,880
He it was a lot about John Lennon he thought that

840
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:15,648
This this

841
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:18,208

846
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:29,216
Of the script of the movie all guitarists Ace

847
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:30,240
Freelee said

848
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:32,032
All his lines were just annoyed

849
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:34,592
Itzhak

850
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:35,360
Why

851
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:37,152
A freely was concerned that

852
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:38,688
Speaking dialogue will act

853
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:39,456
Thing might hurt his

854
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:41,248
Be it was

855
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,272
Is it tribute to freely

856
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:43,040
Recently

857
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:47,904
We're see when the film's writers met with the band to get a feel for how they spoke

858
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:48,672
Freelee refused

859
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:49,952
To say anything to them but

860
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:53,792

Alright last question if you get this right you win

867
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:12,480
The production was

868
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:13,504
Plagued by tension

869
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,528

Drummer Peter Criss quit the film

874
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:21,952

950
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:18,848
No it came out 1989 it was published by a small unknown publishing company in New York I printed 5,000

951
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:24,224
Hardback copies and we couldn't give them away about a thousand copies and couldn't give them away so

952
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:25,504
Total disaster

953
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,272
Really

954
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:28,064
How did you ever get the gumption to try again

955
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:35,232
Well it was a hobby it was not a job I told my wife I was going to write one more book and if the second book didn't work

956
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:36,512
Reply to flop two

957
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:41,888
I was going to forget this whole secret Hobby and just go you know sue people all the time

958
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:43,680
And so the second book

959
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:45,728
Turn out to be the firm and that changed everything

960
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:46,752
It sure did

961
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:48,288
Did you like

962
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:52,895
Sit down and think yourself okay the first one didn't do well so what do I need to do to write up up

963
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:54,687
Books that will did you actually calculate

964
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:56,223
I need to up your game on the

965
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:58,271
I had the idea

966
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:03,903
And it could be better and my wife really liked it and so I said okay

967
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:07,999
I'm going to be something a little more commercial a little more Beano popular

968
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:09,791
It wasn't naked grab for money

969
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:16,959
That's a good title

970
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:17,983
Tumi

971
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,519
It is how

972
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:25,151
Relax you seem I've read that you have a schedule where you start writing

973
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:26,431
A book and what is it

974
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,967
The middle of the summer middle August

975
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:30,783
Did you finish my Christmas and then you take the rest of the year off

976
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:32,575
That was the old schedule

977
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:36,415
The new schedule start a book every year on January 1st

978
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:39,231
And finish July 1st at the go with you on the first

979
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:45,631
And so I get myself six months and to write during the winter time when things are slow and all that

980
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:52,287
I mean I have no real job you know this is not a real job

981
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:54,591
I work 40 hours a week in like 30 years

982
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:55,871
Okay so it's not a real job

983
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,663
You've got great title

984
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:59,967
You say your books have good titles are there any

985
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:00,735
Titles at

986
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:02,527
Dad that you rejected that

987
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:06,879
You look back on and think I can't believe I ever considered that like what are some of the rejected title

988
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:08,415
Gone with the Wind

989
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:14,047
Kill a Mockingbird

990
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:19,167
Every you want to start a book I think okay I want a great time I want something like to Kill a Mockingbird

991
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:20,703
Are The Grapes of Wrath

992
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:23,007
Sophie from great title

993
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:25,055
And I just can't find them so sticky

994
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,079
Something

995
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:32,735
I read that you are really big in the Little League Baseball I understand you have

996
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:34,783
Six Little League fields on your property

997
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:37,855
7

998
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:40,671
Nnnnn who plays on the

999
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:44,511
We have about 400 kids every year from our neighborhood, it's just

1000
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:45,535
Spartan County

1001
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:48,095
And we have 35 teams and we have seven

1002
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:52,447
Open Fields and we have we have tons of baseball t-ball softball

1003
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:55,775
I'm the commissioner

1004
00:43:56,287 --> 00:44:02,431
Because I own the damn place to pay for it it's a wonderful place

1005
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:04,735
Can we have kids now to play in our ballpark for a

1006
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:07,807
10 straight years but when they grow up here so it's

1007
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:12,415
That's awesome gif

1008
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:18,815
When you have a dictator the commissioner

1009
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:20,351
Place a big role in your writing

1010
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:25,471
She plays a big role she has to approve each story before I start riding it

1011
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:32,127
Which moments around the house when I have a brilliant idea for a novel and

1012
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:34,175
She thinks it's just not going to work

1013
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:38,783
I got to get about thirty seconds to pitch an idea to her for a novel

1014
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:42,367
Which is really the way you should write if you can't pitch

1015
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:44,159
Stop playing in 30 minutes

1016
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:47,999
And convinced your listener that it's a good story you're probably in trouble

1017
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:51,583
We read somewhere that one of the things that your wife did for your writing

1018
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:52,607
At least early on

1019
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:54,399
What's the next the sex scenes

1020
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:57,727
Well she reads a lot of books in a lot of books

1021
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:02,591
Have some sex I'm not sure how much that I don't read those books but

1022
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:05,151
She's always said that men cannot write sex

1023
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:09,503
7 years ago I wrote the sex scene

1024
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,063
And

1025
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:16,671
She read it chapter by chapter and so I gave her the chapter to read with a sex scene

1026
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:23,327
And I heard her laughing upstairs

1027
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:25,375
Men cannot write sex

1028
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:30,751
Well John Grisham it is a pleasure

1029
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:32,031

00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:47,135
Underwear you win a prize one of my listeners

Bill who is author John Grisham playing

1037
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:51,999
Courtney Bond St Louis Missouri

1038
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:53,279
Here's the first Quest

1039
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:55,583
Saint John in olden times men's underwear was

1040
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:56,863
Extremely valuable

1041
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,423
Prize by the wealthy and Powerful how do we know that

1042
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:03,775
Hey King Henry II of England have a royal supplier if I mention

1043
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:08,639
Beat King Tut was buried with 145 pairs in his

1044
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:09,407
Tomb

1045
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:12,735
Orsi Peter the Great of Russia invaded the Crimea just

1046
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:13,503
To capture

1047
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:14,783
Particular Taylor

1048
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:15,551
Who made underwear

1049
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:17,087
Wow I mean

1050
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:19,903
OC

1051
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:22,207
Actually it was actually be King Tut

1052
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:29,375
Because you get you know if you go into the underworld you want to need support

1053
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:32,191
Next question

1054
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:37,311
According to a 1933 issue of the trade Journal Menswear

1055
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,615
A man's underwear should

1056
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:40,383
Be what

1057
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,151
Hey

1058
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:41,919

Should be like a Fort Knox

1060
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:44,735
For the bits

1061
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:51,391
Bee quote should have the grace of Apollo the romance of Byron the

1062
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:52,671
Extinction of Lord of Chester

1063
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:54,463
You filled in the he's coolness and comfort

1064
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:55,999
Mahatma Gandhi

1065
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:58,303
Foresee quotes

1066
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:01,631
Should let him at know that whether he's stagger falter or fail

1067
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:03,423
At least he will not wiggle

1068
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:07,519
Integrate

1069
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:10,079
Wow down supposed to responses

You can do whatever the hell you didn't know which one you want I want I want to see

1071
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:26,463
No it was B

1072
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:29,023
I'm so sorry

1073
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:35,423
We have one more for you

1074
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:36,447
Authority on men's fashion

1075
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:37,983
Nicora surges you not

1076
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:40,543
Not to wear one kind of underwear which is it

1077
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:44,383
Briefs with pictures of animal faces on the front

1078
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:49,503
Be tidy whities because quote they remind every woman of their dorky little brother

1079
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:52,319
Or see anything that cost over 20 bucks

1080
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:56,671
Because by the time anybody else sees it they've already made up their minds about you

1081
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:57,695
Haha

1082
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:05,887
I don't like beer say let's go

1083
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:12,287
It is obvious you should not wear the underwear with a big tiger face right there in the front but GQ apparently felt a need

1084
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:13,311
David let their readers now

1085
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:14,591
Do not do that

1086
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:15,871
All right

1087
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:17,151
How

1088
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:20,735
Did John Grisham do an AR quiz

1089
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:25,087
The defendant has been found guilty

1090
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:26,879

1092
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:28,927

1093
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:31,999
Hey Courtney in St Louis I'm really sorry about this
