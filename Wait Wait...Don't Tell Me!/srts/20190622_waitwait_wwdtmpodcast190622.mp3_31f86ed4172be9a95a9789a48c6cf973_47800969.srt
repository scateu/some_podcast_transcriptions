47
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,632

57
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,912
Show with Peter Krause

58
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:20,032
Hello

59
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:20,800
Who's Bill this time

60
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:21,568
Of course Bill Kurtis

61
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,616
This is going to recreate for you three quotations

62
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:26,432
From the week's news your job correctly identify or explain

63
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,200
Just two of them

64
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:27,968
Do that you win

65
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:28,736
Enterprise avoid

66
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,016
Your choice

67
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,040
Ready to do this

68
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,576
I am never ready

69
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,720
Sounds like a great

70
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:44,352
Alright your first quote is the president of the United

71
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,632
It's reacting to another

72
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,424
Countries provocation

73
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,216
I have a feeling

74
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:50,752
And I may be wrong

75
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,800
And I may be right and I'm right a lot

76
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,360
But it was a mistake

77
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,896
That was the president

78
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,200
Acting is the voice of reason

79
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:03,552
Really after who shot down an American drone this

80
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:10,464
Exactly around yes if you were really into that

81
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,096
80s Vibe of US versus Russia you were going to love this reboot of US versus Iran

82
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:20,192
You know Madonna's on tour right now they're making a new Bill and Ted movie

83
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:26,848
What's the only more 80s thing you could have right now is a businessman named Donald Trump driving something he runs right into the

84
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:33,248
The ground but you can tell you can tell the Arabians are kind of enjoyment to sell

85
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:39,648
Altitude are even selling hats and Tehran that say make death to America great again

86
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:46,560
Got to laugh because you have to laugh

87
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,656
Chucky ending it all

88
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,008
People in charge

89
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,312
Just didn't notice going to work out

90
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:59,616
Things have been getting

91
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,408
Intense as you know for a while

92
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,736
First the US

93
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:08,320
Withdrew from the Iran deal then around allegedly attacks on oil tankers than

94
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,088
Trump

95
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:11,648
Accuse Rouhani of getting a bad facelift

96
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,416
No way that was

97
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,208
Rosinski

98
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,047
Then this week in Rancho

99
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:23,167
As you heard instead of responding with his usual fire and fury said hey was probably a mistake

100
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,471
Did he suggested it was some underling that

101
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,751
Was I acting about mistakes

102
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:31,103
Exactly later in the day around was like no

103
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,575
That's a little like get out

104
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,855
He said she said about

105
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,903
Where the Drone was we said it was

106
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,695
National Waters they said it was over their land

107
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:47,743
AR

108
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,511
Proof was

109
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,559
A Google Maps thing with a little

110
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,095
Blue.

111
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:55,935
This is where the law came from

112
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:56,703
Motorcycle that looks

113
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,519
Just make that

114
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,823
Hand drawn map

115
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:08,479
That was like a missile here and then like the golf and stuff like that it was really like I don't believe

116
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,247
Peter Vue

117
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,343
Made by Google

118
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,623
Is it said that it was

119
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,647
37 hour drive

120
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:23,327
Highest winds

121
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,607
Shooting down drones iOS

122
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:30,495
Use Waze

123
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:39,455
Why is Trump trying to keep this war from happening

124
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:41,503
Well he probably took a look at Iran

125
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,527
Anti-gay

126
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:48,927
If I woman and I do and he's like what what are we doing I ran is my base

127
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,511
Michael

128
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,839
Michael your next quote is from a former adviser to Barack Obama

129
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:59,167
When are the primary wouldn't lie all puppies and rainbows

130
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:03,775
He was talking about 23 people who find each other

131
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:04,799
Who are they

132
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:10,687
The candidates for the Democratic

133
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:16,063
This week the various presidential candidates on the Democratic side

134
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,599
Finally started attacking each other

135
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,879
It was real

136
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,671
Mano a mano fight

137
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:27,327
Will actually because there are 23 of them was actually mano a mano a mano Y Manalo

138
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,911
Joe Biden

139
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:31,935
The front runner

140
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:35,775
Bragged about his ability to get along with people he disagreed with like

141
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,567
He said segregation

142
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,103
From the cell

143
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,895
It is unclear why he did this

144
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,943
It's because Democratic voters are probably

145
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,735
Not looking to replace Trump

146
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,783
With someone who gets along with racist

147
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:49,855
Better

148
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,463
His face is you take away

149
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:57,279
People

150
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:02,399
People are like well now I'm listening to nobody

151
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,167
I mean

152
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,703
Oh bless his heart

153
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,007
Everybody love

154
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,055
How do you say about a cousin

155
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:09,823
He's like kind of

156
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:14,431
Yeah

157
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,455
Change to vote

158
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,503
He has the ability to

159
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:18,783
Witchcraft the island make

160
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,831
Congress get along and be effective

161
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:21,855
Give again is a great

162
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:22,623
Strategy

163
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,255
Anyway we're all going to see this

164
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,303
Play out because the debater next week

165
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,327
Who's going to be two of them

166
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,607
Can Canada tonight

167
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,423
The first question for the moderator is going to be

168
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,447
What is your name again

169
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,031
They said when they do the debate

170
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:40,799
To be like

171
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:41,823
Just go down the line

172
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,103
Please say you're opening

173
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,127
And then you're closing

174
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:51,295
Dear Michael is your last quote

175
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,319
Spikes

176
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,599
Head horns

177
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:54,623
And the phone

178
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,463
Bone those are nicknames given to a supposed numedica

179
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,231
Phenomenon

180
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:02,815
A bony Spike growing in the back of many people's heads

181
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,351
Is entirely due to what

182
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:07,935
Looking down on your phone exactly right Michael

183
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:14,591
It turns out that looking down at our phone so much might actually be causing a bonus

184
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,639
Spike to be growing in the back of her head

185
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,943
You can feel the bone if you press down on the back of your neck

186
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,479
Package right underneath the Apple logo

187
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:26,879
And the serious this is happening because we're constantly looking down

188
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:29,439
Nrr head is like growing a little

189
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,207
Extra bone

190
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,743

464
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,903
Police initially considered the possibility that the cult

Could be a dick

466
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,719

Important people about unimportant things

511
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,919
We all have friends

512
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:08,223
Some of us are lucky enough to have very close to

513
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,247

00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,063
Family

528
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:43,040

529
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,112
Best job I would ever have so why would I leave

Goodbye to the Obamas when they went off to the inauguration

536
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:07,872
And that's when I finally went over to The West Wing

537
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,920
And turned in my credentials and my

538
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:14,016

Michelle Robinson in 1991

549
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:36,288
When I was trying to

550
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,568
Recruit her to come at work

551
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,104
With me and the mayor's office

00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,712
Running her fiance didn't think it was such a great idea so Michael who is he and why

553
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:52,928
What does he have to do with it Beauty we were taken aback by then

554
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,464
And she said he's going to be present

555
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,256
Give him a second

556
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:02,912
Pramoxine like when healing usual is that bus

557

00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,264
Every single day

560
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,288
Decision he made for

561
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,568
About his career

562
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,104
She was right there at the

563
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,920
The table as well as more indication of the partnership

564
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:16,480

My squirrel is baby to beyond anything anyone can imagine he's right

Bottle fed

777
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:43,936

Literally have been feeding the squirrel meth to make it aggressive

786
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:01,088
They put out a warrant for mr. Fox they would leave

787
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:02,112

788
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:02,880

00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:06,976

To rescue the squirrel

792
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:15,424

00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,800

797
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:29,504
