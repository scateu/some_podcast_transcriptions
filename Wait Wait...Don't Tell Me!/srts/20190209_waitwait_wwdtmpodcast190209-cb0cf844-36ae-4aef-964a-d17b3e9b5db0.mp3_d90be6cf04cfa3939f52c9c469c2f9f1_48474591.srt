Trump

89
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,040
During what

90
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:41,696
Speech

91
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,464

All

93
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:46,560
In the delay and in the end

94
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,840
It was so boring

95
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:48,864
Disappointing to see

96
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:50,656
That you have

97
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,192
Expected Adam Levine.

98
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:56,544
To come out in the middle

99
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,336
This speech

100
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:00,128
Did make history somebody analyzed

101
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,432
And found all the words that had

102
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,456
Never before been

103
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,224
Sunset in the state

104
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,504

105
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,552
This is real

Freeloading

111
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,744
The dipstick

112
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:16,768
Venomous

113
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,303
And kissing

114
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,911
Where you said all those things

115
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:29,311
The President Trump still hasn't said Tiffany though I don't know

116
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,103
She was there she was there

117
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,127
She was there

118
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,151
Behind

119
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:33,919
Neither one of them

120
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:35,711
Glokknine

121
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,527
Which I think is

122
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,695
Vitriol there were

123
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,023
For example many of the Democrats

124
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:49,791
Warwick

125
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,583
And all of the Republican

126
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,031
Did wear different color

127
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:00,799
Blood Ties

128
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,079
That's Limited

129
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,943
It was amazing

130
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,271
I was wondering lately why is he making

131
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,039
Rhymes

132
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,319

133
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,343
Lake Elementary School

134
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,135
I bet

135
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,927
Advisors

136
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:17,695
Explain

137
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,911
Alright your next quote

138
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,191
From a woman named

139
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,471
Silhouettes

140
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:30,495
Saint Twitter

141
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:32,031
When we said more black

142
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:41,247
We should have been more specific

143
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:44,319
All right

144
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:47,903
Scandal that was apparently end the career of every politician

145
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:49,951
What state

146
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:56,607
Virginia

147
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:59,679
Happening in Virginia

148
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:03,775
The female members of Congress are not the only group of Democrats that dress alike

149
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:11,967
Governor Ralph Northam he was elected

150
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,527
Over a guy who is running on a

151
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,575
Really racist platform but it turns out

152
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:17,599
Before you vote

153
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,391
You got to check under the hood

154
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:23,743
Somebody found

155
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:24,767
Photograph

156
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:25,791
Medical

157
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,607
And it's a picture of a guy in

158
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,631
Blackface

159
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,167
Next to a guy in a

160
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:37,311
And the governor immediately apologize even though he said

161
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,847
That he did not

162
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,919
Remember which one was him

163
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:46,271
Blackface

164
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:53,695
Is there a Jeff Foxworthy joke or it's like

165
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,631
I found this astounding

166
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:03,679
First of all

167
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,703
I was shocked

168
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:10,847
Medical schools have yearbooks

169
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,223
Done the Press

170
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:16,991
Best conferences

171
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,087
Play hard to get

172
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,111
Shoe polish coffee

173
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:28,511
Your skin

174
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,303
Wasn't me

175
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,583
In those

176
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,351
Photos

177
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,887
I was wrong but he says

178
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,191
Put shoe polish on my face

179
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,983
Michael Jackson

180
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:41,567
And somebody says can you feel me

181
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:46,175
And he says I would but my wife just told me it's not the right moment

182
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:51,551
Wow

183
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:57,951
Florida must be sighing relief

184
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:04,351
The Democratic

185
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:11,775
In the middle

186
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:25,087
And then we're not done

187
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,391
Does I edited

188
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:31,743
So seriously at this point Virginia is changing its name

189
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:38,399
East West Virginia

190
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:44,543
Headed your last quote is from a critique of a new play that

191
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,591
The author hopes to debut in New York City

192
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,895
It was long-winded in Meandering

193
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,943
Thankfully none of it was rap

194
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,991
So that was the New Yorker talking about

195
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,527
The play that was written

196
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,831
Just because the play's author hate

197
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:57,855
What

198
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:58,623
So much

199
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:05,279
Hamilton very good

00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,432
Lost the race for governor but that has not kept her off the national stage

486
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:43,040
Most recently giving the Democratic response to the State of the Union Address and now she's here

487
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:58,912
We should start by saying you've been you presumably been listening for what stage do you have a response to

488
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:01,984
The first anniversary

489
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,776
I do but it requires

490
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,568
The teleprompter of fake

491
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,336
Non-green

492
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:12,736
Sunscreen and a union hall

493
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:13,760
The State of the Union response

494
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:16,832

00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:17,856
Draw

00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:40,384
How did you say to you how did you plan that you would not end up on that list

500
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:42,432
I drink a lot of water early

501
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:45,760

00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:46,528

503
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:48,064
But very moisturizing what's

504
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:56,768

505
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:57,536
Call to respond

506
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,072
Did you

507
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:01,632
Think it all about what you anticipated prison

508
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:03,680
Trump might say so you could respond to

509
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:06,240
I would put it this way

510
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,264
I have

511
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,544
Hurt him

512
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:09,824
Yes

513
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:15,712
I assumed it would be some combination of

514
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:16,736
Demagoguery

515
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:19,296
Self aggrandizement

516
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,088
2 lines about

517
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:21,856
Something nice

518
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:23,904
Nice but he would three lines later overrule

519
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:30,304
Did you know that it would rhyme

520
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:36,704
That I missed and you know I feel sorry for whoever thought that with the right way

521
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,520
Way2go

522
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:45,408
State of the Union response is where you going to do it and what the background is people to try various things

523
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:47,712
You went for it was a union hall you say

524
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,248
And in behind you at all these

525
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:52,832
Unusual

526
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,112

Speaking to us

529
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:59,488
And it really is blurry figures behind you and I was like oh those are the ghosts that are

530
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:10,240
They left undone

531
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,432
Question

532
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:20,992
Have we met

533
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,272
Before because

534
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:28,928
I went to Theater Camp with at least three girls named Stacey Abrams

535
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:36,096
It's entirely possible

536
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:40,704
Everybody knows you for your 2018 gubernatorial campaign here in Georgia

537
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,728
People may not know

538
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,008
His evil list

539
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,288
Completely different career

540
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,824

541
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,848

00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:50,944

549
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:59,392
Microsatellite technology

550
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:10,912
And so I thought this thing he created he discovered I was like

551
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,960
You could have perforated increases

552
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:15,776
Chemical weapon that could be discovered by the floogals physicist

553
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:20,896
I could never happen even no imagination

554
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:24,736
I decided

00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,272
It's a right to things I wrote.

556
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:29,088

Income tax exemption

558
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:37,536
And then I wrote

559
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:39,840
Romantic suspense novels I technically write romantic

560
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:43,168
