Vice President Biden just still has the

106
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:26,751
A video

107
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:29,567
What you said you know when I was a kid we used to call these

Takis

109
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,687
And he presented himself

110
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,015
Assertive is an Everyman candidate it doesn't matter what race

111
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:40,063
Is a gender or sexuality you are

112
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,087
Joe Biden

113
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,879
Want to smell your hair

114
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:49,791
Did you see the non-endorsement that Obama release know what are you doing

115
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:50,559
It was just

116
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,327
Blake

117
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,631
I hear my good friend Joe Biden wants to

118
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,399
3 president

119
00:04:55,679 --> 00:05:01,311
Ricky was really non-committal it was like it was

120
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:05,151
Like if your friend asks you to come over to like their candle party

121
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:08,735
Bright like you have to go but you really want to leave with him

122
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:09,503
Maximum of

123
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,271
Two candles

124
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,063
What the problem is I mean

125
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:15,391
His connection to Obama is his primary selling point he was

126
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,159
Of course

127
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,951
Obama's vice president for 8 years

128
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,743
And people don't like Obama

129
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:20,511
The Democratic Party

130
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,559
Two people might vote for him this

131
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,095
History people will vote for him

132
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:27,167
For the same reason you invite somebody you don't really like

133
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,447
To your party cuz you hoped

134
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,215
He'll bring his hot

135
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,335
Like

136
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,127
Mayor Pete buttigieg is a millennial

137
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:36,895
Biden cases

138
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,687
Cuz he is a thousand years old

139
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:41,503
If you check the age of his hair plugs

140
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,271
Hugs and the age of

141
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,039
His teeth

142
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,831
The average of his body part

143
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,879
Which is like $0.30 or something

144
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,439
Just so many

145
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,463
Piano

146
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,999
I'm thinking maybe

147
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,535
I don't know maybe the runoff

148
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,583
Should be like Red Rover Red Rover

149
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:00,447
Or maybe maybe something more akin to the Hunger Games

150
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,215
Arm numb

00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:47,199
For serious Surfers from around the world

381
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:51,295
People like twenty-four-year-old chasen Bradford from Vallejo California

382
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,599
We tried to describe the wave to a can

383
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,623
Infused Wall Street

384
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,647
Journal reporter

385
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:56,927
Bra it's like

386
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,975
You got the best barrels ever dude

387
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:01,535
Just drop in and whoop how you smack the lip and you get

388
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,583
Pitted so pitted you know

389
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,911
The reporter did not know

390
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,751
But eventually got to his real question

391
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:17,151
Asking Bradford if you felt nervous surfing in front of a dam that could burst at any moment and barium under 1.3 million acre

392
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,175
Acre feet of water

393
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,991
Bradford responded by pulling up a shirt

394
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:23,551
Exposing a Hakuna Matata tattoo

395
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:28,159
It means no worries for the rest of your days

396
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:30,207
He added without irony

397
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,791
What time is Umatilla is enjoying me

398
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:37,887
Research and tourism actually sees that they long-term Boon to the local economy

399
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,935
Since once the dam does burst

400
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,727
The three local funeral homes

401
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:45,567
Will be doing brisk business dealing with Jason and his buddies for the foreseeable future

402
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:52,479
Surfers taking advantage of a leaking Dam on the Columbia River your next story from the bridge and tunnel crowd

403

00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:54,783
Poundstone

405
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:59,135
Paramedics in Omaha Nebraska we're rushing a man to the hospital

406
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,415
Fearing for his life

407
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,695
His heart was racing

408
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,975
200 beats a minute

409
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:06,303
Which could mean imminent heart attack or heart failure

410
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,583
Then Fortune

411
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:10,143
For him the ambulance hit a pothole

412
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,423
Which Jordan to page

413
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,447
Patient so hard

414
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,471

Quotes

420
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:25,247
One way to treat that is with an electrical shock

421
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,039
Classically

422
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:29,087
See it on television the paddle

423
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,879
Clear and the big jolt

424
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,927
Turns out you can do that with a pothole

425
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:36,767
When news of this gets out Philadelphia

426
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:37,535

With car is filled with drivers and passengers with racing

430
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,703
This hard killing

431
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,727
Pothole

432
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,519
It's made frame any move towards a nymph

433
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,823
Infrastructure bill as an assault on Healthcare in

434
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:52,127
On the other hand it could lead

435
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:52,895
To be unloaded

436
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,663
Cardiology

Your last story of Decay being okay

442
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:07,743
Comes from

443
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,511
Bobcat Goldthwait

444
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:13,119
The Tiny Town of Cresco Iowa is enduring what might be legitimately

445
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,167
He called politely a poop storm

446
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,471
Because of recent Mass

447
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:20,799
Flooding the centuries-old sewer system has been overwhelmed

448
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:23,103
And the drains are acting in reverse

449
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,895
Causing a Townline prep test

450
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,711
Homeowners

451
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:29,759
Installed into the bathrooms and discovered that they

Sinks bath

453
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:34,111
Toilets have become Bellagio like dancing Fountains of waste

454
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:38,207
A petition is already gathered 1200

455
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:40,255
Signatures almost half the population

456
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:43,071
To change the town's motto to Cresco Iowa

457
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,607
Even worse than before

458
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:51,007
One resident who will not be signing the petition.

459
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,055
Situation is a miracle quote

460
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:53,823
Like Jesus

This week to find her

465
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,199
Long lost

00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:02,527
Engagement ring at appeared right there on the floor

467
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:05,343
I can only hope it came from the sink

468
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:08,927
She said that one of these three things happen

469
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:14,815
Is it because of a failing Dam a small town of the Columbia river is now a tourist spot

470
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:15,839
Being

471
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:16,863

A woman's

478
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,687
Wedding ring from the deck

479
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,479
Which of these are the real story

480
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,271
Of an infrastructure failure being a sec

481
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,319
Well I love

482
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:39,135

483
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:46,303
You can go tell the story of the pothole in Omaha

00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,375
Ring the correct answer we spoke to a reporter who covered it

485
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:56,031
While en route to the hospital they hit a pothole and the jolt returns got patients heart rate back to normal

486
00:19:56,287 --> 00:20:02,431
There you go that was Kelsey Stewart she's a reporter for the Omaha World-Herald

487
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:05,247
Congratulations Lacey you got it right

488
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,039
Yonder point for Paula of course

489
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:10,367
You have won our prize the voice of your choice on your voicemail

490
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,927
Thank you so much for playing again congratulations

491
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:18,559
Thank you so much thank you take care

492
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:27,519
And now the game where talented people are confronted with a

493
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,823
The challenge that requires no Talent at all

494
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,847
Call not my job

495
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,407
Laird Hamilton is the most

496
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:36,223
Famous surfer who's never won a surfing competition

497
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,527
And he's never won one because he's never

498
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,295
Entered one

499
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:43,391
Instead he spends his time doing remarkable things like setting the record

500
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,671
For the biggest wave

501
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,695
Eversor

502
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,999
He has a new book out called life writer

503
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:51,327
We are pleased to welcome him now we're Hamilton welcome to wait wait don't tell me

504
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:04,383
I wanted to check that too cuz if somebody wouldn't somebody said your name as I can but it turns out

505
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,919
You've never actually enter to surfing,

506
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:11,039
Yeah I I tripped it a couple when I was a kid when there was a t-shirt

507
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:13,087
For the prize but it soon as it

508
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:17,184
Money came into it it seemed like that changed the Dynamics and I

509
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,232
I opted to not participate

510
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,024
We understand that it's

511
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,608
It's not surprising you spent your life on the water cuz you were actually born in water

512
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:32,544
Using a bathysphere which was actually like almost like a hairdressers vacuum

513
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:35,616
Went over my mother's stomach and relieve the pressure on the

514
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:37,152
On the optimum

515
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:42,528
Birth in a tub but I did have a unique birthing process was it put that way

516
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:45,600
Did you think that ended up sort of steering the course of your life

517
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:52,768
Or I would like to see it didn't affect me but other people disagree

518
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:56,864
Basic question what is your job Laird Hamilton

519
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,728
Innovator I like Innovation and

520
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,336
As an athlete

521
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,384
Subsidize my surfing with

522
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,664
A lot of different things

523
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,224
Leonard when you serve

524
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,760
Like for a living

525
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:20,928
How do they know to do that I mean

526
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:21,952
Your guy with a

527
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,256
Beach and there's a wave

528
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,024
Surfeit

529
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,328
Somebody runs over and

530
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:28,864
Gives you a check

531
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:37,824
No you're you'd write a giant wave somebody takes a picture they put it on the cover of National Geographic and then

532
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,896
Can a company says you know we love to give you some money in

533
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:45,760
And then try to get on National Geographic again

534
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:48,320
Make it clear to Paul everybody else that actually happen

535
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,856
Bright

536
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:53,440
So what what do you think in your estimation is sort of the craziest or riskiest

537
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:55,232
Maybe the most foolish thing you've ever done

538
00:22:56,768 --> 00:23:00,352
You know there's a long list we don't have enough time but

539
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:02,912
You know I've done some crazy paddles between

540
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:06,752
Highlands II paddle from Corsica to Italy one time and

541
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,800
And we were kind of lost at night

542
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:11,104
In the middle of the Mediterranean Inn

543
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:15,200
You know I've had some other I've been those in Russia and I fell through Glacier when I was

544
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:18,016
Helicopter snowboarding into military helicopters

545
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:27,488
You got a ride you got to ride on a Russian military

546
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:28,768
Helicopter

547
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,584
Yeah to a glacier in Russia

548
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:34,656
And then you went snowboarding down the glacier

549
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:38,496
Yeah but I fell in I fell through a cornice

550
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,288
Sudan Iowa

551
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,568
Biking behind

552
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:43,360
One of my partners

553
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:49,504
You don't have been in the wrong you know a couple feet over I might not

554
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:57,696
So was it hard to get the Russian military to let you do that or they were like Laird Hamilton to be loved your short

555
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,976
It was more like

556
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:02,048
You know money for vodka

557
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:06,144
There's a couple bullet holes in it in the bird in

558
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,680
Do you know now you still got it

559
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:08,704
There's a pilot

560
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,728
He was whining

561
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:11,776
Are you paid with vodka

562
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:17,920
The very low bar it's refreshing to hear an American that it has no problem admitting that the rush

563
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:24,832
Yeah

564
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:30,720
Falling through a glacier and you're in a big hole in the ice

565
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:37,376
Or you are somewhere between Corsica and Italy on a paddleboard or a surfboard on that particular

566
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:40,448
Standing there in a board in the middle of the ocean

567
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,984
It's dark you don't know where you are

568
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:47,616
Has there ever been a point where you said oh man I screwed this up now or do you just not

569
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:49,920
Ever like losing faith

570
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:53,504
Really really

571
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:59,904
Here I am again

572
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:05,792
You're somebody other people admire so much and I'm just wondering if you ever found yourself in a moment

573
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:08,608
Man I wish I'd become a CPA like Mom wanted

574
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,568
Snowboard glitch

575
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:20,384
But the most terrifying thing

576
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,152
Is

577
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:21,920
Being asleep

578
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:24,736
EPA

579
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:29,856
Why I understand that one of the things that you're doing is you have a really rigorous

580
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,136
I don't know

581
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,928
Exercise program is not

582
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:33,952
Sufficient rhytids

583
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:35,232
It's kind of a training program

584
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:40,096
You offer to people

585
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:40,864
Stands for

586
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:45,728
Exploring Performance training but it it really is a lifestyle program

587
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,824
It's really about recovery move and breathe

588
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,640
I don't know how accurate this is but somebody told me oh yes

589
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:55,200
That's the program where you have to go underwater and Lyft

590
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,224
Weights while holding your

591
00:25:57,504 --> 00:26:03,648
Darius Darius. Part

592
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,952
Recovery in the nuts

593
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:12,352
You're just killing you like a normal way program might make you go to the gym and lift weights but you because you're more generous to people make some cold water

594
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,400
Yes actually figured

595
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:17,728
Hold Us Down and we do a lot of explosive

596
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:20,544
Jumping

597
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,080
It's the Hold You Down

598
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:23,872
In the bottom of the pool

599
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:24,640
Yes

600
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,176
How many clients have

601
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:26,944
Are you lost

602
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:32,320
None that we know of but I haven't looked in the pool today

603
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:36,160
Willard Hamilton it is a pleasure to talk to you

604
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,696
We've invited you here today

605
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:39,744

607
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:41,792
Channel surf

608
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:46,400
You of course are big wave surfer but from everything you know you're probably not very good

609
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,168
America

610
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:48,448
His favorite kind of surfing

611
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,728
Channel surfing

612
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,568
Weird ask you three questions about terrible moments in television history if you ask

613
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:56,384
Three questions correctly it was a prize from one of our listeners

614
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:57,408
The Voice update

615
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,688
Your choice on their answering machine

616
00:26:58,944 --> 00:26:59,456
Phil

617
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,992
Who is Laird Hamilton playing for

618
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,272
Evan Hansen

619
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,552
Princeton New Jersey

620
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:05,344
And they've got a big surf seen there

621
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,416
I'm sure he's all right here we go

622
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:10,976
First question there was once a

623
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:13,280
Failed cable channel called Genesis

624
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,816
Storytime didn't last very long

625
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,096
It was created just

626
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:16,864
For kids

627
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,144
What programming

628
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,168
Did Genesis

629
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,448
Storytime offer

630
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,472
Was it a

631
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:24,032
It re-enacted other cable TV shows like this

632
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,312
Sopranos in Homeland

633
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,336
But with puppets

634
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,616
And clean language

635
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:30,944
Be it was just a series of still images of pages

636
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,712
Some children's books

637
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:33,504
So that a parent could sit and read

638
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,296
TV to their kid

639
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,320
Or see if

640
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,088
Deported to teach

641
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:37,856
Kids quotes

642
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:39,136
Real life skills

643
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:41,184
Such as asking people out on dates

644
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,464
Cures for hangovers

645
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:49,120
You're right Laird you nailed that very weird idea

646
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:55,520
You turn it on there be a page of a kids picture book you'd read the page and after a short. Of time

647
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:56,544
Switch to the next page

648
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,568
Can you read that page

649
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:58,848
Didn't last long

650
00:27:59,104 --> 00:27:59,616
All right

651
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:02,432
Netflix

652
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:08,320
Next question there are some shows that have come and gone

653
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,856
Very very quickly

654
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:11,392
As in which of these

655
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,160
Which of these shows

656
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:12,928
The. Only 2 days

657
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:13,952
Disappear

658
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,768
Fox's who's your daddy

659
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,584
A game show in which an adult have been given up for adoption

660
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,400
Guesses which of the 25 men

661
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:23,424
On the set

662
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:24,960
Is their father

663
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,008
Being

664
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:28,032
PBS is

665
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:30,848
Trigonometry teaching educational comedy show

666
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,640
Cosine fell

667
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:40,064
Or cnbc's crossover experiment Law and Order and frayser

668
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:47,488
I have to go with B again to go to the trigonometry teaching educational comedy show

669
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:48,512
Co Seinfeld

670
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:54,400
What's the deal with hypotenuse

671
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:05,408
If you guessed right you got $100,000 at which point your dad

672
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:08,224
Suddenly took an interest in you again

673
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:13,600
All right last question if you if you sit there and channel surf long enough you'll end up on the Home Shopping Channel

674
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,440
Yeah that can make sometimes or unexpectedly memorable

675
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:20,256
Viewing which of these actually happened on the

676
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,280
Home shopping

677
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,304
Was it at

678
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,376
After a host whack the blade of a samurai sword

679
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:26,400
The counter

680
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:28,448
The blade snapped and stabbed him in the chest

681
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:35,360
Be a man showed up a photo of a moth taken by the camera he was selling but then for a full minute referred to them off as a horse

682
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:40,992
Or see a woman selling jumper cables decided to show what happens when you switch the cables on the car battery

683
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:43,296
Setting the battery on fire

684
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:48,928
I'm excited I'm going to Samurai

685
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:55,328
You're right but then again all of them really happened

686
00:29:55,584 --> 00:30:01,728
Home Shopping Channel

687
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:04,288

746
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:38,912
Their weight

747
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,448
No not their way

748
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,728
We are on the right track

749
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:43,008
Because in fact somebody was

750
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:44,032
Denied housing

751
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:45,312
Say it again but one more

752
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:47,616
Dirt weight

753
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:49,664
No

754
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:50,688
Invisible thing

755
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:56,064
I'm not quite I'll give you a hint it's like good may it does make sense with Libras never pay their rent on time

756
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:56,832
Cousin

757
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,648
That's the answer

758
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:02,464
Is it legal to deny someone housing because their afterlife

759
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:04,000
Is the question

760
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,536
So that was happening

761
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:08,608
It happened a woman responded to a potential roommate

762
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,168
And rejected her saying quote her main concern is that you

763
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:11,936
Capricorn

764
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:15,264
But so she still wanted to live with this person

765
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:21,664
Well apparently the woman with Capricorn Moon

766
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:27,296
You're a nut

767
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:30,880
Would be great if that's what discrimination was no jugglers welcome here

768
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:37,536
People who clap after planes land need not apply

769
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:45,472
That's a pretty solid one of courts are going to side with you on that one

770
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,008
Bobcat

771
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:51,104
Hooters has long been known for the waitresses in tight shirts and hot pants

772
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:54,432
But now looking to extend their brand they open a new chain of rest

773
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:55,968
Specifically designed for who

774
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,504
4 Mormons

775
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,304
I have no idea

776
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:15,424
Looks like it's like you know you go there and you say that's right Timmy at the sound an owl makes and nothing else

777
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,008
Hooters

778
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,032
But for

779
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,640
China work clean

780
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:26,688
But you can that's the point

781
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:28,992
I know I'm trying to work clean

782
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:31,296
You bring your kids

783
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,624
Yes you just said it was for kids

784
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,904
Hooters for families

785
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:36,928
It's called

786
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:37,952
Hoots

787
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:43,328
The Hooters restaurant that is usually known as a great place for very sad dad's to

788
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,608
Distress eat while sitting

789
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:45,376
Nearby

790
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,960
What is starting a new family restaurant chain called

791
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:49,728
Boots

792
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:55,104
And it done a very good job they've even remove the nipples from the 200s on the side

793
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:55,872
To take my kids

794
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:56,896
Hooters for Mother's Day

795
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:59,968
Mother's Day

796
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:04,320
Psych

797
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:07,904
I want objectify women but I don't want to go to a strip club

798
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,928
Cuz those are dirty

799
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,512
Strip club

800
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:13,536
Wave training

801
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:15,584
Pretty much

802
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:18,144
Pretty much so this is to basically get your

803
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:18,912
Your kids use

804
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:19,680
2

805
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:23,776
The overall Hooters environment

806
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:25,056
When they're of age

807
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:31,456
Will feel very comfortable at a full life

808
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,480
Cysts on breast

809
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:34,784
Ice will be shifted away from leering at that mentored

810
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,320
Nursing infants

811
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:39,392
In fact the menu offers three kinds of milk chocolate 2%

812
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,160
And prepared tape

813
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:40,928
Hillside

814
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:58,848
Coming up with lightning fill in the blank the first is the game where you have to listen for the rhyme if you like to play on air quality of a message

Sea level rise which is an issue

838
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:59,776
I mean people down where you live in the forest

839
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:01,312
You can't really argue about

840
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,592
Sea level rise because

841
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:04,384
It's basically sloshing at your ankles

842
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:06,176
Yeah that's right

Do you think there's any chance that we here in Chicago will have OSHA

846
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:14,368
Ocean front property cuz that would be

847
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,488

00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:27,168
Dilwyn hour

Ready to go

853
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,728
Yes here is

854
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:30,496
The first limerick

855
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:33,824
With my veil through the pre-check I'm heading

856
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:36,128
The best man's late flight

857
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,152
We are dreads

858
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:38,688
Still

859
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:40,224
Terminal 3 is the

860
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:40,992
The right place

861
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:43,040
Southwest

862
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:44,832
The theme of our

863
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:51,488
Wedding guest wedding if you've ever gotten off a flight with a dry mouth

864
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:52,512
Mouth will also happy

865
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:55,328
Independent thought gee I wish I was getting married right now

866
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:58,912
The ticket it from a couple who got married at a baggage claim in the

867
00:37:59,168 --> 00:37:59,936
The Cleveland Airport

868
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:02,240
Don't laugh have you been to a bag

869
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,008
Paracelsus

870
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,288
It is the Paris

871
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:05,056
Of Ohio

872
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:08,384
The couple get married at the Southwest baggage

873
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,200
Clan because they met their 12 years earlier and South

874
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:15,296
I promise any day now that their bags

875
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:21,696
Will show up at Southwest donated Airline snacks for the reception

876
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:25,280
And is a treat even let the bride and groom have a full can

877
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,048
Can of soda

878
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:30,400
Sadly however because they checked in late they weren't able to stand

879
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,424
And next to each other

880
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,080
The collapsible screen I'm remoulding

881
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:40,640
Now the shards of my phone

882
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:41,920
I'm beholden

883
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,712
This phone isn't

884
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:44,480
Smart

885
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,528
Cuz it just breaks apart

886
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,552
Like a map

887
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:48,576
It just

888
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:49,856
Camp handle

889
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,904
Folding rolling yes

890
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:58,304
Samsung is delaying the release of its highly-anticipated Galaxy fold

891
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,072
The phone which

892
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:00,096
Does a foldable screen

893
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:02,144
Now it's true the screen has a tendency to break

894
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,680
But it only happens

895
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:05,216
If you fold it

896
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:11,360
Breaks by the way in the bad way we're trained as a working on the good way we get to smaller phones

897
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:12,128
We can share with a friend

898
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:19,040
The phone was expected to retail for $2,000 you may be thinking wait isn't that just really an expensive flip phone

899
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:20,320
No

900
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,344
Because flip phone

901
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,112
Work

902
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:25,696
They were the folks that have the

903
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,024
Exploding song

904
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,048
Just wondering like

905
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:33,120
It's the same you know engineer

906
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:38,752
What are you got I know

907
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:39,520
My bad

908
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,848
Folding phones that break

909
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:47,200
Here is your life

910
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:50,016
I ran from the gym for a quick

911
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:51,296
Snack I skip

912
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,856
Factors context

913
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:56,416
I've neglected my app

914
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:57,696
Weather

915
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,976
No excess Flash

916
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,024
Cuz it's urgent

917
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,304
Scope statement

918
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:08,960
Yes very good this week this week

919
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:10,496
American Society of plastic

920
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:13,312
Dick Sargent unveiled a new technique called abdominal

921
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:14,080
Etching

922
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:17,152
Where they sculpt your belly fat into a six

923
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:21,760
Finally a simple painless way to get rocks off tabs

924
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:28,160
Requires multiple follow-up visits and for the patient to wear foam dressings on their stuff

925
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:30,464
4 weeks to keep the etchings in Play Store

926
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,232
Play set

927
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:33,280
So you think a tight corset

928
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:35,072
Pressing into your belly fat

929
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:35,840
Weeks

930
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,376
Is better than going to the

931
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:38,144
