Yes all right

70
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,272
Your first quote took up most of the

71
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,064
The space in a birth announcement

72
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:07,136
Archie Harrison mountbatten-windsor

73
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:13,024
That was the name that is longer right now than the person it was given to who is it

74
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:16,352
The new royal baby royal baby

75

00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,032
1 million

78
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,848
Different species of life on Earth are going extinct

79
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:27,872
But at least

80
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,152
We were able to

81
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:29,920
To save

82
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:30,688
The rare

83
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:34,272
Useless baby Royal

84
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:39,136
This is the first child of Prince Harry and his

85
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,416
His wife Meghan

86
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,696
The baby is

87
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:42,720
You sure you want to know

88
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,256
7th in line to

89
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,280
Did the throne after

90
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,304
His grandfather

91
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,328
Is Uncle an

92
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,096
And his cousins

93
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:50,400
So he'd better get to killing it

94
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,192
Now

95
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:54,752
Yeah that was Game of Thrones he's like next

96
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:57,312
So I'm nearly now you nearly next yeah

97
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:01,408
Really better than American term that's like being the the secretary of agriculture

98
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:07,040
So probably not going to happen but you're allowed to dream about

99
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:10,880
Have a question about his name a couple of questions.

100
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:13,952
His name is really Archie not Archibald

101
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,655
Yeah I was hoping a lot of people

102
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,959
A lot of people say we're too obsessed

103
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:25,727
For the Royals

104
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,519
Ward and not have to be obsessed with

105
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,287
The Royals

106
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,055
But

107
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:29,823
Come on

108
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,359
It's just so exciting

109
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,919
After the last couple of years

110
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:34,943
To see a

111
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:35,711

Wow

115
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,719
Currently

116
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:49,535
You know this is Megan's first baby sometimes that's hard it was

117
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,559
The challenging labor

118
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:55,423
But interested Me by tradition the OBGYN who finally pulled the baby out is now the right

119
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,191
King of England

120
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:59,519
Well isn't I mean I don't know

121
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:00,543
British history

122
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,567
Thoroughly but

123
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,103
Is this the first

124
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:05,407
Royals with American

125
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:07,199
Colonial

126
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:10,271
Apparently there was somebody way back when but certainly is

127
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,831
What is the first one

128
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:19,231
Yeah yeah

129
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,791
I don't know why I saw a CNN did some

130
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,327
Horrible tagline

131
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:29,215
How old will you be black on black

132
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:30,751
How do you

133
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,799
How do you raise a British black purse

134
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:38,175
All African-American I thought I died

135
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:41,503
I don't know if you saw the video of Prince Harry

136
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:44,575
Coming out he was so excited

137
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,879
He said the baby was close to amazing

138
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,927
His wife was quote amazing

139
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,999
And the birth itself was quote wait for it amazing

140
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:56,607
But you know what he also said something that men I've never heard a man say

141
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,935
He said I don't know how women do it

142
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:06,591
I have never heard a man say that I'm sure men

143
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:13,503
What kind of man do you hang around

144
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:19,903
I thought that was so endearing he was so delighted with everything he was frankly

145
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:20,671
Hey just so happy f

146
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:24,511
Happiest day they didn't have feathers

00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,351
Gingrich

149
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,631
Speaking on Fox News

150
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,935
You didn't lose a billion dollars

151
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:34,239
He had a billion dollars

152
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,847
Mr. Gingrich was explaining why

153
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:39,871
Despite news of this

154
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:43,199
Astounding laws who's still really is a wonderful business

155
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:47,807
It could be Trump Donald Trump our president

156
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,879
The New York Times reported this week

157
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,695
That Donald Trump lost one

158
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,231
Billion dollars

159
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,767
Between around 1985

160
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,047
A 1994

161
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:03,167
He lost money running a casino hotels Airlines a football team on one occasion

162
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,215
He left 300 million dollar bills

163
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:07,775
In the pockets of his pants that he ran through the walk

164
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,055
Honestly

165
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:12,383
We should have figured out he really wasn't that good at business when

166
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,175
He tried to pay off Stormy Daniels

167
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:14,943
With a Groupon

168
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,527
Peter got to say one thing

169
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,575
Change your name Brian

170
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:21,855
People need to realize

171
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,415
He lost a billion dollars back

172
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,695
A billion dollars worth

173
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:29,023
The billion.

174
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,047
Free internet

175
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:36,191

176
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,727
Destroy people's lives

177
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,263

Accidentally lose that much money I would have to do it

182
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,063
Purposely

00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:33,376
Sideways get the ball

565
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:39,008
Jump 10 feet over the head of the guy coming in the second base and throw to first

566
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,312
Do they come up to you and asks

567
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:46,688
Well how do you get into the floor

568
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,736

Explain to people

570
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,296
Yolanda Sanchez

571
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:53,088
What's in motion stays in motion

572
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,392
Right so the one thing that you don't want to do

573
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,184
Princess Anne middle infield

574
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,720
Is be stagnating

575
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:02,048
Yeah there has to be some type of movement that allows you

576
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,072
You go left to right

577
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:05,888
And that that probably is the one thing

578
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,936
When I talk to her when I try

579
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:08,960
Trying to teach a guy

580
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:11,008
Is to have some type of movement

581
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,544
Cuz that's what allows you

582
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:21,248
Never flat-footed it's interesting because you mentioned you know laws of physics cuz I was watching

583
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:23,552
Quinceanera highlights and that was physically impossible

584
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:26,624
Couldn't be done

585
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,416
I always ask

586
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:32,512
Question of of elite athletes like yourself how young were you when you knew that you were good

587
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:36,864
You know I don't know if you ever really know exactly when that

588
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:40,192
But when I was a kid I used to throw the ball light where to pick fruit

589
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,728
I used to throw the ball up

590
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,776
On one side of the roof

591
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,848
And run around to the other side

592
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:47,616
In hopes

593
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,896
Yeah of catching it

594
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:50,176

596
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:52,736
Yeah

597
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,016

598
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:55,040
Did you do it

599
00:24:55,552 --> 00:25:00,416
I never did I never I never did but it was that type of

600
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,184
Determination

601
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,464

00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,816

The original Wizard of Oz

649
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:55,872
The classic

650
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,152
1939

651
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:57,920

Richardson St Louis Missouri

All right all right

657
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,072
People say they don't make them like they used to and it's

658
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,352
It's true The Wizard of Oz is

659
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,632
Proof of that which of these

660
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:20,960
Is a real reason that the Wizard of Oz as it was made

661
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:22,240
Could not be made

662
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,008
Today

663
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,800
Hey the actors who

664
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:26,848
Who played the munchkins were all paid a fracture

665
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,128
Action of regular wages

666
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,152
Due to an old

667
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:30,432
Pay by height

668
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:34,272
Be the wicked witches broomstick

669
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,064
The scarecrow's outfit in all of the

670
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,856
The fake snow we're made of a

671
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:38,624
Bestest

672
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:42,720
Or see the 1994 Religious Freedom Act

673
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,256
Which prevents witches

674
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,280
Or wiccans

675
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:47,328
From being presented in negative light

676
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:49,888
Call

677
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,960
Idiocracy

678
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,616
Can I tell an anecdote

679
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:02,688
So I read that you know the Tin Man

680
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:04,224
With all the silver

681
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:07,040
Bet that makeup was so toxic

682
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:09,088
That it sent the original actor

683
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:15,488
To the hospital

684
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:22,656
Genesis

685
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:24,704
That scene in the poppy field Arrow sleeping

686
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:30,336
And all the snow falls on their faces and wasted

687
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:33,664
Alright next question The Wizard of Oz has been of course

688
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,200
The pop culture treasure since it's

689
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:36,224
Releasing 39

690
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:37,248
Sometimes

691
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:39,808
Things from the movie pop up in unexpected places

692
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:40,832
As in which of these

693
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,904
Hey after Margaret Thatcher died in 2013

694
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,952
The song Ding Dong The Witch

695
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:47,232
His dad re-entered

696
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:49,536
British music charts at number two

697
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:54,144
B Popeye's restaurant once offered something called the gizzard of Oz

698
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:58,752
Or see Garth Brooks 2003 man behind the curtain tour in which

699
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:00,032
He sang his entire set

700
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:02,336
In a booming voice from behind a curtain

701
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:03,872
Just like the wizard did

702
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:12,576
They said they say what are you saying that you're right that's what happened

703
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:14,624
All right

704
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:18,976
Let's see if you can be as perfect in this as you were in just about everything else

705
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:22,304
There was a fair amount of acrimony of the said it was

706
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,840
Wizard of Oz with a lot of the hate folks

707
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,888
Because I'm one of the performers who was it

708
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:26,912
Was it a

709
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:28,960
Scarecrow actor Ray Bolger

710
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:31,776
Who walked around the set saying actually I'm very smart

711
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,056
And mansplaining

712
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:37,408
B-flat Ami roskopf a Russian method actor

713
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:39,712
Who played the lead flying monkey and weld

714
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:41,248
Decided to act like a monkey on

715
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,784
On the set if you know what I mean

00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:44,576

718
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,952

00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,232
He work

What's total play

721
00:29:54,304 --> 00:30:00,448
You're right it was me

722
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:06,848
Terry the dog who played Tuttle brought down like a hundred fifty bucks a week which of the time is

723
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:07,616
The equivalent

724
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,384
$2,000

725
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,152
