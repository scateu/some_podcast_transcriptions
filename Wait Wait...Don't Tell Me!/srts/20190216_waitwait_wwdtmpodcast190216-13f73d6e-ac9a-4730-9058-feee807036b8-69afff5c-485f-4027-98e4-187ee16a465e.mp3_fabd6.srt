Yes I am your first load here is

79
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,304
The president

80
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,096
I can't say I'm happy

81
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,912
I can't say I'm thrilled

82
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:23,776
That was the president talking about a deal that he really really doesn't like butt

83
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,568
Eddie's going to sign anyway

84
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,360
The deal to do what

85
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:34,016
App for a border funding to avoid a government shutdown

86
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,320
Behove

87
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:39,392
The art of the deal it turns out it's the kind of art that makes

88
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,160
You say Mikey

89
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,488
Tok the Democrats

90
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,256
Offered

91
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:47,840
This is how I

92
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:48,864
Last year

93
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,656
Wofford President Trump about

94
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,192
2 billion dollars for defense

95
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:58,080
And the president said no I want 5 billion and I'm going to shut down the government until you give it to me

96
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,360
So he did that

97
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,664
And now he's going to get about 1 points

98
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,432
4 billion

99
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:06,272
He negotiates like he's in a limbo contest

100
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:09,088
How low can you go

101
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,904
The president is going to save face

102
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,672
She's going to say face by

103
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,952
I totally came in the wall

104
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,744
Declaring a national emergency

105
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,280
If you have an emergency

106
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,839
Building a Big Wang cement wall

107
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,375
Slowest way to

108
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:27,519

115
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:50,047
Yeah I know you're just kidding but somebody's going to hear this

116
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,847
You notice that the

117
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,127
The president as

118
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,199
It's become clearer and clearer that he's just not going to get this wall

119
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,991
Has done this amazing thing

120
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,527
He simply started

121
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,295
Saying

122
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,575
That he did

123
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,879
To like you told rally he don't he said

His handlers app

129
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,399
People around him

00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,007
Just tell him that we did build a wall

132
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:37,151
And put him back on Executive time I mean he's not going to know he

133
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:39,967
He's never going to go check or anything so you just like

134
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,271

I get it now

142
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:10,431
That was a man named Jake Flores commenting on what company that suddenly backed out on a plant

143
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,967
The move to New York

144
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,783
Amazon Amazon

145
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:21,439
Amazon came to New York with just a

146
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,487
The dream and the hundred billion dollars

147
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:24,255
Pocket

148
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:28,095
New York City a bunch of clowns get off at Port Authority every day

149
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:33,215
This is a city that will tolerate 3 billion rats and regularly sitting in pee in the subway

150
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:37,055
But Amazon hell no

151
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:40,895
So it stopped you know cuz it was going to go to New York and mama said New Yorkers got upset and

152
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:41,663
Back down

153
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,967
Set a tough week for Jeff Bezos but at least when it comes

154
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,503
The Amazon New York

155
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,551
Feel that something we can on

156
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:55,999
Set the deal look solid they were going to build this new headquarters in Queens but New Yorkers were upset that the mayor and the governor

157
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,023
Gave Amazon

158
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,047
Tax breaks

159
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,071
Helipad

160
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,607

On her wedding night

163
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:08,287
The local officials in Union guys made such a fuss about it that Amazon sat5 will take her bottle girl home

164
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:11,359
Also every Alexa in New York is not responding to

165
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:13,919
To request you know like Alexa what's the weather by saying

166

167
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:21,599
I'm not there what's going to be embarrassing is now that

168
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,879
Jeff Bezos is going to have to like

169
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,439
Make a late-night call to Gary Indiana

No return

177
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:50,783
That was a US District Attorney talking about the conviction of what drug lord this week

178
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:58,207
El Chapo

179

00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:07,935
So this time

184
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,215
They are

185
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,495
The door

Checkmate

187
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:18,175
It was an amazing trial it was both a

188
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,991
It was about the trial and a movie about a trial

189
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:23,807
El Chapo's mistress testified against him singing

190
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,855
Here's how much you love him while his wife

191
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:26,623
Watch

192
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,159
From the courtroom

193
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,183
And his wife

194
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,463
Still stood by him

195
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,231
The whole time

196
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,023
Maven coordinated outfit

197
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:37,119
Is it true it's a tribute to the power of true love and billions of dollars in drugs

198
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,423
I think if your mistress

199
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,239
Is testifying on your behalf and your wife is

200
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,519
Sitting in the courtroom

201
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,055
You're like a runner

202
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:48,383
Can you lock me up for a while

203
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:52,223
There are those that mean they're being of the fact that he's going to jail for

204
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,247
There's only the rest of his life

205
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,807
People say will make any difference

206
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,087
Because his whole business

207
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,111
Is going to

208
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,135
The inherited

209
00:08:59,391 --> 00:08:59,903
They say

210
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,671
By his

211
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,951
Twin Suns known as

212
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,231
Los chapitos

213
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:07,327
Roasted potatoes sounds silly but it's no sillier than

214
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,863
El Chapo

215
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,399
Which means

216
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,423
Shorty

217
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,447
That's most

218
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,215
Fear drug lord

219
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:13,983
Shorty

220
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,007
And that's

221
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:15,775
Silly

222
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,055
Cuz he's only 5 6

223
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,847
And it's insulting in an Acura Epic

224
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,383
T56 is well within the normal Ray

225
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,831

Is it a bit of weirdly hot water this week

252
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,759
They actually had to come out and deny

253
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,295
Claims being made in the internet

254
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,087
That the pizza they serve is what

255
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:35,903
Are they had to deny claims that they're using

256
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:36,927
Pizza

257
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,463
That other customers

258
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:42,303
Have like thrown out basically

259
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:46,143
That sounded like

260
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,007
Pizza

261
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,031

Quarter of another

266
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,967
It says clearly

267
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:04,575
What they're doing is they're taking the pizza that their prior customers don't eat and slapping it on your plate

268
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,599
Filling out with somebody else

269
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,647
And serving it to you is Snoopy

270
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:08,927

The cheese for the pizza don't you deserve that

274
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,103
Chuck-E-Cheese I put out a statement denying it right it's not true

275
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,919

I moved here because of the railroad history and

Wrote the book about it and the rest is history

344
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,111

A potential disaster was narrowly averted last week when two armed F-18 Hornets were scrambled

To respond to an Airborne disturbance over an elementary school

358
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,775
In the town of Sedro-Woolley washington

359
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,847
We didn't know if it was going to be Al-Qaeda or alien

360
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,639
Pilot John Bolden told

361
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,919
Skagit Valley Herald

362
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:18,271
It just look like a cluster of some kind of small Warcraft on the radar

363
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,575
It turned out to be something much more sinister

364
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,367
5 drones

365
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,903
Being piloted

366
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,439
By 5 different parents

367
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:28,255
Watching their kids play during recess

368
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:33,887
Apparently things started when Jan saperstein the mom of Brayden

369
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:34,655
A fourth grader

370
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,727
Heard from her son at the other kids were cheating at tetherball

371
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,799
Using a drone camera that her older son

372
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:41,567
Caden

373
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:46,943
Add quart bags for and then never use not even once Jen did uncover rampant

374
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,991
Tetherball and Hopscotch cheating

375
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,087
Uneven photo documented it sending the Drone pics to the school administrators

376
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,391
This led to a number of the accused kids

377
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,183
Parents buying their own drones

378
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,975
To gather their own evidence

379
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,535
The number eventually grew to five

380
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,839
Known in aviation circles as

381
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,631
And overparenting of drones

382
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:11,263
The mid-air dogfight that have started breaking out posts real danger to the students

383
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:15,359
Play was actually the noise from all those drones that proved to be the final straw

384
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:18,175
2087 year old Lloyd leyritz who lived

385
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:21,503
Near the school emerge from his house in full duck hunting camo

386
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,063
And started shooting at the aircraft with a shotgun

387
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:27,135
That was when the US military got involved

388
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:30,975
And that was when Mary Purcell Elementary School officially banned all drones

389
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:36,351
Now staring daggers across the parking lot during after school pick up that is still allowed

390
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:43,775
A drone dogfight as overprotective mothers and wash

391
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,567
Washington State tried to monitor their

392
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:46,847
Elementary School

393
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,383
Kids your neck story of a mom

394
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,663
Can't stop mumbling

395
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,711
Comes from Alonzo bodden

396
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:55,039
Every grandmother thinks their grandchild is perfect

397
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,367
But if you had the chance would you want to make sure

398
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,391
Before it was too late

399
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:04,255
Rodger Cato's mom Lindsey was delighted when he told her that he and

400
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,791
His girlfriend Wendy were engaged

401
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,095
But Lindsey became obsessed

402
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,119
With one question

403
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,399
And it wasn't the wedding day

404
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:13,215
What would her future grandchild look like

405
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:14,751
How about their health

406
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:18,079
Since Wendy's relatives weren't around the only solution

407
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,615
To get a sample of Wendy's

408
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,383
DNA

409
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,175
She thought it would be easy

410
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,455
But as it turned out

411
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,991
Future daughter-in-law

412
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,271
Is a bit of a germaphobe

413
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,319
Mom offered when do you taste

414
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,343
Cookie dough

415
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,879
I think you should get DNA from

416
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:31,647
Spoon

417
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:34,463
And Wendy whipped out her own sterilize spoon

418
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:39,583
Mom suggested to Wendy that she looks feverish and offered to take her temperature

419
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,887
But Wendy had her own ear thermometer

420
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,935
Mom tried the direct

421
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:47,263
The protesting will be fun for the family to send in their DNA

422
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,799
And find out that backgrounds

423
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,079
Wendy's response

424
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,103
Those companies

425
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,663
Is keeping cell personal info so no way

426
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,199
But it's blank

427
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:55,967
Lindsey Woods

428
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:56,991
Convince Wendy Wu

429
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:59,039
Spy or a mutant or worse

430
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:00,831
She had to have that

431
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,647
Which is why Lindsey Kato

432
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,415
63

433
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:07,743

00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,095
Stolen urine sample

437
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:15,423
As a first-time offender mosquito will most likely

00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,959
We be sentenced to the minimum 6

439
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:17,983
In jail

440
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,775
But having finally gotten windy

441
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:21,311
To show her some family picture

442
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:24,895
She will spend the time in jail bragging to her cell mates

443
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,687
About her tall blonde

444
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,967
Future grandchildren

445
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:28,735
With a pinch

446
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:29,503
Breitling

447
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:37,183
A future Grandma tries to steal

448
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:39,743
Her future daughter-in-laws DNA

449
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:43,327
And your last story of a Grizzly mom comes from maven

450
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:46,143
Is there anything better than a mother's love

451
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:48,447
1 married and Mom certainly think so

452
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:51,263
She wants an actual lovers love for her son

453
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:55,615
The woman's name is unknown but she was spotted on tosin University campus

454
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,919
Desperately trying to find her son a date

455
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,455
The Baltimore Sun

456
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:02,015
Which is a newspaper and not her actual son

457
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:10,207
Reported this week that a woman in her fifties with approaching people and showing them photos of her baby boy all grown up and asking them to

00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:11,999
Cheap

460
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:17,119
Chief Charles Herring said her reported Behavior may cause

461
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:17,887
Concern

462
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,423
He did not specify

463
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,775
To whom it would cause concern but it's widely assumed he meant her absolute version of

464
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:26,335
Avatar

465
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:30,943
University officials say that the woman is not being sauce for any criminal investigation

466
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:33,759
But they do want her to refrain from hustling her son

467
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:35,039
Photo of encompass

468
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:37,599

Well we could not find the mother in question but we did speak to a reporter who

487
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:31,615
Who's covering

488
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:37,759
A woman in her fifties was going around campus with a picture on her phone of her son

489
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,039
And she was at

00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:43,391
Asking people if they'd be willing to fight a state for it

Well they do something else

501
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:26,656
Matt Smith first became world famous playing the iconic British TV character

00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:37,152
The famously transgressive photographer Robert mapplethorpe

508
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,688
Before playing Charlie Manson

509
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:40,224
We're beginning to suspect

510
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,504
Please not ask

511
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,784
Actually any of those

512
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,344
People but instead some kind of act

513
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:49,184
Matt Smith welcome to wait wait don't tell me

514
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,096

00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,296
2010

520
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:20,416
And for people who don't know the doctor has been played over the course of 50

521
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,952
2 years by a bunch of different actor

522
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:23,232
Under the conceit

523
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,256
That he regenerates

524
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,024
And he gets

525
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,304
He becomes a different person

526
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:31,168
Yeah it in your ear doctors seem to be having a lot of

527
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:31,936

Like parent

531
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:46,016
For example

532
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,808
Ticket from a to zed

533
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:49,856
Dakota kccd

534
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,464
That

535
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,936
Shutdown I mean

536
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,544
Timer

537
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:14,944
Look before you get all high-and-mighty your country is about to fall off the edge of the Earth

538
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:21,088
You know what's funny of course man if Doctor Who were real none of this ever would have happened

539
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:23,904
Opt-in

540
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,208
So you go from Dr Who

541
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:27,232

542
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,024
2 plane

543
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:31,840
Prince Philip who is a very real person

544
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:37,984
Did you guys working in the show ever get anything back from the actual royal family

545
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,032
About how they felt about who you were to pick

546
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,080
I think the fit it was off

547
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:45,664
If he if he works there and he just turned around and said

548
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:47,456
Joshua

549
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:55,392
Joe Sadler you've been phased out I want to get removed before she been phased out of the crown because that their aging you out

550
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:57,440
You got to be replaced by an older actor

551
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,208
Tobias Menzies

552
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:00,512
Did you argue with him to say I can be old and decrepit

553
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,680
Change it

554
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:13,312
2 years I think you'll be able to achieve it'll be wonderful looking forward to the first season of the next episode 1 of course

555
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,336
Prince Philip

556
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:19,456
Dies and regenerates as Tobias Menzies

557
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:24,320
And then I just want to talk to you about your latest film which is mapplethorpe

558
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:27,904
Is out now in which you play Robert mapplethorpe again a very real person

559
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:28,928

Now Prince was Prince's real name he was born Prince Rogers Nelson

But when he was very young sheep

617
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,888

618
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:18,656

Knowing about him

626
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:37,344
The answer was

627
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,112
Skipper

628
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:40,672

Let's be friends again

633
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:48,096
Prince got an early break as a musician

634
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:51,168
When he was hired to open for the Rolling Stones.

635
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:53,984
Concert in LA in 1981 but it didn't go well

636
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:54,752
What happened

637
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:55,520
Hyundai

638
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:59,104
Mick Jagger looked at him and said nobody goes on stage who's

639
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,384
Skinnier than I am

640
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:04,480
Beef and chased him off stage by throwing garbage at

641
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:09,856
Or see Prince announced his set by saying sorry that it all goes downhill after I'm

00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:18,560
Call Taylor

643
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:22,144
They chased him off the stage

644
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,936
The garbage and he was very upset

645
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:25,984
But it was too nice and they said don't worry about it

646
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,520
Those crazy we're so sorry go on

647
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:28,288

00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,824
It will be fine anyone on the second night

649
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:31,872
And they chased him off the stage with garbage

650
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:34,688
But why he got his vengeance

651
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,992

Half a million dollars

659
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,280

Basketball court

668
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:00,288

Be when Prince rented boozers home

672
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:08,992
He turned boozers bedroom into a hair salon without asking

673
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:13,856
Or see if the 2007 NBA All-Star Weekend Prince hooked up

674
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,392
With Boosie's girlfriend

675

00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,368
With the kids these days

750
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:28,416
I've had very little experience with

751
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:29,440
I don't know what it is

752
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:34,048
Oh they're confused by cash

753
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:35,840
Store owners

754
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:38,144
Report children being bewildered by

755
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:38,912
Currency

756
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:40,192
Paper and coins

757
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:41,728
It parents say that

758
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,776
Is there kids how to identify money

759
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:44,800
Well

760
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:46,848
It's the thing with all the old white man on it

761
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,408
No no not the US Senate

762
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:56,320
Google shopping being done online and more stores not even accepting cash kids

763
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,344
Never see eye-to-eye

764
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,368
What currency in fact

765
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,392
There's a new edition

766
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:01,440
Of Monopoly that doesn't even have

767
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:02,720
Metal debit cards

768
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:04,000
Player that's true

769
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:08,096
Again Peter at you know I hate to be the cultural one whenever I'm here

770
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:11,168
But I just don't think black kids are confused by money

771
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:17,568
Really

772
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:19,872
You know you you go to a black

773
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:22,432
Child or Latino child and say

774
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:28,832
Here's some money they're going to be like thank you then I can be like what is that

775
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:35,232
Anything you speak of oh no they blow my nose it's not going to happen

776
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,000
Money

777
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:37,280
Just money while goes away by

778
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,560
Eventually think of the tradition

779
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:39,840
That will be lost

780
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,144
Young kid standing in front of a wishing well

781
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,960
They close their eyes and make a wish and then they throw your iPhone down at

782
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,264
Maze

783
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:51,360

Fairy lights

790
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:09,536

791
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:10,560
Pettibone

792
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:23,360
People with that people would like

793
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:28,480
Vornado with no people who have something that might care about that might get blown away

794
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:32,576
It's a little dog that's exactly right

00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:38,464
Hang onto your hats ladies

Especially if you wear a shitzu as a hat

798
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,888
This week

00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:48,192
Sworn that in some parts of the Midwest wind gust

800
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:49,728

801
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:50,752
Harry Wei

802
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:52,032
Smaller pets

Twitter. A picture of a little dog getting blown away watch out they said

00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:20,960
The photo was adorable and hilarious and an undoubtedly inspired pet owners

811
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:21,984
To throw caution

812
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:22,752
Into the winds

813
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:24,800
That is pet owners who would name their chihuahuas

814
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:25,568
Caution

815
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,688

Two more trouble don't worry though they said as long as their last name is not a city in Southern California

834
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:10,880
They'll be fine

835
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,208
There is one name that did worse

836
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,488
I don't feel bad all the way

837
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:17,536

00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,688
Like a baseball team where we got jackets

845
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:36,224
