00:00:03,072 --> 00:00:07,168
From NPR and WBEZ Chicago this is

2
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:09,984
Wait wait don't tell me the NPR news

00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:15,616
You'll never take down this

4
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:16,896
Billionaire

5
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:26,112
And here is your hostess

6
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:27,904
Chase Bank Auditorium

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,672
Chicago

8
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:41,728
It's that time of the year when everybody goes wait a minute Summer's almost over and then they don't run around like maniacs

9
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:44,800
Pack as much fun as they can into the short time remaining

10
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:46,336
That's what we're doing in the shower

11
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:47,616
We're packing in

12
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:49,152
So many memorable moments

13
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:50,176
Android conversation

14
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:54,272
Well by the time we're done you'll be ready to go back to work

15
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:55,552
Just to get a break

16
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:57,088
From all the joy

17
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,392
First

18
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:02,720
When I was growing up I loved Jacque Cousteau the famous

19
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:03,488
Oceanex

20
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,280
Explorer

21
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,584
More sense because Jack

22
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,608
What is father

23
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,704
Gusto joined us in June of last year Peter asked him

24
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:14,240
How he was introduced

25
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:15,776
To the undersea world

26
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:22,432
But until my fourth birthday it's slightly different I actually went to the bottom of the pool with a family friend who is

27
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:27,808
Reading the newspaper while I was Buddy breathing with him everything is when you're sort of sharing one respirator

28
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:28,576
Back and forth

29
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,368
Star Trek and

30
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,672
He's reading a newspaper at the bottom of a pool

31
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:37,536
Yeah I guess he was bored but there's not much to see at the bottom of the boot into any fish in there I understand

32
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:40,608
Did you always want to go into what I guess

33
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:41,376
This is the family biz

34
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:42,400
The coastal family

35
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:45,216
I was actually

36
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:48,288
I never pressured to be in the family business I was always encouraged

37
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,824
To forge my own path

38
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:56,224
But at the pass always ended up turning back towards what we do with the family

39
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,504
Because I grew up watching

40
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,272
Your grandfather TV

41
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,808
It will the jacuzzi

42
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,600
And I mean

43
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,368
To me what I

44
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,392
Remember as much

45
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,416
What is the film of the fish

46
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,208
Is your father's

47
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,512
The grandfather amazing French accent

48
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,984
I'm talking to you and I can tell it if you did not speak

49
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,288
Really elaborate right exit I will not take you

50
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:23,360
You seriously

51
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:29,248
Jordan time when I was 7

52
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,320
Your specialty is

53
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:36,416
Sharks right I saw a film review diving with sharks

54
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,440
Inside

55
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,208
Well I don't know how to do

56
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:40,256
Describe it it's a big artificial shark

57
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,024
You hiding

58
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,584
Shark shaped submersible yes

59
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:50,496
I always wanted to approach great white sharks in a different way than the ugly bubbling creatures in the cage Thor

60
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,544
At these wild animals

61
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:59,968
The best way to go and learn a little bit more about them is to become a shark so that became reality and

62
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,272
M6 2007

63
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:05,088
Rebuild a shark shaped submersible little did I know that

64
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:10,208
Doing such a thing was more challenging and I ended up on the bottom more than I did with the sharks

65
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,512
Really so it would just like you to go down there

66
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,304
And you be like hello fellow sharks

67
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,328
And you just

68
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:21,728
Continue the sink right now

69
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:26,848
So you know it was it was meant to be a polymorphic sharp where you could do

70
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:30,176
Male and female in Fortune got so complicated we left the male parts

71
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,200
Behind in

72
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:37,600
A female shark that was hoping that hey maybe this is going to attract a shark and we'll have mating behavior

73
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,256
Female shark Parts on

74
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,120
Immersible

75
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,400
Shark parts

76
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,168
But they weren't

77
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,192
Detachable

78
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:58,336
Male sharks have two penises or clasp

79
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,360
So they're lucky

80
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:06,016
Unfortunately

81
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:09,344
Twice the maintenance.

82
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,648
One more question

83
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,440
Witches

84
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,256
Accurate was Finding Nemo

85
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,375
Can my child hard

86
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:27,775
Well Fabian Cousteau it is a pleasure to talk to you we can talk to you all day about the ocean

87
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,055
But we have in fact

88
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,615
Ask you to play a game of this and this time we're calling it

89
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:35,967

00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:40,575
A lot of fish

92
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:41,599
Personally

93
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:47,999
What do you know about the band Phish

94
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:51,583
Legendary

95
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,143
Some Grateful Dead fans find a little to Mandarin

96
00:04:54,911 --> 00:05:00,543
Answer to out of these three questions right you win a prize what if I listen to the voice of anyone they might like on our show on their voice

97
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,847
Bill who is Fabian Castillo playing for

98
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,639
Robert loving them Los Angeles

99
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,407
What's California

100
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,943
Alright ready to do this

101
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,991
Let's go for it I just first question

102
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,783
How fish got its name

103
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,063
PH

104
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,343
Is HP

105
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:16,671
How fish got its name has been a subject of Interest

106
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,207
Fans for decades

107
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:20,511
Which of these is a possible explanation for

108
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,791
Permasand quoted in Newsweek

109
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:26,143
Hey that's what the bandleader Trey Anastasio says and said

110
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,679
The cursing

111
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,983
BSN acronym meaning

112
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,519
Psychedelic hypnotic

113
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,799
Instrumental sounds are

114
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:33,567
Happening

115
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:38,431
Dorsia to take on the sound that comes out when you're filling a balloon

116
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:39,967
Do nitrous oxide

117
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:40,735
At a party

118
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,503
In Vermont

119
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,111
My love Sia

120
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,647
I won't say that I've done that

121
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:51,487
Before

122
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,583
Question

123
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,167
The acronym meaning

124
00:05:59,423 --> 00:05:59,935
Psychedelic

125
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:00,959
Hypnotic instrumental

126
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,775
I

127
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,079
I'm guessing that knows answer the nitrous oxide

128
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,687
Is the river that never come out in

129
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:17,087
I actually listen to a lot of fish music and I'm

130
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,367
I'm guessing it was the nitrous

131
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:24,255
Lead singer Trey Anastasio was

132
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:28,607
Expelled from the University of Vermont for a prank that he is never described in public

133
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,655
But according to Phish fans it was

134
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:31,679
One of these

135
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,447
A

136
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:35,519
Stealing a human heart and hand from a biology lab

137
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:38,591

00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:01,887
Sick twisted humor of the of the hand a

This Summer's been

190
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:43,679
Pretty full

191
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:47,007
Snowfall in fact that we had to edit out

192
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:47,775
Part of it

193
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:50,335
Here's a question we asked Roy Blount Jr

194
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,871
A couple of months ago that we

195
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:52,895

196
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:53,919

00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:57,759
Right we've had an intense tornado season but so far

198
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:00,063
Meteorological technology is allowed p

199
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,343
Be warned in time

200
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:04,415
One problem though residents of tornado-prone areas are

201
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,183
Complaining that

202
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:05,951
The tornado

203
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:06,975
Rings are doing what

204
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,791

205
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,559

208
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,703
Gering NE livestock at all

209
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:24,383
I had a lot several other livestock

210
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:27,199
The tornado warnings are interfering with

211
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:27,967

212
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,527

And tell those people contacted the TV station

221
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:50,239
Not to thank them for saving their lives

222
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:56,895
But to tell them to stop with the warnings until we find out which of these identical asshats is going home with her

223
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:04,063
Also my TV is flying away can you do anything about that thing

234
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,031
The other solution is

235
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,311
Because of all the roundabouts

236
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,079

I've been reading your book

Which is a great book hilariously funny

294
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,143
And you were a very different person growing

295
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,679
Then you are now

296
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:02,239
Yes I was very shy

297
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,263
And

298
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,567
Weird and I just wanted to hide

00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:09,407
Israel under a blanket and never talk to anyone

300
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,711

00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,407
It was just

313
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,687
It was just a bunch of

314
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,223
Ladies sitting in a

315
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,503

Inside a community center

00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,647
And then we sat on

00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,695
The floor is like 8 Hershey bars

320
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:57,535
Oh that sounds fun

321
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,559

00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,647
It is

336
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,439
Terrifying

337
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:27,231
So I built my

338
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,255

00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,991
New rules around here

348
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:52,319
They didn't even give me that talk I think they were like

349
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,343
Come on

Even though I'm an ass girl

475
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:25,888
Kanye always says my boobs don't get as much credit as they deserve

476
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,168
Unquote

477
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,776

00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:34,336
The weather

479
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:59,680
I'm old enough to have lived through a number of Revolutions in pop music and I pretty much missed all of them while listening to me

480
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,984
My scratched up original Broadway cast album

481
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,008
Pippin

482
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:07,616
Why doesn't Vegas Peter is utterly oblivious to was

Rise of the Beastie Boys the new york-based Trio

484
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,224
Who helped to

485
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,760
Who popularized Hip Hop

486
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:14,784
With their album

487
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,576
From the 80s and 90s

488
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:19,136
So when I talked to Mike D and ad-rock

489
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,672
The Beastie Boys the main thing I wanted

490
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:21,440
Janelle was

491
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,976
What were their parents thinking

492
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:26,048
It seem like your parents and this was back in the 70s

493
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,376
Would basically let you guys do whatever you wanted

494
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:32,960
To do it was like when you were like 14 or 15 your parents like are you ghosts

495
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:35,264
See what is Black Flag concert to have whatever you want

496
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,288
Just be back by morning

497
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:43,712
There wasn't that much of a discussion

498
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:49,600
Yeah pretty much different type of parenting you know

499
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:53,696
You know the details

500
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:55,488
Flag Show versus

501
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,096
Like a bad brain Show versus a treacherous P I don't think she wanted that kind of fine print

502
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,424
And

503
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,984
One of the other things that I

504
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,056
I do not seem like you guys constantly

505
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:10,592
Had great Strokes of luck

506
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:14,176
For example you form the punk band The Beastie Boys originally hardcore band

507
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:16,736
And you did a you did a song called

508
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:17,504
Cookie Puss

509
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:22,112
British Airways

510
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:23,904
Stole it for a commercial

511
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,720
And give you lots of money

512
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,768
Which is fine

513
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:31,072
That that had happened yeah yeah

514
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:37,728
Does that strike you like an amazing Stroke of Luck cuz then you had money to like

515
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:40,032
You no pay rent and buy that first drum machine

516
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:47,200
Yeah it was pretty awesome to go from 0 to we got it we got a bunch of money was pretty nice

517
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:49,248
I've never had cash like that

518
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:53,344
I was at a friend's house and I heard our song playing from the TV set

519
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:57,440
Animals like it was one of those things that make You Go Hmmm

520
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:04,352
And then like I don't know how long after your first hip hop track

521
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:06,400
You were opening for Madonna

522
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:11,776
Yeah crazy right you guys are like 19

523
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,824
You didn't have your first album out

524
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,592
And you were

525
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:19,200
Opening for Madonna on her first national tour

526
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:22,272
Blowing up on MTV and then she becomes

527
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,552
Madonna that is

528
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:27,904
In terms of just public Consciousness like the biggest pop star

529
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,208
On a planet she likes shut up to

530
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,512
Michael Jackson

531
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:35,072
And you were like her opening act when this happen

532
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,424
I don't even know opening act

533
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,192
What is the right

534
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:40,960
Any word

535
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:45,824
Assault on

536
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,848
Poor unfortunate

537
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:53,248
Suspecting 12 year old girls

538
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:56,320
You guys are on the way up and you keep writing about your books how you

539
00:24:57,344 --> 00:25:01,440
At this point before License to Ill came out and people would hate you

540
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:05,536
Which is kind of fun for you to write about was it fun to live

541
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:09,376
Kinda I mean nothing was definitely funny that

542
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:15,264
You know children were crying watching us

543
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:20,128
Interesting seeing how angry their parents were

544
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:25,248
One last question about the book the book has got some amazing stories in it about things you did and things that you saw

00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,592
All right

566
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,200
Here's your first question in feel free to collaborate argue whatever you like

567
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:29,504
Bread is really important to the French

568
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:33,600
I'm sure you know so much of the French government once did what a

569
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:36,160
Created an award called LaCroix

570
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,952
Dapat or the cross of dough

571
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,536
Be passed a law preventing Baker's from taking vacation

572
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:46,656
4C they sent in certain violent criminals to eating only American bread

573
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,472
Definitely

574
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,336
Be because

575
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,152
Vacations are essential

576
00:26:57,408 --> 00:27:02,784
French people at the Crossing Doe

577
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:06,368
Yes it was actually be the one about taking vacation

578
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:12,000
Because the problem is French

579
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:18,400
Bakers were not allowed to take vacations but then they

580
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:20,704
Modify the rules another Baker's of France

581
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:23,008
Can either take vacations in July or August

582
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:25,312
But that way there will always be some Bakers around

583
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,384
They did

584
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,432
Here we go

585
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:34,272
These days most people are more excited about baking cakes and bread making

586
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,808

613
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,760
That the protein

614
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:11,296
Of eggs would be sufficient

615
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:12,064

Did you call it that just to watch interviewers

683
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:15,360
Squirm when they had to say it on the air

684
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:19,456

00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:52,736

I just did Marietta sirleaf

701
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:58,624
Why do you just go by one name Retta

702
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:02,976
What up when I was in college

703
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:05,536
I hooked up with this guy from Georgia

704
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:07,328
And they pronounce

705
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:09,376
Marietta Georgia May weather

706
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:10,656
Oh and

707
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:13,728
He started calling me rather as if I allowed it

708
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:15,520
And my friend thought it was

709
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:21,920
Hilarious and so they insisted on calling me that and then so when I first

710
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:23,200
Doing stand-up

711
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:29,088
I between an open mic in the MC came out and said

712
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:32,672
What other actress writer and that's how I got rid of four

713
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:38,048
Because you didn't have the patience to go over your actual name with him

714
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:44,448
No I was like if this is too challenging with six of the easy stuff

715
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:45,984
One neighbor which I think is

716
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:48,800

The comedian

720
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:55,968
How did that work

721
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:58,528
I was I was pretty mad I was

722
00:33:58,784 --> 00:33:59,808
All about the book

723
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:00,576
Growing up

724
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:02,880
I

725
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:05,952
I was taking a year off after college

726
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:08,256
Which is the first time I ever lived alone

727
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:12,608
Brake just before I went into medical school

728
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,192
And I used to it and I was giving myself so my TV was my roommate

729
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,264
And after a while I feel like I can do this

730
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,056
I can do this

731
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:24,896
But I decided that I wanted to have my own which is why

732
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:28,224
I started doing stand-up because I saw that so many

733
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,504
Sitcoms where

734
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,808

The fall off the edge of the Earth

911
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:13,119
You know what's funny of course man if Doctor Who were real

912
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:14,655
None of this ever would have happened

913
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:19,775
So you go from Doctor Who

914
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:20,799
What is incredibly popular

915
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:22,591

00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:33,343
About how they felt about how you were

921
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:35,647
I think the fit it was off

922
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:39,231
If he works there and he just turned around and said

923
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:45,119
So sadly you've been phased out of the crown because

924
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:46,655
Is that their aging you out

925
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:48,703

927
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:51,263

00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:58,431
