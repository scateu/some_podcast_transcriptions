Here is your

92
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:42,720
Your first quote

93
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:45,280
He's just extremely flirtatious

94
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,072
Completely safe

95
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,864
Now

96
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,656
That was Mika Brzezinski

97
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:53,216
Defending a prominent Democrat was being criticized for

98
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:53,984
The way he lays

99
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,752
His hands

100
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,360
On the lady who is it

101
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:06,528
It is Joe Biden Vice President Joe Biden Tuesday

102
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:09,344
About to enter the presidential race was hit with accusation

103
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,112
Nations that he's been

104
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,648
Weirdly creepy with women

105
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:18,047
Not exactly man-bites-dog more like man gives dog unwanted back rub

106
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:24,447
Came forward this last week to describe an incident 5 years ago and which biting to put his hands

107
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,471
And on her shoulders

108
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:26,495
And she

109
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:29,055
He says quote inhaled her hair

110
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,639
You must have liked to brand of shampoo because he then quote

111
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,407
Put a big

112
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,967
Slow kiss on the back of her head

113
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,247
Unquote

114
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,295
Now one problem

115
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:45,695
Is that is overly familiar another is that he doesn't know which side of the head is the kissing song

116
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:48,255
Yeah he's a little

117
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,535
Clumsy it's kind of like

118
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:55,423
Lenny Bruce

119
00:04:55,935 --> 00:05:02,079
Oh my God

120
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:03,615

121
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:07,199

They smell so good

127
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,119
People like how many months are you

128
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:28,959
240

129
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:33,823
The person is buying dip was he put out a statement he said

130
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:40,223
Not once did I believe I acted inappropriately while he also believes he was born with those teeth but it doesn't make

131
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,039
Heathen

132
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,319
I had to put out a video

133
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,343
In in which

134
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,135
He doesn't quite apologize

135
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:50,207
But he explained that things used to be different back

136
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:50,975
When when he

137
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:51,743
He started

138
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:52,511
Impala

139
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:53,791
Joe Biden

140
00:05:54,303 --> 00:06:00,447
I'm not just creepy I'm also very old that

141
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,215
He should have just

142
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:04,543
Just apologize like I don't know why it's like what is it that so

143
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,079
Hard of four about policy

144
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,103
Apologizing

145
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:09,151
Because I'm sorry but I don't know

146
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:11,711
Play that whole video was like

I was like you were waiting and waiting and waiting and it and then like

148
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,831
He wanted you to think that he had said

149
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,207
Thinks he did anything wrong

150
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:22,975
I think Joseph

151
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:23,999
He's a guy that

152
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,303
This is like hey you know I'm a hugger

153
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,327
And

154
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,351

00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,111
Michelle here is your next

157
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:50,879
Quote

158
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:56,511
That was presidential lawyer Rudolph Giuliani

159
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,047
Getting a little angry

160
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:58,815
This week

161
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:02,143
At the authors of what

162
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,447
The Mueller report report

163
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:10,847
Do you remember that's why I remember last week when the Attorney General said

164
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:14,431
The mother reports which only he had seen exonerated the president

165
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,735
It also said he didn't obstruct Justice

166
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:21,599
And also not only does the president really weigh 230 lb where is

167
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,647
Does long ties just to keep

168
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:26,207
From intimidating all of us with his rock hard abs

169
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,023
Well turns out

170
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,559
Maybe not

171
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:36,959
Members of Mueller's team are reportedly very upset because there were a lot of things in the report that made the president look really really

172
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:37,727
Bad

173
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,287
And somehow they didn't get mentioned

174
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,079
The team even had a list

175
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,615
True prepare to their own

176
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,383
Summaries

177
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,919
Of the different sections of the

178
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,455
Report to be released to the public

179
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,247
Summaries with titles like

180
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,295
Like Lollapalooza but with

181
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,063
Collusion

182
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:56,927
And I can't believe it's not obstruction of justice

183
00:07:57,183 --> 00:08:00,767
Because it totally is

184
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,303
The molar teeth

185
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,327
Was

186
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,607
Legendary

187
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:05,631

Is raining outside

191
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,775
Standing next

192
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,543
Them

193
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:13,567
You said

194
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,591
Rite Aid

195
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:15,615
Indigo

196
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:20,991
Because the reason why we have like

197
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:23,039
Council regulations that we do

198
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,087
Do now that there is this like check of going

199
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:25,855
Attorney General

200
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:26,623
Because

201
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,647
Kent Starplex

202
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,183
Mass printed and like

203
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:32,255
Broke broke the internet for the first time 20 years ago would like

204
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,279
He released like

205
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,559
Every single word in every

206
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,839
Piece of evidence

207
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,143
And I wish we didn't have that one other wish we had

208
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:44,031
We could the country could live without like the blue dress and all those

209
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:46,079
But I would like to know

210
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,103
About like

211
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,151
Don Jr like calling up

212
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:52,479
Some Russian on his cell phone to be like hi this is the son of the president

213
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:56,319
Can you collude with me

214
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:00,927
Your last quote is from an article in the Washington Post

215
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,719
Describing a downward

216
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,487
Trend

217
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,023
That people are experiencing

218
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,839
There are a lot more things to do now.

219
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:12,703
That was one of the reasons that people might be doing what a lot less

220
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,495
Sleeping

221
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,031
Nowell

222
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:19,615
Metaphorically Maybe

223
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,175
Can you repeat

224
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:25,759
Well I have a hint for you

225
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:28,831
Okay I would never hear I was trying to avoid this

226
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,927
Well like chicken tenders

227
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,719
Their nights are boneless

228
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,727
Yeah Michelle do you know it now

229
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:53,407
What is

230
00:09:54,687 --> 00:10:00,831
Yes I'm glad somebody around here up in class yes

231
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:04,159
Have sex is answered more Americans

232
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:06,719
Then ever before about 25 per

233
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,791
Percent reported not having any sex at all

234
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,583
During the last year 2018

235
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:12,863
Well if you don't count

236
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:13,631
Joe Biden

237
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,423
Sniffing their hair

238
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,447
And they don't

239
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,983
Because

240
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,263
There are more things

241
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,823
To do

242
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,591
There are

243
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,383
What's surprising about this is

244
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,407
That

245
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,711
Part of the reason is that people get older

246
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:31,551
And people get older their rate of sexual activity tents

247
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,319
The decline

248
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,855
Although they still have it which

249
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:34,879
Probably why the red

250
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:43,071
The jokes are getting a little harder for me to tell him to tell you about it

251
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:43,839
But

252
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:46,399
But what's different is that young people

253
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,679
Are also

254
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,471
Saying not this year deer

255
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:54,079
Given to believe that song

256
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,103
That when

257
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,639
The young folk with tax

258
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,431
Want to Netflix

259
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,223
Chinchilla

260
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,271
A metaphor for

261
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:07,903
Impeach

262
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:11,487
Actually Netflix and chill because that of course is the other

263
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,255
Explanation

264
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:16,095
Is that there are so many things to do including all this

265
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,375
Streaming entertainment

266
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,911
So you know it

267
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:19,679
He looks like

268
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:23,007
Yeah honey I'll come to bed as soon as I finished watching all of Nets

269
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:26,335
Many months later

270
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:31,199
Where did

271
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:33,759
How did Michelle do an AR quiz

272
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,295
If you got a ball right

273
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:40,671
Congratulations

274
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,935
Bring up panel time for you to answer some questions about this

275
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:53,727
Tom

276
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,007
Researchers at

277
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:58,335
Australia we're interested in making the roads safer for cyclists

278
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,127
As result of their study they have

279
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:00,895
Have suggested

280
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,175
That we ban

281
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,199
What

282
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:04,991
Spandex

283
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,831
I'm just tossing out ideas here

284
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,879
I need a hint

285
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,159
Well

286
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:12,927
This is true

287
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,975
They're suggesting instead

288
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:15,743
Rephrase

289
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:16,511

291
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:22,399
Stop calling us exactly right

292
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,679
Just like objectifying

293
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,727
You have figured it out

294
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:31,103
There you are that's exactly right you may think of cyclists is a neutral term like violinist

295
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:31,871
Best oral sex

296
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:35,455
But according to the authors

297
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:40,063
Bible study in the Journal of traffic psychology and behavior cyclist is a dehumanizing

298
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:41,855
Like caca

299
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:45,183
And it makes it easier for drivers

300
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,207
Is two sides

301
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,999
Swipe them feel aggressive even

302
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:53,375

To say a person

306
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:01,823

Person who Cycles

309
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,943
You have to say a person who drives through a

310
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:07,967
Bottle that beer

311
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:31,775

And about the size of a good number of other random everyday objects you don't think about very much

382
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:55,295
This receipt is ridiculous and unnecessary Diamond tweeted calling for the scrapping of

King said about the receipts

404
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:43,167
Their lack of recyclability really makes them problematic

405
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:46,495
Strong words from a mildly influential man

Is parking

417
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:11,839

And neither would

436
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:38,207
The ensuing brouhaha

437
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:38,975
Resulted in

438
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:40,511
Disorderly conduct arrest

439
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:44,351

City officials debated various solution

443
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,495
But finally settled on

444
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,055

Of age

453
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:07,647

00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:07,680
Townes Van Zandt that you actually like

567
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:13,568
Went where he was and tracked him down at the same time with guy with downtown Houston

568
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,640
He turns up at my gigs about four people there

569
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:18,432
Get out including towns

570
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,552
And the second set when I go down for my set you're the first at the most eventful thing was

571
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:26,112
The club Owners dog fell in love right in front

572
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:32,256
II said I finally come down and here's Town sitting in the front row

573
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,792
I drank a little

574
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:39,424
Pretty lit and he was sitting there and he did not make a sound while I was actually

575
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:42,240
Cut between every song Hit leave acne

576
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:46,080
Play the Wabash Cannonball

577
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,872
I don't like side play another song

578
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:51,456
Great I'm being heckled by my hero

579
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:53,760
I get a treasure longing to get to

580
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:58,624
Play the Wabash Cannonball finally had to admit I don't know the way

581
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:04,256
And he's in he's so you call yourself a folk singer and you don't know the Wabash Cannonball

582
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,536
Play the song called Miss

583
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:06,560
Mr. Mudd and mr. gold

584
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:07,584
What song has that has

585
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,120
About a million words

586
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:10,400
Anthony shut up

587
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:16,032
And he became a teacher

588
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,128
You've been through a lot

589
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:26,272
I mean I find out I mean like for example you played a recovering addict

590
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:27,296
In The Wire

591
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:29,600
I did and it apparently

592
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:34,720
It was it was not a stretch for you is it

593
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:38,560
The word for me too because I was offered acting roles when I was a lot younger and better-looking than

594
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:40,608
I am now and I hated it when I

595
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:43,168
Just made a record so I just always turned them down and

596
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:46,240
Then think about something I want to do with David's big music

597
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,264
Fan and heater

598
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:49,824
Call my manager because I've got this character

599
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,360
I think she could do it

600
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,128
What do you like to

601
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,688
Read what I read for it on me now just don't know

602
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:55,712
Meditating

603
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:56,480
In a studio

604
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,016
And you know it was

605
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:01,344
Play by play the redneck recovering addicts and like you said I didn't have to

606
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,976
I really accept New York and the most amazing

607
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,304
In New York are yoga and Broadway music

608
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:18,240
Georgia was just a

609
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,520
The thing that was sort of

610
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:23,104
Fish with a fly rod

611
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,896
And I get that travel places

612
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:27,456
Fun to do and I fell in a river for

613
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,224
For the first time

614
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:29,504
You know I was

615
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:31,808
Just getting back in the bug floating down to the neck

616
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,344
Ispot talking to a friend of mine

617
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:35,648
And I just said man my core strength is

618
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:36,672
Going

619
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:40,000
10 and he said well you're not been taking you got to go

620
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,792
Couple times a week ago

621
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:43,584
I spend money on dumb stuff

622
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,424
It started

623
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,216
Is that

624
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:51,264
Dealing with a physical issue

625
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,568
But I'm on the way I'm

626
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,848
Still here is 12

627
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:57,152
You know that's

628
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:03,040
It's a spiritual program and what do you think you're supposed to do is entrust

629
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:04,832
Is get to a place

630
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:08,160
Free pray or meditate everyday and that was the only thing that I didn't do

631
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:13,024
And I'm kind of an Old Hippie anyway and so I'm done about these things all my life

632
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:16,608
But through that Association I'm a yoga teacher in New York

633
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,376
Anna

634
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,936
Started studying with her

635
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:21,472
I'm on blocks and

636
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:26,336
You know why the cheating

637
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:28,128
You've you've been married

638
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,664
6 * 7 *

639
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,944
6 * 7 * 2

640
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,968
Six Wives right

641
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:33,760
So independent

642
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,040
I have to correct them

643
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,576
For the record seven divorces

644
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,624
Excuse me

645
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:42,720
Now

646
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:45,792
When people when people talk about people been married a lot

647
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:48,608
We often joke about you know hope over experience

648
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:51,936
Insignia they just think this time it's going to work out we talked about people's optimism

649
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:53,984
What I was thinking about in your case is

650
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,824
Is how do you if you meet a woman and the woman knows you've been married say let's

651
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,616
Pick middle 5 times before

652
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,920
How do you convince her like no

653
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:03,456
Really

654
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:06,528
We'll wait a minute. That like to hear it here is to hit the real question

655
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,064
You've been married

656
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,600
6 *

657
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,136
Have you made a woman

658
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:14,208

00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:16,000
What you know it says yeah that should give you

660
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:17,280
Pause and

661
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:23,680
I'm finally starting to get it

662
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,984
Yeah

663
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:27,520
Okay so

664
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:28,544
Let me ask question

665
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,824

I'm so

673
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,904
Whoever was married to me probably didn't like it all that much

674
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,208
Because I was gone but I have the time and I didn't really know what

675
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:47,744
Really being married was like the way the

676
