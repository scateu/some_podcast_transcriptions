Two times at a 311 R price

00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,128
You ready to go

68
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,432
Here is your first quote

69
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,480
Was extremely

70
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,248
Call

71
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,392
Hello somebody going to Great Lengths to him since he wasn't upset no he wasn't upset

72
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:10,720
When he stormed out of a meeting with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer

73
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:11,488
Who was it

74
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,024
That would be

75
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,328
Would be president

76
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:19,680
On Wednesday President Trump

77
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,728
Stomped into a meeting he had called

78
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,264
With Nancy Pelosi and Chuck show

79
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,312
Yelled at them for

80
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,336
Trying to impeach him

81
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,128
And stomped right out

82
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,968
Now we have never identified with Donald Trump more

83
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,992
Then this moment

84
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:36,320
Because we are also always trying to get out of meetings

85
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:40,416
Now the president then after he stomped out of the meeting

86
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:44,000
3 minutes after you walk in went out to the Rose Garden to make a spontaneous

87
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,024
Appearance before the Press

88
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,304
A spontaneous

89
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,584
Disappearance they had scheduled

90
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,376
Before the meeting began

91
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,656
And for what

92
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,192
Staff had printed up a big

93
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:55,264
Posters

94
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,800
Always has a spare selection

95
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,848
Just posters just in case the president

96
00:03:59,104 --> 00:03:59,872
Needs to rent

97
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:03,712
I know the same way you always carry plastic bags

98
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,480
Can you take your dog

99
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:11,136
It was true

100
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:15,488
Yeah I guess so

101
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:18,559
Is walking around the perimeter while till he's finished

102
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,911
Getting to the Garden every day

103
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:28,031
Mississippi map

104
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:28,799
CMS

105
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,871
She said something about

106
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:35,967
Pray for the president president president after the country

107
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:36,735
Smart away

108
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:43,135
What's weird is that President Trump

109
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,671
Presumably is angry and

110
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:45,951
People OC because Nancy

111
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,719
Pelosi wants

112
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:47,743
To impeach him

113
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,023
Or as he likes to put it

114
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,047
The I word

115
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:51,583
And

116
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:56,959
And what's crazy is he says that but Nancy Pelosi but Nancy Nancy Pelosi famously is very reddish

117
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,495
About moving toward in

118
00:04:59,007 --> 00:04:59,775
She says

119
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,335
That he the president wants us

120
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,383
To impeach him so therefore we shouldn't do it

121
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,663
He thinks

122
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:06,687
True

123
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:07,711
She thinks

124
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:08,735
What to do at the fire

125
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:11,039
What is base for the real reason is that he thinks

126
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,063
Is being impeached

127
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,855
Means you get to have sex

128
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:14,623
Sex with an intern

129
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,047
All right we're moving on

130
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,071
Here

131
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,607
Is your next quote

132
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,399
Lactose again

133
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,423
Tolerance

134
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:33,055
That's the rallying Cry of a protest movement growing in Britain calling for more people to throw what

135
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,847
At politicians they don't like

136
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,663
Close enough

137
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,687
Milkshake

138
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:45,599
The latest type of political

139
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,135
Protest is throwing milkshakes

140
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,927
Two politicians began with a protester

141
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,487
Was confronted on the street by the far-right politicians

142
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:54,303
Tommy Robinson and he had a milkshake and he spontaneously

143
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,583
You just took off the cap and threw it on

144
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,119
Ndk

145
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:00,703
Spread widely much like a milkshake down a politician suit

146
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:06,079
Right-wing brexit are Nigel farage has gotten so many milkshakes

147
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:06,847
Promoted him

148
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,895
Venom McDonald's near one of the

149
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,943
Speeches was asked by Scotland Yard

150
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:11,967
Not to sell them

151
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,063
So ecstatic milkshaking

152
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,111
We all got to see what it was like to be

153
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:18,879
Filet of fish

154
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,231
So can faraj say

155
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:23,999
He's shaking

156
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:29,887
Not so he doesn't have to whip

157
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,679
Was trapped in his campaign bus

158
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:38,591
Because people are outside all holding milkshakes

159
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:43,967
Imaginext

160
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,783
Just waking up

161
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,575
Wookie

162
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,647
It's so funny how different our culture

163
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,415
Shoes are like over there

164
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,439
Can insult again

165
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,463
With a milkshake

166
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,231
Vignette are present

167
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:55,999
Showers

168
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,095
What does seek

169
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,631
Secret Service have to dive

170
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:06,239
In front of him and takes the shape

171
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:09,055
Yo

172
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:13,663
McDonald's

173
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,711
Burger King this is truth advertising

174
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:22,111
Twitter hey we're selling milkshakes

175
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,135
King in the UK is Prince

176
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:29,535
Charles cuz that's the only time he ever gets to really wear crown

177
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,583
Set server closing you need to leave

178
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:34,399
You can keep the crown

179
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,727
But look how small my head is

180
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:38,495
Next to the mask

181
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:44,895
All right you're last quote is the title of an episode of Arthur that's of course of popular anime

182
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,455
Mr. Ratburn

183
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,479
Endless

184
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,247
Special someone

185
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:52,575
What episode was not broadcast in the state of Alabama because they

186
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,879
The special someone that mr. Ratburn married

187
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,159
Was what

188
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:04,607
Well yes another man

189
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:11,007
Another man are technically he married a male aardvark and I don't know why people are upset about two males marrying each other

190
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:16,639
Rather than a rat Marrying an aardvark of course the real reason

191

It is time for you to answer some questions about this week's news

219
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:52,127
Faith parenting is a full-time job through bonobo

220
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,919
We learned this week

221
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,711
Are heavily involved in finding their son

222
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:59,039
We know that bonobos are

223
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:02,623
Randy that's true right so I would

224
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,415
Think they're involved in find

225
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,463
Telling their son's mate that's exactly right

226
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,999
Supernovas are also

227
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:15,167
Vampire Knight

228
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:21,567
Yeah they came from bonobo with when they made partner

229
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:30,015
Bonobo moms aggressively help their sons findmate they check they chase away competition

230
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:32,319
Either their sons straight to potential partners and then

231
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,855
Explain to the feeble bonobos

232
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,415
How wonderful their son is once you get to know him

233
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:41,535
Classic Helicopter parents so who else is going to be at the party

234
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,071
And are they ovulating

235
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,143
And then this is true once

236
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,423
The kids actually hook up

237
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,703
With a fertile female

238
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,239
The mother will stand guard

239
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,007
Nothing in hands

240
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:55,871
It's a sexual performance like Mom

241
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:00,223
So this this behavior is actually

242
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,015
Sleep more proof that we have the

243
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,295

Turn it on

379
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,087
Cheap

380
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,111
You'll drift right off

381
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,415
But as soon as Nina started

382
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,695
Using it she started weight

383
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,719
Waking up in the middle of

384
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:33,535
The night screaming in a cold sweat along side

385
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,559
Her partner Nigel

386
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,327
Smite

387
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,351
Who's likewise

388
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,143
Speak watching her and hyperventilate

389
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,959
All this while their daughter merch

390
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:41,727
Curry bacon

391
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,775
Kept sleeping like

392
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,567
Like a baby

393
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,639
Her mom friends and their Partners were having the same

394
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,919
Problem night time

395
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:50,687
Terrors

396
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,967
No one knew why

397
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,247
One night

398
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,015
After baby

399
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,551
Mercury was extra fussy

400
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,343
Cartullo herself Act

401
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,111
Sleep Inn

402
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,135
Turn the Sleep sheep

403
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,415
Up to 11

404
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,207
As she sat listen

405
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:02,975
To the switch

406
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:03,999
Uterus

407
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:04,767
The sounds

408
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,071
She heard a deep male voice

409
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,095
Or did she

410
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,119
If she listens

411
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,399
Super duper closely chic

412
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,935
I can barely make out the sheets

413
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:12,959
Singing in a Barrett

414
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:14,751
The tune was like a

415
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,519
Soothing Nursery

416
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:19,103
Nursery rhyme with horrifying lyrics about devouring a baby

417
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,663
It was sung in this really cool

418
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,431
Creepy voicemail

419
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,735
When he got to the part about the baby

420
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,015
Beto's in earlobes

421
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,551
Sing like Welsh rabbit

422
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,087
That's when I gasp

423
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:31,135
Did Nigel sat bolt upright

424
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:35,743
An investigation revealed that while a worker on The Late Shift

425
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,023
Was making the white noise

426
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,559
Recordings the microphone

427
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:39,583
Him up while he was

428
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,351
Was rehearsing in a

429
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,375
Acoustic love song

430
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,399
Who's girlfriend

431
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:45,727
Relieved to learn this but still shaking

432
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,751
Nina says

433
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:47,519
I guess

434
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,543
He means well but he

435
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,335
Really needs to work on his metaphor

436
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:57,759
Jeep turns out to be a wolf

437
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:58,783
Infliction

438
00:17:59,039 --> 00:17:59,807
Clothing because of

439
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:04,159
Hidden recording of an original song your last story of sleeplessness comes from Alonzo

00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:04,927
Boden

441
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:07,487
Shannon Arthur Murray thought they found

442
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,511
Perfect retirement

443
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,559
In the town of ravello off the code

444
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,327
Coast of Italy

445
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,351
And they had

446
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:13,887
Until the 3rd night

447
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,679
It started at midnight

448
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,215
Crying weep

449
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,239
Screaming

In Italian

451
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,287
As if somebody was being

452
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,055
Torture

453
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,335
Whimpers grunts

454
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,615
Leaving deep bumps

455
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,663
Like bodies were being dropped on the ground

456
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,223
What was it did they live below a serial killer

457
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:29,503
Couldn't be

458
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,039
At that rate the time would be

459
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,319
Depopulated in a month

460
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,903
After whole Sleepless month is staring at

461
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,439

462
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,207

463
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:38,975
And found someone

464
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,999

466
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:41,791
Point

467
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,839
The crazy person living above us

468
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:44,607
I think you need

469
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:45,631

Oh no that's not a crazy person

471
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,447
That's just

472
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,471
Vlad Guerrero

473
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:50,495

Hunting kittens cuddling

483
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,599
Everything but

484
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:07,391
In sleeping because then you could

485
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,159
And see that wonderful

486
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:08,927
How big I

487
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,231
Signore Carrero

00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:11,999

Legion anger

498
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,031
So that the only thing he had left the

499
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,055
To put on the canvas

500
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:25,823
Was inner peace

501
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,871

Thank you so much bye bye

527

And now the game where we reward a lifetime of achievement by offering a few minutes of a pale imitation of it

528
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,695
But we call it not my job

529
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:50,559
In the Far Far Future of Star Trek humans have created a paradise of equal opportunity

530
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,839
Been weirdly

531
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:55,423
It still took them 30 years to find a woman to Captain a Starship

532
00:20:55,935 --> 00:21:02,079
That was Kathryn Janeway played by Kate Mulgrew she also started as red in Orange is the New Black

533
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,103
How much is a new memoir

534
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,151
She joins us now

535
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,943
Welcome to wait wait don't tell me

536
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:13,599
Thank you it's very rare for

537
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,928
For an actor to play one iconic character on television you've done

538
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:17,696
2

539
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:20,512
What do you get recognized most for when you're walking them

540
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,048
Captain Janeway

541
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:22,816
Yeah I bet

542
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,864
I bet that's very closely by

543
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,448
Red and sometimes I get the double whammy which is an absolute next with

544
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,776
Captain Janeway Janeway red

545
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:38,176
And I'm freaking out a very interesting Venn diagram intersection but I'm sure they find you

546
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:41,760
I myself in the Star Trek nerd so I'm going to start by asking you about that was

547
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,552
When you were offered

548
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,832
That roll

549
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,368
Oh Captain Janeway in Star Trek

550
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,136
Trek Voyager

551
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:49,184
Did you know what you were in for

552
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:49,952
Did you know

553
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,232
I had no clue

554
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:57,632
Really had no idea that it was going to be as life-changing as it was

555
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:59,168
Normal life is

556
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,192
Typically ambitious

557
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,544
Forward-leaning young actress in Hollywood raising my Tucson

558
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:07,616
Intently I'm starting technobabble which is

559
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,920
Absolutely like learning Greek

560
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:10,688
Overnight

561
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:14,272
Sure working 18 hours a day in four and a half inch heel

562
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:17,856
Wait a minute I can't remember seeing your feet they made you wear

563
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:21,184
Are heels on the bridge of the Starship

564
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:22,720
Really

565
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:28,096
And if I had not had those heels I would have looks like a little cartoon character

566
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:30,400
They could have made you decided you were just a particularly

567
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:36,800
A short kind of alien

568
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:40,384
Did you how have you found I'm sure it continues to this day your interaction with the

569
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,176
I think the fans

570
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,968
Star Trek fans have the best fans

571
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:50,368
In the world but you never had a moment but it was represented by that classics

572
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:52,672
Night Live sketch with a Bill Shatner get a life

573
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,440
If you've never

574
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:57,792
And it's been cornered by these people arguing with you about the way

575
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:59,584
My hand stopped off and save it

576
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,144
I made it so rude and I said that to Bill

577
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:04,192
Really

578
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:07,520
What did he say that these people have given you your career

579
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:11,104
It's no big secret

580
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,640
And it works both ways

581
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:18,528
You lectured William Shatner about Hinata

582
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,368
So then a while ago you

583
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:24,160
Recast as read

584
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:24,928
Who is the

585
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,976
The chef in the kitchen in a powerful

586
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,512
What's the cook in the beginning

587
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:30,560
Did she change

588
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:31,584
What did you

589
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,888
I mean I imagine there's not a lot of research

590
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:34,656
You can do

591
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:36,192
To be a Starship captain

592
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:38,496
But did you actually have to do like the

593
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,288
The classic like actor research

594
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:43,872
Words to play that one

595
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:44,896
They gave me a very

596
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:45,920
It's small

597
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:49,504
A piece of paper on which was written this is Galina red reznikov

598
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,552
He's been in prison for some time

599
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:52,832
She's a blessing

600
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:54,880
We only want you to tap

601
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:57,440
Cockroaches looking for this place

602
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:58,720
Flavor

603
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,256
Right of of of Russia

604
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:02,560
But that is what came out of my mouth

605
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:06,912
I want to talk about your new book how to forget

606
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:09,728
Which is quite a remarkable book I've been reading it all week

607
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:12,800
First of all you really

608
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:14,336
All right I'm going to tell you the truth

609
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:23,808
Finally I can make the sign of the cross is not going to make much difference

610
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:29,696
Seriously the truth of the matter is is that a lot of the people we write we have in the show him written book

611
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:31,232
Make an attempt

612
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,000
To read their book

613
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:35,584
In your case I actually got quite involved in it

614
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,424
It's beautifully written and the story is I'm not going to say

615
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,192
Entertain

616
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,984
Beaming as much as as

617
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,008
Deeply involving

618
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,848
The book is about the death of your parents

619
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,128
Correct

620
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:50,176
I am told that your book how to forget

621
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,712

Your family about your father your mother

627

I know your parents are no longer with us because

628
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,496
As I said I read the book but

629
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:20,640
In the book have they still been living

630
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,664
Obvious

631
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,968
Do they live long enough

632
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:25,504
How to understand and appreciate

633
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,272
Successful

634
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:27,040
You became

635
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,320
He never saw me

636
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,088
Never

637
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,648
He never watched

638
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:34,464
Play on television

639
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,768
She's pretty much a guy

640
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:38,048
That just confused

641
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:38,816
Right

642
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:42,912
He seemed to be absolutely perplexed by the what the hell are you doing up

643
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:43,680
Where are you

644
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:50,592
I just go get the vodka

645
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:52,640
Forget about it

646
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:55,712
I'm just going to ask you one but one more thing the

647
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:59,808
The your first book you're more autobiographical memory is called born with teeth

IWatch

650
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:05,440
What does it mean if a baby is born with a full set of

651
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,720
That she's awake

652
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,024

00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,976
Meet the rest of this

664
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:39,744

00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:49,216
In your TV show

669
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:54,336
The voice of their choice on their voicemail

670
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:56,640
Bill who is Kate Mulgrew playing for

671
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:57,920
Sebastian

672
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,712
Fall River Massachusetts

673
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:04,832
Alright ready to do that I think you're ready to do this I got that

674
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:05,856
The nomadic

675
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:08,416
Tuareg people of the Sahara don't have a word for the

676
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,184
The Color Purple

677
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,208
Which has

678
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:12,000
Resulted in some interesting quirks

679
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,792
Such as which of these a

680
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:17,120
When Tuareg filmmakers did a remake of Prince's Purple Rain

681
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:20,960
They had to call it rain the color of blue with a little red in it

682
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:27,104
B instead of saying a turn purple with rage they say chewing on ones own toes

683
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:33,248
Or see they refer to purple jelly beans as the ones that are at least better than the black one

684
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,576
Definitely be

685
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:37,856
Definitely be

686
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,136
It was actually a

687
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,416
I know it was

688
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:46,048
You know what yeah

689
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:52,448
This was actually true is reported on NPR these Twilight filmmakers made their own remake of purple

690
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,288
The color blue with a little red in it and apparently it's not bad

691
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,568
Alright your next question

692
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:58,592
Pantone

693
00:27:58,848 --> 00:27:59,616
448

694
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:02,176
Is the technical name for a brownish

695
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:02,944
Color

696
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,712
That has what

697
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:08,320
Distinction a dog's adore it which is why all dog food is that color

698
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:11,904
Be it is the color of everything Once you turn the lights off

699
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:14,720
Or see it is the very worst

700
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,000
Color in the world

701
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:19,840
You're right

702
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:21,120
That's what happened

703
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:26,752
What happened was an Australian marketing company did a survey they found out that this

704
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:27,776
Shade of brown

705
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:30,080
When is the least appealing color in the world

706
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:32,128
Unless they've been used it for cigarette

707
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:39,040
Okay last question you may think you know all the colors but you don't

708
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:40,832
Which of these is a real

709
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:41,600
Color

710
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:43,136
A fall of us

711
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:44,928
B Gamboa

712
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:47,488
Orsi's smaragdine

713
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:52,352
I'll bet it today but I'm going to go with B

714
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,376
Veganburg

715
00:28:53,888 --> 00:29:00,032
Yeah you're right but they're all real colors

716
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:06,432
Call Miss can be described as a brownish-yellow gamboge is a transparent mustard in

717
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:08,224
Smaragdine is a kind of green

718
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:15,136
What do you mean how can it be mustard if it's transparent well

719
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,416
Color but it's like a lighter

720
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:18,208
Do we have

721
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:19,488
The colors are refinished

722
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:26,144
Why finish where only finished when built

723
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,680
Give the score so Bill

724
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:32,544
How did Kate Moseley doing a quiz well-proven Cambogia is the New Black

00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:05,792
It's just a nefarious way to track employees and increase

Wheels of

00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:08,992
Cheese

899
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:10,272
Cheese

900
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:15,136
If you like how cheese is made out of bacteria mold and hard old milk

901
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:18,208
The wish it had one more gross twist

902
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:24,352
A cheese maker in London is making cheese with bacteria starters made from swab celebrity

903
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,376
Skin

904
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:30,240

Sea salt

906
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:38,176
Just think of how much closer you'll feel to your favorite celebs as soon as you eat their bellybutton remnants on a cracker

To be kissing me

924
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:16,832

926
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:25,536
After a startup offer to donate money to charity for every cow kiss

927
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,864
The challenge has proved so popular that Health officials released

928
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,144
Statement of begging people

929
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:30,912

Kissing cows

931
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:38,336
