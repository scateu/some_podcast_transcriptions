Ansible for yourself

111
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:58,592
Because I did the same thing that you're doing now for 10 years

112
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:04,224
Who's the guy warning Republican members of Congress don't be like me

113
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:10,880
Well I'd probably have to go with Michael Cohen on this would have to go with Michael Cohen

114
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:14,464
Don't go too far with him he's heading

115
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,488
Go to jail

116
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,768
The

117
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:19,583
Completely discredited liar absolutely should not be

118
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,399
He trusted spent a whole day in Capitol Hill saying a bunch of things

119
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,935
We all completely believe

120
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:29,311
President Trump's former lawyer told the country about how the president was quoted a racist

121
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,591
A con man and the

122
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,359
The cheat

123
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,175
Which Michael Cohen just wouldn't stand for which is why he

124
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:34,943
He quit after.

125
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:35,967
10 years

126
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:40,063
Is going to jail in the first 10 years is tradition

127
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,343
The iron bar in

128
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:45,439
Now the Republicans just went

129
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:51,839
After him they yelled at him and called him a liar and a fraud the even and this I tell you America is

130
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:52,607
True

131
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,887
They held up a big

132
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:54,911
Big poster with his

133
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,679
Face

134
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,703
And the words

135
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,239
Liar Liar

136
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:00,287
Pants on fire

137
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,567
They did that

138
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:05,919
And as embarrassing as that was it was better than the earlier draft

139
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:10,271
Whoever smelt it dealt it

140
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,575
Also he would hold up that sign

141
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,855
And it said I'm rubber you're

142
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:20,255
Yeah

143
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,047
Crunch numbers

144
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:25,631
And there is a water bottle in front of Michael

145
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,399
Cohen

146
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,191

Free advertising

152
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:41,503
Anybody's going to go out there so I'm going to buy some Dasani the favorite brand of Michael Cohen

153
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,367
I really like this could be monetized

154
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:52,767
There could be some labels on our body

155
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:55,327
I never even noticed a water bottle nor did I noticed

156
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,095
The label and

157
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:56,863
Yaki

158
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:57,887
Did look hydrate

159
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:07,103
So if I knew what water company it was I might as well gravitate

160
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:10,175
I love learning that that Trump said that the

161
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,991
The person with the worst judgement in the world

162
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:17,087
3 with something

163
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,111
Finding out

164
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:21,439
In that way what your parents

165
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,743
Said about you

166
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:28,863
Alright Elizabeth your next quote how happy it's the president of the United States

167
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,655
When we walked away

168
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,191
It was a very

169
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:37,823
Mr. Trump surprised Everybody by walking away in a friendly fashion

170
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,359
Course from a deal

171
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,639
With whom

172
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:47,551
I guess that would have to be Kim Jong-un the dictator of North Korea

173
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:51,647
So when the president for his second Summit

174
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,183
With Kim Jeong Hoon

175
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,207
Because he was so eager to

176
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,231
To claim credit for

177
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,535
Who knew what he would do

178
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,815
North Korea Mike

179
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,863
Get there sanctions lifted they might

180
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,935
Continue with a nuclear program and also be given article

181
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:09,567
Amazing thing happened the president just walked away

182
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:15,455
He walked away no deal it's amazing for a couple of reasons first because he walked instead of using a golf cart

183
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:19,295
It must have been painful with his bones

184
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,975
After his first meeting

185
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,511
With Kim and it's kind of sad

186
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,047
On a human level because after his

187
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:30,815
First meeting

188
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:31,583
With Kim last

189
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,887
Do the president said they were quote in love

190
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,167
True

191
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,215
But Kim had to know the

192
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,007

198
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,943

So you'll go away

200

Level artist

202
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,415
And guess we did a good job

203
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,463
That was Lady Gaga

204
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,487
Talking about the

205
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,023
As she says artist

206
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,047
Officially intimate Loma

207
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,583
But she had with Bradley Cooper

208
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:04,607
Where

209
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:11,007
It must be the Oscars

210
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:14,335
Oscar ceremony are usually forgotten as quickly as

211
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:16,383
This year's best picture will be but

212
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:22,271
People will remember forever where they were when they said oh my God their lips

213
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:26,111
Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga did their big song

214
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:26,879
Shallow fry

215
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:27,647
From A Star is Born

216
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,927
Live on stage

217
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:33,023
It was so steamy everybody was wondering not so much will they won't they

218
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,047
But did they just

219
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:36,607
Do it live on TV

220
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,655
Yeah she had

221
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,423
A mark

222
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,447
From The Pianist

223
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,215
Strings on her face

224
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:50,175
I think that happened during the commercial

225
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,479
We wanted

226
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,503
Was for them to

227
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,271

Trite

231
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:01,183
Oscar's is a night of drama that's

232
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,975
I want to see

233
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:03,743
Screen

234
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,535
Do you think

235
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,303
Don't you think

236
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:09,119
I don't know I mean these people are

237
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:09,887
Actors

238
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,167
They're paid lots of money to

239
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,191
Pretend to feel things

240
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,471
That they do not

241
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,751
Don't people know that

242
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,799
I mean another news Tom Cruise has not asked

243
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:17,823
Actually killed people

244
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,383
Well except for those guys who tried to leave

245
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:24,735
But they knew what they signed up for

246
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,807
To say like if I was watch

247
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:28,575
Touching my

248
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,343
Wife

249
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,623
Read up on

250
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,903
On stage with Bradley Cooper

251
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,951
Like that

252
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:34,975
I would think

253
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:35,743
I am

254
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:36,767
So screwed

255
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,607
But I was amazed that

256
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,887
After she won her Oscar

257
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:42,655
Gear for best average

258
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,935
Gentle song Lady Gaga

259
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,471
Backstage and she

260
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,751
She said something to the effect of

261
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,543
This was for this

262
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,311
Boyfriend

263
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,871
We told her that she never ever be famous

264
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,431
And here we go see my music everywhere

265
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,199
I'm famous

266
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,223
And so there

267
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:59,807
And all I can think of is like what kind of relationship did she have

268
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,087
What kind of boyfriend is that

269
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:04,415
Hey honey do you want to order in tonight and by the way you'll never be fat

270
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,047
Heated fight

271
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,119
Like she said

272
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,911
You know when you pee outside the toilet

273
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:21,311
Clean it up and he said you'll never be friends

274
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:27,711
A weak moment we do those things

275
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:31,551
Lady Gaga has been famous since she's been about

276
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,319
20

277
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:39,487

To do not disturb or recessive

304
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:28,799
Yeah the only difference between this and the nursing home is how quickly they find your body

305
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,943

Unpredictable

332
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:44,831
But what if we actually have more control than we think we do

333
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:47,647
A lot of it has to do with taking time

382
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:44,127
Being the last Ryder over the

383
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,151
The finish line

384
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:46,943
Horse ironic

385
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,479
Name the last word

386
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,527
Alexander Graham Bell

387
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,831
Was on the verge of never riding left

388
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,599
Word again

389
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,879
When he stopped by to visit

390
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:55,903
Is it the horse what

391
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:56,671
Eating a pickle

392
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,975
Discovered that the horse had next

393
00:15:59,231 --> 00:15:59,743
Scream reaction

394
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,839
He mounted the horse

395
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,119
Took him out to the track

396
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,143
And show them the

397
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,959
Last word took off like

398
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:09,727
Rocket

399
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,775
We've been winning ever since

400
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,055
Said four valves

401
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,615
We get on that inside rail

402
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:17,663
Squeeze the reins in my right hand

403
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,199
Kind of pickle in my left

404
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:23,039
Then I reach my pickle hand in front of his muzzle and it's

405
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,319
Equine Magic

406
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:28,671
To date no other horse has reacted

407
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,463
Do pickles away last word does

408
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,743
Undaunted

409
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:32,767
In training session

410
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,047
Desperate jockey

411
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:36,095
He's way better Vegetable that can sync up

412
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,911
His face looking for a birthstone

413
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:39,679
Speed

414
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,215
Eggplants tubers

415
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,239
Brussel sprouts

416
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:43,775
So far nothing

417
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,823
Some horses actually back up when they say

418
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:46,591
Jesse Cale

419
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:52,735
The secret to a horse's speed is a pickle that's

420
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:53,759
Impala your

421
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:54,527
Next bit of pickle

422
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:55,295
GoPros come from

423
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,319
It's a lie

424
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,855
Estelle Schmidt

425
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,391
Of hegel's dorf buxom

426
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,415
Always

427
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,439
Bird flying

428
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,207
Nothing

429
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:02,975
Could get her on a plane

430
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,279
Except her love for her great-grand

431
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,047
And father

432
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,071
Muller

433
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,887
When Marcel died all of hagel's door

434
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,191
Because for as long as anyone

435
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:12,959
Could remember

436
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:14,495
He had provided the village

437
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,567
Honest Deathbed

438
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,335
He summoned

439
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,103
24 year old

440
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,639
Michelle and ask her to fly

441
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,407
I took Gibraltar

442
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,687
Scatter his ashes

443
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,479
Then he bequeathed

444
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,247
Per his MO

445
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,807
According to Legend

446
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:30,367
Can this pickle marinades in a brine made with

447
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,135
Water

448
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,927
In which Jesus washed his feet

449
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,743
Since Marcel's death

450
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,279
Estelle has carried this

451
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,047
Pickle contest

452
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,351
She Strokes it by day

453
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:43,423
And returns it to its cloudy water by night

454
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,447
Turi brine

455
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:46,751
She knew

456
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:49,567
The only way she could fly to Gibraltar

457
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:51,615
Was if she were clutching Marcel's pic

458
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:52,895
Burlap

459
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:59,551
But passengers on the small plane rioted over its noxious smell so the Lux Air flight attendant wrenched

460
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:03,391
The green stink bomb from a stealth hands and put it in the aircraft mini fridge

461
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:09,279
Even after being reunited with a pickle upon Landing Estelle sue the airline for mental anguish

462
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,583
This week the European Court of

463
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,351
Justice hurt

464
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,119
The case

465
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,399
After witnessing a selfie

466
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,935
Attachment to what one just

467
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,471
Just called the holy Cube

468
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:23,615

00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,383
Support pickle

470
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:27,199
Estelle funneled her grateful tears in

471
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,223
Into the jar of juice.

472
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:30,783
Declaring I owner of this condition

473
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,551
With the salt of my

474
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:37,951
An emotional support

475
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,719
Pickle

476
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:41,279
Your last day of someone hurting for a gherkin

477
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,607
Comes from Tom bodett

478
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,911
When a purse Australia man

479
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,703
Went through great fall of his own manager

480
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:52,799
It's the glue is on but to a 6ft wooden bar counter Last Friday Night

481
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,591
He did what any of us

482
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:55,359
Baidu

483
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,127
He sat there

484
00:18:56,639 --> 00:19:02,015
Then he posted his predicament on Reddit which has saved so many lives

485
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:08,415
So I'm kind of sitting here with a slab jar attached to my butt cheeks watching Battlestar

486
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,463
Galactica and waiting for the emerge

487

Play services

488
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:12,511
To return my call

489
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:17,119
After realizing the only chemicals xi'an capable of divorcing his

490
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:19,935
Speaks from his board were tucked away in the garage

491
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,471
Stupid or he couldn't fit through

492
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,263
He turned back to his Reddit

493
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:25,567
Feed to find 300 comments

494
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,871
One more useless than the next

495
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,663
Until one jumped out at him

496
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,711
OMG what a pickle

497
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,503

498
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,527
Sticky but man

499
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:37,599
He read somewhere on the Google that the vinegar in pickle

500
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:41,951
Will do so I'll break down and epoxybond and he had a jar of gherkins within his reach

501
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:48,351
One episode of Battlestar Galactica later the first pickle but posted that he was free

502
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:53,215
Saturday morning the man reported feeling a little tenderness but not much pain

00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:56,287
If anything my butt feels thoroughly exfoliator

504
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:03,711

To a countertop

And now the game or an important person does something completely trivial

544
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:35,360
It's called not mine

545
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:38,688
So have you ever said to a friend you can't handle the truth

546
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,736

Cool you know what's cool a billion dollars

548
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,600
Well if you have first of all start thinking of your own things

549
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,696
But secondly you were quoting Aaron Sorkin

550
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:50,464

00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,296
Was exfoliated his butt with a pickle

561
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,488
At my first question is I know

562
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,512
So many people

563
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:25,792
Who are

564
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,840
Especially fans of The West Wing

Roden crater

566
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:36,288
Who are so disappointed in real life

567
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,336
Because the people in real life

568
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:40,128
Especially in politics are nowhere

569
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:41,152
Nearly as smart

570
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:44,224
Interesting and mostly articulate as they are on your

571
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,320
Shows so my first question is are you just as disappointed as they are

572
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:51,136
Sure

573
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:53,696
I go a step further I mean I'd say that most

574
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:57,536
5th graders are smarter than

575
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:01,632
You did one of the things that I was amazed that given your

576
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:02,400
Your talent

577
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,424
Productivity

578
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:04,704
The awards you won

579
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,520
Is I always assumed that you grew up wanting to be a writer

580
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,544
Because you're sober

581
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,336
Frankly good at it but that's not the case

582
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,200
When I was in high school I thought I was going to be an actor

583
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:22,368
Cool plays in community theater and then I went to college and studied acting and it wasn't until

584
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,208
Play the day after I graduated from college that I

585
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,512
For the first time wrote for pleasure

586
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:29,792
Android dialog

587
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:34,912
And I felt a confidence that I've never felt with acting and I was a pretty cocky actor

588
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:35,936
Really

589
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:37,216
What did you write

590
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:37,984
That day

591
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,776
I started writing A Few Good Men

592
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,568
Wow yeah

593
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:43,104
At my older sister

594
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:43,872
Debbie

595
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:46,176
I had just graduated from Law School

596
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:50,528
And she went into the Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps jag corps and she

597
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:56,928
Told me a story about this trip she was about to take the Guantanamo Bay and it became the inspiration for

598
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:57,696
A Few Good Men

599
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,768
I moved to New York after college and I got a job

600
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:03,072
Bartending in Broadway theaters

601
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,864
And I wrote

602
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,448
A Few Good Men on cocktail napkins during the first active look house or false

603
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:14,848
I love that was a bartender in theaters if you work during the walking and you working during intermission but your

604
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,640
You're not doing anything during the First Act

605
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:19,968
And there was an unlimited supply of cocktail Mac

606
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:24,064
I just envisioning like this cocktail napkin and on it is

607
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,624
You can't handle when you turn it over the truth

608
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:31,488
So of course known for your

609
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:33,024
For your dialogue does it

610
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,816
Just come into your brain

611
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:37,632
You quickly write it down like you hear the back

612
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:40,448
Enforced or is it something that you actually have to

613
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:44,032
Conjure on a good day I do but I don't have many

614
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,056
Good day

615
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,920
Pacing around and trying to get into an argument with myself

616
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:54,272
And if I can get a good one going then it starts going down on paper

617
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,296
Make out loud

618
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,576
You do this

619
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,880
Why was doing The West Wing

620
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:01,440
A messenger came to my office

621
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:06,048
The package from the president of NBC with a headset

622
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,864
That you're supposed to pair to your car phone

623
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,984
And there was a note from the president of NBC saying I was next to you at a red light today

624
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:18,336
Please wear this anytime you're driving your car you look like a madman

625
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:23,200
Because you were just like shouting

626
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:29,088
An imaginary people in your car shouting at CJ and Bartlett and Sam everybody's

627
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:35,232
Fighting in my car

628
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:38,816
It looks like I'm being mean to somebody

629
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:41,120
Hey Aaron one of the questions on

630
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,912
Wait wait don't tell me was about you

631
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:43,680
You want time

632
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:45,216
There was a story

633
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:47,520
Where you were working on dialogue I guess it you

634
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:48,288
Your house

635
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,104
Accidentally hit your

636
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:57,504
Head on my God my nose riding

637
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:03,904
Holding a is writing an early episode of The Newsroom and I got up in the middle of the night cuz

638
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,208
Play I had an idea just just for a

639
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,488
Sort of a classic

640
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:13,888
Comic beat where Jeff Daniels was going to lunch at one of the staffers and two staffers were going to hold them back in one of these

641
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:16,704
And

642
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,776
I was really excited about it was going well

643
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:23,360
And I happen to be kind of acting into the mirror

644
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:27,712
And I lunch. Jeff Daniels would but there was no one there to hold me back

645
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:34,112
So I can smash right into the bathroom

646
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:36,672
Go to the emergency room and if so what did you tell them

647
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:43,328
I called that friend that you have that you can call it midnight when you broken your nose

648
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,240
And she came over and she took one look at me and said you would have to go to the emergency room

649
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:56,896
And I said okay but I think it's pretty good well

650
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:59,200

651
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:02,272

The first to A & B are certainly the funniest but the answers got to be sick

683
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:08,320
I'm somewhat disappointed

684
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:10,368

00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:17,024
