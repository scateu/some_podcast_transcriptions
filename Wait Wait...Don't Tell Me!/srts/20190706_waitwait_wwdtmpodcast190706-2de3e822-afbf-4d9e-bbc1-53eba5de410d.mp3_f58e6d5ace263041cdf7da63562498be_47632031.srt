Times of the 1920s

12
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:45,056
So you're putting presents under the independent

Probably

20
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:54,784
Because it made them

21
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,320
Mistake of thinking we're normal

22
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:01,184

Protocol

27
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:09,632
I should say

28
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:12,192
We've never spoken to the head of a

29
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,728

00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:41,120
First things were kind of curious about is what you do and now we assume that you have people killed is that

41
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:53,408
Seriously

42
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,432
I know this

43
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,456
A complicated question

44
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:58,272
But none the less cuz I understand that you spend all day

45
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:01,600
Having people call you up and asking you to lend the money

46
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:06,976
What is conscious

47
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:09,536
Improved over time

48
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,328
At the moment

49
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:13,376
It's full of sable

50
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,424

And capital flows coming out of the big Emoji market economies around the world that's all running into troubles

54
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:29,504

56
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:34,368
Is Paula Poundstone here

57
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,416

Which country or developing country

59
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:44,096
If you are developing country will lend you

60
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,376
Money at 0

61
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,168
Interest rates

62
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,216
Because committed your

63
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:54,848
Chicken feed slow and it would be totally abusive and unfair to land at

64
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:55,872
Expensive

65
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:58,176
What's the diff definition

66
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:00,736

If you are below.

71
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,976

72
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,024

In addition to the Aveeno the extraordinary

Important education

76
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,080
And various posts

77
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:29,664
We discovered that you at one point where a competitive synchronized

78
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,432
Swimmer

79
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,528
How do you feel about men in

80
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,624
Speedo

81
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:45,024
But I'm more interested in actually the issue of Shaving

82
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:52,704
At least a little bit of hairs on your legs

83
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,728
Because that is a

84
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,520
Actually

85
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:58,336
How high and how good you are

86
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:02,176
In the water never heard anything like this here saying

87
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:06,784
That synchronized swimmers need to have a little bit of hair on their legs that can't be completely smooth why is

88
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,600
Is there anyway it's because when you're thinking too much

89
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,392
Did you shave your legs completely

90
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:15,744
Where You Are

91
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,143
What you're telling me is like when you see synchronized swimming as as you once were

92
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:25,727
And is water in the pool and their legs are straight up in the air

93
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:31,359
They can only tell that their legs are straight up in the air or wherever they're supposed to be because of the sensory

94
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,407
Feeling from the hairs on their legs

95
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,687
Exactly right

96
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:41,087
I didn't play this is wonderful because I

97
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:47,487
I did not know that I would have anything I could talk to you about

98
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:51,583
Ask if your career where you a competitive synchronized swimmer did you actually go to competition

99
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:09,759
Do you use anything that you learned there and decided who to loan money to

100
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,319
If there's somebody who comes from a country that

101
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,111
Are we not going to be good for the money

102
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:18,463
Do the little hairs in your legs

103
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,487

Are you ready to play

124
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:07,871
Your first question the funeral of the Guardia was an immensely

125
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,151
Popular figure in his

126
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:12,223
His day he received what tribute from president

127
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:12,991
Franklin

128
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:16,319
Roosevelt said he is just 5 feet tall

129
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,855
But it's all Vim

130
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,927
Be upon meeting Winston Churchill

131
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:23,231
Roosevelt said quote in English

132
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:28,863
Orsi Roosevelt said quote the only thing we have to fear is fiorello LaGuardia

133
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:38,079
I'd say beat your right that's what I'm saying is the highest praise I don't have

134
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:41,407
Next question LaGuardia went on a camp

135
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,943
Pain in New York City against

136
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,967
Crime in Vice

137
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,807
He once declared that the sale and possession of

138
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:48,575

139
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:52,159
Would be illegal in his town was it a violin cases

I just want you to know now you know how I felt stuck

145
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:10,591

Artichokes

148
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,063
Controlling the artichoke mark

149
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:23,135
Kentucky banned their sale in till prices

150
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:26,719
What does this is exciting if you get one to get this last question correct

151
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:27,743
What a prize

152
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,279

Memphis beat

173
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:32,511
What happened was I said he went on a campaign against Vice

174
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,791
In the city the strippers were

175
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,327
We were told they had to put on underwear.

176
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,095
Perform

177
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,375
But they wanted to expose

178
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,167
As much of themselves as possible

179
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,191
So they invented

180
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,727
Thong underwear

181
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:48,383
Wow isn't that amazing

182
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:54,783

00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,799
Explanation to come from Edinburgh

386
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,079
With so much

387
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:51,711
Intentional obscenity on the internet it seems that unintentional obscenity is also becoming a problem

388
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:52,991
Take the case of

389
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:55,295
Sports writer Natalie weiner

390
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:58,623
Who tried to log on to a website only to have the site

391
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,903
It security protocols

392
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,183
Reject her name as a

393
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,207
Offensive language

394
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:07,327
It's part of what web developers refer to as the scunthorpe problem

395
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,351
So-called

396
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:12,703
Because when certain a eyes and internet monitoring algorithms are confront

397
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,471
Did by name

398
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:16,799
Like that of the English industrial town scumthorpe

399
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:19,359
They often flagged as objectionable

400
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,127
As it

401
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:23,199
Contained within a particular four letter word

402
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,479
That many find defense

403
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,271
Quick hands

404
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,807
The word isn't

405
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:28,575
Thor

406
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,927
As researcher Michael Veal puts it somewhere

407
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,743
What is a common abbreviation of the name Richard

408
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,535
Are harmless in certain context

409
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,559
But in other case

410
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:40,351
His parents might not want the muse

411
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,655
Imma Be flagged by certain types of program

412
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:43,935
It seems apt

413
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:48,799
So many years of being played by dirty minded 11 year old boys the internet

414
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,335
Has turned into one

415
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:57,247
Who can't or won't distinguish whether charity buckets is a woman's name

416
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:01,087
Or just a very particular request on GoFundMe

417
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,791
Cooter's Luray

418
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,839
Teach computers when the naughty word

419
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,631
It's not really a naughty word

420
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:17,215
And your last description of the scunthorpe problem comes from Navy

421
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:23,103
The scunthorpe problem if you're not familiar is a term in biology for the tendency of human beings to

422
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:23,871
To react

423
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,663
To the discovery of a new species

424
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,199
Please by immediately trying to

425
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:27,967
Qechs

426
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,503
It gets its name

427
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,271
Information

428
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:33,599
56 incident when a scientist names dr. Thomas Contour

429
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:37,183
Proudly presented the discovery of the Platypus out of conference

430
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,719
Described

431
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,511
Tis the body of

432
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,303
Weasel the head of a duck and a

433
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,327
Heats of a woman

434
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,631
The first question

435
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:48,959
From the audience was incredible Discovery sir what side

436
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,239
Is do you recommend

437
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,055
Weeks Later doctor scunthorpe

438
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:53,823
Released his

439
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,847
Findings in a paper

440
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:55,871
Recalls the Platypus

441
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:56,895
Please don't eat us

442
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,431
He was ignoring

443
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,711
Sherpas population

444
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:00,735
Somerset

445
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,015
Scunthorpe problem

446
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:02,783
Most boring

447
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,575
Orange

448
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:10,463
There is something real

449
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,743
Call Dad

450
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,511
Problem

451
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:13,791
But is it

452
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:16,351
From Helen the problem of people being inevitably this

453
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,375
Disappointed when they find out

454
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,655
What their favorite Public Radio

455
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,447
Actually look like

456
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,263
From Adam Burke

457
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:28,639
The problem of people or words with names that could be dirty not being able to use computers cuz

458
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:29,663
The computers won't let them

459
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:30,943
Or

460
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:36,575
Is it from Maeve Higgins the problem with people immediately celebrating the discovery of a new species

461
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,855
She's by immediately trying to

462
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,623
Eat it

463
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,415
Which of these is the real

464
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,183
Scunthorpe

465
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:41,951
What's the problem

466
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,743
Well it's really funny.

467
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:46,047
Because I'm recently I looked up

468
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,839
A picture of what you look like

469
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:54,239
Peter and I was very shocked to find out what he looks like

470
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,663
Replace the word shop

471
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:08,575
Surprise

472
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:12,671
I'm pretty sure it's Adam story

473
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,463
Refers to a problem in computer program

474
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:16,767
Will you chosen at

475
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:17,535
Tim Storey then

476
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,839
Definition of the scunthorpe problem

477
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,375
Talk to somebody who knows all about

478
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:22,911
My last name

479
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,959
Weimar quicker than algorithm

480
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:26,239
That was designed to prevent

481
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,263
People from using

482
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,311
Pornographic content or something

483
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:31,103
That was definitely Winer

484
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:36,223
A staff writer at SB Nation in the victim of the real scunthorpe problem

485
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:42,879
Because she can answer her name and will computers congratulations

486
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:46,207
You were right Adam Burke was telling the truth you picked a d got the point

487
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:49,535
You would surprise any voice you like saying pretty much anything you want

488
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:54,911
Wonderful thank you you're very very well who can ask before you

489
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:55,679
Go

490
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:03,871
What did you imagine I look like a description of a

491
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:13,855
Different sounds pretty good everybody jumps on you

492
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:17,952
Bengals play

493
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,632
Earlier this year we went to San Antonio Texas

494
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,656
That's where we were lucky

495
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:30,496
The interview one of the greatest TV Anchorman ever well

496
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:32,032
The other great

497
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,568
TV Anchorman ever

498
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:36,128
My old friend Dan Rather join us on stage

499
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,944
And Peter began in the appropriate way

500
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,480
Comparing him to me

501
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:46,880
You started and it turns out that many reporters I know including Bill started this way you were a local guy you were

502
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:49,184
What you were doing minor league baseball games at one point

503
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:51,744
I did I did play by play

504
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,536
Football baseball basketball

505
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,304
Ball

506
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,096
Track practice really difficult

507
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:59,936
How to do play-by-play.

508
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:06,592
Wait a minute how would you do that he seems to be running more

509
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:11,200
Parties voting already has this shot put in his hand and

510
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:17,856
He takes 5 Steps and Heathrow

511
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:22,976
Do you think there's one moment that which you sort of got your start

512
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:23,744
Started your

513
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,768
The career that we've also

514
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,304
Watching movies many decades

515
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:29,376
Well I do that there was a great hurricane

516
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,400
In 19

517
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,936
61 hurricane

518
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:32,704
Carla

519
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:35,008
Which was it that down and I think

520
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:36,288
I'm still the largest

521
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,824
In terms of sheer size

522
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,616
Hurricane on record

523
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,920
And I had just started in Tel Aviv

524
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:43,200
How to make my move from

525
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,224
Radio windows

526
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:44,992
Television

527
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:45,760
I'm still new to

528
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,064
And we

529
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,344
Roundup in the right place

530
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,648
Listen to write time on Galveston Island

531
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,184
Hurricane came in

532
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:57,024
And that was picked up by other stations nobody else was there

533
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:57,792
Broadcasting

534
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:00,096
So if I had to point to one moment that

535
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,400
Made my career

536
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,168
That was probably

537
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,472
Yeah it's funny cuz Bill got his sort of

538
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,752
Start over the great toe

539
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:07,520
Tornado in

540
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,288
Kansas tornado

541
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,080
It trailer maybe these

542
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:15,200
Maybe these weather events are being caused by ambitious young reporter

543
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:19,296
You were known for many things but certainly for being

544
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:23,392
Fearless not in the not only the places you went like War zones but also the way you treated

545
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,160
Do people in power

546
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:24,928
There's a famous into

547
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,720
Where you got up and you ask

548
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:27,744
The President Nixon

549
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:28,768
A question of

550
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,048
During Watergate and he didn't like

551
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,608
And I believe you said are you running for something

552
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:33,376
And you're famous for

553
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,144
Response was

554
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,424
No service

555
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,704
President ru

556
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:43,872
A pretty good

557
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:48,736
Horse took over as the anchor of the CBS Evening News taking the Baton from Walter Cronkite another Legend 2

558
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:51,296
Ticket from Edward R Murrow so

559
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:54,624
You're part of that line one of the things that people

560
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,904
Noticing as you as you

561
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,696
You settled into that role was you were looking for your

562
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,464
Sign off

563
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,792
Cuz famously of course contract would end his broadcast with that's the way it is

564
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,096
And what was your thinking

565
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,376
I needed something

566
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,144
You needed something

567
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:08,960
What was suggested to me that you need to sign up

568
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:12,800
Following a legend like that is not the easiest

569
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:16,640
I did write my first suggestion was maybe I can say well

570
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:23,296
That's some of the way it is

571
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:29,696
That's the way it might be.

Here's your first rather than this was when you were covering the 2000 election

633
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,816
Did you say this race is

634
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:15,584
Tight like a

635
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,120
Too small bathing suit and

636
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,912

Tilly after 1/3 Moscow mule

Definitely

643
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:48,096
I've always wondered

644
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:52,192
Did you just make those up off the top of your head did you like them having ready to go

645
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:54,496
In the beginning

646
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:56,800
They came from working in the oil fields

647
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,592
This is way men talk

648
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:00,384
You have got to be kidding me

649
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,224
You can only say it

650
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,088
It's hot as hell so many times

651
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:11,648
Hotter than a Laredo parking lot

652
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:13,696
Use colorful language

653
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,976
All right we have two more

654
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:19,072
You did well with that one this is now we're moving to time to the election of 2004 that way

655
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,352
Was George W bush real life

656
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,632
Scary

657
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:25,216
During that evenings coverage on CBS did you say a

658
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:29,824
John Kerry's wife might on Heinz but this is one night he won't catch up

659
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:36,736

Pockets he'd carry a handgun

661
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:42,112

664
00:28:55,168 --> 00:29:01,312
Here's your here's your last question this is a great metaphor you use while commenting

665
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,872
The 2016 election was it a

666
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:08,224
This race is a Backcountry Tilt-A-Whirl it could go either way

667
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:10,784
Be like the talking horse

668

Do you know which one you wish you were

673
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:35,360
I guess that would be

674
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:40,736

All I need is Bill Gates

763
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,632
The fly camera

764
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:10,656
Once

765
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,216
You'll be able to build

766
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:13,984
The whole wall

767
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:15,776
I don't like that the money's going

768
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:18,080
Going towards the wall but I'm off

769
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,360
Taking all of my check

770
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:20,384
All of the time

771
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,152

Just looking at my face

775
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,344
And yet I've got

776
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,648
Tons of metal in my pockets like

It's all grimy

781
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:43,936
It's filled with germs

782
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:46,240
Take all of it

783
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:48,800
Actually that's actually plan B

784
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:58,784
Cities like New York

785
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:00,832
LA and Washington DC

786
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:03,648

Parking tickets

792
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:24,896
Jeff the terrible life

00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:29,760
Idea that's where we are faced this will be known as the era of

794
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:32,320
Terrible ideas

795
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:34,880
Frustrated

796
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:35,648
The Jerk of Park

797
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:36,672
In the bike lane

798
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:37,696

You know after a couple of years of the United States

805

Seeming like Nazi Germany

806
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:50,496
It's a refreshing now that I have it just seemed like

807
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:51,520

00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,344
The young people from being

857
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,880

Hang out together

922
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,416
All the time

923
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:27,232
And we only do it in the most fancy places

924
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,768
Like Carnegie Hall

925
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,072
Last winter we allowed in audience

926
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:33,888
I'm still listening that's we chatted with our late night

927

College Seth Meyers

Peter may not have been to show her who he was

929
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:45,920
I understand you have a television show up sometime it's on very late at night

930
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:49,504
Did I am never awake

931
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:53,856
I have no idea what I would do if someone said okay you're going to be starring in a in a

932
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:54,880
Evening show

933
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,416
Four nights a week

934
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:58,208
Was that intimidating when you got that job

935
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:59,232
It was

936
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:03,584
Saturday Night Live was so intimidating when I got that job that I was

937
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,352
Prepared

938
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:07,936
To be intimidated again if you can do that

939
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:11,264
When when you said yourself okay we're going to have our own our own a duration of late night

940
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,312
You said I want to do

941
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,592
What

942
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:16,128
I didn't know

943
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,408
Really

944
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:23,808
When I first started doing the show your biggest fear was how do you fill an hour and that is not my fear

945
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:30,208
It's been replaced with bigger fears

946
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:36,608
No I was not joking we are very proud that you came out of Northwestern

947
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:38,912
College and then you were in Ohio

948
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:41,984
Chicago improv tradition

949
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,776
Considered improper profession

950
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:45,824
You know my parents

951
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,640
Did deserve some of the blame when they

952
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:55,296
When they took me to Chicago and New Hampshire with my parents also went to Northwestern and when they took me there

953
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:56,320
For my first

954
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:57,088
The week of

955
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:59,904
School they took me to Second City because it was something they had done in college

956
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:00,672
And so

957
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:03,744
Second City and so

958
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,864
Which was a grave mistake because that was so much more interesting than any of my freshman year class

959
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,680
But then I was very lucky

960
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:13,984
Theater in Chicago

961
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:20,384
It's based in Amsterdam the Netherlands and so I audition for that and moved overseas for a couple of years

962
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,456
Improv in Amsterdam for Dutch people

963
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:24,992
How did that go

964
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:26,528
There were nights

965
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:28,320
It was not great

966
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:34,720
I have a love affair with the Dutch so this will sound like a criticism but it's the loving one they are the

967
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:36,256
Most honest people in the world

968
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:37,280
Okay

969
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:39,840
I remember after show

970
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:41,376
A judge guy

971
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:45,728
Came over and said hey I'd like to buy you a drink and I said oh did you like the show he said no

972
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:52,640
I said why are you buying me a drink

973
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:01,599
Serious people are they hard to make laugh

974
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:04,927
Play would only laugh if it was genuinely funny and so I do

975
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:06,463
Think looking back when you

976
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:10,047
It's been two years somewhere we're polite laughter doesn't exist it makes you better come

977
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:13,375
I put you through and you never think

978
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:14,911
You were good when you were

979
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:19,519
You know I should point out that Imports 80% of our audience

980
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:23,615
Was Dutch any other 20% were Americans who were visiting aunt

981
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:24,383
Amsterdam

982
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:26,687
And of course they weren't there cuz Improv

983
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:33,087
Was legal aid help or hurt

984
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:35,647
You know people say oh my God

985
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:42,303
A stone. Ian Smith's me the best audience they are the worst. Even because they laugh at the house

986
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:47,935
That you're wearing a perfectly crafted joke and they're already laughing

987
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:50,495
How you walked on stage

988
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:56,383
You know we have a little bit of History

989
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:57,407
But

990
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:59,455
You know well recently

991
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:04,319
Michelle wolf who who was a colleague of mine she worked at are showing in after her Correspondents Dinner key

992
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:09,183
Tweeted that she bombed as badly as I did during my Correspondents Dinner

993
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,207
I was thrilled

994
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:11,231
To be compared to her

995
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:16,863
Sheena well first of all I thought she was pretty great she was Fearless but you were especially Fearless

996
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,143
This is the famous 2011

997
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:22,239
White House Correspondents Dinner to make fun of a certain person in the audience

998
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:23,519
Donald Trump

999
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:26,079
Private citizen at the time

1000
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:30,175
And you you completely mock the whole idea of him him becoming president

1001
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:33,759
And some people say of course that's when he said I'll show them

1002
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:40,159
Wella Color Me shown

1003
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:46,559
But you're like the mrs. O'Leary's cow the national concentrate

1004
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:52,959
Even mrs. O'Leary's cow that night didn't walk out of there going I crushed it

1005
00:43:56,287 --> 00:44:01,407

1014
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:19,071
Rachel Berry show

1015
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:25,471
New York New York all right

1016
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:27,519
Dating has changed

1017
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:29,823
Significantly over the centuries if

1018
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,103
You were for example

1019
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:34,431
A Welshman looking for a date in the 17th century

1020
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:37,759
What could you do to ensure you might catch her eye

1021
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:40,319
Hey walk loudly pastor

1022
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:44,415
As passion was considered to be proportional to the volume of footsteps

1023
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:47,743
B give your crush a homemade spoon

1024
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:51,071
Carpet with specific symbols indicating the nature of your love

1025
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:56,959
Orsi traveled as far away as you can and send a letter as level As proved by the distance that had

1026
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:57,727
New travel

1027
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:00,287
Fall really

1028
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:02,079
Good feasible.

1029
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:02,847
Options yeah

1030
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,663
The one of these was the

1031
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:09,759
17th century Welsh equivalent of swiping right

1032
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:13,087
Loudly walking path

1033
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:17,951
I'm going with that I must stop

1034
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:24,863
Couple of Welsh people and I've always heard him coming

1035
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:27,679
No I'm sorry it was the spoon

1036
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:28,703
Will Harris

1037
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:31,775
Spoon presumably this means I want to spoon with you

1038
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:34,335
All right you still have two more chances your next question

1039
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:36,127
Scientists are nerds

1040
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:40,735
But they look for love to as in which of these real life cases which which of these really have

1041
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:41,759
Hey

1042
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:43,807
A researcher in Antarctica

1043
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,599
Turned on Tinder

1044
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:46,623
End matched

1045
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:49,951
With someone in Antarctica a few miles away

1046
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:52,767
Be a clinical technician

1047
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:58,399
Was really impressed with the quality of a particular blood sample and looked up the patient to ask

1048
00:45:58,655 --> 00:45:59,167
Ask her out

1049
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:03,007
Or see a medical researcher who managed to impress his crush with

1050
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:04,287
Comic dioramas

1051
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:06,335
Made with euthanized lab mice

1052
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,663
I'm going to go I'm going to say

1053
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:10,431
Tinder in Ann Arbor

1054
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:16,831
You're right it works

1055
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:18,623
Turn on Tinder

1056
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:24,255
I guess the nights get long and he actually found somebody who is camping just a short while the way

1057
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:29,375
They didn't meet but nothing happened this scientist said the first Antarctic Tinder hook-up

1058
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:30,399
Has yet to happen

1059
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:33,727
So I question if you get this one right

1060
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:37,567
Celebrities have their own dating troubles I'm sure you know that

1061
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:41,663
Actress Zoe Kravitz once went on a date

1062
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:44,735
Which she says went pretty well he was nice they got along

1063
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:46,271
But then what have

1064
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:49,087
Happened was it a at the end of the day he said that was fun

1065
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:52,671
But I got to confess it only came because I thought I had a date with Lenny Kravitz

1066
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:57,791
Be she pulled out her phone when she got home and saw that he had life

1067
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:59,327
Tweeted the whole thing

1068
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:01,119
Or see the next

1069
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:03,423
Day the guy called her and asked

1070
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:06,495
Ask her if she wouldn't mind looking after his quote pet turtle

1071
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:11,615
I'm quoting she said yes because he was a nice guy and who doesn't like turtles and it turned out to be

1072
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:13,663
A 30-pound African

1073
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:14,431
Tortoise names

1074
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:15,199
Gary

1075
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:19,039
Who stayed with her a month while this guy totally disappeared

1076
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:24,671
Italy came back and said hey want to catch a movie and they went to the movie and he never mentioned

1077
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:29,791
The turtle which she ended up giving

1078
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:31,071
To Eternal rest

1079
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:37,983
Wow

1080
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:38,751
Taiwan

1081
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:41,055
I wanted not to be

1082
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:47,455
Only because it's such a wonderful piece of writing

1083
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:51,039
I want that to be fiction and then I tip my cap to whoever came up with it

1084
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:53,343
Because of that desire

1085
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:55,903
I meant to say was be

1086
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:57,695
But it was live

1087
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:58,463
Stream

1088
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:00,767
No that's not what it was but

1089
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:03,327
I'm going to say that was a hint and not a

1090
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:05,631
And I'll give you another chance

1091
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:12,287
