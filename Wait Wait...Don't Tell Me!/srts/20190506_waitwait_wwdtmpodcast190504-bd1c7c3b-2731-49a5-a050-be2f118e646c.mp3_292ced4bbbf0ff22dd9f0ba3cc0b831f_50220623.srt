14
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:24,320
Hey there is Peter as you might have figured out recently when you tried to listen to our show and got somebody else's or

15
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:26,368
Tried to listen to another show and got ours

16
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:27,904
We screwed up

17
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:30,464
NPR me to change to wear web servers

18
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,744
That we didn't expect to have

19
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,048
Any affected our podcast and we

20
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:35,072
We're wrong

21
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:38,912
As far as I know this is the first mistake of any kind of NPR has ever made

22
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:39,936
Ever

23
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:41,472
About anything and it feels

24
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:42,496
O odd

25
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:46,080
The change forced a bunch of episodes into NPR Podcast feeds

26
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:48,384
Resulting in downloads you didn't ask

27
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:53,504
It also made it hard or impossible for you to find a listen to your favorite NPR Podcast

28
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:55,296
We're really sorry for this

29
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:58,368
Especially because trust me last week's wait wait was fantastic

30
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:00,160

31
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:01,952
You didn't get to hear it

32
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:06,816
We fix the root cause of the problem shortly after we discovered it but it took a while for that fit

33
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:08,352
Text to make it to all the podcast app

34
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,888
Some pulled it has to do with the size of

35
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:11,424

In the letter

119
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,367
He got from whom

120
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,671
I believe that's me

Butter that was leaked

123
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:01,311
This week it turns out to have been sent to mr. bar by this gentleman

124
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:04,383
Right after Mr bar had sent out his summary of the mullet

125
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:14,367
No I don't think our president actually writes letters

126
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:22,303
We were not doing too hot right now

127
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:27,935
After

128
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,727
Years of Silence

129
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:36,127
As he was viciously attacked by the president and his allies slandered and threatened to special counsel Robert Mueller had

130
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:36,895
Enough

131
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:37,919

And typed a letter

135
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,367
Use his nuts

136
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,927
So Mueller sent this letter to William Barr

137
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,463
Criticizing the way bar

138
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,743

The letter said bars summary did not quote

142
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,375
Capture the

143
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,935

00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,471
Bar Zen

145
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,239
And summarized

146
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,263
That letter

147
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,031
To the Pratt

148
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,823

149
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:06,847
Cuz I look like I've lost

150
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,735
There's just such an unfortunate amount of

151
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:13,503
Notkin

152
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,527
Exclusive stuff

153
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,599
Going on it just feels like

154
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:20,159
Leading up to the report I feel like

155
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,695
Everybody on both sides

156
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:22,975
Want like someday

157
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:25,535
Definitive answer

158
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,303
Closure

159
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:30,143
I want closure I want like the last scene of the movie

160
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,167
Page

161
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,703
407

162
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,871
Movie you want to see the last you know if you want to see like the last scene

163
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,407
Of our eternity

164
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,431
The Jedi will all the

165
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,455
He walks her dance

166
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,295
Or is it more like the last scene of The Godfather where everybody

167
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,743
No one has ever said this but I'm choosing Ewoks

168
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,327
More like this

169
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,095
Sopranos

170
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,375
Black and then

171
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:02,911
Decide what

172
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,751
That's what's happening

173
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:07,775
There's like

174
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:10,847
No definitive thing and then even mother's letters like I

175
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:11,615
Disagree with

176
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:13,663
You drew about

177
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,967
He should have written letters I get stoned

178
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:19,039
Download

179
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:21,087
Interesting things about this that didn't get

180
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,367
A lot of attention this week

181
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,975
Is that Mueller and bar our old Friends Bar talked about this

182
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:27,999
During his confirmation

183
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,535
After 30 years

184
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,559
Their wives

185
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,583
Go to Bible

186
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,607
Study together

187
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,935
Of course bars wife insist The Ten Commandments are really just

188
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:38,239
Suggestions

189
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:41,055
More of a listicle than anything else

190
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:44,383
Can you imagine how like incredibly awkward

199
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:00,511
Is your next quote the fact that it's

200
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,303
2019 and we're dealing with

201
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,327
This is

202
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,607
Ridiculous

203
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:11,007
That was a student at UCLA who recently found out that she was among the many people who might have been exposed

204
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:13,055
What disease making a comeback

205
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:20,479
Measles that's right Google measles age of course the disease that

206
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,759
That's so contagious

207
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:22,527
You caught it

208
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,063
Just because I said its name.

209
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,951
America had eliminated measles but then people started saying the measles vaccine was bad for you

210
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:32,255
So now there are 700 report

211
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,023
Cases of music

212
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,047
Nationwide

213
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,839
And people are freaking out

214
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:36,607
Parents are trying

215
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,375
Adonai

216
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:40,447
They are the problem though my kid doesn't have measles

217
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,727
He's a bodybuilder

218
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,263
And that's just facts

219
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,567
And

220
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,591
Front knee

221
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:49,407
Narnian face knee

222
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,199
Heine

223
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:55,039
So many people are responsible for the

224
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,319
This crisis is anti-vax

225
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:58,111
Syncrisis does the right wing nutjobs

226
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,135

Dairy and Nut Job

229
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:04,511
It's so great that in this divided time we live in

230
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,047
Allsides can get

231
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,583
Together to do something

232
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,351
Deep least

233
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,399
Stupid

234
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:11,935
Now the question is

235
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,239
Affect

236
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,519

237
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,543
Yes

238
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:22,943
The question is

239
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:38,559
Assassins

240
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,583
Ecology Cruise

241
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:40,863

Quarantine off an island in the Caribbean because there's a measles Outbreak on board

243
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:51,871
This is crazy cuz means old is not the worst thing that ever happened on a cruise people he'll Diesel's is an upgrade from what

244
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:56,223
You usually get on a cruise America

245
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,783
Gabriel you're last quote is from a

246
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,063
Burger King

247
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:00,831
Customer

248
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,111
If you don't tell anybody

249
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,647
They don't know

250
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,183
That man was talking about the

251
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,975
The taste of a new Whopper the bear

252
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:10,559
The first-ever Whopper that does not contain what

253
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,583
Eats right

254
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:17,983
Me please very good it's called The Impossible Burger it's

255
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,543
All vegetable Patty the tastes amazingly like beef

256
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,591
Burger King offer them is a limited experiment

257
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,639
It was so successful they're extending a nationwide

258
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:29,503
Which could mean that non-vegetarians are choosing the burger

259
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:30,527
Which is amazing

260
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:34,111
We're could just mean that anybody who goes into a Burger King is beyond caring what the

261
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,815
Not sleep

262
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,839
Terrible

263
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:46,399
Taste like beef but here's the thing

264
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,447
It's still really bad

265
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,519
It has to be in order to taste that good

266
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:54,591
It's got all kinds of fats to make it take give that juicy taste

267
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:57,663
Listen to some of the ingredients right

268
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,967
Soy protein concentrate

269
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,759
Methylcellulose

270
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,295
So

271
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,087
Leg hemoglobin

272
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:14,047

Is good enough for the congratulations

278
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:45,279
Right now it's time for you to answer some questions about

279
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,815
This week's news

280
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:49,631
Peter an investigation by CBS News reported this week

281
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,679
Did some schools are frantically using scotch

282
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:54,751
Tape roses and old gum to try and teach

283
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:55,519
Watch kids watch

284
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,335
Kids what it's like

285
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,103
Wynyard school

286
00:11:59,359 --> 00:11:59,871
Schools budget cuts

287
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:10,879
Can I have a little help sometimes in a piece of tape and a Rose Levy

288
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,647
Weather very much

289
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:17,279
These are the methods

290
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:20,351
Used to teach something called abstinence-only sex-ed

291
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,143
Which is sort of like

292
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:26,751
Starvation only cooking class

293
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,775
So for example

294
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,055
A teacher will stick

295
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,079
A piece of tape

296
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,127
On a student's arm and then tell the kids

297
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:32,895
You pull it off

298
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:33,919
And then

299
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,967
Hand the tape to the next

300
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:37,759
At that point

301
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,039
Here on it

302
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:43,135
And it's like put it in your arm so it doesn't stick as well the second time right

303
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:45,439
Which is why you should never have sex

304
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,279
So I get the gum

305
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,863
The Roses the rose Works be in the summer way is what to do

306
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:56,703

00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:58,751
First kid in the first get hold

309
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,287
The second kid

310
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,335
Could get it in the pass it around the class

311
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:05,919
Have the time heroes has been passed around with very many shall we say

312

I do enjoy a lot but

365
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:38,751
Challenging is definitely the way I would also describe it

366
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,799
So what do you do to relax after a hard day at school

367
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:45,407

The great clock on Big Ben is a fixture of London

479
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:32,223
Along with Buckingham Palace

480
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,015
The Tower of London and fog

481
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,343

They don't have fingers

490
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:00,639
They should call them arms

491
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,711
And why the Roman numeral

550
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:40,384

Xi an

772

There's not enough room at the debate

773
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,408
It's okay that's exactly right

774
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:29,504
We've known for months that they're too many Democrats running for president but now it's a fish

775

Now there's an extra Canada

783
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:42,816
The DNC is not happy about this I don't want to be accused

784
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:43,584
Favoritism

785
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:46,912
So they've adopted a policy

786
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:47,680
Pretending

787
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:49,728

Squares that

794
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:18,400
I'm so the DNC has a plan they're going to get up at the first debate and they say this

795
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:19,424
Debate is over book

796
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:26,336
So we need volunteers to take a later today for a $300 voucher and a guaranteed spot in the car

They say they've captured a Russian spy

799
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:33,504
Who is it

800
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:40,928
Well that's right. I thought I saw this week

801
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,720
Spotted this beluga whale

802
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:43,744
When they noticed it had this

803
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,768
Equipment harness

804
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:47,072
On it that was labeled St Petersburg

805
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:51,424
Further Evidence it was a spy came in the asset it's

806
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,960
Species and it said well

807
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:59,360
Beluga whale

00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:03,456
Buy water board again man with bat not effective

809
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:11,136
So the Russians didn't even deny that said yeah we've been using whales to spy for years and also we are told your submarines don't

810
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,416
Taste good get on there

811
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:16,256
This news is tough to the reputation of whales

812
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:19,328
So far until now seen as innocent in the Affairs of men

813
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:21,888

Look like

00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,880
