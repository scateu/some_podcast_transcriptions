80
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,896

That you did not know John Hickenlooper

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:47,584
This is true he does not have he was the white guy

Gender weight

138
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:31,935
It's just something somebody misread that birth record

139
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:37,823
And here's your next quote it's about a phenomenon happening mainly at schools around the country

Somebody's close friend you know

149
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:10,079

Descending on their small town for a Neo-Nazi

376
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,007
Music Festival

377
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:48,383
The town decided to fight back against the festival how by starving the neo-nazis of their primary source

378
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,151
The food

379
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:49,919
Beer

380
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:55,807
First the police force got permission from a local Court to seize almost all of the beer in town

381
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,087
7000

382
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,391
Before it fell into the wrong stomach

383
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:04,255
That Dope still left 200 crates of beer for sale in the local grocery

384
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:07,071
Restore so the people of ostrich stood up

385
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:12,703
They went to that local grocery store and they literally bought up all of the beer left in the town themselves

386
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:14,751
So the Nazis couldn't get it

387
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:19,359
The ultimate location of that beer is unknown and now appears to be completely missing

388
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,127
When asked

389
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,663
The townspeople burp

390
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,735
And the plan worked

391
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:29,087
Attendance at the Nazi Festival was down by over 50% this year

392
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:30,623
Peter

393
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:34,975
Spoiled

394
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:41,119
When the town bought up all the beer so that they couldn't have any your last or even

395
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:41,887
Productive

396
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,167
Comes from paella pan

397
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:50,079
The lucky moose Food Mart in Toronto Ontario did not get lucky when they made the decision

398
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,895
Not to allow soy milk and not milk

399
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:56,223
To abide in the section reserved for cow produce

400
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:56,991
Milk

401
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:01,599
The local vegan Community responded with a pro nutmilk day of Rage

402
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:02,879
Store posters

403
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:05,439
Screaming don't let dairy cream nuts

404
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,999
Unholster your Holstein

405
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,279
Someone

406
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:15,679
Watching on two feet and a cow costume wearing a sign that simply says how dare you

407
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:22,847
So at first it was assumed the people who got off the old timey truck with the hay on it with fellow vegans

408
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:28,735
They set up nut milking demonstrations with people in overalls sitting on stools trying to

409
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:32,575
Squeeze liquid from almonds and soybeans in the metal buckets

410
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:39,231
Others set up an enclosure for some nuts on the ground inside it and how come on kids

411
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,815
As if he can clear these were not vegans

412
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:48,703
Dairy Farmers sick and tired of raising milk cows from calves only to see them put out of a job by some damn plan

413
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:52,031
Doesn't even need refrigerated

414
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:58,687
Said a man who called himself old nuts farmer McDonald's who was actually an executive with a local

415
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,711
Dairy co-op

416
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:01,247
Andrew ordover

417
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:04,063
Just put it on a shelf in the weird food section

418
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,231
One of these was a counter-protest

419
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:12,767
It was actually quite

420
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:13,535
Success

421
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:17,631
Was it from faith saylee other people in the town in europe managed to

422
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:18,655
The foil of actors

423
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:21,983
By pretending they all have the Bubonic plague and driving them out of town

424
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:28,895
Was it from Luke Burbank Highway Nazi rally in Germany was foiled in all the towns people who don't like Nazis

425
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:31,967
Bought up all the beers of the Nazis wouldn't have any

426
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:35,295
Or from Paula Poundstone how some Dairy Farmers

427
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,879
Turn vegan protesters methods on their head in order

428
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:39,647
To make

429
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:40,671
Acclaim

430
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:43,231
For milk which of these is the real story of a counter-protest

431
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:47,327
I'm going to go with Luke story I say

432
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:53,215
You go with Luke story about the neo-nazis who gave up because there was no beer to be had

433
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:58,335
It sounds like something crazy German people might do well

434
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:01,407
We spoke to somebody who actually covered of the actual counter-protest

435
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:04,991
Some citizens decided to buy up all the beer

436
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:11,391
Going to local supermarket and to make it as quick as a spot for sure cuz if he doesn't end Indiana

437
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,415
Alcohol

438
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:16,511

In your book

467

Probably just

473
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:46,624
When I was writing

474
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:47,904
And every time I said I'm

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,768

476
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,304
You shouldn't believe me

477
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,096
And so I got to go home and I

478
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:59,168
Simon & Schuster publishing a novel in and she

479
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:01,216

Identifiable.

493
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,632
Tales about people you knew and had

494
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:33,728
Grown up with and perhaps who had mothered you

495
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,520
My mom had been

496
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:36,288

How to come out to your parents like for your mom to come out to

511
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,888
Weird

512
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,680
Well I mean

513
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,728
She didn't tell us

514
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:11,360
Rachel showed you exactly what happened but you know that you know this or just the first

515
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:17,760
She's going to hit us

516
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:20,320
So what happened was

517
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:22,624
What happened was my youngest brother

518
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,392
Joe

519
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,672
What home did he was laundry

00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,976
And called me at work at

521
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:27,744
Philadelphia

522
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,512
Inquiring

523
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:29,536
There's a woman

524
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,560
Living in the house

Close and it's not friend

527
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:37,728
I'm close and then he said and I was in mom's bathroom

528
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,008
Toenails

529
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,800
When I found all these love letters

530
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:42,080

Never going to happen again

She says no and I say

I wanted to give her the chance to write took to come clean

538
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:04,096

00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:06,560
Say this is for municipal purposes but then again that's what your 22 year old cousin with

747
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:07,840
Glaucoma says

748
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:12,192
Horses everywhere hear this news and they're like great

749
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,984
Okay could I use this

750
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,800
The day you nailed my shoes on

751
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:20,128
Is it making them high

752
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,664
How can you tell

753
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:33,696
You show up at a kid's birthday party in the pony is talking about how weird hooves are and

754
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:34,464
Movies

755
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,792
Anyway I'm really excited for the Kentucky Derby to take for Days Inn

756
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:41,888
Next year

757
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,680
Giving horses weed

758
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:50,336
Everytime something blows their mind and they go woah they stop

759
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:55,456
That just doesn't seem right that like horses will be the last animals we want to make

760
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:03,136
I just have this image

761
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:05,696
Tending around America around just be like

762
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,352
You know when I was a kid my mother would say you get off your high horse

763
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:15,936
I would think to myself

764
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,472
I would think to myself

765
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:23,360
What the hell is that high horse of her time

766
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,128
Richard Thomas

767
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:31,040
Paula will know seals could do need things like balance a ball and clap their fins with

768
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,576
This week we learned the scientist

769
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:35,904
Scotland have been hard at work teaching seals how to do

770
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:38,464
And this given the healthcare crisis in

771
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,024
Crisis at the border and the crisis in our democracy

772
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:43,072
Is a huge breakthrough

773
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:46,144
They can sing rock and roll songs I think

774
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,680
They can sing yeah

775
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:49,984
Very good as well

776
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:52,800
Science time will you

777
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:56,384
What person on the planet will not benefit

778
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:58,176
From this

779
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,456
Are the Seals

780
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,736
Do we know what music

781
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:05,088
Yes we do

782
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,880
This

783
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,184
No I have like

784
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,976
3 Zola albums

785
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:12,000
And Josh

786
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:16,608
And what are the other ones one of them is

787
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,656
I just don't care anymore that's one

788
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:21,728
I love that and then there's a rap one

789
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,568
Kendrick Lamar

790
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,616
What is sololearn

791
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:30,944
Twinkle Twinkle Little Star

792
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:31,968
Star Wars

793
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:32,736
Theme song

794
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:36,064
Proving seals would do literally anything for the fish including

795
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:36,832
Selling out

796
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:39,392
But it's pretty amazing

797
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,952
And we want to show you some

798
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:42,720
The first of course

799
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:43,744
The real thing

800
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:52,704
He's back the thrill of hearing it

801
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:58,848
For the first time you really think I needed you to remind them the theme to Star Wars

802
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,128
Anyway

803
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:01,920
That was the real one obviously

804
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:03,200
Here is

805
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:04,736
Zola the singing sea

806
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:19,328
That's exactly the same oh yeah

807
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:23,424
That was a seal literally millions of fish

808
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,240
Don't forget that

809
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:29,568
What's the only possible way that this

810
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:30,336
Experiment

811
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:32,896
Or training or whatever you want to call it

812
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:33,664
What is Project

813
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,200
Could have any value

814
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:37,760
If it is if they taught at the Jaws theme

815
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:47,744
You know great white was coming up near you

816
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,048
Wild Kratts

817
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,936
And then you would know you know

818
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,472
Let's get out of here

819
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:59,008
Another seal to be like

820
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:05,152
What was that was like a teacher for the Peanuts cartoon

821
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:17,184
Coming up with Lenny fill-in-the-blank the first is the game where you have to listen

Blossom Music Center just outside of Cleveland located within Cuyahoga Valley

829
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:42,016
National Park

830
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:44,576
Hi you are on wait wait don't tell me

831
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:47,136
My name is Candice

832
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:48,672
I'm from Norfolk

833
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:52,768
Virginia Norfolk Virginia bucolic Northfolk I was order like Norfolk

834
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:53,792
North Pole

835
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:55,840
I want to go local

836
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:57,120
Call it Norfolk

837
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:59,936
So you're not from Norfolk originally

838
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:01,216
I know I was

839
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:02,496
Freezing Florida

840
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:03,520
Do you ever Miss Florida

841
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:05,056
Nope

842
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:08,640
Oh so you are from there

843
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:16,320
Well welcome to the show Candice Bill Curtis is going to be the last word or phrase missing for me

844
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:19,648
If you can fill in that last word or phrase correctly into the limits will be a win

845
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:20,672
Ready to play

846
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:21,952
I am ready

847
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:22,720
Here's your first

848
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,768
My stomach I like

849
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:26,304
Flat

850
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:28,096
So it's coffee I drink

851
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:29,120
By the vet

852
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:31,168
I recently learned

853
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:31,936
It gets

854
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:32,960
Calories burned

855
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:36,544
Making brown kind of

856
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:39,616
There you go

857
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:46,016
New research has found that drinking coffee can stimulate a substance in the body known as brown fat

858
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:47,040
The stuff left over

859
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:48,064
For the pan after you make bacon

860
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,856
Would rather sell the produce heat

861
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,648
That then burn off the other kind of fat

862
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:52,672
Did you get from eating

863
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:53,440
Bacon

864
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:55,232
So the idea is that

865
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:56,768
Coffee helps you lose

866
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:57,536
Lose weight

867
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,072
This cannot be

868
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:02,144
Because if it were I would have banished

869
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:03,168
Decades ago

870
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:08,800
Want to be fun of coffee becomes a new health drink

871
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:11,104
It'll be great when it replaces Gatorade in the

872
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,152
Team wins the big game in dumpster

873
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:16,736
Big Ern of hot coffee on the couch

874
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,296
Alright here is your neck slimmer

875
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:22,624
In their enclaves the real was nesara crying

876
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:25,184
We can see the young fella is

877
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:25,952
Triumph

878
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,744
But his costume is

879
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,536
Poor Eddie's got a week

880
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:30,304
Roar

881
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,864
So he doesn't seem much like a

882
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:35,936
Lion the lion

883
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:43,360
An employee at a zoo in Japan finally got the role of a lifetime

884
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:44,384
Zoos emergence

885
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:46,944
The same way every time your building is a

886
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,224
The fire drill somebody has to

887
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:49,504
The fire

888
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:52,576
Do you have to find this on the internet

889
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:53,856
It is amazing

890
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:56,160
You think they choose like a convincing lion costume

891
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:57,952
But no it's a guy

892
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:58,720
In like

893
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:01,280

Plastic smiling lion

896
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:05,888
Walking around on two legs

897
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:09,728
You know cheerfully waving at people being a lion

898
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:14,592
Everyone on Twitter applauded the employee's job playing the line except of course for the zoos real lions

899
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:16,128
Called his performance derivative

900
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:16,896
An unreal

901
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:19,968
You know who would crush at that gig

902
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:20,736
Gritty

903
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:24,576
Here is your last

How are athletes are strong

905
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:28,416
Silverfish

906
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:29,952
Like Popeye

907
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:30,976
Their strength

908
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:32,000
What the minute

909
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,328
A dark leafy green makes them tough

910
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,096
Meaning

911
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:36,864
Lean

912
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:39,168
Yes I doping entails

913
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,800
Yes yes very good

914
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:49,152
Performance enhancing drugs along with unflattering shorts has been a long day

915
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,176
Problem in

916
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:56,320
2 banned substances well German scientist

917
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:57,600
Suggesting spinach

918
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:58,624
Should be added

919
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,392
To the prohibited list

920
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,160
Presumably

921
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,440
Because the scientist

922
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:02,208
Sorry team

923
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:03,232
AB 7 year old

924
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:06,816
Broccoli brussel sprouts

925
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:08,352
And cooties

926
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,656
So it's not it's not

927
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:12,960
Spinach it's not like

928
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:18,080
Spinach is found in some other drugs actually chemicals similar to a steroid natural

929
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:18,848
We found in Spanish

930
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,664
And it's so effective scientist really exposed

931
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,200
To the chemical compound were able to

932
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:24,992
Suddenly bench press 5
