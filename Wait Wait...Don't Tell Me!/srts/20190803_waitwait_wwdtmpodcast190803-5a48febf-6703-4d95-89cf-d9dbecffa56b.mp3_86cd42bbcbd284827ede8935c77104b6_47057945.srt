With the second round of the democratic debates

00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:26,080
This weekend despite the efforts of many people doing a lot of work

81
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,360
After the first round

82
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:34,016
We weren't able to get rid of any of those people at the Wednesday to make their two Tuesday and Wednesday at the

83
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,808
Wednesday debate everybody went after biting

84
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,856
His main response was hey

85
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,648
But Obama like me

86
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,232
Come on that was years ago

87
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:46,560
It's like the old guy who won't stop talking about high school

88
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:50,656
Rite-hite I was vice quarterback of the football team

89
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,960
Did you guys enjoy the debates

90
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:58,848
I take it you did there either

91
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,152
I feel bad for

92
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,176
Marion

93
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:05,760
Yeah because everybody kept tweeting her like

94
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:06,784
Affirmation

95
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,112
I realized they were asking her if she had like

96
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:16,512
Don't feel bad for her

97
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:21,887
I was shocked

98
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,167
Just see you're on the

99
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:23,935
Debate stage

100
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,215
For the Democrats

101
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:28,543
Very impressed in the first

102
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,335
Debates when she said

103
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,103
Her first

104
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:31,871
Couple answers

105
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:32,895
Pretty good

106
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:34,943
Third answer

107
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,831
Will happen like that

108
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,927
She doesn't go for men

109
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,975
Rubs herself against

110
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:52,351
Old Oakhurst conventional wisdom coming out of the

111
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,655
Affair was that a Joe Biden who is

112
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,935
Leading by a lot

113
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:56,959
Long way

114
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,495
The Democratic polls

115
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,775
All he had to do was not

116
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:00,543
Screw up

117
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,567
And he didn't

118
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,871
Scraps are always doing great

119
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,919
Except at the very end of it

120
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,455
He screwed up his own website

121
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:12,319
Right he said go to Joe 30330 when he meant X

122
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,087
That

123
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:18,463
I mean it was such a grandfatherly thing to do

124
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:23,583
3030

125
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,679
Next quote is from

126
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,983
Some public service that NPR did

127
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,775
Sending a message to

128
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,055
Specific group of men

129
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,079
This week

130
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,639
Children think you're really really on a

131
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:41,759
Attractive that was NPR's and Nell greenfieldboyce talking about a new study that finds men with

132
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,295
What facial feature

133
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,343
Actually scares young children

134
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,391
Mustaches

135
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,439
Oh bigger than that go for the whole face

136
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,463
Obir

137
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:58,911
Wait a minute you said that his resignation and sadness do you still have

138
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,679
Add a beard

139
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:03,519
I definitely do not know the answer is beer

140
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,311
A new study finds adult

141
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07,871
Perceive people with beards at stronger and more mature

142
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,919
But that young children find them

143
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:10,687
Terrifying

144
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:17,087
Single mom

145
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,111
Stronger and more

146
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,647
Mature most adults

147
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,671
According to psychology

148
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,487
Well I wasn't thin survey

149
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:30,655
This is part of it they were trying to find out how kids related to people with beards or not

150
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,191
Not so what they did was they took some young kid

151
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:32,959
Kids and they gave them

152
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:34,239
Specially created

153
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,543
It's about a Mysterious Island

154
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,567
We're The Kids

155
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:40,639
Help

156
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,687
So they tended to pek

157
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,967
Clean-shaven men

158
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,503
4

159
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,783
Convolving cooperate

160
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,575
And bearded men

161
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,855
And for tasks that called for

162
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,135
Strength and men's

163
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:56,511
This is all ready to copy

164
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,279
The kids don't like

165
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:10,591
I don't know are you

166
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,919
Should find band terrifying

167
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:19,807
It seemed everyone should have a beard

168
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:26,463
Children

169
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,279
Detective

170
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,655
Bearden I said I don't think that they seem

171
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,919
Dear Joshua is your last

172
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:46,687
Best quote

173
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,991
I got the horses in the back

174
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,527
Horse tack is it at

175
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,063
Those are some of the lyrics

176
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,111
To the song that is now broken the record

177
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,647
Longest run ever

178
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:58,463
At the top of the Billboard charts what is that song

179
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:00,511
So it's that horrible song old

180
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:05,887
Old Town Road in the nation disagrees

181
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:09,215
The song by Lil Nas X has been number one on the billboard charts

182
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,775
For 17 consecutive weeks that breaks a record

183
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:14,591
At this rate it will last longer than human civilization

184
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:17,663
Lamaze execution in the charts

185
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:20,479
True by constantly turning out new versions with diff

186
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,503
Collaborators include

187
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,551
Billy Ray Cyrus and Lil Wayne

188
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,087
Song keep getting updates

189
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,111
Burnout version 13

190
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:28,159
2.8 so it doesn't work with the old version

385
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,463

00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,095
And had pop tide night all over

390
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:11,263

391
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,823
Your neck story of a mystery

Demystified comes from

393
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,383
Adam Burke

394
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:19,967
We can all agree the only thing worse than a McChicken sandwich

395
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,783
Is McChicken sandwich at someone's already taking a bite out of

396
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,575
That was the situation

397
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:30,207
Placing an Indianapolis police officer who went to reheat McDonald's meal at the beginning of his shift

398
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,999
Only to find someone had

399
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,023
Pre nibbled at

400
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:39,167
I know I didn't need it to the officer who identified himself to local press as DJ

401
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:42,239
Officer DJ immediately went to the McDonald's

402
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,007
Quotes from Wednesday

403
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,287
The sandwich originated

404
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,567
And demanded to know which

405
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,103

Sandwich

408
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:52,991
A joint investigation was immediately launched by both the golden arches

409
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,527
And the boys in blue

410
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:59,647
Just in case anyone in Indianapolis was wondering why it was taking so long to find your stolen car

411
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,695
And or deliver your McMuffin

412
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:06,559
Eventually the perpetrator of the masticatory misdeed

413
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,839
Was brought to life

414
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:10,655
None other than officer DJ himself

415
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:14,751
The employee took a bite out of the sandwich upon starting his shift

416
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,519
Polly said

Instead he had previously been in the summer

419
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:25,503

420
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,295
DJ has been working on

421
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:30,623

00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:34,207
The Mystery of the missing TV remote

423
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:38,559
And the baffling riddle of who use up all the toilet paper

424
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:44,703
Marcus and investigation

425
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:49,055
To see what prankster took a bite out of his own sandwich only discover that it was he

426
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:49,823

Chairs were flipped

Furniture was in

439
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,511
Disarray

440
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,535
The couch cushions

441
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,583
And hemorrhaging phone

442
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,375
The refrigerator door was

443
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,423
Supposing it

444
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,191
Collapsed

445
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,215

Sea containers

447
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,775
I was so angry

448
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:21,055
Nina Ricci outside

449
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,079
Romeo

450
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,895
Her son was sitting at the computer when we left

451
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:25,663
And there was

452
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,247

453
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,527
In the refrigerator

454
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,575
Two and a half hours later

455
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:35,647
He was sitting there playing fortnite or whatever it is

456
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,695
The apartment was awarded

457
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:40,511
Containers even under the couch

458
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,303
However Young Romeo

459
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,071
Insisted

460
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,351
He has done nothing wrong

461
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,143
I had no idea what it happened

462
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,679
Feeling unjust

463
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,447
Accused

464
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:50,239
Romeo stormed out of the apartment

465
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,775
Slamming what was left of

466
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,823
Front door and saw + 11

467
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,615

Mission vehicles

470
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:03,295
When their neighbors saw the alligator coming out of the front door if they immediately called the news

471

Alligator hotline

472
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:09,951
Authorities are not sure why the mammoth's Predator broke through the russos door and ravage their apartment

473
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,231
But Romeo's Perrin

00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:48,896
You golfed with President Obama what was that like

576
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:56,064
That was one of the best round of golf ever played President Obama talked a lot of trash

577
00:24:56,832 --> 00:25:01,184
And this is Obama a chatty golfers in one of those serious golfers you just want to hit the ball and get down there

578
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:07,328
And I'll tell you this

579
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,864
It took all of our money

580
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:14,240
He's he's that good of a golfer it was Chris Paul

581
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,264
Myself

582
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,288
Michael Phelps

583
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,592
And our President Obama

584
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:21,408
President Obama doesn't hit the ball long off

585
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:24,480
About 220-230

586
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:26,272
Straight as an arrow

587
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:28,064
Right down the middle of the Fairway

588
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:30,112
And he ended up taking money

589
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:32,160
From all three of us

590
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,952
You said you took all of your money

591
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:36,000
You Chris Paul and Michael Phelps

592
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:40,352
Have a lot of money

593
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:58,784
Because

594
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,088
We didn't know if we could have

595
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,952
Amongst ourselves

596
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,792

Access to it

00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:55,008
But the health authority shut them down

00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:55,776
So they weren't able

640
00:27:56,032 --> 00:28:02,176

761
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:41,120
Does it appeal to our innate

762
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,912
Desire to get a good deal

763
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:47,008

That is true if you've ever worked in an office

771
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,352
I mean the stuff you would never eat

772
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:13,888
Even at home

773
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:14,912
You like oh my God that big

774
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:15,936
You've been out sitting out all day

And I was like oh baby

776
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:19,776
Don't usually you cut it in half

777
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,336

778
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:25,920

The possibly segmented.

784
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:39,232
The ideas like you can't eat a whole donut

785
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,000
That's terrible for you

786
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:41,536
Gain weight but if you cut the donut

With enough time between

789
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,424

790
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,752
Eating a whole donut

00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:57,152

Guacamole yeah

870
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:12,736
Avocados are getting more and more expensive and Millennials have already taken out second mortgages

871
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:14,528
Store for them as it is so

872
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,600
Restaurants that started making guacamole without avocado

This mock

00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:22,464
Guac is made often with the Mexican squash

875
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,744
Called calabacitas

876
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,768
Fun to say

877
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,304

878
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,864
Chef say the flavors almost identical

879
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:29,632
Princess in the text

880
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:32,704
Calabacitas tend to be thinner and running

881
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:35,520
Because he hasn't looked at a bowl of guacamole and thought

882
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:36,288

Of course only opened recently and clergy around the world too quick to condemn it describing it

902
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,464
Act of desecration

903
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,280
Some religious scholars believe the course has a place in the church

904
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,048
For example

905
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:30,816
Jesus

906
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:34,144
It would be a great golfer he never loses his ball in a water hazard

When I work out

914
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:45,408
Get anxious or fret

915
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,688
I get stains

916
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:47,968
Funky smell

917
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:48,992

Really good

923
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:56,160
When I

00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:57,696
Sweats

925
00:39:57,952 --> 00:40:04,096
Yes indeed scientists have created a new fabric that turns your body

926
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:05,888
Body odor into a fraction lemony a room

927
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:09,472
Instead of smelling like an old wet you you'll smell like somebody just

928
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,496
Drowned in lemonade

929
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:12,544

I like that idea actually

936
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,768
Someone who's constantly a conscious of

937
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:39,936
I think you know sometimes what other people say it like for example a car air freshener

938
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:42,240
Which I'd rather be

939
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:43,264

940
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:45,312
