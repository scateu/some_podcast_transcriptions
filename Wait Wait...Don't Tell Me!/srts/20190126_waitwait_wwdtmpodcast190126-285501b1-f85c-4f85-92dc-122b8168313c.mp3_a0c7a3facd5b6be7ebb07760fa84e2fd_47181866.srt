59
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,392
Suspiciously well-written

60
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,440
This is her

61
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,208
Prerogative

62
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:39,744
I will do it

63
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,512
When the shutdown

64
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:43,840
Is over that was the president of the United States getting into the

65
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:44,608
The speaker of the house is

66
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,400
In agreeing to postpone what

67
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,936
Until the shutdown is

68
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:48,704
Over

69
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:54,336
The State of the Union

70
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,128
After a week of back and forth

71
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,408
Between President Trump and Nancy

72
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:59,200
Pelosi about whether he'd be able to

73
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:01,248
To deliver the State of the Union during the shutdown

74
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:03,040
The presidents that only gave in

75
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,576
In a very civil

76
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:05,600
Tweet

77
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,136
But even spelled

78
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:07,904
The word

79
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,928
Prerogative

80
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,744
Correctly which means

81
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,328
One thing the president is going to be so angry when he finds out about this

82
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,936
At first he said he just make the speech

83
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:20,960
From someplace else

84
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:27,616
We couldn't find anywhere even that club that lets Louis CK do is that was like now

85
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,736
Jaguars

86
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,784
My favorite insult

87
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,552
Tweet

88
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:36,832
You sent out

89
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,112
Affinity Plus Easter eggs

90
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,136
Something like

91
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,672
Nancy Pelosi

92
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,208
Who I call Nancy

93
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,864
Yeah well it's like what happened and he just nasty that's his insulting nickname

94
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,984
We assume that the White House senior official who's in charge of insulting nicknames has been furloughed

95
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,104
One point

96
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,896
You seem like a battle of letterheads

97
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,992
From the desk of

98
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:07,552
Courtroom sketch from the toilet

99
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:15,232
About what fun is a sense of who speaker Pelosi is and how she'll do with them a lot of people read

100
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,000
Atmos Polo season

101
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:16,768
Letter

102
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:17,791
As a c

103
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:18,559
Suggestion

104
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,119
But Italian grandmother

105
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:21,887
Please do not

106
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,679
Suggest

107
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:27,007
It's like her saying oh maybe it's a good idea to change your dress

108
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,031
Before you go out

109
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:31,871
Which means change that or you'll be locked in your room until you're 25 I mean

110
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:34,943
Poker now

111
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:41,087
No....

112
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,647
Here is your next quote

113
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,695
I'm afraid it'll be on my gravestone

114
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,975
He lied for Trump

115
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:53,375
That is someone who could be right about what his gravestone will eventually say he's been all over the airwaves recently saying all

116
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,423
Kinds of things about his client the president

117
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,191
Who is it

118
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,727
I would say Michael Cohen

119
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00,543
Oh no Michael Cohen no longer represents

120
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:06,943
The president Rudy Giuliani yes very good

121
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,319
Make a good point about Michael Cohen there could someday be a graveyard filled with headstone saying I lied for Donald Trump

122
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,391
Last year apparently the

123
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,415
The president became

124
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,695
Satisfied

125
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,463
With

126
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,511
How is representatives were defending him

127
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,279
On TV

128
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,839
And since he couldn't do it himself he wanted somebody just

129
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:24,863
Is aggressive he want

130
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,631
Was Giuliani

131
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,167
When he couldn't get his first choice

132
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,191
Rabies

133
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:34,591
Before Giuliani

134
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,127
Potential Epitaph for himself

135
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,015
You should think about what else it might be given his career I mean here lies Rudy Giuliani

136
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:44,319
He let his wife know he was divorcing her in

137
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,343
In a press conference

138
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:48,927
Or here lies Rudy the only man who looked better

139
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,207
With a comb over

140
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,999
Xiaomi

141
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:54,559
Shirley's dad summer just right here lies

142
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:59,423
Message

143
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:05,823
Wow he said he was on all the

144
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:06,591
Cable news

145
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,615
Sunday shows of the office

146
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:08,895
But that

147
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,175
Quote from about his

148
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,223
Future based on him from this very bizarre interview

149
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,247
With Isaac chart

150
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,271
Winner of the

151
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,039
New Yorker

152
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:15,807
Who caught him

153
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,343
I said just before he was going to

154
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,111
Shower

155
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,391
And maybe it was because he

156
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:21,695
He was physically naked that he became emotionally naked

157
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:24,255
And he said all these crazy things like

158
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,535
For example

159
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,559
I've been through all the tape

160
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,351
And the interviewer said

161
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:35,007
Tape

162
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,311
And then he just changed his voice

163
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:41,663
Jason said new phone who dis

164
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,575
The shower an audible Subway announcement

165
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,343
For the most of

166
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,367
Obvious Child

167
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:53,951

168
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:54,975
Did you do it

169
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:55,999
The kid ghost

170
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,303
Did you do it and the

171
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:08,287
12 minute oil on the carpet like a shot

172
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,567
Here's what I look like

173
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,103
Soon-to-be

174
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:13,151
Most recent ex-wife

175

Students Nathan

176
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,967
Said something like

177
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:16,991
As his

178
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,527
The ex-wife and

179
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:19,295
The nurse

180
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:25,695
I'm really worried about him that was in their vows

181
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,399
All right very good eyesight your last

182
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,191
Quote is from a lawsuit that was

183
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:38,751
Filed quite recently in New Orleans Louisiana

184
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,031
Past present

185
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,127
Lots of faith

186
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,151
Enjoyment of life

187
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,943
Those were damages

188
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,967
Is that these people

189
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:48,991
Pulseira cos

To them

191
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,551
Because of what

00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:12,543
The New Orleans Saints to go into the Super Bowl basically

199
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:15,615
All Saints receiver was getting ready to catch a ball when a Rams

200
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:16,895
Defender appeared

201
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,687

Associate's fans are demanding

206
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:35,583
Variously that the NFL apologize or that it reverse the results of the game and let the Saints go to the Super Bowl

207
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,911
Or that they pay a massive penalties of the hurt people of New Orleans

208
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:45,823
Saints fans lawyer Rudolph Giuliani made a strong argument

209
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:48,383

210
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:59,135
Some people in New Orleans are extremely upset meanwhile people in La home of the Victorious Rams or saying wait a minute we have a football team

That number is to give the rest of the cast time to change

377
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,087

Stepped into The Fray

380
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:30,047
I guess it seemed to show thousands of times and rehearsal

381
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,143
Roller skating in the zoo

It wasn't the most graceful version of that number I've seen said quickly

386
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:48,735
At Arrowhead more hockey stops fist-bumps

Spray than usual but the crowd loved it

389
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,343
They got a standing ovation

390
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:57,439
I kept that detail from the regular performers. I figured they'd been through it

391
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:04,863
Zamboni driver and his son step into Ursula and Ariel to Carol 25

Film history

407
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,439

Getting the monkeys

423
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,639
But his response

424
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,271
It hurts so much

425
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,295
That they inserted

426
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,319
The line it's the movie

427
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:57,599
So

00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:00,415
In a stealth operation worthy of done

429
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,951

450
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,871
A true American Hero

451
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,663

The Krush Groove

The people's groins off the surgery

465
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,799
Until the bleeding stop

466
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,103
Which can mean he's standing there

467
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,383
Crushing on your groin

By his own estimate

472
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:37,183
He's consensually crushed more than 10,000 growing

473
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,487
And he's so good

474
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,047
That he is one

I'm holding someone's growing for 20 minutes they tend to remember me and nobody else has he

477
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,263
Presumably with a straight face

478
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:55,359
He might sound like a man who's watch The Sopranos a bit too enthusiastic

479
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:57,919
Ugly but he's okay henchman without technique

480
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:00,223
Pete's hotdogs groin crushing down to an art

481

The save lives off of surgery but he's a gentleman to

484
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,999
How do you tell one patient

486
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,303
To hold your groin

487
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:18,399

00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,103
You'll never forget my name

00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:27,871
Oh my face

493
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:36,063
Sadly

494
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:38,367
One of these three stories of heroism is

495
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:41,951
True was it from Adam is Zamboni driver and his son

496
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:42,975

00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:21,792
Charles Tillman known as peanut was one of the greatest defensive backs ever to play football

So I can feel like making up a bunch

568
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:30,560
I hate to ask but what kind of sex

569
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,608
This lady was

570
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,680
I don't know what exactly I said to the lady I just met

571
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:44,128
Get out of my way I love it

572
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:46,432
Among other extraordinary cheat

573
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:53,088
You played against Tom Brady and you've intercepted that I think twice in one game

574
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,536
Search like a legend about greatest football

575
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,584
Quarterback has ever lived it yet mean

576
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,400
Did you guys find that like intimidating or like

577
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,168
Inspiring

578
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:07,936
Like I'm going to go out and

579
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:08,704

Imma take option number 2 imma go on

581
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,056
I think he is

582
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:14,848
This is not the greatest

583
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:17,664
Play the game play I don't think anyone

584
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:18,944
Intimidated

585
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:22,016
I mean there's a second-year player that when I was damn your beetle

586
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,808
So you don't think players

587
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:29,696
If he's the greatest will I want to go again

588
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:32,000
We heard that you

589
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:34,048
You play the game when your wife was a

590
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,072
Extremely pregnant

591
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:38,656
And she might have gone into labor at any moment

592
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:39,936
Yasso

593
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:44,544
This was 2012 my wife was pregnant

594
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,824
Review with Lauren phone

595
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:50,688
Lortone back to the question hey what you going to do if your wife goes into labor before the game

596
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,528
Laughing well I'm missing the game I'm going to go see my daughter be born

597
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,488
They're their there they're just athletes but I felt like I was attacked because I made

598
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:04,256
Smart choice

599
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,280
The Family Choice

600
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:09,376
I want to go be with my family and watched the birth of my daughter

601
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:12,704
I know women is it hard people think

602
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,312
You put in a baby comes out your vajayjay

603
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,616
The lot of complications that can go wrong

604
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:26,272
All of a sudden I'm really interested in what you told those reporters about sex

605
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:30,112
Nickname for that

606
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,240
After the Glitter

607
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,008
To the game

608
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:48,544
My wife now we go home

609
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:51,616
Changes and everything gets her bags

610
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:54,176
And we go straight to the hospital at like

611
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:55,456
Midnight

612
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,480
12:30

613
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,760

00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,904
Come On Eileen

616
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:13,888
To talk to you but we have asked you to play a game this time we're calling

617
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:16,704
Now that's what I call an offensive line

618
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:23,104
You know a lot about defense you're very good at that but what do you know about defensive lines that is

619
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,176
Things people said or did that offended people

620
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:31,296
I'm going to ask you about three offensive lines get two questions right you want a price one of our listeners

621
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,832
Bill who is Charles Tillman playing

622
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:34,112
Diane Schultz

623
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,160
Alright you ready to do this

624
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:38,208
Alright big also

625
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:45,120
Is presumably listening at home

626
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:50,240
Subaru

627
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:53,824
Charles during the early days of

628
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,592
Spaceflight

629
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:57,920
TV stations with awesome often broadcast the Ashton

630
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:58,688
Do not slide

631
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:01,760
And that's it was worried that one of their astronauts Improv

632
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:02,528
Particular

633
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:03,808
Would swear

634
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,368
When the whole world was watching him

635
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:08,928
In order to prevent that NASA did

636
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:09,696
What

637
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:12,256
Hey they told him that for safety sake

638
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:14,048
He had to wear a gag

639
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:15,840
So he wouldn't quote inhale

640
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:17,632
Space

641
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:24,288
Be through a careful psyops campaign they convinced them that the most offencive swear he could possibly say

642
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,312
Was

643
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,080
Gadzooks

644
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,152
Or see they hypnotize them

645
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:29,920
So he would

646
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:30,944
Hum

647
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,968
Anytime

648
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:32,736
He wanted

649
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:33,760
To swear

650
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:34,784
Amazon

651
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:42,464
I can see you're right that's what they did wow

652
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,256
I've never said

653
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,792
What astronaut they did it

654
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:47,328
2 but it is absolutely true

655
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,608
That astronaut

656
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,632
Conrad

657
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,448
While he was on the moon when I get polymer

658
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,728
Weirdly hum

659
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:56,800

00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,336
