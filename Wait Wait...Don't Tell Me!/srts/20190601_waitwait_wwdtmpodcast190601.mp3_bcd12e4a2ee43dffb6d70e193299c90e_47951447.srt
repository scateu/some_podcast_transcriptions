The triumph

18
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:33,280
Of the bill

19
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,584

Then here is your host is he Chase Bank Auditorium in Chicago

00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:48,384
Chucky

22
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,456
Agree on these days it seems to be superheroes

23
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:52,480
They're everywhere

24
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:54,272
The movie theaters on TV

25
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:56,832
But surprisingly rare in real life

26
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:58,624
That's because supersuit

27
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,928
What's are extremely restricting

28
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:01,952
Where it matters

29
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:09,120
All superhero show today although not all heroes wear capes for example

30
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,656
Black panther didn't

31
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:15,008
And that was because oscar-winning costume designer Ruth e Carter decided he

32
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,824
Shouldn't we spoke to Ms Carter rice

33
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,128
After he won her Oscar in February

34
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,944
And she was still pretty excited about it

35
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:25,504
First of all

36
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,808
Congratulations on the Oscar win

37
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,856
Have you gotten over to you still

38
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:31,136
Still sort of a buzz you walk around

39
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:37,536
Holding it all day

40
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,912
But you were nominated

41
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,448
So were you

42
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,496
Surprised when you finally won or you were like it

43
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,264
My turn

44
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,312
It's been 21 years since

45
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,080
The last night

46
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,104
Really

47
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,640
Yeah I was like man

48
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:53,920
Going to take 21

49
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,712
1 years each time I better grab

50
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,808
You're the First costume designer weave Everett

51
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,088
I just wanted to go over

52
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:01,856
Some basic stuff

53
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,904
So you're the costume designer

54
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,208
Do you ever do you ever have to deal with like

55
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:06,976
Factory girls like you

56
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,120
I guess you deal with that cuz

57
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,400
He goes on

58
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,168
Level

59
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,192
Sometimes

60
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:18,752
They say you know I can't wear that color

61
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:19,776
Are you now or

62
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:23,616
But because we're discovering a character we are both

63
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:25,664
Kind of contributing to the conversation

64
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:27,968
Right just say yes

65
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:28,992
So maybe your

66
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,272
Character has a bigger butt

67
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,600
To look at the fun stuff

68
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,624
Which is a movie like black

69
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,416
Comicbookmovie

70
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,184

Country

73
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:41,536
You are the most qualified person

74
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,072
Ask about something

75
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,096
That I've always thought

76
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,120
The great problem

77
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:48,448
Is that unlike in comic books

78
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,216
People wearing

79
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,240
Superhero suits

80
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,008
In real life

81
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:51,776
Essentially

82
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:52,544
Look dumb

83
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,872
Yeah because they don't realize it's their whole process

84
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:56,640
To make a mess

85
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,176
You just don't go to

So it up

89
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,320
So how do you make it so like the Black Panther when he's in his

90
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:05,344
Superhero suit run

91
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,392

292
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,839

You know how I talk about Peyton Manning

385
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,767
You know I thought about Peyton Manning for 5 days

386

Board 5

387
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,215

Among other extraordinary

390
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:15,199
Who played against Tom Brady and you've intercepted that I think twice in one game

391

Looks like a legend about greatest football

392
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,439
Quarterback has ever lived it yet mean

393
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:28,255
Did you guys find that like intimidating or like

394
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,023
Inspiring

395
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,559

The greatest if not the greatest

399
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,519
Play the game play I don't think anyone

400
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:44,383

401
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:50,783
Don't think players are in

402
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:55,647
We heard that you played a game when your wife

403
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:56,927
Extremely

404
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:00,511
She might have gone into labor at any moment

405
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:01,791
Yasso

406
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:04,351
Fifth wheels 2012

00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,679
McLaren phone

409
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:12,543
Laurence Holmes ask me the question hey what you going to do if your wife goes into labor before the game

410
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:16,895
Blossom well I'm missing a game I'm going to go see my daughter be born

411
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:20,223
About how they're not family man

412
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:23,807
They're their there they're just athletes but I felt like I was

413
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,343
Call the tax because I made

414
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,111
The smart choice

415
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,135
The Family Choice

416
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:31,231
The more important choice to go be with my family and watch the 4th of my daughter

417
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,791
So after they literally asked

418
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,559
To the game

419
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,095
My wife now we go home

420
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:39,167
Changes and everything gets her bags

421
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:41,727
And we go straight to the hospital at like

422
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,007
Midnight

423
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,287

424
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,823

Talk to you but we have asked you to play a game this time we're calling

428
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:02,207
Now that's what I call a notch

429
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,231
Offensive line

430
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:09,631
You know a lot about defense you were very good at that but what do you know about offensive line that is

431
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:12,703
Things people said or did that offended people

432
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:15,519
We're going to ask you about three offensive lines get to

433
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:17,823

Subaru

440
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:41,119
Charles during the early days of space flight

441
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,399
TV station

442
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,447
Kitchens with Austin often broadcast the action

443
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:46,495
Knots live and NASA was worried that

444
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,031
What are there astronauts in

445
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,055
Particular

446
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,335
Would swear

447
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,895
When the whole world was watching him

448
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:55,455
In order to prevent that NASA did

449
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,223
What

450
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:58,783
Hey they told him that for safety sake

451
00:17:59,039 --> 00:17:59,807
He had to wear

452
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:00,575
Gag

453
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,367
So he wouldn't quote inhale

454
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,159
Space

455
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:08,511
Be through a careful psyops campaign they convinced them that the most offencive

456
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:11,071
Just where he could possibly say

457
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,607
Was gadzooks

458
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,679
Or see they hypnotize them

459
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,447
So he would

460
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,471
Um

461
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,495
Anytime

462
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,263
He wanted

463
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,287
To swear

464
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,311
Amazon

465
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:29,247
Optionc you're right that's what they did wow

466
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,527
They've never said

467
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,855
What astronaut they did it too but it is absolutely true

468
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,391
That astronaut

469
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,159

00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:38,975
While he was on the moon I'm going to get polymer

00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:43,327
All the time so we have our suspicions

473
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:48,447
BBC Radio goes to Great Lengths to keep its listeners

474
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,471

475
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:50,239
Content

476
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,007

477
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:54,079
Put a decade-long ban on what

478
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,615
Song because they thought it was offensive

479
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:58,175

00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:10,975
It was the

488
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:17,119
They said this is back in the sixties the song came out they did not plan for 10 years cuz they thought it was quote

Last question

At one time the world championship wrestling organization

Time between me entering the door and walking even 10 steps

638
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:38,560
Before

00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:40,864
My bra and anything would come off

00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:43,168
And he wanted to catch me fully dressed

Unconfessed

800

He didn't

801
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:17,408
Start Alex wanting to be a writer

802
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:22,784
When I was in high school I thought I was going to be an actor

803
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:28,160
Cool plays in community theater and then I went to college and studied acting and it wasn't until

804
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:31,232
Really the day after I graduated from college

805
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,256
That I

806
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:34,304
For the first time rope for pleasure

807
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,840
Pembroke dialogue

808
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:40,704
And I felt a confidence that I've never felt with acting and I was a pretty cocky actor

809
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:41,728
Really

810
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:43,008
What did you write

811
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:43,776
That day

812
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:45,568
I started writing A Few Good Men

813
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,896
Wow yeah my older sister

814
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:49,920
Debbie

815
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,968
I had just graduated from Law School

816
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,552
And she went into the Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps Jag Corps

817
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,320
And she

818
00:32:56,576 --> 00:33:00,416
He told me a story about this trip she was about to take the Guantanamo Bay

819
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:03,488
And if you can't be inspiration for A Few Good Men

820
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:06,816
I moved to New York after college and I got a job

821
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:08,864
Bartending in Broadway theaters

822
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:10,656
And I wrote

823
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:17,056
A Few Good Men on cocktail napkins during the first active look how's your fault

824
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:22,432
If you work during the walk-in any working during intermission but you're not doing anything during the First Act

825
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:26,016
And there was an unlimited supply of cocktail napkins

826
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:29,856
I just envisioning like this cocktail napkin and on it is

827
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:31,648
You can't handle when you turn it over

828
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:34,464
The truth

829
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:36,768
So of course no

830
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:39,328
For your for your dialogue does it just

831
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,608
Coming to your brain

832
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,936
Can you quickly write it down like you hear the back and forth

833
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:46,240
Or is it something that you actually have to

834
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:49,824
Conjure on a good day I do but I don't have many

835
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:51,872
Icon start

836
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:55,712
Pacing around and trying to get into an argument with myself

837
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:58,528
And if I can get a good one going

838
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:00,064
Then it starts going down on paper

839
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,088
Make out loud

840
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,624
Do you do this

841
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,184
What are the questions on

842
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,744
Wait wait don't tell me was about you one time

843
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,024
There was just

844
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,328
Where you were working on dialogue I guess it

845
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,096
To your house

846
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,376
And then you

847
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,912
Accidentally hit your

848
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:18,496
Head on my God broke my nose riding

849
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:25,408
Is writing an early episode of The Newsroom

850
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:31,296
And I got up in the middle of the night cuz I had an idea just just for a sort of a classic

851
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:37,696
Comic beat where Jeff Daniels was going to lunch at one of the staffers and two staffers were going to hold him back in one of these

852
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:43,840
I was really excited about it was going well

853
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:47,168
And I happen to be kind of acting into the mirror

854
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:51,776
And I lunch. Jeff Daniels would but there was no one there to hold me back

855
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:56,384
So I can smash right into the bathroom

856
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:00,480
Did you go to the emergency emergency room and if so what did you tell them

857
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:07,392
I called that friend that you have that you can call it midnight when you broken your nose right

858
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:14,048
And she came over and she took one look at me and said you would have to go to the emergency room

859
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:20,704
And I said okay but I think it's pretty good well

860
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,752
Aaron Sorkin it is an honor

861
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:23,520

862
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:24,288

863
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,104

Grown on the great Wing the farmers of the American Midwest

The voice of anyone they might like from our show Bill who is Aaron Sorkin playing for

00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:51,680
John chaplain of St Petersburg

874

Florida all right you ready to play St Petersburg here we go here we go

875
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:58,848
Wings have been the at the center

876
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:01,664
Have some surprising legal battles

877
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,200
Including which of these a

878
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:06,528
A Man convicted of assault with a deadly weapon was released

879
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:09,344
After judge has agreed a hot wing was not deadly

880
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:11,904
Be alot in Colorado that the

881
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:12,672
Cleared from hence

882
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:13,952
Fourth chicken wings

883
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:14,976
Be considered

884
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,000
Sandwiches

885
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:18,560
Or see a lawsuit

886
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:22,656
Into restaurants in El Paso Texas over who owned their common name

887
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:23,424
The Lord

888
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,192
Of the Wind

889
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:30,080
The first to A & B are certainly the funniest but the answers got to be sick

890
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:32,128
I'm somewhat disappointed

891
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,176
The last one funny

892
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:41,088
But because the real one was be actually

893
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:43,648
Colorado there's a law that certain kind of bars

894
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:45,696
Can't sell liquor unless they also have

895
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:46,464
Sandwiches

896
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:50,048
And so on

897
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,096
Chicken wings are sandwiches

898
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,120
In Colorado

899
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:58,752
Next bus

00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:01,568

00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,848
Show their love

00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,640
For the food as in which of these

903
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:07,456

Be a man in Tennessee created the first ever Wing Pit

You jump in and bouncing

908
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:17,440
The chicken wings

909
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:18,976
Orsi

910
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,768
A Virginia man used

911
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:23,584
2 cups of wing sauce to go out in wink face

912
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,608
Last Halloween

913
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:27,936
Okay

914
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:29,472
I'm going to say

915
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:30,496
USIC

916
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,128
It wasn't fact

917
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:37,152
Hey you know you

918
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:39,456
Of course somebody would make

919
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:46,112
Jewelry I don't care you don't even as I was saying it

920
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:53,280
Okay I'm going to give the third one everything I've got all right

921
00:37:54,304 --> 00:38:00,448
What do you mean

922
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:08,128
Well that's it then you know the Giants been cashed but he's going to try one more time

923
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:15,552
This is brutal

924
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:21,184
In 2014 Philadelphia's 22nd annual buffalo wing eating contest was one

925
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:23,488
By 125 lb male

926
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:24,256
Skylar

927
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,536
Record shattering

928
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:26,304
300

929
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:27,840
Free wings

930
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:29,120
But the question is

931
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:31,680
How did she celebrate her win

932
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:34,496
The following day did she a

933
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:39,360
Drive to the Des Moines Blue Ribbon Bacon Festival in need 5 lb of bacon in 3 minutes

934
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:40,384
B

935
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,432
Celebrate with a free meal at IHOP with

936
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:44,736
What you want by eating 59 pancakes in one

937
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:46,016
Horsey

938
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:49,600
To go to Jethro's BBQ in Iowa and eat a sandwich

939
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:50,368
Pork tenderloin

940
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,136
Chicken tenders

941
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,160
White cheddar

942
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:54,464
Fried cheese curds Applewood smoked bacon

943
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:56,256
Add a pound of french fries in just

944
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,280
15 minutes

945
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,560
Which of those did she do

946
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:04,704
I honestly have no idea how someone who only weighs 125 lb

947
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,984
8 / 300

948
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,776
