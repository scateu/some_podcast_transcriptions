00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:22,271
I love it it's a vintage accessory

198
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:25,087
It's like Instagram but just the comments

00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:32,767

Expect of a model which

207
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,431
Just totally blank of any game

208
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,991

Mo Congressman Devin Nunes

229
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,111
This has filed a

230
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,903
250 million dollar lawsuit

231
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,183
Against Twitter

232
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:08,255
And against one account in particular for defending him

233
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,303
Star supposedly coming from his what

234
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:11,839
Cow

235
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:18,239
How is a Twitter account

Congressman's Wrath

237
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,543
With tweets like

238
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:24,895
Devin is utterly worthless

239
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,687
Devon is Wei Wei

240
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,711

To prison

244
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,391
Because of this lawsuit

245
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,951
This account which had a couple of hundred followers

246
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,767
Now has more than Devin Nunes

247
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:47,167
Himself it has over 600000 followers it's a social media star

248
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:47,935
It's kind of a

00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,215
Kim Kardashian

250
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:53,823
Run for Congress now

251
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,359
It's possible I guess

252
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,639
What's amazing is

253
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,431
Nobody knew

254
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,199
About these

255
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:02,015
Obscure Twitter accounts that were dragging Devin Nunes

256
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,319
Until he filed sitting congressman

257
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,343

Assertive saying yeah and then they shove me in the locker like lifting he climbs in and then they

266
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,687
Prospectus wasn't real cow

267

That's a good question did he even know

268
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:38,879

Begin doing what

789
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:54,528
At age 33 on the people tend to do this but now we know

790
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:56,064
Starts at age 33

791
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:58,368
Weird because that's also the date

792
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:01,696
Jesus year Jesus died

793
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:02,464
Coincidence

794
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:04,512
33

795
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,048
People start

796
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:09,376
Like really trying to identify their life

797
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:17,568
To the scorn of NPR listeners

798
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:21,152
Come on now

799
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:24,480
People are like a wrecked cars for 8 years

800
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,552
It's been great and they celebrate no

801

I get a title

806
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:47,264
I don't know

807
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,848
When you haven't when you have a kid

808
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:51,616
What are you

809
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:54,176
A parent right and so therefore

810
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,456
What do you start Maybe

811
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,224
To turn into

812
00:33:56,736 --> 00:34:02,880
Europe

813
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,256
Now we know exactly what it happen

814
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:10,560
When you turn 33 or thereabouts which

815
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:11,584
Is Wyatt your 30s

816
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,608
3rd birthday party

817
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,168
You said to yourself wow by this age

818
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:16,192
My cousin was a docker

819
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:20,800
Scientist officer

820
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:23,360
This week that you're not an adult until you're Thirty

821
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:24,640
So that means

822
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,456
3 years

823
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:28,736
Of course

824
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:31,552
If you free sample turn into your mother right well

825
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:32,320
She turned

826
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:33,088
Into her mother

827
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,880
And her mother turned into her mother

828
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:36,416
So basically

829
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,952
Everybody ends up being

830
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:39,488
Exactly like our very first

831
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,256
Human ancestor

832
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:41,792
New Scientist

833
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:43,072
Is defined as the first

834
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:43,840
8

835
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,376
And primordial Africa

836
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:47,680
Never to stop doing what I was doing and said he was off

837
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:48,960
Oh my God I'm turning into my mom

838
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:54,080
33 is of course as you said the age

839
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:55,104
The Jesus was when he

840
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,128
He was crucified he didn't

841
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:58,944
Quite turn into his dad but he did decide to go live with

842
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:13,792
Beguine the

843
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,840
Presence of men

844
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:18,656
Can have a negative impact on women in the workplace

845
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:19,680
Need to tell you that

846
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:23,008
But a new study shows that women may have a lower income in their lifetime

847
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:25,056
If they spend an extended

848
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,336
Good. Of time

849
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,360

852
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:36,832

00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:43,232
Swollen uterus and are exactly what's coming up

854
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:47,328

Who had a male fraternal twin

856
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:51,168
Ie

857
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,216
They were they were rejected together

858
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:56,544
Tend to have lower career incomes than those

859
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,568
Female twins

860
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:58,336
Who had

861
00:35:58,592 --> 00:35:59,360
A female

862
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:01,408
Well

863
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:02,688
This

864
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:04,992
It seems to have to do with the amount of testosterone

865
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,016
Family Birthing

866
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:13,696
No man will just suck the life right now

00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:16,512
Start very early cuz you know mom's having a sonogram at

868
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:19,328
When she hears the heartbeat and all the sudden another heartbeat interrupts and says

869
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:20,352
Actually it's thumbs up

870
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:24,960
Are the amniotic

871
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:31,104
Explaining that the umbilical cord is really a way for them to get the internet in there

872
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:36,992
Mo Andrew Yang is yet another Democrat running for

873
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:38,784
The president you probably never heard of him

874
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,112
But he started making headlines this week when he staked his claim as the

875
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,136
The only Canada

876
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:44,416
Get to come out firmly

877
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,696
And strongly against

878
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:47,232
What

879
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:50,048
This is going to help him make the cut but he's

880
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:51,072
Is against Circle

881
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:53,120
That's right

882
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,984
Cutting Edge,

883
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:02,080
Healthcare is

884
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:05,408
Going to once again be a top issue in 2020

885
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,968
So there's one candidate out there was letting you know

886
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:09,504
That if you like your foreskin

887
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,528
You can keep it

888
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:18,208
Andrew Yang who is an entrepreneur and otherwise seemingly unqualified person

889
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:21,024
He came out this week and said circumcision is not in

890
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:21,792
Necessary

891
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:23,328
So what we don't yet know yet

892
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:25,888
Change policy in the budget overall we do know there are some cuts

893
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:26,656
Simply want me

894
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:30,496
No I mean

895
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:31,264
Maybe it's

896
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:32,288
Because
