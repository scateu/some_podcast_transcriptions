142
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:24,511
A reading about

161
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,615
Sitting next to him during the announcer

162
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,663

The senate race

167
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,231
And then

168
00:07:59,487 --> 00:07:59,999
Decided to run

169
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:04,095
Kind of like if you ask out

170
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,631
Prom queen

171
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:06,911

And you get turned down

173
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,215
And then

174
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,495
Decide to then run

175
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,519
For president

176
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:15,615
The prom queen

177
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,383
Almost

178
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,919

179
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:21,503
The prom queen only Turns You Down by

180
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:27,391

181
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,183
I'm not sure is that important to you

182
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,487
Yes

183
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:37,887
I'm when I'm with you it's hot

184
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:41,727
Senate race I mean that you seems very intelligent like Vaughn

185
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,519
When I saw pictures of him and his

186
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:44,543
Sleeves rolled up into

187
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:51,199
Yeah maybe literally was the last Democrat in America to say that yes he's running for

188
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:53,503
President and get none the less as soon as he did it

189
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:57,599
Everybody is all the people on cable news can talk about that or this or that

190
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:01,183
It makes sense because you really are the Democratic candidates

191
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:01,951
You smart

192

30 years ago this very much

196
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:29,599
What did mr. berners-lee invented didn't quite turn out to be the bun.

197
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,135
Times that he hoped it would be

198
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:39,839
Internet very good and

199
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:46,239
March of 1989 we had a primitive internet use only by scientists but Timber

200
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,103
You look at a page of information on your computer

00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,639

202
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:55,199
The interest you and it takes you to another computer

203
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:57,247

Access to an Internet connect

208
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,559

00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,383
Being released under the name universe

310
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,687
The scientist Harold at Eunice

311
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:51,295
The first birth control pill that can reduce your. To literally just one minute

312
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:54,879
During the press conference

313
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,439
A female reporter asked if the one minute

314
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,743
The. Fell on a specific day of the year

315
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,791
A spokesman responded

316
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:04,095
Well with you the moon your period does

317
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,375
Liquor everyday

318
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,399
But just for a minute

319
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:11,007
At this point another female reporter raised her hand

320
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,287
So

321
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,591
You mean we will get her. Every single day

322
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:17,151
There be no days of the year we don't have her.

323
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,687
That's correct

324
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,247
But it's only for a quick minute

325
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,015
In a minute

326
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,039
60 second

327
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,599
A female reporter photo

328
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,903
We know how long a minute is thank you

329
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:34,303
Is there any predictability with Luna Moon as to what minute of the

330
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,327
The day your. Might

331
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,095
Strike

332
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,911
One of the men from the all-male team of science

333
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:39,935
Step forward again

334
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:42,495
No there isn't currently any predictability

335
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,775
Leah can come at any time

336
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,871
Another female reporter pose a question

337
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,663
Is there any reduction

338
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,199
Symptoms of PMS

339
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:51,967
To the universe

340
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:55,039
No there is not the male leader of the research team

341
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:55,807
Responded

342
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:58,367
And truthfully some of the symptoms might be way worse

343
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:02,975
Your period is only a minute a day so we think it balances out

344
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:07,839
At this point there was a murmur among the female reporters in the room and the spokesman

345
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,607
Step forward again

346
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:15,519

By all accounts the wedding of Irene O'Brien and Mel McClain Was A Beautiful Affair

355
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,143
They danced they drank and they promised

Starting right after

358
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:49,567
After they got back from traveling the world without each other

00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,871
Han Solo honeymoon

360
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:55,199

Today to convince us something is actually a thing

362
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:01,087
The New York Times wedding section reported this week

363
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,879
That the new trend of

364
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,159

Where couples take their honeymoons

367
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,815
Apart from each other

368
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:16,191
In the case of O'Brien and McClain they say they realize they didn't really have the same trip in mind

369
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:21,311
He wanted to get drunk in France with his buddies and watch the Northern Ireland soccer

370
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,079
Routine

371
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,103
She wanted

372
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,895
To not do that

373
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:30,527
So she went and visited Niagara Falls

374
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:35,391
Other couples profiled about this very real thing what you know is a real thing

375

00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,256
Well I don't know how long is the drive

535
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:15,680
Is it true that you were the first person to be allowed to skateboard in the winter

536
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:17,472
I wouldn't say it loud

537
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,800
Oh yeah what happened

538
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:23,104
Well I saw I was there

539
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,896
During the previous administration

540
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:26,176
They had a bunch of

541
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:29,248
Prominent or celebritytypes fathers

542
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:35,136
Coming in they were talking to a lot of different charities around DC converter is it at the White House

543
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,672
4 in the morning

544
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:40,256
And I brought my skateboard because every time I go somewhere without my skateboard

545
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,280
People ask me that

546
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:46,144
It's always going to get caught there especially with the president

547
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:49,728
And suddenly I found myself in the hallway

548
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:53,824
Unattended

549
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,432

551
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:00,992

552
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,016
I said hey

00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:02,784

00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,904
And I skated and

556
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,184

557
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:15,584
I didn't got a date kind of ignored it

558
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:16,864
Really yeah

559
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:21,984
I think they just didn't really didn't want to say that I ever had permission they didn't want to acknowledge that I did it

560
