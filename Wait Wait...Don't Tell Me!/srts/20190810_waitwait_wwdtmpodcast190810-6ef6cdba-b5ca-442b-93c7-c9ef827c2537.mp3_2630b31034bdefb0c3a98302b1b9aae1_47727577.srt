His parents were both shocked and elated

455
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:55,711
Because he had never shown any interest in creative writing

456
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:56,735

Copy of the video game in the accompanying manual in the family

470
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:27,199
And decided it was time to write it all down

471
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:32,319
Even more shocking the award committee Miss some very telling clue

472
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,879
Such as the stories mentioning of

473
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,415

Samuel claims he didn't know the story had to be original and the rules of the contest

480
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,199
Never said

481
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,479
You could not plagiarize

482
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:06,623
The contest organizers admit this is true because they just assumed nobody would do that

483
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:14,559

Now the game where we force people we admire to do something they may not like

513
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:57,215
It is a curse for an actor to be associated with one iconic role the people assume that's all he can do in that sadly my

514
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:58,495
Might be true for Henry Winkler

515
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:02,079
His performance is acting teacher Gene Cousineau on HBO

516
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,615
Show Barry is so amazing

517
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:06,943

The Fonz 40 years ago and hasn't gotten to the point

524
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,456
Given the passage of time that more people

525
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:44,320
Recognize you for a gene on the show Barry than for the cause

526
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:47,904
It is people yell out bearing

527
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,976

528
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,512

It is still amazing

537
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,160
But people still do

538
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:23,488
Refer to you as the van deventer

539
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:34,752

They can pay in cash on time

547
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:54,464
And I can teach a young man who came into my class

548
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:58,304
Who has kind of like another job

549
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,864

Write to me

553
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,592
What was amazing about the show is

554
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,384
Even given that outlandish

555
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,152
Premise that he's a

556
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,432
An assassin who decides who won

557
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:16,224
How to be an actor in friends an acting class

558
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,016
It really quite moving

559
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,320
Because you say

560
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:22,624
She does need a father and your character

561
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,904
Kind of provides.

562
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,024
Know that he was as big as much as he

563
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,352
And and then

564
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,376
The two men

565
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:35,424

566
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,704

I started to

568
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,520
To to bring Gina live

569
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:43,104
You could also have a heart

570
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,688
So then they combine the two

571
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:54,368
Should my body and lower down

572
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,392
Is more of a jerk

573
00:23:57,696 --> 00:24:00,000
But you're Henry Winkler you can't play a complete

574
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:01,024
Jerk is not in you

575
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:05,632
Well you know what I I didn't know that was true but it seems to be

576
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:12,544
I got to ask you because of the so much of this is said in this acting class did you ever take an acting class and was it like this

577
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,848
You know what I had

578
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:15,616
14

579
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,664
Teachers in college

580
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,712
In graduate school and drama

581
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:23,040
That's cool I did research and I came across

582
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:26,368
Where there was a teacher here in LA

583
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,160
Literally

584
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:31,744
Barely made enough

585
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,768
To take his class

586
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:35,072
Made them by

587
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,096
Is art

588
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:39,680
Give me like he would paint pictures or whatever

589
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:42,240
And then sell it to his students

590
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:44,288
And I I thought

591
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:46,592
Yes this says everything I need

592
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:47,360
To know

593
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,640
About this teacher

594
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:52,480

595
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:53,504
Ben proulx

596
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,576
You know what I actually never thought of that cuz

597
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:57,600
When you

598
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,880

602
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:05,280
I'm making that scene

603
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:06,304
Perfect

604
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:07,584
And all the

605
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:12,192
You put all these details together and I watch along with everybody else

606
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:14,496
I don't see it until it's on the air

607
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:19,872
Will. I just love going to work

608

628
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:22,336
On the same plane

629
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:24,640

Ask you do you think that's an accurate description

633
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:40,512

Cindy Metcalf of Dallas Texas

653
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,664
Alright Henry ready to do this

654
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:34,016
We've learned some interesting things about stars

655
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,296
Since we started venturing in

656
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:37,344
Into space including which of these a

657
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,136
Stars can get bored

658
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,160
B

659
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:40,928
Stars

660
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:41,952
Smell like burnt

661
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:42,720
Steak

662
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,512
Or sea stars

663
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:45,792
They're just like us

664
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,352
Wow

665
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:52,704
We have to go with stars are just like us

666
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,008
Very normal person

667
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,104
Actually Stars they're just like us is a future in Us magazine

668
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:01,408
The real answer was star smell like burn

669
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:05,504
We didn't notice it was literally true until astronauts

670
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:06,528
Went out in space

671
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:07,296
Space suits

672
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:09,344
And came back and sniff their space suits

673
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,368
Felt weirdly hungry

674
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:13,184
Because it turns out that stars give off

675
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,720
The number of chemicals one of which

676
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,512
Smells like burnt steak

677
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,792
True

678
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:18,816
Wow

679
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:23,680
Subspace

680
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,728

Women classified tens of thousands of

683

686
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:41,600
One day the head of the observatory got frustrated with the staff and said my Scottish made could do better

687
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:42,624
He hired her

688
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:43,648
She did

689
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:48,256
Be she was a theater critic who said people are boring I want to watch something else

690
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:52,096
Or see nobody knows you just showed up one day wearing

691
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:52,864
