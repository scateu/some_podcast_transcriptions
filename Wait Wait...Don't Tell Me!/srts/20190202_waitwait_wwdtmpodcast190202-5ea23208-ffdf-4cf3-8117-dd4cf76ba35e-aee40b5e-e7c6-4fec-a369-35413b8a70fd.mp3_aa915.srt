I wasn't I wasn't really following the news for the last week which I'm just now realizing

95
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,127
Was maybe not a good idea

96
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:38,015
But it was until I was sitting on the airplane and the pilot over the intercom was like

97
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:43,135
Now that you're on the desk flight blah blah to Chicago I don't know why anyone would want to go there

98
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:46,463
Everyone started laughing but I was like

99
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:50,559
Now I understand

100
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:55,167
Cuz when I got out of the airport I was like oh my God slapping slapping me

101
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:57,983
But it said it was just the weather

102
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:06,943
Is a terrible idea why are we doing this

103
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,783
Is this a prank so but it was it wasn't it was just

104
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,855

00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,407
About running for president

130
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:12,223
Then would ever vote for him for president

131
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,295
But you know his pitch

132
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,063
Makes sense

133
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:18,879

When I log into Netflix

There's all these things, so who's watching it says Tom or Rita and my wife are the boys you know

174
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:44,543

Dr. Emmett Olivia local orthodontist with ambivalence

380
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:42,143
I'm happy about this latest wave of orthodontic enthusiasm but I can't help feeling this could lead to

381
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:45,215
Two more kids who don't need braces actually getting braces

382
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:48,543
Because they want the feeling of hot chocolate in their mouth all of the time

383
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:51,871
Frank's response

384
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,151
She's just jealous

385
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:55,455
Because she didn't think of it adults really suck

386
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:03,135
Pray for the flavor Grace's story of the nerd Champion comes

Has Brady heads to his

392
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:20,799
67 Super Bowl thinking he was finally in the clear on the whole deflategate controversy

393
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:24,639
He is faced with damning scientific evidence assembled by the

394
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,175
Intrepid Ace Davis

395
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:29,247
That he did in fact gain a distinct advantage

396
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:32,831
Spidey inflating his football during the 2014

397

Subjects from his immediate family

400
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:41,791
Davis had them toss footballs filled with varying degrees

401
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:43,583
The pressure to see which ones went

402
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,351
The farthest

403
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:47,167
Why the NFL investigators didn't think of this

404
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,191
Is anyone's guess

405
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:54,079
Test results prove incontrovertibly that low pressure in a football makes them

406
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:56,127
Fly further and are easier to catch

407
00:18:56,895 --> 00:19:00,223
Having answered the question is Tom Brady a cheater

408
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:02,527

554
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,280

561
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,288
A year ago Manhattan

562
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,056
2 hours

563
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:20,640
And we had lunch and then we saw the shooting on the Monday

564
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,944
And I knew within about for nanosecond

565
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,968
The meeting house that we were

566
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:25,248
Would probably be friends for life

567
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,296
Sing in a bottle so it was

568
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,832
It was just luck as much as I do

569
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:33,184
She did and she's having my triplets in Oregon

570
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:39,328
The game

571
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,608
Let's assume

572
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:43,936
That you win but even if you don't getting an Oscar nomination

573
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:44,704
Hopefully not

574
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:46,496

575
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:50,080
So you been doing all kinds of different roles

576
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:51,104
All kinds of different

577
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,152

Here we go

596
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,464
Grant original name

597
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,744
At Birth was Hiram

598
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:42,816
Ulysses Grant but he eventually dropped the Hiram

599
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:43,584
Why

600
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:46,400
Hey you just like being made fun of for his initial

601
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:47,424
Hug

602
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:50,752
Be he found a Hiram was the name of his father

603
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:51,520
Favorite mule

604
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:55,872
Orsi's Hiram Grand owed a lot of money to the local

605
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:56,640
Saloon

606
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:59,200
But nobody had ever heard of Ulysses Grant

607
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:03,296
See no it was a he didn't like being called hug

608

Is today

611
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:10,464
One of Ulysses S Grant's lesser-known claims to

612
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:11,744
US president

613
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,328
Is that he had what did the first known pet fish in the white

614
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,120

616
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:22,496
According to historian of hairstyles redhead the quote

617
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:23,264
Harriet

618
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,312
In presidential history

619
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:36,320
I've never I've never heard it described like that

620
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:42,976
Harry cabinet is a euphemism where you come from it's not

621
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:43,744

Hail to the me

624
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:54,240
I think it has to be the Harry cabinet members

625
00:27:54,496 --> 00:28:00,640
1000 mustaches every man in Grant's cabinet and the revered mustache a reception

626
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,944
All right last question

627
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:06,016
It is as we all know Ulysses S Grant 1st Road

628
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,040
The fame and National

629
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:09,088
Stature as a general in the Civil War

630
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,880
But that thing for him was Summit

631
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:12,160
Surprising y

632
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,696
Was it a he was so afraid of

633
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,464
Blood

634
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,000
He reportedly couldn't even look at a rare

635
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:16,768
Steak without

636
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,072
Bees High School

637
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:22,144
Voted him least likely to lead the Union Army to evict

638
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:28,800
Or see you at a terrible allergy

639
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:29,824

640
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:31,616

641
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,664
Heart attack

642
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,432
Which was

643
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,456
The kind of

644
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,224
Biscuit

645
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,808
That one might keep it hairy cabinet yes

646
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:44,928
I think it has to be number two

647
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:51,584
They like 1834

648
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,632
Whatever was he graduated

649
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:55,936
Voted least likely to leave

650
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:58,752

If you want to go that I will respect that cuz I'm a fan

653
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:07,200
Make up your mind

654
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,224
Okay

655
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,552
Stop doing that

656
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:15,648
How many of your characters are your gloriously mistaken

657
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,744
The answer was of course a he was so afraid of blood apparent

658
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,280
Mima deal with raw steak

659
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:24,608
It does make you wonder how I guess that's why he wanted to win so bad

660
