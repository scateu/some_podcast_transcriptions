The presidents

82
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:20,704
Of these United

83
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:21,984

84
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,520
Probably I will do

85
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,312
I would almost say

86
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,080
Definitely

87
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,104
The president

88
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,176
What's expressing concern unshakeable resolve

89
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,480
To declare a national emergency

90
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,016
Then say so he can do what

91
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,040

Declare a National Emergency to get the money for his wall Maybe

95
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,584
He's not sure

96
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:50,400
The whole point of an emergency is that it

97
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:53,728
It's fairly obvious you need to do something about it

98
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:57,312
Nobody stands in front of a house on fire

99
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,104

100
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:02,688
Might be an emergency I don't know it looks pretty Bernie

101
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:09,600
Basically Trump declares an emergency only when he wants something and he can't get it any

102
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:13,696

00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,975
Too much information quality

The wizard

00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,175
Would never have to suffer empathy

248
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:39,231

Luke Burbank

339
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:00,351
Verma is a 29 year old social media celebrity

340
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,143

And Famous

342
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:03,679
Just for being

343
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,727
Well rich and famous

344
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,543

Three stars

346
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,103
Think of him sort of as

347
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,895

Of the United Arab Emirates

349
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:18,015

Do this

363
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,311

370
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,415

371
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,951
Is that Scrooge McDuck

372
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,743
Is a cartoon character

373
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,559
And in the real world

374
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,095

No most diamonds like you know you got to get there or you got

572
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:03,936
Part of your duties as head coach

573
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:06,240
He seemed pretty serious are you allowed

574
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,520
Tease him about his beard

575
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:11,360
Very carefully

576
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:13,408
When did you

577
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:15,200
Figure out that you could be a coach

578
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:21,600
I'm 39 years old now retire from playing and I'm looking around and going now watch

579
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:23,392

When back and started coaching the NBA

583
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,400

Nicole

585
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,192
Techniques

586
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:36,960
Did you use

587
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:42,848
That would mean that I would have to be and

588
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:48,224
The players have to be smart so we're not messenger

589
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,248
Tempo Style

590
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,784
Do players like playing

591
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,064
Sing for you because of that or is it

592
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:52,832
Exhaust

593
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:54,624
Diet

594
00:23:57,184 --> 00:24:00,512
There's been something to have enlightened obviously I've been to different cities

595
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:02,304
I've been fired a few times so

596
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,840
Don't like that

597
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,120
No no

598
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:07,168
Don't like being fired then like when you get four

599
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,192
No

600
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:14,592
They get me fired

601
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:15,616
Coaching

602
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:17,664
Incredibly well-paid

603
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,968
Incredibly talented athlete

604
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,248
Who have been at the

605
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,528
The Pinnacle of their sport

606
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:23,552
For probably retire

607
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,344
Everybody in the NBA

608
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,368
For the Superstar

609
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,440
How do you

610
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:31,232
Handle people like that

611
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,768
Who are the stars of The League

612
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:33,536
Well

613
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:36,352
There's a lot of groveling and begging and

614
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:39,424
A bleeding exam that you need to have some

615
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,448
Psychological

616
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:46,848
James Harden say or Chris Paul both Superstar

617
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,224
If you want them to do something they're not doing or you want them to do something better or differ

618
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:53,504
How do you do that

619
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:57,088
We work together and get my experience in there and we

620
00:24:57,344 --> 00:25:00,160
We're very athletic base now so a lot of it is

621
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:00,928
Data

622
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:03,488
Driven where they can see that it makes sense

623
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,024
Give me an example of a

624
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,560
What time were the problem

625
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,096
Is soft by data

626
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:14,496
Will you have a player that shoots primarily two-point shots and says 3-point shot so I'm not going to

627
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,776
Get too technical but

628
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:18,336
I can show him some the data that

629
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:20,384
Shooting that shot there is not his

630
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,408
Effective shooting

631
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:23,200
3 points you have to change your text

632
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,992
They don't know that

633
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:31,392
3 points is 20 years for the

634
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,256
Wait a minute

635
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,304

Dusklight shards you probably heard of us

638
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:46,752

639
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:53,152
We have Scouts their most tonight we lost a game this week by 49 points

640
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:55,200

641
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,224
Advice

642
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,760
It's for us is how to be a better

643
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:06,464
Start score more points with three points more than two points

644
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,048
The biggest cliche of every sports movie

645
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,328
Any of us have ever seen

646
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,352
It is the half

647
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,376
Halftime motivation

648
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:24,896

649
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,944

No

803
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:50,688
Why did you guess

804
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,504

805
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:59,392

Disappear

812
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:10,912
Then the treadmill plays messages like here kitty kitty

813
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:13,472
And when you become physically fit

814
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:15,008
Humans will become your prey

815
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:20,896

816
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:23,712

817

819
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:31,904

Is this a butt dial

835
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,520
So apparently just like in your office

836
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:22,592
To dial out at the space station you have to dial 9

837
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,664
Wow and one particular astronaut

838
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,456

847
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:51,264

00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,592
Part of the space station and talk to her friends

849
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:57,920

Foot clips

910
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:44,320
Psyched

911
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:46,368
And my soul is a flame

912
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:47,648
For that ultralight

00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:50,976
With my

916
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:58,400
Fight very good research out here treats that cyclists have an emotional can

917
00:37:58,912 --> 00:37:59,424
Into their bikes

918
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:01,216
Forming bonds akin to that of a

919
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:02,496
Spouse or child

920
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:04,800
They give their bikes names they nurture them

921
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:06,080
They kiss them I mean

922
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:07,872
They fix the fake fix

923
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:09,408
Their bicycles

924
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:13,248
Researchers say the bond is formed through shared experiences the bike is such

925
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:16,064
The huge part of your daily routine you start to think of it as a friend

926
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:17,344
Instead of a means of chance

927
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,112
Application

928
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:21,696
In the strange friendship hey I'm going to Bar do you mind standing outside

Bee sweet Thunder

932
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:28,352

00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:29,632
12 / 13

934
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,936
I can see someone

935
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:32,960
A guy having a

936
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:34,240
Feelings for a huffy

937
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:35,008
Sweet Thunder

938
