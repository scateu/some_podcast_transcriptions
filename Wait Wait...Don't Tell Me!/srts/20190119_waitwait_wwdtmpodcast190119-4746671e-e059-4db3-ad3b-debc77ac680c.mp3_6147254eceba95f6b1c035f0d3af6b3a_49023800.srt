00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:28,128

Your prerogative

88
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:38,368

00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:50,656
The beef between the president and the Speaker of the House went for

93
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,424
Emma Constitution

94
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,192

First

98
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:59,104
Speaker Pelosi let the president know

99
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:02,176
It was a government shutdown maybe he shouldn't deliver

100
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,200
The State of the Union

101
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,480
As schedule

102
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,272
It was a political equivalent of

103
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:09,088
Thanks for asking me out but I'll be washing my hair

104
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,648

106
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:16,000
Is it a little romantic though it's like

107
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,536
I don't know it's a little bit like

108
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,559
Tracy and Hepburn

109
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,631

Well it would be

114
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,319
Fun except it's real

115
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:45,439
President and the Speaker of the House have

116
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:52,095
Fat that's affecting you know what I mean it's like it's a real thing like I fly all the time and are certain TSA

119
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:57,983
Angry old school grandmother Vibe yeah

120
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,519
We need to send her

00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:05,663
To the White House

122
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:11,807
Yeah

123
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:14,111
Should be getting paid

124
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:18,207
We have to mention only cuz we thought this is going to be the craziest thing that happened this week

125
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:20,255
The dinner the President Trump

126
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,279
Through

127
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:25,631
For the Clemson Tigers football team you may remember this it was a year ago on Monday

128
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,263
I do know or as President Trump told us

129
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,543
Because the government shutdown

130
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,311
Close the White House

131
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,615
Hazmat he out of the goodness of his own

132
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,383
Heart

133
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,407
Decided to pay for

134
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,711
For dinner himself so he made this amazing

135
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,247
Wonderful fast

136
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:43,295
Fast food feast in the Washington Post

137
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,087
Careful analysis

138
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,391
Decided it cost him about $3,000

139
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,671
That's half his net worth

140
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:53,023
Peter is dead

141
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:58,655
It's probably

142
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,935
Disparage fast food

143
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,471
Because McDonald's

144
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,751
French fry hat

145
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,775
Fresh McDonald's

146
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,799
French fry as a rebel

147
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:07,103
But like a 4-Hour Old MacDonald

148
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:07,871
French fry

149
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,407
I tried to offer that once

150
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,431
To a foster dog

151
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,199
And he was like just

152
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,223
Take me back to the pound

153
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,855
The scam he just ordered it for

154
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:22,207
He got caught

155
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,743
You're at your neck

156
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:24,767
Quote is

157
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:27,583
From the floor of the house of Parliament

158
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,119
United Kingdom

159
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:30,655
Order

160
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:31,935
Order

161
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:38,591
That was just a little of the chaos that rained in London as British politicians voted

162
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,639
The plan to do what

163
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,431
That would be

164
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,991
Xidan

165
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:51,391
Brexit is happening but it's not happening and it's going to happen is going to be terrible

166
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,951
It's incredibly complicated

167
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:58,047
Imagine it this way you have a mommy and a Daddy who love each other very much

168
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,095
They decide they like to live apart

169
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,399
And then Daddy sets himself on

170
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,703
Bonfire

171
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,775
Britain is like blowing up there.

172
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:12,127
Destroying their own economy that can't figure out how to do it they can figure out how not

173
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:12,895
How to do it there in

174
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,431
Crisis still hate each other

175
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:16,735
It's a disaster button the other head

176
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,271
It's kind of sweet that the US

177
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,575
And United Kingdom were going through horrible times together

178
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,855
We've been allies for 4

179
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:25,183
For 200 years and now we're all falling apart it's like it when women hang out alot

180
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:25,951
Motorcycles

181
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:30,303
You know it's like that so like you said Peter who would have guessed

182
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,327
50 United States

183
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,863
Did Britain would get into a

184
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,887
Who's worse

185
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:38,495
You know like I know you think your leaders bad oh yeah what watch out

186
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:43,359
Well we don't even want ours when we never want it all and I mean it

187
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,895
It is incredible

188
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:47,455

We've seen how you Yanks are after a championship

400
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,927
I guess it doesn't even take a championship

401
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:31,487
The Raiders may not play proper football

402
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:32,511
But those fans

Drug dealers

Have a lot to worry about

411
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,527
Getting raided by the cops

412
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:55,295
Of course

413
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,111
Getting murdered by ruthless drug cartel

414
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:01,183
But also climate change is real you guys

415
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,743
Saving the environment has become

416
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,023
Come such a concern for

417
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,559

Selling the white powder in Ziploc baggies and if

421
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:14,751
Starting using reusable pods

422
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,799
The practice

423
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:19,615
The woke is confusing their customers

424
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,663
Who frankly just want to get high

425
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:24,479
I was giving a gram of cocaine in this class

426
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,503
Fake punt thing

427
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:28,319
And Medina said they were serving up in past

428
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:30,367
Big Ziploc bags or wraps anymore

429
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:34,719

If I wanted to anybody

432
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:40,095
Refill it and that it would be better for the environment

433
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,655
Biodegradable paper

434
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,423

Maryland

441
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:00,575
The hill is

442
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,343
The flight attend

443
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,623
I thought she lives in

444
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,415
Cincinnati Ohio and she

445
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,183
It works for Sun

446
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,463
Country Airlines

447
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10,303
Sun Country Airlines they serve banana

448
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,071
A lot

449
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,375
And Marilyn really hates

450
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,655
Touching banana peel

451
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,191
And so she wears

452
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,215
Gloves

453
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,495
I'm so that should have

454
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,263
Touch them

455
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,799
But Sun Country

456
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,591
Has a small budget

457
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:25,407
And so sometimes she's ended up having

458
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,175
Handle

459
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:29,247
The slimy banana peels when she gets upset these are all talk

460
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,527
Hazard

461
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,575
Banana peels everywhere

462
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,855
And so she

463
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,927
Was so frustrated she started making a Bloody Mary on the

464
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:37,695
Plain and she

465
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,975
Cut her hand

466
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:41,279
She was very upset about and then she

467
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:45,119
She just impulsively cut her hand

468
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,399
And magically

469
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:49,215
Healed wound in her hand

470
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,519

Answer she sold it to Merck

Great Britain

00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,863
Deciding to use reusable pods instead of

494
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,911
Environmentally wasteful

495
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,447
Plastic baggies

For their health benefits

501
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:10,111
Thereby

502
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,903
Preventing them from being

504
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:19,839

Uber

None of these are super

00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,239
Compelling

508
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:32,639
I'm going to go with Alonzo

509
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:39,039
You're going to go to Lonzo and the soccer hooligan

510

Because that's how they are

513
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:46,207
We spoke to somebody who knew something about the real

514
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:46,975

515
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:48,767

I'm sure you thought that was still Helen talking because of this amazingly accurate

518
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:07,711
In fact it was Helen story that was funny that was James Rodger head of Trendz Birmingham live

519
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:11,039
Talking to us about the environmentally woke

And now the game where we ask people who've done a lot and Been Everywhere about something they avoided the whole time

00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,272
It's called not my job

Back in Maine

527
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,392
1893 David Letterman left his job hosting late

NBC in to replace him

529
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,232
The network picked a completely unknown

Comedy writer who. Has never appeared on camera

Somebody in the Simpsons writers room said Conan he's funny and Charming let's give him a show

542
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:26,304
Other versions that you audition for what's the truth

543
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:31,168
The truth is that I had it was really my association with star Night Live

544
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:33,216
I was a young writer external alive

545
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,776
And I was the writer that was kind of known

546
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,336
To sort of perform my sketches

547
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:40,640
Three other writers and I perform them

548
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:43,200
For people when I get them laughing

549
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:47,296
I think Lorne Michaels notice that I left on a live I went onto the

550
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,064
Simpsons

551
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,344
And I work there for a

552
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:51,392
About a year-and-a-half two years

553
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:52,416
When

554
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,440
Lorne Michaels worth

555
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,208
Charged with

556
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,256
Who's the new guy is going to replace Letterman

557
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,024
And

558
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,840
He said you know was just Geico

559
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,632
He's got something

560
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:02,912
And

561
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,984
They looked into it and it turns out I really didn't have anything

562
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:10,080
And here we are all the

563
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:12,640
Years later it must have been crazy

564
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,432
Because you know you weren't a stand-up you didn't

565
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,200
The following is

00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:16,224
Performing you were thrown

567
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:18,272
You're going to be in National Television

00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,296
ResCare you're nervous

569
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,088
I was diluted

570
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:25,440
There's nothing like delusion

571
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,464
There's nothing like

572
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:33,120
If you think you can't do something convinced yourself that you can and then it have a few drinks and go do it

573
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:37,472
I really believed I could do it and I was also terrified

574
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,008
The same time but I think I had a

575
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,544
Deep-seated belief

576
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:42,336
Did America needed to

577
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:44,896
See me on your cell phone

578
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:47,200

00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:57,184
Mow how dare you speak to me directly

580
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:03,328
Your question has to go through Bill Curtis and then

581
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:08,192
Bill would you ask Conan

582
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:11,264
Show how it's when they get home a lot of time they came

583
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,080
Remember who was the guest earlier that day of

584
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:14,848

585
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,944

586
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,736
Song the show that night

587
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:27,648
Bill that's a really stupid question

588
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:28,672
Funny

589
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:29,952
2 most point

590
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:30,976
No

591
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,256
You do the show

592
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,280
And it becomes

593
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:36,864
You're feeling the moment when you're doing it and I like in the hole

594
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,168
Experience and I'm actually not even kidding about this

595
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,192
I think everyone's

596
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,216
Dropping your audience's

597
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:41,984
Familiarity

Yes where you turn the knobs

600
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,872
How to create a picture you

601
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:50,432
Create something and then you just shake it and it's gone

602
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,200
Start again

603
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:55,040
Everyday I come in and I learn everything I can

604
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:57,088
That I need to know for that show

605
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:59,648
And I learned it to the best that I can and I can

606
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:01,440
Tell you everything about the gas tank

607
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,976
Play everything about the comedy

608
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,512
The minute it's over

609
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:06,048
I shake the edge

610
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:06,816
Sketch

611
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:10,656
And all of its gone and I go home and I don't know what we did

612
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,704
I've done 4000 hours

613
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,264
Broadcasting I'm told

614
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,800
9 of it quite good

615
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:18,336
Yeah

616
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:21,920
You have I want to get on to what you're doing an hour

617
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:22,688
Which is really interesting

618
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,456
Variety of things

619
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:26,784
Pornography

620
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:34,208
You're tall enough of course your head would never enter the frame would be good for a 9in today

621
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:38,560
I just leaned down

622
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:44,448
I couldn't have met on one occasion it was a red for the White House Correspondents Dinner

623
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:47,776
And I have my picture taken with you, which I'm grateful for and you did something

624
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:48,800
You crouched

625
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:51,360
Instantly without being asked you to sort of Crouch

626
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:53,920
So that you and I had would be in the same frame

627
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:56,224
You must have to do that.

628
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,248

And whenever I go anywhere in the country or the world

632
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:09,280
All people say to me

633
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,072
Good God

634
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,400
You're so much bigger that you are on television

635
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,960
But I would say you need a bigger caliber

636
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:21,824
And my daughter now has said you need a

637
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,592

I know everything

645
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,864
Really that's a bold statement

646
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:47,424
There's not a thing you can ask me

647
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,960
About hot cocoa

648
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:54,592
But I do not know well I am interested in what's going to happen now because we have in fact prepared three questions for you

Peter

675
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:47,584
I'm going to say this one more time

676
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,936

In our penal reform system and I don't poop

Stop that they would let Bernie Madoff do that too in a way I'm counting that answer is

685
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,120
Correct

00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:28,800
People were doing what

689
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:31,104
A mixing protein powder into cocoa

690
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:33,664
So it would be the only thing that ever has

00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:37,504
Be snorting lines of cocoa powder like Coke

692
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,088
Or see you trying to have a transfused into their body instead of blood

693
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,624
Answer is

694
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:44,160

00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,952
It lasts for about 20 minutes

707
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,536
And then you have to cough out the marshmallows

708
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:24,864

00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,432
Which were $13 a bottle

714
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:39,456
Will do what

4C it gives you chocolate dandruff instead of dry skin you shed chocolate flake

721
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:54,560
The answer is a

00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:59,424
Sweet like chocolate

723
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,960

But yes

728
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:09,920
The idea is

729
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:10,944
It's a little pill

730
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,480
And you take it and if you take it

Scatological I don't work blue

I didn't realize this was that kind of show

736
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:29,120
