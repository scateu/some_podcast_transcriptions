Because that's two other people that don't have to

87
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:06,016

115
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,975
That was a reaction to news that what

116
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,255

117
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,279
By 2050

118
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:22,815
Oggi's

119
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:30,751

00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,031
Population growth

By 2050 the whole world

124
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:44,063
You may have missed this because everybody was

00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,879
Distracted by that hilarious video of the rescue

126
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:49,695
Hiker spinning underneath the helicopter wasn't that great

127
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:52,767
But according to a study out of Australia there is an excellent chance

128
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:55,839
The human civilization will be over by 2050

129
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,375
Which is silly cuz

130
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,167
Human civilization already ended

131
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:01,727
We started using Fried Chicken as bread for sandwiches

132
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:05,311
Wondering how the scientist

133
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,103
We're dead serious by the way

134
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:09,151
Can be so specific at the world end

135
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,943
Precisely in 2050

136
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,271
That's because research has shown the world warranty expires

137
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:17,343

148
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,647
His plan to reduce

00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,487
2050

151
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:57,791

From other climate

161
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:13,919
Research has ended

00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:34,912
Yeah I'm one of the things I've read is that it

551
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:36,960
It's very intimidating to be a movie director

552
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:39,520
Cuz even a low-budget movie there's a lot of money this Allah

553
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:41,056
A lot of people they're all looking to you too

567
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,384
The spring of 2019

568
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,664
Yes that's right

569
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:21,248
You are to me a very young person but you're not that young

570
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:26,624
So did you have to learn stuff about like what high school kids are like now and how they were different

571
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:27,904
When you were graduating ice

572
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:30,464
Yeah basically they're just a lot better now

573
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:34,304
Smarter there much cooler there much more evolved

574
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:36,096
How much more fluid

575
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:39,680
And then I had to learn some of their cool lingo that I am

576
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:43,520
100000 years old and I had to kind of catch up on how they

577
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:49,664
For the longest time I didn't know what they meant when they were like Brad Pitt lives

578
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:54,528
Batman's outfit so I passed out on

579
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:56,576
The word

580
00:24:56,832 --> 00:25:00,928
Brad Pitt

581
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:01,952
Bad Batman

582
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:02,720
Yeah

583
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:06,048
Did ever tell you anything that made you think they were just pulling your leg

584
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:11,168
They were at the whole time but

585
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,216
They were very very kind

586
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:16,544
Give me a call I have to ask you this is a movie

587
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,128
As is giving away by the title about to rather brainy girls

588
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,152
In high school

589
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:23,968
Woohoo in fact the side at one point they haven't had enough fun they've been

590
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:24,736
Been so brainy and

591
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,296
Was that what you were like

592
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,320
In in high school

593
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:32,672
I went to like the ultimate nerd High School just the nerdiest

594
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:34,976
The nerd and I was one of them and I'm proud

595
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,512
We didn't have

596
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,280
Fun party

597
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:41,376
I just wasn't made aware but

598
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:46,496
The movie about it in order to go to the party

599
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:53,152
The movie has come out it's gotten great reviews I hope

600
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:56,224
A lot of people see it let's assume that it is the success that it seems

601
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,016
Tubidy know what you want to do next or going to

602
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:59,808
Try to do one of those big superhero movies

603
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:03,136
Usual progression

604
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:05,184
We've done those big movies you can

605
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:05,952
Handle it

606
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:11,072
I can handle it I can handle it as long as I have you no good snacks and

607
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:13,120
Loud music I can make it happen

608
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:15,168
You know I will say

609
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:21,824
The statistics are pretty Grim for female filmmakers so I say that all of us ladies should step up and

610
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,360
Start telling stories as much

611
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,128
Could we possibly

612
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:30,784
Well Olivia Wilde we haven't

613
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,808

624
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,344
Here's your first question

625
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:08,416
Though the star of the menu at Buffalo Wild Wings Dezavala

626
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,184
Obviously

627
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:09,952
The wings

628
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:14,048
That's not all they have to offer you could also order which of these at one of their rest

629
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:17,888
AAA 1 gallon bag of fountain soda for only

Hope it's

638
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,064
What was the back of a bag of salt and soda

639
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,392
That's what it is

640
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:52,960
You're right Olivia that's the right one very good

641
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:54,240
Good for parties

642
00:27:55,264 --> 00:28:01,408
Yes that question you can catch it with any sport you want on the many TVs at your local Buffalo Wild Wings but at 1

643
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,944
Ocean in Alabama

646
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:09,088
Very big backyard

647
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,648

649
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,000

00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:23,936
You're absolutely right Olivia yes

652
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:28,032
Of course the church service at this particular Buffalo Wild Wings begins Buffet

653
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:30,592
For the restaurant opens you can't have beer and wings

654
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:31,872
Service however

655
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,432
They encourage you to stick around and enjoy it at

656
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:41,856
The communion wine also come in a bag

657
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:44,160
Perfect in this as you have been in so many other things

658

661
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:53,888
Four ways to make the customers experience even more enjoyable

662
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:54,912
Including which of these

663
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,960
Hey they set up boots

664
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:59,008
With sports bookies to help you drop your brackets

665
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:01,312
Being on site therapist for those

666
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,872
Suffering from actual clinical March Madness

667
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:08,992
4C the jewel stool a cool bar stool for men who got

668
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,552

00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:17,184

00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,720
What are the booths with sports

671
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:25,376
It was actually the jewel stool what does truth and it isn't even

672
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:26,912
Genius many men

673
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,960
Schedule vasectomies around March Madness

674
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:32,288
This is true so they can enjoy the enforced rest in front of the TV

675
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,848
So why not entice them down to Wild Wings

676
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:38,944
Right marketing

677
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:45,088
