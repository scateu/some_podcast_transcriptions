But instead of the summer so he just kind of daughters around for 8 hours

90
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,464
Was Wednesday

91
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:46,816
Former special counsel Robert Mueller appeared before a two house committees

92
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,352
With the energy and enthusiasm

93
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,192
Have a man facing his annual prostate exam

94
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:54,240
Which might explain why he answered certain point

95
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,032
Did questions by just turning his head and

96
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:58,592
And coughing

97
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,432
Everybody said it was boring but I was kind of breathless

98
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,200
Because I was

99
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,248
Know something is going to happen

100
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:11,136
You didn't want to miss the one moment and yet nothing did I was so disappointed

101
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,928
How many Democrats and liberals

102
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,720
Because liberals had been building him up for

103
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,488
For two years

104
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,512
As this

105
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,791
Clint Eastwood

106
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,119

And take names

109
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,959
And in the end he was just like

110
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:25,727
Clint Eastwood

111
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:32,639

115
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:48,511
There was none of that

116
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,815
And instead of Clint Eastwood we got like

117
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:51,839

As or Bojo is we hope everybody starts calling

138
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,439

The Empire has fallen they are so broken the good news is they're ripe

149
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:12,735
Decolonize

150

Time for payback India

151
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:19,647
What has happened where

152
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,463
People who were clowns are now in charge of everything

153
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:25,023
And I wish they were actual clown

154
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:31,167
Because those people at least have timing

155
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,471
Is is most famous at least here in the US

156
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:37,567
For being at the mayor of London during the 2012 Olympics during which

157
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,359
He tried to do a zip line stunts

158
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,127
Promoted

159
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:40,895
And famously got

160
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:41,663
Stuck

161
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,199
Dangling from a rope

162
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:45,247
Remember this 50 feet above the ground

163
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,039
Maybe that's why he was

164
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,319
Finally elected

165
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,087
The handle brexit

166
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,111

167
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:50,879
To be just

00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,559
Interesting

172
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,607
Bloke but he struck me

173
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:01,631
And maybe this

174
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,423
Just cuz I'm reading the Harry Potter series

175
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,191
The first time

176
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,215

Which is what all of us would say if

227
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:14,751
I'd be even more unemployed

228

Only good part

229
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,175
The Scandal has shown

230
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,223
That Puerto Rico is so full of corruption

231
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,759
Shouldn't racism and misogyny

232
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,575

Kentucky have filed a lawsuit against

246
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,007
To the ark

247

250
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,759

Permission

265
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,735
The park opened in 2016 but was forced

266

Close for a few days right then when the ark and its surrounding area

267
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,343
Was damaged by and I quote

268
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,879
Slightly above-average

Rain

270
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:14,559

00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,791
Swans by

383
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,583
Earning him the nickname

384
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,887
Mesilla

385
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,423
Mister Magic

386
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:10,239
And you can't miss him

387
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:14,079
To travel with that or he rides his 1964

388
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:16,383
Joe motor scooter a contraption that

389
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,407
So terrific

390
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,175
Quickly loud

391
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:23,551
It warned smokers he's coming and therefore leaves a wake of hastily cast off cigarettes

392
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:26,367
Didier celebrates his work every night

393
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,647
With a nice Pernod

394
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,439
Single gas wall

395
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:30,975
Problem

396
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:31,743
He says

397
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:36,095
Nothing holding with a little smoke as long as it's away from zika

398
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:44,031
The official cigarette extinguisher of the Moto you're next

399
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,823
Story of a tour helper comes

400
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:46,847
From Adam

401
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:47,615
Felber

402
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:51,199
The cycling world was stunned last week by the Revelation that

403
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,479
The devil Tour de France

404
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,247
Is Rick

405
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:54,783
Know the winner is

406
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:57,599
Predetermined but now we've learned that the loser

407
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,367
Is

408
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:00,415
In fact for the past 10 years

409
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,951
Tour officials paid an hour

410
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,231
Actor to come in last

411
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,511
As a means of encouraging

412
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,559
Lower razor to maybe thinking of giving up

413
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:13,215
Now if this sounds like evidence of an overweening everyone gets a trophy Nanny think culture run amok let me assure

414
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,239
Sure you

415
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,519
Exactly what this is

416
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:21,663
It's a good job and actor Leon Christ who is just exposes this year

417
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,943
8 loser

418
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:25,503
You don't have to try this hard you can have a pint or two

419
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:31,135
How do you make friends with a lot of wonderful funny people whose only sin is being helpless wankers when it come

420
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:31,903
Comes to cycling

421
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:38,815
But now that the Jig Is up Christ knows that the gig is over and we can all rest assured that next year's last place finisher

422
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,351
Will be a real loser

423
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:44,959
For his part Grace expects he'll return to acting and maybe someday the cycling quotes

424
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:46,239
Now that I'm coming

425
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,007
106

426
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:50,335
It'd be fun to see if I can improve on that or

427
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:53,919
Baby just doing what I did this year but for free and with more training and

428
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:54,687
No drink

429
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,223
In fact nevermind

430
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:05,183
Leon draisaitl designated loser of the Tour de France always comes in last July

431
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,719
A story of the wind beneath

432
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,999
The Tour de France has wings

433
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,279
News comes from pita bread

434
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:13,375
One of the great traditions of the Tour de France is fans rioting

435
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:15,167
Encouraging messages for cyclist

436
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:15,935
Ghost on the road

437
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,471
Stuff like golang

438
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,751
Miguel

439
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:21,055
You don't even need those training wheels from

440
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,663
How many fans write bad burn

441
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,199
Profane pictures

442
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:30,527
Which the tour doesn't want showing up on the TV

443
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,295
Broadcast

444
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:33,599
It's hard enough to keep people watching ever since

445
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,367
Play Crackdown

446
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:37,439
On drugs and all the cyclist walking their bikes up there

447
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:42,303
So the tour has higher to Man Who Sold job is

448
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,095
Describe the course every day in

449
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,631
Repaint over those dirty mess

450
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,679
They're called officially

451
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,447
Erasers

452
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:52,031
People draw genitals

453
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,567
I have no idea why

454
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:57,151
Because it's fun

455
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:00,991
Multi the erasers just paint over the image

456
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:03,807
But they also let their artistic side show

457
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,623
According to the Wall Street Journal one of the erasers

458
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:11,487
Renderings of the male anatomy into butterflies or owl

459
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:14,815
By the way

460
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,375
Now you know the backstory of everyone you meet

461
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,143
Who has the butter

462
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:25,311
All right

463
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,335
Topolino in France

464
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,615
He's helped along

465
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,919
Buy one of these three p

466
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:30,687
People is it from

467
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:32,991
Faith the official cigarette extinguisher guy who

468
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,271
Rides on the Corson

469
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,807
Take the cigarettes out of the mouth

470
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:38,367
Are the people who might dare to smoke them near the Riders

471
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:45,023
From Adam felber Leon Grice the man whose job it is to ride and come in last so nobody else has

472
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,071
Or from PD

473
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:53,215
The stories of the guy who goal on the course and erase the obscene messages that people might have left

474
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:55,519
For the writers they don't appear on TV

475
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:57,055
Which of these are the real story

476
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,103
Of the Tour de France is Little Helper

477
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:02,431
I really wish with all them but I'm going to go with number 3

478
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:09,855
Alright then

479
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:12,415
To bring the real answer you somebody who knows a lot about

480
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,183
The Tour de France

481
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,975
The most inappropriate graffiti

482
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:21,375
You see out on the road to the Tour de France's you spell genitalia wouldn't be a favorite

483
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:24,703
Robinson he is the European sports reporter for the Wall Street Journal

484
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:30,847
Who wrote about the official Tour de France erasers and what they have to do congratulations you got it right

485
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:37,503
You are being honest and you have one arm

486
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,527
Has the voice of anyone you might

487
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,551
Congratulations

488
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:43,647
Thank you so much thank you

489
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,495
And now the game will be asked

490
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:02,591
Pioneers to go discover something completely uninteresting it's still not my job

491
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:05,151
Marin alsop discovered her passion for music

492
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:05,919
In an early age

493
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:08,991
Juilliard wouldn't admit her to their conducting program

494
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:12,575
So she just started her own damn Arkestra Nextdoor presumably

495
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:13,343
To drown them out

496
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:19,744
2000 music director of the Baltimore Symphony and the South Paulo State Symphony we are delighted to have her with us Marin

497
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,280
Stop welcome to wait wait don't tell me

498
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:27,936
Thank you

499
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:32,032
Musical Geniuses like yourself were you like a musical

500
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,312
Prodigy did you have to be forced

501
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:34,848
Rihanna where did you love

502
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:37,408
I was born with a job my parents were

503
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,200
Professional musicians wear

504
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:42,016
My dad was a violinist and my mom a cellist and so

505
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,552
They needed a Pianist

506
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,600
And so they said all let's make one

507
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,696
So I was born

508
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:51,488
With a job and

509
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,024
Really hated the piano

510
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,328
I hated it I retired when I was sick

511
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,120
From Gallup

512
00:21:57,632 --> 00:22:00,960
That was because you didn't like the piano or because you just resented your parents

513
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:01,984
This is why you were

514
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,848
How much time do we have

515
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,384
You know for every kid there is

516
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:11,968
Is there is a right instrument playing the violin

517
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:18,368
It was very close because they said

518
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,416
They said you want to go to summer camp

519
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:26,048
You know I'm so I already had an archetypal image of summer camp you know was sailing and

520
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,840
And horseback riding somehow horse

521
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:32,704
Just got in there and I forgot to tell you you might have to

522
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,728
How to play the violin

523
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:34,752
And

524
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:37,056
Is this campus called Meadow Mountain

525
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:39,104
Finally called the concentration camp

526
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:39,872
App for violin

527
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:46,272
So that's why when you got there they just put you in your little salad

528
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,552
So you're going to price

529
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,320
What is from

530
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,624
Until 1 everyday 5 hours

531
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,440
Luckily I was 7 I had no real sense of

532
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,208
What time

533
00:22:55,232 --> 00:23:01,376
7 years old and they made you practice your violin 5 hours a day and that was supposedly for pleasure

534
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:04,448
Camp right I mean there's so many things to say

535
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:10,848
Swallow

536
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:13,664
The only sport we are allowed to do

537
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:14,688
Ping pong

538
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:17,504
I am

539
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,576
Awesome at ping putter loft

540
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:24,160
Is it true we read that you decided at some point you wanted to be reckoned

541
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,952
Well what happened was it after

542
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:30,560
After practicing for 5 hours from now

543
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,608
I played in the orchestra which I loved it

544
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,144
They got some complaints

545
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,704
Is that somebody was trying to lead the whole Arkansas

546
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,752
Picture from the back of the second violin

547
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:40,800
And so

548
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:47,200
Where is the orchestra

549
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:48,224
From the second vial

550
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,528
I think the problem was I was having a really good

551
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:54,880
Good time was really cute back there and I was having fun

552
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,160
And you know I was

553
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:58,208
Moving and everybody else was

554
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:59,232
Do you know already like

555
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,024
Stonehenge and I was busy

556
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,840
And then luckily my dad took me to a concert and I

557
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:08,960
I saw the conductor he came out and he started talking to me I talk into the audience talking to me

558
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:14,336
And you know he was really excited and then he started jumping around and conducting and I thought

559
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,200
Nobody's yelling at this guy I could do that

560
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,992
He is doing the yelling

561
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,528
Exactly

562
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:24,320
And he was sweating and spitting in

563
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,600
In-N-Out in that was Leonard

564
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:30,720
Oh wow

565
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:32,256
And I should say so much famous

566
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:34,304
Became of I I guess

567
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:35,584
Student ism

568
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:37,376
His protege

569
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,912
And I did luckily

570
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:39,936
Yeah that was a

571
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:40,960
Highlight of my

572
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:45,568
How does one become a protege of a conductor like I'm thinking

573
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:46,336
Karate Kid

574
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:48,640
You know like and is there a lot of work with the

575
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:49,664
Switch of the arm

576
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,992
There's a lot of that yes

577
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:05,792
Really under the question is

578
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:06,560
Every kid

579
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:07,328
Jugos

580
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,096
Sia concert

581
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:10,144
Thinks he or she can be a conductor

582
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,216
Write the actual the actual movement that you make

583
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:14,240
Forgive me

584
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,008
Looks

585
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,056
So what is it

586
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:17,824
That goes in

587
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,592
Conducting

588
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,128
Oh my God that

589
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,664
These questions you said they're going to be

590
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,720
Listen you know it's true it is a lot of it I think about who we are as

591
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:35,488
Human beings

592
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,048
That creates a different sound

593
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:40,608
And and elicits a different response

594
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:41,888
It's all about body language

595
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:45,472
Not only that

596
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:46,240
How to see you work

597
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:48,288
Something I noticed most people can't see this

598
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,824
The conductor has their back

599
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,104
The audience

600
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,896
But because music is playing

601
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:53,920
Can I shout instruct

602
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:55,712
You must indicate

603
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:56,480
What you'd like to meet

604
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,272
Facial expression

605
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,832
You have to have a wide range

606
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:01,600
Dirty looks

607
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:02,880
Encourage

608
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:09,024
Looks or you're not really going to play it that way are you

609
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,840
Also you know you have to anticipate

610
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:13,120
Sometimes people are about to

611
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:15,168
To play at the wrong moment you know you have

612
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:16,448
Anticipate

613
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,520
Preventive conducting I call it you know

614
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:20,288
Don't do that

615
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,736
You have a good conductor

616
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,272
But are you a super

617
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:35,648
We have heard I've seen

618
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:39,488
At musical conducting but what other kind of conducting

619
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,256
Conducting a lie

620
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,024
Electricity

621
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:44,864
We're going to ask you three questions about that other kind of conducting

622
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:48,448
Did you get to write you would apprise for one of my listeners the voice of anyone they might like

623
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,216
On their voicemail

624
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:51,264
Bill who is Marin alsop playing

625
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,824
Lucinda Watson of Chattanooga Tennessee

626

The winter of our smarts

628
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:57,408
Quiz

629
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,968
You could be a winner to just ask you

630
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:00,992
Smart speaker

631
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:03,040
Do open the wait wait quiz

632
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:04,832
Alright ready to do this

633
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:05,600
Here we go

634
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:12,000
Lightning rods were all the rage after they were invented in the late 18th century so much so that they

635
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,024
Turned up where

636
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,048
A attached

637
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:14,816
Two race horses

638
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:16,352
Just hoping they give them an ex

639
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,120
The Kik

640
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:21,984
Beyond cannonballs in the hope that it would attract lightning onto someone's enemies

641
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:23,776
Orsi

642
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:25,056
On top of ladies hats

643
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,080
Because they looked

644
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:26,848
Cool

645
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:29,664
Oh

646
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:31,200
Pixie

647
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:33,248
We got that horse back

648
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,344
Do you have the

649
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,624
Or ladies hats

650
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,392
Because they looked so

651
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:44,000
Yeah but that would hurt wouldn't it the ladies that that could be

652
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,024
That could be really dangerous

653
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:47,072
Well ladies inordinate sacrifice

654
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:47,840
Sephora fashion

655
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,144
We're going with the hat

656
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,960
Yeah okay we're going with the hat

657
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:58,848
It's amazing by the way how you got them off of work

658
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:05,248
Our next question Electric

659
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,016
Fences

660
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,040
Are excellent conduct

661
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,064
Of course

662
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:08,832
But they're not just

663
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:09,856
Pepper Farm someone

664
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:11,648
Once seriously suggest

665
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,696
Using an electrified fence

666
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:14,976
For which of these uses

667
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:17,792
This is a surrounding a mixed martial arts Fighters at the first

668
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:18,816
UFC bout

669
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:22,912
Beekeeping the political press from harassing senator

670
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,472
Foreseeing managing the line

671
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:28,544
It gets quite extraordinary at Franklin's Barbecue in Austin

672
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,080
Austin Texas

673
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:35,712
Okay I'm going to go with the barbecue because the electric in the barbecue it sounds kind of

674
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:41,088
No it wasn't the barbecue it was mixed martial arts but I just want to say that I'm glad

675
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:46,208
That you mention the barbecue cuz the only reason I put it in here was that they would hear it and send us some barbecue

676
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:50,304
Appreciate the help

677
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,096
Get this last one right you win

678
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:57,728
Your last question is about superconductors these are the remarkable materials that conduct electricity with

679
00:28:59,008 --> 00:28:59,776
Industry in science

680
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:04,128
In 2010 a group of Japanese scientists made an incredible discovery

681
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,152
About superconductor

682
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,432
How did it happen

683
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:09,504
Was it a one of them was picking out ham at the grocery store freezer sex

684
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:11,808
Noticed it was colder than the frozen chicken

685
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:13,088
That led to the discovery that

686
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:13,856
Hammock

687
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,136
An excellent superconductor

688
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:20,256
Be an incompetent lab assistant made contact with two electrical leads and

689
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,536
The current pass through his body

690
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:23,328
Deficiency without harming it

691
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,120
So he now works as a

692
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:29,472
A professional superconductor

693
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:34,848
Dunked a superconductor in booze and discovered that red wine increase its conductivity 62%

694
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,736
All right we're going with see I'm trusting them

695
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:52,512
And I got amazing results red wine

696
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:54,816
Increases conductivity of the substance they were using 60

697
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:55,584
80%
