00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,543
I wrote a best-selling book

162
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:07,871
If you write a best-selling book you can be a millionaire

163
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,943
That is the new Democratic polls who is it

00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:24,767
Revealed that he is in fact a millionaire

168
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:25,791
Surprising

169
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,583
Because most millionaires

170
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:28,863
Afford haircut

171
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:33,983

Billionaire

176
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,015
But Bernie has promised

177
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:52,927
Not to enjoy the money because in his entire life he has never enjoyed anything

178
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,719
I just can't believe he got rich

179
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,487
Writing a book

180
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,023
Because everybody I know who's written

181
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,815

182
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,863

By the way this is all

189
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,127
In preparation for Bernie releasing his

190
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:13,919
Did you know that Bernie has not

191
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:14,687
Not released

192
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:15,967
Didn't do it in

193
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,271

194
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,039
Next week

195
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,831
He's the perfect candidate for

196
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,367
People who both hate President Trump

197
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:23,903
Jealous of Republican

198
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,719
Why can't liberals have an angry old man with

199
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,743
With terrible hair who won't

200
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:28,767
The tax return

201
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:34,399
I'm sitting here Peter trying to think about it joke

202
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:40,799
It shows I care about rich white men but I got nothing

203
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:47,199
Just one more time white people complaining about

204
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,735
And I done made a million dollars

205
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:55,391
I don't know how to help you on that one good luck with that Megan here is your last

206
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:58,719
Einstein must be

207
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:01,279
That was a very happy astronomer quoted in the New York Times

208
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,303
Talking about

209
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:04,095
The first ever photograph

210
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,119
Ever made

211
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:06,399
Of a what

212
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:13,311
A black hole a black hole yes

213
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,847
Of an actual massive

214
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,383
Interstellar black hole in a gallon

215
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,151
Auntie known as

216
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:17,919
Has Messi

217
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,687
87

218
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,711
I-55

219
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,503
Million light-years away

220
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,783
It looks like a welt

221
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,319
A black hole

222
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,879
Surrounded by a ring of arms light like

223
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,415
The eye of Sauron

224
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,487
Really evil bagel

225
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:35,327
I thought it was a scientific

226
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,863
Triumph it was unlike anything

227
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:39,935
4 photos

228
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:40,959
Of their colonoscopy

229
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,263
Interesting life

230
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,591
Waited all I can tell you

231
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:50,431
How many people colonoscopy photos you look at

232
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,735
Interesting man this is

233
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,015
Pretty cool because of

234
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,551
Time it takes the light

235
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,343
To get here 55 million years

236
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,367
The photo

237
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,647
Is the black

238
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:02,463
A hole when it was much younger than it is now

239
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:03,999
So what do you know

240
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:04,767
The black hole is

241
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:05,535
Just like everyone

242
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:10,911
My first thought when I saw that photo is like

243
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:11,679
They're really great

244
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,823
Yeah that's who I really I really feel happy

245
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:18,591
Before those

246
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,615
Astrophysicist

247
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,639
The other side

248
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:21,919
The geniuses

249
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:22,687
Says who

250
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:23,967
Spend your whole life

251
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:26,527
Studying and working in and they can finally say

252
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,807
That's what I do

253
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:31,391
This is what I do. What do you do at work

254
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:37,023
This is what I do and this is really cool

255
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:37,791
This picture of this

256
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,071
Extraordinarily Disston

257
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,375
There's no single telescope

258
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,399
That's strong enough to do it

259
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,935
So they had to get data

260
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:44,703
Different telescopes

261
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,983
All around the world

262
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:48,543
And combine them in an incredibly complicated way

263
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,079
Figured out by 8

264
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,103
29 year old

265
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:57,503
And they say that's at the Precision of this

266
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,039
Virtual instrument they created

267
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,063
Was so precise

268
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,343
They could see

269
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,367
Orange

270
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:03,903
On the moon

271
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:10,303
Which makes you say why are they going on about a black hole there are oranges on the moon

272
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:13,631
Everything about this

273
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,167
Read like if you were

274
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:15,935
Deer tracks

275
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,215
Explain what happens if

276
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:17,983
You go into

277
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,263
To the black hole

278
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,055
Park City events

279
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,079
Horizon

280
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,359
Unscathed

281
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,895
And then you get to this point

282
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,919
Where the black hole

283
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:26,687
Stretches

284
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,455
Do you like a

285
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,223
Noodle

286
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,015
Which for a minute I was like

287
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:36,415
I'm okay with that ass so what the f*** he was like

288
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,183
Like you kind of

289
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:43,583
Microsecond you finally be a size one yeah I know

290
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:51,519
Integrace worth it

291
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:03,551
Thank you

292
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:11,231
Pantelis now some questions about the rest of the week

293
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:15,327
Are you Alonzo a Taurus getting a ride in a fighter jet

294
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,095
When France got the

295
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:18,399
Full experience when the pilot accidentally did

296
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,983
Ejected yes that's what happened

297
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,543
You know the whole thing with a canopy blowing off in

298
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,823
Tennessee rocketing into the air

299
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:30,431
Don't worry he parachuted safely to the runway below French authorities say he's fine

300
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,479
Or wait French authorities actually said quote

301
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,759
His health is not a cause for

302
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:38,623
Weirdly that's exactly with the same guy who

303
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,647
Rented the island had

304
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,927
How to say

305
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,743
The 64 year old man was riding along

306
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,047
A French Air Force fighter jet

307
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,327
Which isn't supposed to

308
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,351
To eject past

309
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,887
Messengers just because it feels like it

310
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,935
It's not a nightclub it's a fighter jet

311
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:55,007
Most likely nobody knows exactly what happened

312
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,287
The most likely the passenger

313
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:57,823
Close to

314
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,359
Fulfill his lifelong dream but

315
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,895
His Last Words Be

316
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,431
What does this button do

317
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:08,319
Peter is someone who used to work on on fighter planes

318
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:09,599
I think that's

319
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,135
Exactly what happened I think

320
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:17,791
He saw that red lever and said I wonder what this does and then he found out maybe this fire

321
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,863
But that is the ultimate I mean

322
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:24,191
You know it's great to get a ride in a fighter jet but it has to kind of

323
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:24,959
Be cooler

324
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:25,727
Stephen ba

325
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:29,055
Ejected from a fighter jet

326
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,335
Imagine being

327
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,359
At a party

328
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:34,943
And some guys bragging that yeah man I was riding in a fighter jet

329
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:41,599

You want your silence to be a drag queen

392
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,647
Better how to do makeup than someone who beat their face weekly

393
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,415

394
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:29,791

Huge hit with NPR audiences

416
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,407
You may also remember the

417
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:19,967
Curious fact that they wore their pants backwards

418
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,527
The kids at Centennial High could not get enough

419
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,319
Kris Kross and started dressing back

420
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,343

00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,719
The whole thing is a passing

425
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,743
Throwback bad

426
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,023
But the trend

427
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,047
Continue to grow in

428
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,327
The senior class decided to

429
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,167
The theme of prom backwards so they renamed it more

430
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:43,519
Which is proper back work for those of you who lack backwards speaking facility

431
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:44,799
Not only did this

432
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,591
Students decide to dress backwards

433
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,359
Long dress

434
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:50,431
And flowing forward on girls and corsages

435
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,711
Depend on boys back

436
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:54,271
But they made everything backwards

437
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,039
Morphe night

438
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,831
It started with the after party wear

439
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,903
Just got exceedingly drunk and made mistakes they would sue

440
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,695
Tune regret for the rest of their lives

441
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,231
As a dancer

442
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:05,023
Through the night they turn their moonwalk

443
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,303
Forward and there

444
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:12,703
Flossing upward their twerking had more chest and less booty and their Gangnam style look like a horse

445
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,983
Was riding them

446
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:22,431

00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,599

00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:34,207
You might have to figure that out

451
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:37,279
Especially is the trend of celebrity prom chaperones

452
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,047
The spreading

453
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,071

TMZ reporter Salena Jones says

457
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,959
It started at Calabasas

458
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:45,727
Aces High School

459
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,751
Southern California

460
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,031
The Calabasas

461
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:50,079
This is well known as the home of the car dash

462
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:50,847
Sheen family

463
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,383
One parent called in

464
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,663
Favor from a friend Chris

00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,503

Checking kids for alcohol

468
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,831
Not to be outdone

469
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:01,599
ICM

470
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,367

Has a friend whose daughter is at Beverly Hills High School of the Arts

473
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,279
So now they're probably monitored by

474
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,047
Idris Elba

475
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:13,631
Interesting League that maybe more mom Volunteers in action

Senior prom makeup

484
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,599
I'm sure the kids don't do anything that they'll have to later right

485
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:34,623
Country songs about

486
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:37,695

It's a Brooklyn Tech will have to settle for Chris Rock

491
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:47,935
All of this led to the nightmares

Scenario parts

00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:27,584
Your text I was born in Wharton Texas I grew up in Houston and

569
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,376
I'm not just from Texas

570
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:30,912
I am up

571
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:31,936
Newark

572
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:40,384
You started and it turns out that many reporters I know including Bill started the

573
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,920
This what you were a local guy you

574
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:44,992
I want what you were doing minor league baseball games at one point

575
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:47,552
I did I once have always been used

576
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,832
Good news for once

577
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,368
How to supplement my income

578
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,904
Tickets lower level Chino

579
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,696
Broadcast News and pay all that

580
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:00,864
So I did I did play-by-play as a way of supplement my income I did play by play football and baseball basket

581
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,632
Ball

582
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:03,168
Track fracas rediff

583
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:07,264
Difficult to do play-by-play.

584
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:13,920
How would you do that well he's running it seems to be running more

585
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:18,528
Call Hughes boxing or he has this shot put in his hand and

586
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:25,440
He takes 5 Steps and Heathrow

587
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:31,072
Do you think there's one moment that which you sort of got your start that started your

588
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,096
The career that we ball

589
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,376
I've been watching Lotus menu

590
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:36,960
Well I do that there was a great hurricane

591
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:37,728
In 19

592
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,264
61 hurricane

593
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,032
Carla

594
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,336
Which was it that Donna nothing

595
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,616
I'm still the largest

596
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,152
In terms of sheer size

597
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,200
Hurricane on record in the Gulf

598
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,528
Oh and I had just started and television had made my move from

599
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,552
Radio India

600
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:52,320
Your television

601
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,088
We're still new to

602
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,392
And we

603
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,672
Wound up in the right place

604
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,208
Wait time on Galvez

605
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:58,976
Kitchen island

606
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,512
The hurricane came in

607
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,352
And that was picked up by other stations nobody else was there

608
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,120
Broadcast

609
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:07,424
So if I had to point the one moment

610
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,448
It's sort of quote

611
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,728
Made my career

612
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:10,496
That was prop

613
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:12,800
Yeah it's funny cuz Bill got his sword

614
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:14,080
Start over the great tattoo

615
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:14,848
A tornado in

616
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:15,872
Kansas tornado

617
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:17,408
Maybe these

618
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:22,784
Maybe these weather events are being caused by ambitious young reporter

619
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,624
You were known for many things but certainly for being

620
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,720
Fearless not know of not only the places you went like War zones but also the way you treat

621
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:32,512
The people in power there was a famous incident

622
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:34,048
Where you got up and you ask

623
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,072
The President Nixon

624
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,096
Questionable

625
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:36,864
During Watergate

626
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,632
He didn't like it

627
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,936
And I believe you said are you running for something

628
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:40,704
And you're famous

629
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,472
Response was

630
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:42,752
No service

631
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:43,520
President

632
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,288
Are you

633
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:56,064
You of course took over as the anchor of the CBS Evening News taking the Baton from Walter Cronkite another Legend

634
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:58,624
Took it from Edward R Murrow so

635
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:01,952
You're part of that line one of the things that people

636
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:05,024
Noticing as you as you settled into that role was you were looking for your

637
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:05,792
Your sign off

638
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:08,608
Cuz famously of course Cronkite would end his broadcast with ATS

639
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,376
The way it is

640
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,424
And what was your thinking

641
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:13,216
I needed something different you needed

642
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:16,288
Suggested to me that you need to sign up

643
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:20,128
Following a legend like that is not easy

644
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:24,224
I did write my first suggestion was maybe I can say well

645
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:25,504
That's some of the way it is

646
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:37,024
That's the way it might be.

647
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,584
What is rape

648
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:40,608
My father

649
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,400
I like father's favorite word

650
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:43,168
Discourage

651
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:43,936
For a lot of reasons

652
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:44,704
Soap

653
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:47,520
I thought well maybe we could just pause and say yeah

654
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,104
What's the CBS Evening News Dan Rather reporting

655
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,128
Courage

656
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,432
The more I thought about it the more I got elected

657
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:56,992
Nostalgic ring for me

658
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:00,064
I will say that the executives in the company

659
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:00,832
We're horrified

660
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,928
Short lasted about a week

661
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:09,792
Interviews that waitress pretty much you either stop using this

662
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:11,840
Sign off or we stop using you

663
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:13,376
Wow so it was easy

664
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:17,984
I just decided not to have one

665
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:22,336
Just went with the playing my best shot didn't work

666
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,200
We can talk to you about your career all night but out of all the people you've interviewed and you interviewed

667
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:29,248
Just about every you know major historical

668
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,296
Go player in last 50 years was there a particular favor

669
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,064
Somebody who

670
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,088
He was glad to talk

671
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,880
Well I'm glad you put the breakfast

672
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,160
Places I've been

673
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:38,720
Lucky and might have a blessed I could give you the names

674
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:39,744
Maybe seven people

675
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,536
But if I had to pick one

676
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:43,840
It would be I was just signed my first major

677
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:45,376
Assignment for CBS News

678
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:47,168
What's the cover dr. Martens

679
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:48,192
The king and what was

680
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:49,984
First in the emerging civil rights

681
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:55,104
Stubborn donkey King

682
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,384
Covering donkey King

683
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,432
Change me as a professional

684
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,736
And it changed me as a person

685
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,552
And for that reason I would see if I had to

686
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:04,320
Typical novel

687
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,368
Give him Doctor Martin

688
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,904
Peking and covering in Bay today

689
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:09,696
Rauscher

690
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:10,464
I imagine that

691
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:17,120
NBA so you have a chance

692
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,656
Whomever do you ever like

693
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:19,936
Miss it

694
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:22,240
Give it like if I was there I would have the quest

695
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:28,896
Like every second

696
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,176
I can imagine

697
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:34,528
Well Dan Rather it is an absolute honor to talk to you but

698
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:37,856
Today we have in fact asked you here to play a game

699
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:38,880
We're calling

700
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:44,256
This game is tougher than the height of an armadillo

701
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:46,560
As I'm sure you know you are famous

702
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:48,864
Nice for what people call rather isms

703
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:55,776
Folksy sayings with colorful metaphors and colorful wisdom you've used so many of them over your career

704
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,568
We want to

705
00:27:57,824 --> 00:28:03,968
See if you can pick the one you actually came up with

706
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:08,320
From some fake ones that we made up

707
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,856
Contribute to you

708
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:15,488
If you can do that two times out of three you'll win a prize for one of our specimens

709
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,792
Bill who is Dan Rather playing for

710
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:20,096
Tori hinderstein of Washington DC

711
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:25,216
Here's your first rather than this was when you were covering the 2000 election

712
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:27,008
Did you say

713
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:30,848
This race is tight like a too-small bathing suit and

714
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:33,152
2 long ride home from the beach

715
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:40,064
Be Papa where your good suit cuz we got ourselves a tie

716
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:46,720
Or see this race is tighter than aunt

717
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:49,024
Tilly after 1/3 Moscow mule

718
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:55,680
Daiquiri

719
00:28:55,936 --> 00:29:02,080
I've always wondered

720
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:06,176
Did you just make those up off the top of your head did you like them have them ready to go

721
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:09,248
In the beginning they came from

722
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:10,528
Working in the oil field

723
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:14,368
This is way men talk about you have got to be kidding me

724
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:18,208
You can only say it

725
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:19,232
It's hot as hell so many

726
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:27,680
Hotter than a Laredo parking lot

727
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:28,960
All right we have two more

728
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:34,336
You did well with that one this is now we're moving through time to the election of 2004 that was George W bush re-elected

729
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:35,360
John Kerry

730
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:39,200
During that evenings coverage on CBS did you say a

731
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:43,808
John Kerry's wife might on Heinz but this is one night he won't catch up

732
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:50,720
Be we used to say if a frog had side

733
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,768
Pockets he'd carry a handgun

734
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:56,096
Or see it all comes down to 208

735
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:59,936
I o which stands for oh hi it's over

736
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:08,896
Definitely be I think you're doing really well

737
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:15,296
Here's your here's your last question this is a great metaphor you use while commenting

738
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:17,856
In the 2016 election was it a

739
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:22,208
This race is a Backcountry Tilt-A-Whirl it could go either way

740
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:24,768
Be like the talking horse

741
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:28,096
Said to the hopping Bowl I can't believe what I'm seeing

742
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:35,264
Or see if Clinton wins Florida this race will go faster than a Hamilton ticket at face value

743
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:43,456
I don't recall seeing any of them

744
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:46,016
Do you know which one you wish you had

745
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:49,344
I guess that would be

746
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:54,720
Bubba like the talking horse head to the hopping bullet is a good one but the one that we were told you said

747
00:30:55,232 --> 00:31:01,376
If Clinton wins Florida this race will go faster than a Hamilton ticket at face value which I thought was great cuz you're updating your pills

748
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,144
