00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,872
Don't talk about John Wick so you play this guy I noticed in the first two movies

581
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:44,896
First of all

582
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:50,784
How come you your character always has to end up looking after John Wicks dog

583
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:53,600
That doesn't seem right to me

584
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:08,192
People ask me this

585
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,216
What is

586
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,240
Karen

587
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,008
Accent

588
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:18,432
I think it is

589
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:32,000
Smooth characters very scared and you don't really

590
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,280
Say much but you're

591
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,048
It's very like

592
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,072
Oh this

593
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:39,424
I have to ask you because

594
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,192
Is Keanu Reeves

595
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,728
Has become such an icon

596
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:42,496
Over the years

597
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:44,288
For kind of just like laconic

598
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,056
Silence

599
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,360
We all think of like sad Keanu

600
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:50,176
Is that what it's really like in the satyrs he likes like

601
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,200
Costly joking around

602
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,272
She's one of the most

603
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:04,512
I'm going to tell you that I've heard this I know people that work with him

604
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:06,560
A generous actor went Ramsey works with people

605
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,608
But his interaction

606
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:11,936
With almost everybody he meets all the other actor

607
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:12,960
Christmas movie

608
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:13,984
Killed

609
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:20,128
I'm wondering like I would like oh let's say the Ninja

610
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,152
Just hey guys

611
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,432
We'll work together and

612
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:25,248
And when I stab you in the I just want you to know I really was

613
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,440
He was very kind

614
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:37,024
He's very kind

615
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,304
You stickers.

616
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,240
The Departed movie

617
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,008
It's basically

618
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:50,592
He kill people but the reason he killed people

619
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:53,920
The reason to kill people in the beginning of the first movie the bad guys kill it

620
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:54,688
Puppy

621
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:56,224
Just pretty traumatic

622
00:25:56,736 --> 00:26:01,344
Nobody cares about that

623
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,720
Puppy

624
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:13,632
Brittonfield Greyjoy who we all know is a loser shows up and kills it

625
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:23,872
So in the movie at the end of the first movie he then gets a dog

626
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:27,456
And then at the beginning of the second movie the first thing he does is it gives the dog

627
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:33,856
Talk to you

628
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,648
And I say no

629
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:36,672
However

630
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:41,536
So like there's this dog and the dog has live now

631
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:43,328
To the second movie now the third movie

632
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:46,656
Oh I saw John Wick

633
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:51,264
It's really great it's even better than the last one and they say is the dog okay

634
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:55,872
Yeah because it turns out that you can do a movie and watch like literally

635
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,920
80 people are murdered

636
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:00,224
And all people care about is the dog

637
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,744
The moment if it came down to you and your character and the dog people be rooting for the dog

638
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,072
Unfortunately

639
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:22,752
Tonight and if the dog doesn't make

640
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:28,896
Go see John Wick 3

641
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,432
The dog is fine

642
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,968

Be imported

671
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,616
Sod and grass onto the

The floor of the room so it can join

Pee without going Outdoors

675
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,784
Orsi ordered the dog a custom cooked

Steak from Japan

677
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:41,856
In a private jet

678
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:43,136
So it would arrive

679
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:43,904
Warm

680
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:45,696
Wow

681
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:46,976
That's a tough one

682
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:59,008
That was actually the sod and grass in the room

683
00:28:59,264 --> 00:28:59,776
Dog outside

684
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:01,056
But you didn't want the dog.

685
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,336
Pitter-patter something

686
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:03,360
Into the concierge

687
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:08,480
Rock the lawn to the dog

688
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:14,368
Concierge at the Ritz-Carlton Cancun was able to help guests enjoy his trip to

689
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,648
The beat by doing which of these

690
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:16,928
Hey

Sun

693
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:23,328
With a 300-foot long shade so he wouldn't get a sunburn

694
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,888
Becoming the waves with the Giant

695

With carpet so we didn't get sand in his toes

698
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:42,528
I'm going to give you a hint this this guy apparently had something in common

Sensitive toes

701
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:00,192
Sometimes concierge's have to say no

702
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:02,240
As when a guest at a safari Lodge

703
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,776
Did Africa ask for what

704
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:06,592

705
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:09,664

The lion is right.

712
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:39,872
The lion to walk up to the girlfriend it would be very brief engagement

713
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:52,672

768
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:20,128
An aisle or window seat

769
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:20,896
Guaranteed

770
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:23,712
No one in the middle seat in and out Aer Lingus ofcourse

771
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:26,528
Is the only airline with its own definition

772
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:27,296
Urban

773
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:34,464
But they're trying

774
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,280
Airlines doing short hops all over Europe

775
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,560
So they've offered this thing

776
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:39,840
4 times the price to get in

777
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:44,448
Nobody in the middle

778
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:50,848
A little over half price

779
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,896
Too dumb to realize that for only twice the price of

780
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:53,664
The standard

781
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,224
You can buy the seat next to you

782
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:58,272
It's very kind of you

783
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:08,000
Thank you thank you very much

784
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:10,304
Adam linguists have Trace

785
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:12,608
The evolution of modern languages backed

786
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:13,376
UPS Store time

787
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:14,400
And it turns out

788
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:17,728
There's one word that hasn't changed at all

789
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:19,264
8000 years

790
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,032
So

791
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:22,592
If you were able to go back in time and meet somebody who spoke

792
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:24,640
The proto-indo-european language

793
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:26,944
You can happily talk to each other about what

794
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:27,968
One word

795
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:29,248
Guys named John

796
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:31,552
No

797
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:33,088
Poop no

798
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:38,464
Very very very few words have survived the Millennia without being

799
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,232
Change since

800
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,256
Some way to different language

801
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,280
Is this one of course

802
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:42,048
Has

803
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:44,096
But you would have to mind the big link

804
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:46,144
Locks

805
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,168
Lock

806
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:48,192
What

807
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:49,216
Roblox

808
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:50,752
Hazmat salmon

809
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:52,544
Is there a smoked salmon

810
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,848
Thousand Years you'll be one

811
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:55,616
Word

812
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:57,920
Hasnat

813
00:34:58,176 --> 00:35:04,320
Look for the salmon that they locked

814
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:10,976
Rite Aid thousand years ago

815
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:16,352
Hieroglyph

816
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:23,520
Had invented

817
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:26,080
They had the bagels at that time it was before the invention

818
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:27,360
Are the wheels of the bagels world

819
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:29,152
Square

820
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:33,760
Now we know this because like I said the word is the same in all languages that have descended from this

821
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,552
Proto-indo-european language

822
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:36,576
Which most of our life

823
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:37,344
You just come

824
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,648
So if the theory about locks is right

825
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,184
That means that Jews

826
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:42,208
Existed back

827
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:46,560
So we can assume proto-indo-european was mostly used to complain

828
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:52,704
Who invented fire did you have to make it so hot

829
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:07,552
Coming up it's lightning fill in the blank the first is the game where you have to listen

I am very exciting but the obligation to be extremely healthy and fit yourself doing all those things

855
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,368
Baidu

856
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:15,136
And I am

857
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:22,304
Walter is a welcome to the show Bill Kurtis is going to be

858
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,376
3 News related limericks for the last word or phrase missing for me

859
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:28,448
If you can fill in that last word or phrase correctly on

860
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,472
Who were the members will be with

861
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:30,240
Ready to play

862
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:33,312
Let's do it here is your first one

863
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:35,872
Tell my drivers not starting a riot

864
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:38,176
He keeps talking about

865
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:39,200
His new diet

866
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:41,248
But I don't want to talk

867
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,296
I might get out and walk

868
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:44,576
I'll pay more

869
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:46,624
If the driver stays

870
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,696
Yes

871
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:50,464
Uber

872
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:56,352
You know that they're now offering quiet mode with the Press of a button when you order the car

873
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,656
You can let your driver know you'd rather not talk

874
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:03,776
All right it's all part of Uber's lifelong mission of making their customers rides more enjoyable

875
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:06,336
And making their drivers feel more and more like ghost

876
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:08,640
Oh my God I

877
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:09,408
Cannot wait

878
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:14,016
You should know how I know that it's only available with Uber black

879
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:16,832
That's the high-end expensive limo option

880
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:19,648
And if you don't want quiet never fear if

881
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:22,464
Do you prefer customers can also select a talkative preference

882
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:24,000
But that

883
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:27,072
Do you need to do this

884
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:28,608
You don't need to do this

885
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:30,400
It's all you need to do is get into the car

886
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,168
And say something like

887
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:34,240
Like so have I ever told you about the miracle of dianetics

888
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:38,336
Your driver will not talk to you

889
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:40,128
Here is your neck slimmer

890
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,408
Something bites

891
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:42,688
Can't be scratched

892
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:44,224
Text with Muirhead shrugs

Does dinosaurs may have had

900
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:05,728
Bed bugs and yes it's true that dinosaurs

901
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:08,544
Had bed bugs really surprising thing is that dinosaurs

902
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,568
Had been

903
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:12,384
A new study based on

904
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,224

It's also not street legal

941
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:36,608
You can't have it towed to a parking lot and driving around there

942
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:41,728
And the drivers will need to spend 30 hours with a learner's permit to kill before they get their life

943
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:44,288
I can't remember when
