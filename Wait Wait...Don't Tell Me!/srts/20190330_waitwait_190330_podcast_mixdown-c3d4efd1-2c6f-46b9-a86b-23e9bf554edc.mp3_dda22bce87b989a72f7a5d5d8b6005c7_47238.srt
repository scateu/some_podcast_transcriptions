Exoneration

78
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:18,144

Republicans Or democrats

86
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:43,744

He's not going to be president after all

91
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,008
But the people who are really

92
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,544
Are the hard

93
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,080

Cupertino at their headquarters

135
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,527
The fact that their products are in a billion pockets it's kind of a

136
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:51,487
Call Bro

137
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:57,887
Alright friend of

138
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:01,983
Viewers and secondly it's not right but I just

139
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:06,591
Would love to live in a world in which Oprah came out

140
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,895
Unannounced her alliance with hot pocket

141
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:14,527
You gave me

142
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,807
The clue that it's in

143
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,599
You know aliens are pockets

144
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:21,439
You put hot

145
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:26,047
That's weather

146
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,607
No it's not Hot Pockets like I said it was a tech

147
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,375
Company

148
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:38,335
Is an apple a man

149
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,127
Big Apple event

150
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:43,199
They didn't introduce any new Apple devices kasiri

151
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,735
At this point what's left

152
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,039
The Apple IUD

153
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,855
No instead they said they were getting

154
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,647
The two new kinds of businesses first

155
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,183
Apple TV

156
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,999
They brought out a bunch of big stars like Oprah Winfrey

157
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,535
You tell us they would be putting out

158
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,071
New original program

159
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:02,655
Everybody was so excited because I thought Opera was

160
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,423
The new

161
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,191
Apple

162
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,215
Product

163
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:05,983
SiriusXM

164
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:08,543
If she tells you what to do Oprah what's the weather like

165
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:14,687
If you believe in yourself the Sun never stops shining on you I'm wondering if

166
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,967
Now that apple is hurt

167
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:17,503
Did you mention the IUD

168
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,807
Hahaha

169
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:23,647
If they want now I'm not I am not a biology expert

170
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,695
Nora sex master

171
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,511
Would it be accurate

172
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:31,071
To say that it was a camera on the IUD

173
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,351
It would see the

174
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,375
Sperm going

175
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,215
It would have to have to be like a special

176
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,751
Slow motion camera

177
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:40,799
Technically

178
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:41,567
We can work that in there

179
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,871
Yeah we want the government having that

180
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,175
They already do

181
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:49,759
The amounts to that it was like

182
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,527
Apple credit

183
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,551
Red card

184
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,831
And then Apple are

185
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,111
Arcades

186
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,391
I don't know how Apple

187
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,415
Go to the bank biz

188
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:07,167
The first credit card ever to have real

189
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:07,935
Really crappy battery

190
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,751
Did you know

191
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:13,823
Knowing Apple you're going to have to probably buy it

192
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:20,223
Special reader and then a special adapter

193
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,527

Eminem Christine's Wicked on Twitter reacting to the news that NASA had canceled

198
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:35,583
What historic first they had schedule for this week

199
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:42,495
It was supposed to be the first all-female face wash

200
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:47,871
You want to go on this show we celebrated this planned landmark

201
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,431
Can space exploration the first all-women spacewalk but it was

202
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,967
Is canceled and why

203
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:55,551
Because they didn't have enough space suits in women's size

204
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:59,135
It is true that always thinks when you find the perfect

205
00:08:59,391 --> 00:08:59,903
Outfit

206
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:03,999
Keep your blood from boiling out in the vacuum of space and they don't have it in your side

207
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:07,583
The question is right that it turns out like literally they have like

208
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,607
Only one

209
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,375
Space suit

210
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,143
That fits

211
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,423
A woman so the

212
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,191
Second woman

213
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,215
Didn't go

214
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:15,007
And the question is why

215
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,287
Couldn't NASA

216
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,823
Make another one

217
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:21,663
It's a cliche to say you know they put a man on the moon if they can't do this

218
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:28,063
These are literally the people who put a man on the moon

219
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,855
Hanging around

220
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,951
Throw their stuff down when they're done from

221
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:34,719
The trip

222
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:41,119
Put the clothes away neatly and then they don't have them

Pope

230
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,351
Well this week

231
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,143
We found out he really doesn't like it

232
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,423
When you try to kiss his what

233
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,495
All right I got to be careful

234
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,567

The Pope's ring but this week this

238
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,575
Video of Pope

239
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,111
Francis went viral where he

240
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,951
Repeatedly yanked his hand away from people trying to

241
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:40,767
Kiss it was very strange there were even trying to use their tongue

242
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,815
The video

243
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:46,655
It's great the Polaris heinle shaking hands with

244
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,935
Baseline pilgrims waiting

245
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:50,751
But when they go to kisses ringing like vinyl

246
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,031
Takes his hand away

247
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:52,799
And it's not

248
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,847
Some of it all and you can see his lips moving

249
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:57,151
As he says download too slow

250
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:01,759
The funniest thing about that video

251
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,039
What was it was like

252
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,575

256
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,719
Like this

257
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:21,471
Juke music

258
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:27,871
What is done instead of taking social cues from the situation

259
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,407
There was strategizing

260
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,455
Yeah you know that

261
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,247

332
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,775
There's not a lot you can do it for

333
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,311
Where does $5,000 buy at

334
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,687
Used car 1000 Footlong sandwiches from Subway or one bag of groceries from Whole Foods

Poundstone

344
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:29,119
Good knock against Tesla

345
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,679
Is that the only make cars for the uber-rich

346
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,215
Not the Uber driver

347
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,287
That's been absolutely true until now

348
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,311
Elon Musk

349
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:42,431
Has created a car that will retail brand new for $5,000

350
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,247
The body of the car is made of pound

351
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,271
Did soda cans

352
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:53,439
It is remarkably light in the advertising potential for the beverage companies may even further lower the overall cost

353
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,207
Of these

354
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:54,975
Vehicles

355
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,791
The cars have no temperature controls the seats

356
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,071
Do not move there are no

357
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,607
Computer components

358
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:04,191
There is no phone charger there is no radio or sound

359
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,495
Laughingly suggest

360
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:09,823
Set this Tesla should be the real Hummer

361
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,151
Because if the driver wants music no have to hum

362
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:16,991
He said the baby these drivers will return to the practice of

363
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:21,599
Well they drive or even the practice of thinking about driving

364
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,903
The car seats only one

365
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:29,791
So although it is not a family car it is a car for someone who has spent a lot of time with their family

366
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,375
The majority of the interior of the

367
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,655
The car is storage

368
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,191

369
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:39,007
Vinegar and baking soda that power at

370
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:45,919
The company says they don't expect to sell a lot of the $5,000 cars but that's not the point the point

371
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,455
To shut up all the people

372
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:49,759
Complaining about how much their other cars cost

373
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:57,439
Tesla comes out with the $5,000 model powered by

374
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,207
Vinegar and bake

375
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:58,975

435
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,479
Diversion of hair

436
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,807
Or God forbid in all white raisins

00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:00,575
In the Sun

438
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:05,695
But audience members at North Bergen High School

439
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,487
Surprised to see a stage version

440
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,279
Teen 79

441
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:11,583
And science fiction horror movie Alien

442
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,119
With spaceships

443
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,399
Space suit

444
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:18,751
1 Facehugger and a very scary full-grown Xenomorph

445
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:19,775
All done

446
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:20,543
For judge

447
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,079
$5,000

448
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,103
Or the cost

449
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,895
Cost of 10 laptops for pores

450
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:30,527
Originally the school had planned to do Romeo and Juliet butts

451
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,807
Students felt the play about

452
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,623
Teenagers being overly emotional and overreact

453
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,903
Nothing to being told no

454
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,695
Just didn't seem realistic

455
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:41,023
So they went with alien

456
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,071
The film about the

457
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,863
Space crew that is forced to fight

458
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:45,631
A terrifying

459
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,399
Sharptooth

460
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,679
Extraterrestrial

461
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:50,751
Was adapted for the stage and directed by English

462
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,799
Teacher perfecto quavo

463
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:56,127
And was designed by fellow teacher Steven defendini

464
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:59,199
Their names clearly indicate that they are both

465
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:02,271
In the witness protection program

466
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:05,343
The fact that reproduction could cost only

467
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,903
$5,000 is a testament to some

468
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:08,671
Ingenuity

469
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,439
And hard work

470
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,463
Especially

471
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,255
Given that everything was made

472
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,535
Recycled material

473
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:16,351
The play went viral and the response has been in

474
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,119
Incredible

475
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,167
Patton Oswalt to saw a clip

476
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,703
The play tweeted

477
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,775
This blows my high school's adaptation of pink

478
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,055
Flamingos out-of-the-way

479
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,615
The students are asked

480
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,151
Anxiously awaiting the review in there

481
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:29,919
School paper

482
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,967
Which will almost certainly say

483
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:32,735
Quote

484
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:33,759
The play was

485
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:35,039
Lip or whatever

486
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,063
But don't forget

487
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,087
They're all still no

488
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:46,815
One of these things only $5,000 was it from polyps

489
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:51,935
Brownstone a low and model of a Tesla that runs not on battery power button

490
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:52,703
Baking soda and

491
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:53,983
Vinegar

492
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:58,591
Brian Babylon I ramen restaurant open for only $5,000 because really

493
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,639
That's what Ramen cost

494
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,407
Or

495
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:04,223
From Hari kondabolu $5,000 pays for a heist

496
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:07,551
School production of a dramatic adaptation

497
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:12,159
Of the movie Alien which of these is a real story of frugality in the news

498
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:12,927
This week

499
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,487

Yeah apparently everybody if you can do that as well

503
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:28,287
What we spoke to somebody who is deeply involved in this remarkable

504
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,055
Project

505
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,359
Arctic Invasion alien popped out of

506
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:35,967
Small budget

507
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:41,343
That was Brian Bonacci he's the technical and lighting director for the North Bergen High School production of

508
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,879
Alien I've never

509
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:43,903
Been prouder

510
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:50,303
The country New Jersey then this very moment and if you haven't seen it I highly recommend finding online

511
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,095
Find the videos taken of this production

512
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:54,655
It's arguably better than the movie

513
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:55,935
Meanwhile

514
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:58,751

And now the game where you get rewarded for doing things that one you actual rewards instead of this

518
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:35,872
Andrew Reynolds is a Broadway star most famous for creating the lead role in Book of Mormon and he's gone on to

Managers of mine did you talk to the manager at Nacho Mama's we had heard that this was in fact a Hallmark

527
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,544

Kept like losing jobs

529
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:07,616
Is that right

530
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:11,712
Okay well it was by my choice just to be clear all right

531
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:14,272
I was very good at an interview

532
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:19,648
A very solid job interview and then I would get the job show up

533
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,184
Work for one day

534
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,232
Decide I hated it and then leave

535
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,256
Braylon

536
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:26,304
So can you get me an example of the kind of job you

537
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,840
If you did for the day then left

538
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,888
Well I did work at

539
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:33,472
Restaurant near Columbia University Health Nacho Mama's

540
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:38,336
And I worked there as a host for one day and then I do

541
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:40,640
Never return

542
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:42,944
This is Paula Poundstone can I ask you a question

543
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,784
When you applied for work at Nacho Mama's had you been there before I do

544
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,832
You seen it did you know what you were

545
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:52,928
In4s Paula I am sad to say I knew exactly what I was getting

546
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,256
I had only been

547
00:22:56,512 --> 00:23:00,608
Drunk at that bar I had never thought about what it would actually be like to work for drunk

548
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:02,400
People at the bar

549
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:07,776
Did you ask any questions during your interview did you ever say like so what will I do

550
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:09,824
I

551
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:14,944
I was a temp at Ernst & Young

552
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,016
And they asked me all these questions about like it

553
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:20,832
Do you know how to answer phone. Like sure

554
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,744
And then when you're not know how to answer phones well

555
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,144
I think like I think they were multiple line

556
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:40,032
Call my own experience that was watching Lily Tomlin in 92508

557
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,056
Now you grew up

558
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:45,408
In a Omaha we were just talking about theater kids in high school so I assumed you were one

559
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,736
Well I yes but I went to an all-boys Catholic

560
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:52,064
School that did not have a drama program so I did

561
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,856
But Community Theater shows

562
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:01,024
Which means I would often be like I remember when I was like I don't know Seventeen and I did a production of a Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum

563
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,864
The woman I was playing opposite was like 45

564
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:11,520

566
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:15,872
So great

567
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:28,416
Were there things that you learned

568
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:31,232
You think perhaps were specific to Catholic School

569
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:37,632
Call I would say shame and guilt

570
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:39,936

Fastest way to make your mother feel bad

573
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,640
When you move off to New York

574
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:52,480
To be a performer and how quickly did it take you to get actually performing

575
00:24:55,296 --> 00:25:00,160
Summer Stock jobs like right after like while I was still in college and then I did some

576
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:06,560
Dinner theater in Westchester and then I did a really unfortunate Toribash okay

577
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:07,840
Call Pokemon live

578
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:12,448
Wait till you were in a life Pokemon

579
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:15,520
Otis

580

581
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:26,528
I'm a trained actor can you give us a sample I've no idea what this

00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:30,112
Can you give us like a sample of what your lines were from Pokemon the

583
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:30,880
The stage

584
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:31,648
Spectacular

585
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:37,792
No I will not

586
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:40,608
We read that you used to audition

587
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:42,656
All the time with just one song

588
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:45,472
That's correct

589
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:49,824
Decided for myself that I sounded very good singing Born to Run

590
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,104
Brian wow

591
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,664
By Bruce Springsteen so I would just

592
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,224
Sing that for every audition whether it was

593
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,504
Correct or not

594
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,880
Like I sang it for my audition for the Lincoln Center Revival of stop

595
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:09,536
And sing it for the Revival of Fiddler on the Roof

596
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,888
Do you Channel like that

597
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:14,912
Like white men

598
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:15,680
Emotional

599
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:17,984
Next song

600
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:18,752
Perform

601
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:25,152
Well lucky for me I'm an emotional white man

602
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:27,200
Yes I was lucky enough to

603
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:28,480
See you in the Book of Mormon

604
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:29,504
Fantastical

605
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,088
But it's very hard for me to imagine you

606
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,624
Singing Born to Run

607
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,928

609
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:47,424
No

610
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:52,544
Well Andrew Riddle That is an absolute pleasure to talk to you but now it is time

611
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,592
Play a game with you when we are calling it

612
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:55,872

613
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:56,896
Merman

614
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:59,968
Who started the Book of Mormon

615
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:01,504
But what do you know about the book of merman

616
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,040
Mainly

617
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,576
Ethel Merman

618
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,392

00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,544
All right here we go

624
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:27,616
First question there a lot of stories of Ethel Merman quote

625
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:28,896
Colorful language

626
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:33,760
Once she was backstage at Gypsy of course your big signature roll

627
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:37,856
An overheard of the stage manager swearing in front of the children in the

628
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:38,624
The cast

629
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,160
What did she say

630
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,440
Was it a

631
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:45,792
Nobody corrupts those little angels but me so blue

632
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,376
Be nothing she just sang a Hi-C until everybody's

633
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,144
LED

634
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:55,264
Or see quote she said don't say in front of the kids

635
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,384
I'm going with c

636
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,152
Your

637
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:12,416
Colorful language there's a story that when a religious Hollywood actress asks you to put a dollar in a

638
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:14,464
Swear jar for saying Hell she

639
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,000
She said well how much do I have

640
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:19,328
To put in to make you

641
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:25,728
Alright next question Ethel Merman fourth and final marriage was the actor Ernest Borgnine

642
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:28,288
Yeah it lasted only 32 days

643
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:31,616
Wow what did she say about the marriage in her autobiography

644
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:35,712
He was at a my marriage to Borgnine was the only thing shorter than he was

645
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:40,832
Be at work he did McHale's Navy at home he was McHale's lazy

646
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:44,416
Or see nothing the chapter entitled my marriage

647
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,696
Ernest Borgnine

648
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:46,720

00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:56,704
See it was only a blank

652
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,472
Page

653
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:02,080
All right yeah it was not good after that there a very stories about why their marriage broke up

654
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:08,736
One of them believe it or not is that Borgnine used to like to fart in bed and then pull up the covers giving her a so-called Dutch of

655
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,552
And I wish I was kidding

656
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:14,368
What was Yoda's last one right answer you win for your list

657
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:19,232

00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:22,944
About 1/2 in your ring finger

751
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,248
I'm engaged and it's going to be a Jewish

752
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:30,880
So the internet responded to this with its normal restraint

753
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:32,928
And by the time

754
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:35,488
It was over Bob Mueller had his neck

755
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:37,792
Crime to investigate

756
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:41,888
People from St Louis God bless them tried to defend this track

757
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:44,704
Convenient little slices to use

758
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:48,544
Dipping in the traditional Bagel topping in St Louis

759
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,080
Creamed ham

760
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:54,176
I think that it's okay however anybody want

761
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,200
To cut their bagel

762
00:33:55,968 --> 00:34:00,064
It's okay now Paula I know why you say that

763
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,856
And I think it speaks well of you that

764
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:02,624
You feel that way

765
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:03,648
However

766
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:04,672
You're wrong

767
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:11,328
Paula most New Yorkers have had experience

768
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,608
Places with rats or roaches

769
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:14,144
Are pigeons before the last two weeks

770
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,936
New York City has been dealing with a

771
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:17,472
Bizarre infestation of wasps

772
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:19,008
Squirrels

773
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,032
No they've got that

774
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:21,056
Unusual

775
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:23,616
Sorry I'm fat

776
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:24,640

Actually pictures of the only kind that I haven't seen yet

780
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,184
There's been a

781
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,304
Work work here in a quack quack now I'll give it to you though it's basically

782
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,072
Farm animal

783
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:49,472
Farm animals in New York City

784
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:53,056
Oh that's what happened

785
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:56,640
Alright a couple of weeks ago Alam was spotted in Brooklyn on the Gowanus

786
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:57,664
Expressway

787
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,248
A few days ago of a cow is found in the major Deegan Expressway

788
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:04,064
If you're wondering why this is happening these animals have places

789
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,856
Has to go in the subway is totally unreliable

790
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:10,208
You know I would not come out what was the first one was it

791
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:11,744

792
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,328
Goat in the Bronx

793
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,864
An infestation

794
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:22,752
What was the lamb a cow a goat and another

795
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:28,384
How's that

796
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,920
I think what's happening

797
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:30,688
People have any

798
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:31,456
Farm Fresh

799
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:32,992
Animals like Elvis

800
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:33,760
Is this milk

801
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:34,528
It's right outside

802
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,064
And then you got sloppy

803
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,624

807
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:49,888
Instead of Farm to Plate it's backyard to play

808
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:56,288
Yeah maybe it was because all these annoying Brooklyn hipsters are moving to Farms Upstate and the farm animals

809
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,640
We gotta get out of here

810
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:08,320
