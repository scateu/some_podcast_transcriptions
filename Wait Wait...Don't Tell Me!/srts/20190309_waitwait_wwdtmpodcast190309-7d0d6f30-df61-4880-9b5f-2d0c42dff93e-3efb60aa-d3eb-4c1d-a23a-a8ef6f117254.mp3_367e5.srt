Today we discuss something we never have to think about here which is

47
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:42,912
Closing

48
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:43,936
There's so many questions

49
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:46,240
For example should we now be wearing

I'm ready

90
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,048
Here is your first

91
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:16,096
Well at least

92
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:19,680
There won't be hate that was David Waldman

93
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:24,288
Twitter celebrating the passage Thursday but bold resolution in Congress condemning hate

94
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,312
By whom

95
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:26,848
The Congress

96
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:28,640
The Congress has which half of Congress

97
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,992
House Representatives

98
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:39,392
Which

99
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:45,792
On Thursday all the Democrats in the house voted to condemn bigotry so hopefully you all got in you

100
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:48,352
Your bigotry before it became illegal today

101
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:51,680
The Democrats took over the House of Representatives in January and then

102
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,448
Reunited

103
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,216
Determined and

104
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:53,984
And focused

105
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,800
And it was amazing that lasted all of 6 weeks

106
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:57,568
Before

107
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:00,640
They reverted to their natural state of backstabbing and purity

108
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:01,664
Testing

109
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,784
This week's disaster all started around representative ilhan Omar who said something something

110
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,064
People that was anti-Semitic

111
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,344
She says it wasn't

112
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,392
And the argument got so bad even

113
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:19,583
Finally decided

114
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,375
To deal with it by passing a resolution

115
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,911
I'm condemning all kinds of hate

116
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:25,215
Including anti-Semitism racism

117
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:28,799
Islamophobia and whatever Taylor Swift was upset about in that sauce

118
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,847
It didn't start with

119
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:34,687
Adjust anti-semitism

120
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,967
People on

121
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:36,991
Weird sort of

122
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,807
Bizarre political thing that only Democrats could

123
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,135
Resolution

124
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:46,463
We don't like hate yeah we don't like hate and they all decided they could

125
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,231
Rihanna

126
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:48,767
Except

127
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,303
21 Republicans

128
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,327
Voted against

129
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,887
I know you're tired.

130
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:56,703
I don't know why they would do that

131
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,495
Vote Yes and everything and Mike

132
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,031
It's like when someone

133
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:06,431
When someone is beating themselves up you just sort of get out of the way and make sure you don't get hit by there.

134
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,967
I feel like I should just be like

135
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:09,247
Works

136
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:12,063
Take a the week off and you guys like

137
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,111
Just fight against each other for a second

138
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,903
Open primary

139
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,183
Sure sounds that there's fight among

140
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,023
Can you be

141
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,559
Critical of Israel

142
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,863
Without being anti-Semitic

143
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,679
Okay

144
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:30,239
And if it isn't anti-Semitism if you

145
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,263
You just hate Jared

146
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,943
Alright your next quote is a Washington Post comment

147
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,711
On a landmark

148
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,247
In space exploration

149
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,015
And it's scheduled

150
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:45,343
It's just too astronautics

151
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,623

152
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:49,951
Is it all goes according to schedule next week NASA will stage

153
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,743
The first all-female

154
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:52,511

00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,279
Flight

156
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,327

158
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,399

All female spacewalk is baby cousin

162
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,687
In space no one can hear you say one

163
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:14,271
At the end of March

164
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,039

Altogether 245 miles above the Earth

168
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,975
Cuz that's literally how far you have to go to

169
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:29,119
Really avoid getting harassed at work

170
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,399
Why do women always

171
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,423

172
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,191

00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:57,407
Which way do I place the toilet paper on the toilet paper holder

457
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:04,319
You can go with the end-of-the-world draped over the top causing the paper to Cascade over the front like a pillow a waterfall or you can

458
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,111
Can go with the End of the Roll Touch This

460
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:15,071
You don't care which way your toilet paper emerges from its cochiti to Plica

00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:41,695

475
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:52,191
Definitive proof of proper paper plates

476
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,751
Over the top of the Roll

477
00:19:55,007 --> 00:20:01,151
Over

478
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:03,455

Tell no longer argue over toilet paper plates instead argue about everything else

481
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:14,207
Importantly toilet paper itself can rest easy

482
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:19,071
Knowing it shall never again before stick our under the oppressive yoke of the role for which it

483
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:25,471

00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,343
These are the question

488
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,647
One of which

00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,695

00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:02,240
Not because the ceremony

Surprised when you finally won or you were like it

My turn

00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,232
It's been 21 years

545
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,000
The last night

546
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,280

00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,816

00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:00,352

549
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:03,424
Time I better grab this now

550
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:05,728
You're the First costume designer we've ever

551
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,520
I just wanted to go over some basic

552
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:10,080
So you're the costume designer Thrift

553
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:12,896
Do you ever do you ever deal with like actor egos like

554
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,176
Perfect costume for

555
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,712
The character like I'm not going to

556
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,248
Don't you know

557
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:21,344
I guess you deal with that cuz he goes on a different level you know so

558
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,112
Sometimes day

559
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:25,696
They say you know I can't wear that color you know or

560
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:29,536
But because we're rediscovering a character we are both

561
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,584
Kind of contributing to the conversation

562
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:36,192
Write the application just say yes so maybe your character has a bigger butt

563
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:43,360
It's amazing to me that everything else you have to do you have to pretend to listen to actors

564
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:47,968
I'm sorry that's a hard job

565
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:49,504

Kitchen country

572
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:03,840
You are the most qualified person to

573
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:06,144
Ask about something that I've always thought

574
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,168
Which is that a great problem

575
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:08,192
For making comic book

576
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,728
Is that unlike in

577
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:10,496
Comic books

578
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:12,288
People wearing superhero suits

579
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,056
In real life

580
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,336
Essentially look dumb

581
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:18,688
Yeah because they don't realize it's their whole process to making that

582
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,224
You just don't go to

583
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:20,992

00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,016

587
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:25,344
So how you think about me

588
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,904
I grew up where we were watching like dumb superhero shows

589
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,928
MTV like Batman

590
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:29,952
People just look

591
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:30,720
Dumb

592
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:32,512
Yeah

593
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:34,560
So how do you make it so like

594
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,840
The Black Panther when he's in his suit

595
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,120
Superhero suit running around

596
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,656
Doesn't look dumb

597
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:40,448
Yeah well we do a muscle School

598
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,216

599
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:46,592
When will we take a vacuform kind of mannequin

601
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,896

602
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:49,664

Body form

604
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,968

00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:54,784
The clay to his muscles and weave

606
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,552
Reform

607
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:57,856
A superhero kind of stuff

608
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:58,880
The physique

609
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:01,184
Are you telling me that that

610
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:07,584
The secret not all Chadwick Boseman how much Muscle Milk you drink you're never going

611
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,632

The kids have it Halloween at the muscles in

615
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:27,552
It's not exaggerated as

616
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:33,952
She might think it's just a little you know because we don't want to you know to really make this up

617
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:38,304
But in the other direction

618
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,584
More shoulders

619
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:47,776
You are going to win more than an Oscar if

You ready to play Ruth here's your first question

661
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:47,072
Garfield was invented by his

662
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:50,656
Creator Jim Davis back in 1978 what inspired mr. Davis to

663
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,424
To create the bull

664
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,448
All the characters

665
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,472

Cleaned himself by licking his

671
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:08,320
Or see a desire to create a quote a good marketable character unquote

672
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:10,368
That would make him a lot of money

673
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:13,952
Tubby tabby

674
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,256
No

675
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:23,936
See he wanted to make a lot of money

676
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:24,960
Set the time they're all the

677
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:25,984

I might enjoy a cat

681
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:32,128
So he created it

682
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:32,896
To be popular

683
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:33,920
