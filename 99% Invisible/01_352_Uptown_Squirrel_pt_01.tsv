EDL	00:01:21,920	00:01:23,200	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	And when he started

EDL	00:02:36,672	00:02:38,464	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	Which is like the squirrel
EDL	00:02:38,464	00:02:40,768	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	It's what you'll find in just about any American city
EDL	00:02:41,280	00:02:42,304	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	But especially Central
EDL	00:02:42,816	00:02:45,120	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	So we need to be on the 10th down there okay
EDL	00:02:45,632	00:02:47,424	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	Well I'm going to

EDL	00:03:07,648	00:03:13,280	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	The job of a census volunteer is to count all the squirrels they can find within their assigned hectares
EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:14,560	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	And only
EDL	00:03:14,560	00:03:15,840	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	Verisign hectares
EDL	00:03:16,352	00:03:20,192	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	Although this doesn't stops you from getting incredibly excited by every squirrel

EDL	00:03:28,384	00:03:31,200	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	After every hectare in the park has been surveyed
EDL	00:03:31,200	00:03:37,600	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	All the data will get plugged into a wildlife counting formula popularized by the great mid-century Danish Amir

EDL	00:03:45,024	00:03:48,608	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	And then finally spit out a number that the world has been waiting for
EDL	00:03:49,376	00:03:51,168	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	The squirrel abundance number
EDL	00:03:51,680	00:03:55,520	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	The total population of eastern gray squirrels in Central Park
EDL	00:03:56,288	00:03:56,800	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	Give or take
EDL	00:03:57,312	00:04:00,896	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	At which point you would be totally justified in asking as many do
EDL	00:04:01,408	00:04:03,200	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	What precisely is a point
EDL	00:04:03,712	00:04:05,504	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	And knowing the squirrel abundance number
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:06,528	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	What they're saying is like
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:08,576	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	You're counting squirrels like

EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:13,184	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	In people's minds
EDL	00:04:13,696	00:04:18,047	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	And it's to be ignored like it's assumed I think that
EDL	00:04:18,047	00:04:21,119	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	Because they're so common we know everything we need to know about squirrels
EDL	00:04:21,119	00:04:22,399	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	But it's true
EDL	00:04:22,911	00:04:23,935	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	The very fact
EDL	00:04:23,935	00:04:27,519	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	But no one has bothered to do a Central Park Squirrel census before

EDL	00:04:48,255	00:04:53,375	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	Girls we see in our cities and towns are so everyday so ubiquitous so

EDL	00:04:55,167	00:04:57,983	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	That is easy to assume they've always been there
EDL	00:04:58,751	00:04:59,519	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	But the truth is

EDL	00:05:21,279	00:05:24,095	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	These were animals you could only see if you left
EDL	00:05:24,095	00:05:26,655	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	And then even perhaps left the farm

EDL	00:05:46,879	00:05:48,671	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	And when it was discovered in a tree
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:51,743	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	A crowd of people gathered in amazement
EDL	00:05:51,743	00:05:53,279	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	Trying to lower it down
EDL	00:05:53,279	00:05:55,839	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	Eventually the crowd grew so large and rowdy
EDL	00:05:55,839	00:05:56,607	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	The police
EDL	00:05:56,607	00:05:58,399	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	Had to forcibly disperse
EDL	00:05:59,423	00:06:01,215	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	So how do these eastern gray squirrels
EDL	00:06:01,727	00:06:03,775	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	These are exclusive Woodland creatures
EDL	00:06:03,775	00:06:05,567	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	Make their way into urban spaces
EDL	00:06:06,335	00:06:07,871	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	Well for starters is Etienne
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:08,895	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	They didn't
EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:10,431	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	At least not on the road
EDL	00:06:10,943	00:06:15,039	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	What was so fascinating to me was to find out that they have been intentionally introduced
EDL	00:06:15,039	00:06:17,343	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	The squirrels that we all take for granted as we
EDL	00:06:17,343	00:06:18,367	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	Walk to the park
EDL	00:06:18,879	00:06:21,183	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	On our way to the gym or the office
EDL	00:06:21,183	00:06:23,487	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	Are only there because we put them there
EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:26,559	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	They were deliberately brought into cities
EDL	00:06:26,559	00:06:27,327	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	And fed
EDL	00:06:27,327	00:06:27,839	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	And shelter
EDL	00:06:28,351	00:06:32,959	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	The first city that we know of to introduce squirrels was Philadelphia in 1847
EDL	00:06:33,727	00:06:36,543	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	Like many East Coast cities of the mid-nineteenth century
EDL	00:06:36,543	00:06:38,335	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	It was already a highly Urban environment
EDL	00:06:39,103	00:06:41,151	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	People urine for a taste of the wilderness
EDL	00:06:41,151	00:06:43,199	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	That the squirrel was seen to embody
EDL	00:06:43,199	00:06:44,479	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	They were captured in
EDL	00:06:44,479	00:06:46,783	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	The Wilderness brought into the city
EDL	00:06:46,783	00:06:49,087	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	And placed on a single tree
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:51,135	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	Almost as if they were animals
EDL	00:06:51,135	00:06:52,927	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	In a menagerie or a zoo
EDL	00:06:53,439	00:06:55,999	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	The tree was in the middle of a small public
EDL	00:06:55,999	00:06:59,071	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	Square and it was equipped with a wooden shelter and offense
EDL	00:06:59,071	00:07:01,887	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	So the squirrels could stay safe from the elements
EDL	00:07:01,887	00:07:05,215	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	And any would-be predators in their little squirrel home
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:08,031	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	A few other cities like Boston
EDL	00:07:08,031	00:07:08,543	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	Replicate
EDL	00:07:09,823	00:07:11,615	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	First the number of squirrels
EDL	00:07:11,615	00:07:12,639	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	With teeny tiny
EDL	00:07:13,407	00:07:15,711	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	Philadelphia started out with only three
EDL	00:07:15,711	00:07:17,503	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	Think of it as a trial run
EDL	00:07:17,503	00:07:19,295	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	Only this first trial run
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:20,319	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	It went terribly
EDL	00:07:20,319	00:07:25,183	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	When I started working on this topic I thought okay you introduce a few squirrels into an urban
EDL	00:07:25,183	00:07:25,951	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	Park
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:28,255	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	In a few years you're going to have 2002 Scrolls no problem
EDL	00:07:29,023	00:07:30,303	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	At the very beginning
EDL	00:07:30,303	00:07:32,351	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	They were essentially incapable of Survivor
EDL	00:07:33,119	00:07:36,959	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	The cities of the 19th century just didn't have the kind of large Park
EDL	00:07:36,959	00:07:38,495	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	An extensive tree cover we see
EDL	00:07:38,495	00:07:41,311	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	When you thought about Urban landscapes
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:42,847	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	Are very unfriendly
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:45,407	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	To an animal that required trees for food
EDL	00:07:46,175	00:07:48,991	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	In the classic storybook image of a squirrel
EDL	00:07:48,991	00:07:50,271	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	Always clutching in a car
EDL	00:07:50,783	00:07:51,807	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	And then that's basically true
EDL	00:07:52,319	00:07:55,903	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	Wild Squirrel requires deciduous nut bearing plants such as Oaks
EDL	00:07:56,415	00:07:57,439	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	In order to survive
EDL	00:07:57,951	00:07:58,975	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	Without trees
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:08:00,255	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	If the city had to provide for
EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:00,767	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	The squirrels
EDL	00:08:01,279	00:08:04,607	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	But the squirrel feed often proved to be either insufficient
EDL	00:08:04,607	00:08:05,887	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	Are nutritionally worthless
EDL	00:08:06,655	00:08:08,959	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	So those first squirrels either died off
EDL	00:08:08,959	00:08:09,983	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	Were killed
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:10,751	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	Word opposites
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:18,175	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	In 1855 the reporter for the Boston evening transcript describe the introduction of squirrels
EDL	00:08:18,175	00:08:18,687	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	As quote
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:21,503	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	Absurd and reprehensible experiment
EDL	00:08:22,015	00:08:24,063	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	Which raises the question
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:27,647	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	Why are there no squirrels everywhere in American cities
EDL	00:08:28,671	00:08:31,231	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	I think it's more a model of if you build it they will come

EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:43,263	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	Specifically in New York City
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:46,079	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	And he says that in the late 19th century
EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:49,151	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	Green spaces like New York's were undergoing a transformation

EDL	00:09:01,183	00:09:02,463	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	And by the 1870s

EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:11,679	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	And although they were designed for people

EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:17,823	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	Just might be the best thing to ever happen to the eastern gray squirrel
EDL	00:09:18,847	00:09:20,383	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	The parks weren't just big
EDL	00:09:21,151	00:09:23,455	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	They were also designed to mimic the natural world
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:26,783	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	Take Central Park and Prospect Park in New York for example

EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:41,375	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	They also chose to
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:43,167	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	To keep the areas dramatic Rocky outcrop
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:45,471	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	Instead of blasting them away
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:47,263	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	That's been done with the rest of
EDL	00:09:47,775	00:09:50,591	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	How do you spread and so they were working with certain natural elements
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:54,175	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	These Natural Parks were filled with Hedges and lakes and streams
EDL	00:09:54,687	00:09:56,479	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	And lots and lots of trees

EDL	00:10:17,215	00:10:20,287	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	But a handful of eastern grey squirrels were introduced
EDL	00:10:20,799	00:10:21,567	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	For a second
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:22,079	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	Trial run
EDL	00:10:22,591	00:10:25,151	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	And it was not landscape that the squirrels
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:27,711	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	Virtually exploded in population
EDL	00:10:28,735	00:10:33,599	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	By the turn of the century what had started as just a few dozen squirrels now numbered in the

EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:39,231	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	I mean how could you with
EDL	00:10:39,231	00:10:40,767	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	So many squirrels running around
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:44,607	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	Guesses range from the high hundreds to over 5000

EDL	00:10:46,911	00:10:50,495	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	Squirrels became a commonplace is fire hydrants and telephone poles
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:54,079	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	No the other Newfound accessories of the urban landscape
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:57,919	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	And is this new approach to Urban Parkland spread to other cities
EDL	00:10:57,919	00:11:00,479	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	So did the idea of populating them

EDL	00:11:01,759	00:11:04,319	| 01_352_Uptown_Squirrel_pt_01 |	Eastern gray squirrels were introduced again
