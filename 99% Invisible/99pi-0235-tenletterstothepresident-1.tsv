EDL	00:05:44,319	00:05:50,207	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	Fiona and her team are looking for a range of opinions and styles Express what Americans are thinking about
EDL	00:05:50,719	00:05:51,743	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	Want to give him
EDL	00:05:52,255	00:05:57,887	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	Now that is representative of geographically we also
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:06:01,727	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	But for different writing styles and different levels of writing in Waze
EDL	00:06:01,727	00:06:08,127	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	Communicating the office also put some thought into where the president is heading in the coming weeks and what issues he'll be just
EDL	00:06:08,127	00:06:14,271	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	To try to maybe make him better equipped to a Time in Mexico
EDL	00:06:17,087	00:06:23,231	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	To discuss an issue that maybe he doesn't have a personal perspective on sort of a way of
EDL	00:06:24,255	00:06:25,791	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	Giving him more advisors
EDL	00:06:25,791	00:06:28,863	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	And the letters don't just inform and influence the president
EDL	00:06:29,375	00:06:33,983	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	Fiona make sure the entire White House get the chance to see what people are rioting in about
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:39,615	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	Each day our team does something without the volunteers called a random daily sample
EDL	00:06:39,615	00:06:42,431	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	So we'll look at all the email that just came in and put
EDL	00:06:42,431	00:06:42,943	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	Together
EDL	00:06:43,455	00:06:47,039	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	A list of topics and for imposed and we circulate that list
EDL	00:06:47,551	00:06:50,623	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	Throughout the White House trip reprod distribution group
EDL	00:06:50,623	00:06:51,647	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	I guess folks
EDL	00:06:52,927	00:06:55,487	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	What the American people are saying that day
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:07:01,631	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	They also put together a word cloud that shows the most commonly used terms across all forms of communication
EDL	00:07:01,631	00:07:03,167	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	The biggest word as hell
EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:07,775	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	Because generally when you're reaching out to your government you are looking for help with
EDL	00:07:07,775	00:07:09,311	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	Must you
EDL	00:07:09,311	00:07:11,103	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	There are times though
EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:14,175	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	Like you can see right now the biggest word is gone
EDL	00:07:14,175	00:07:14,943	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	Where there's
EDL	00:07:16,223	00:07:19,295	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	Conversation topic
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:20,831	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	So in that case
EDL	00:07:20,831	00:07:23,903	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	Fiona will make sure the president gets a letter about guns
EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:26,719	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	When we do that we make sure he sees
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:27,743	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	Both sides
EDL	00:07:27,743	00:07:32,607	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	And we think a lot about the order in which things are given to him you know
EDL	00:07:32,607	00:07:33,887	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	How you write something
EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:35,423	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	I think affects the way it has
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:40,287	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	And after Fiona chooses the 10-letter she hands them off to someone who scans them
EDL	00:07:40,287	00:07:42,847	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	And then hand them to the person who puts together the
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:43,871	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	Husbands briefing book
EDL	00:07:43,871	00:07:44,895	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	I reach my heat
EDL	00:07:44,895	00:07:47,967	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	Text Mom homework binder and
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:52,319	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	It has information on what he'll be doing the next day
EDL	00:07:52,319	00:07:53,087	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	Every night include
EDL	00:07:54,879	00:08:00,255	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	I'm like almost everything else that reaches the president these letters have not been fact-checked her committee reviewed
EDL	00:08:00,767	00:08:03,071	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	They're some of the most direct communication he receive
EDL	00:08:03,583	00:08:06,655	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	When people are writing a memo to the president
EDL	00:08:06,655	00:08:07,679	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	Enough air
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:09,983	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	I Ching on a policy topic
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:15,103	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	And everyone who has hand in that or who may have information to Advocate add value
EDL	00:08:15,103	00:08:16,895	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	I take a look at it and ask her
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:18,943	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	And so by the time the president
EDL	00:08:19,455	00:08:20,223	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	See that
EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:22,271	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	It has gone through so many eyes
EDL	00:08:22,271	00:08:23,807	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	Our correspondence
EDL	00:08:24,319	00:08:27,135	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	Is really like someone sits down at their kitchen table
EDL	00:08:27,647	00:08:29,183	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	Anime
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:31,743	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	And Anna kissing their mind and then
EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:34,047	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	That's basically two sets of eyes in the White House
EDL	00:08:34,559	00:08:36,607	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	Volunteer if I hate
EDL	00:08:36,607	00:08:38,143	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	Fast and then it's me
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:39,167	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	Yeah I agree with that
EDL	00:08:39,679	00:08:41,727	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	And because these letters are so Direct
EDL	00:08:41,727	00:08:42,751	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	An unfiltered
EDL	00:08:42,751	00:08:44,543	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	A lot of them are pretty intense

EDL	00:08:48,895	00:08:51,455	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	Deals a lot and emotion and empathy because
EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:54,783	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	We are absorbing so much of what people
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:55,551	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	Hope
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:57,599	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	Next year and what they're expressing to
EDL	00:08:58,111	00:09:00,927	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	Who's the president of the United States but also
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:05,791	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	Barack Obama in the way they see themselves and Barack Obama and that
EDL	00:09:07,071	00:09:08,607	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	That I think makes our work play
EDL	00:09:09,375	00:09:10,911	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	Quite an emotional one
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:13,471	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	A lot of people write about where their writing from
EDL	00:09:13,471	00:09:14,751	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	For what time the writing

EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:40,863	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	I think

EDL	00:11:00,223	00:11:00,991	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	Something like

EDL	00:11:16,351	00:11:17,631	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	And turn them into letters

EDL	00:11:20,703	00:11:23,519	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	And because he's responded personally to so many letters of the year
EDL	00:11:24,031	00:11:26,591	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	The writers often have a really good sense of his voice
EDL	00:11:27,103	00:11:31,455	| 99pi-0235-tenletterstothepresident-1 |	And often his margin notes are so expensive he's practically responding to the letter himself
