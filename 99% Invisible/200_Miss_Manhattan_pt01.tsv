EDL	00:03:53,472	00:03:54,752	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Before becoming a movie star
EDL	00:03:55,264	00:03:58,848	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	And eventually getting embroiled in a sensational murder scandal
EDL	00:03:59,616	00:04:04,224	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	And although Audrey Munson's body has been immortalized in the iron and marble

EDL	00:04:29,055	00:04:31,871	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Like so many supermodels that would come after her
EDL	00:04:31,871	00:04:34,943	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Audrey Marie Munson was scouted on the streets of New York City
EDL	00:04:35,455	00:04:36,735	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	In 1906
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:43,903	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Audrey's mother and father were divorced which was very unusual at the time and her mother decided to get a fresh start in the big sick
EDL	00:04:44,671	00:04:46,207	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Audrey was 15

EDL	00:04:48,511	00:04:51,839	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	She was picked up on the street by a photographer
EDL	00:04:51,839	00:04:57,727	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	When she walked around with her mother this photographer gave Audrey his card and asked if she would pose for some portraits
EDL	00:04:58,239	00:05:00,799	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Her mom was invited to so intentions were good
EDL	00:05:01,311	00:05:02,335	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	These photos were

EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:08,991	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Audrey by chance was picked up as a model and then in the studio
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:10,783	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Proof that she was somebody
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:15,647	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Who was very good with the camera very good in creating a generating poses
EDL	00:05:15,647	00:05:20,255	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Best photographer recommended that Audrey meet a friend of his the famous sculptor Isidore Conte
EDL	00:05:20,767	00:05:23,071	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	At first, he thought he didn't really need Audrey
EDL	00:05:23,583	00:05:26,143	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	But as Audrey herself later recalled
EDL	00:05:26,655	00:05:30,751	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Suddenly he rose from the table walked about me asked me to stand and walk
EDL	00:05:30,751	00:05:32,287	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	And then said that he thought he could use me

EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:48,415	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	If they would have been wealthy people I don't think her mother would have let her pose in the nude
EDL	00:05:48,415	00:05:51,231	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	From that encounter the resulting sculpture was
EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:51,743	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	The three muses
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:54,303	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Three nude women with their arms around each

EDL	00:06:28,095	00:06:30,911	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	But Audrey is not always recognizable in sculpture
EDL	00:06:30,911	00:06:33,471	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Her figure is different in different artist eyes
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:35,519	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Sometimes she's lying

EDL	00:10:41,791	00:10:45,119	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	What about 24 years old Miss Manhattan had won the West
EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:47,167	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	And there was a new form of RN during the scene
EDL	00:10:47,679	00:10:48,191	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Cinema
EDL	00:10:48,703	00:10:51,775	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	The obvious next stop for Audrey Munson was Hollywood
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:53,055	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	And Hollywood was
EDL	00:10:53,055	00:10:53,567	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Unfortunately
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:55,359	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	The beginning of the end
EDL	00:10:55,871	00:10:56,383	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Probably monsters
EDL	00:10:56,895	00:11:01,503	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Cheers cast in a few films after the exposition but in every case she has cast
EDL	00:11:02,015	00:11:03,551	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	As a nude model
EDL	00:11:04,063	00:11:06,879	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	As an artist model and she appears nude
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:10,975	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Body was actually the first leading woman in Hollywood to appear naked on film
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:13,279	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Audrey may have been a good model
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:15,583	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	But she honestly wasn't much of an actress
EDL	00:11:16,607	00:11:19,423	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	If you've heard films she actually had an acting double
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:22,239	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	To basically do everything except the naked posing
EDL	00:11:23,007	00:11:27,103	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	In the movies and end up really being worth it for her financially she was paid very little
EDL	00:11:27,615	00:11:30,175	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	And none of them seem to have been critical successes
EDL	00:11:31,455	00:11:35,551	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	That might have been okay for her her career might have survived.
EDL	00:11:36,063	00:11:39,135	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	But then unfortunately she was involved in a murder

EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:58,591	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	So that he could be with Audrey
EDL	00:11:58,591	00:12:00,127	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Romance with Doctor Wilkins
EDL	00:12:00,127	00:12:03,199	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	She and her mother had actually moved out of the

EDL	00:12:06,015	00:12:12,159	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	But they were questioned they had to testify in court and they were sort of dragged through the mud in the Press
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:16,255	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	The so-called Wilkins case became a phenomenal media scandal
EDL	00:12:16,255	00:12:19,327	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	As Audrey told the daily Variety in 1920
EDL	00:12:19,327	00:12:21,631	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	The Wilkins case ruined my career

EDL	00:12:23,935	00:12:27,775	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	I'm loving and admiring me the public seems to have grown to hate me
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:29,567	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Audrey couldn't find any work
EDL	00:12:29,567	00:12:35,711	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	In Fillmore in artist Studios for the decline of Audrey career wasn't just because of the Wilkins scandal
EDL	00:12:36,223	00:12:37,247	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	She was after all
EDL	00:12:37,247	00:12:38,527	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Totally innocent
EDL	00:12:38,527	00:12:41,855	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Noticed a lot of factors changing in the culture around her
EDL	00:12:42,623	00:12:48,511	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	I want the Bozart style wasn't very popular anymore the Bozart style came out of Europe
EDL	00:12:49,023	00:12:51,327	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	And there is this thing called World War 1
EDL	00:12:51,839	00:12:54,143	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Where Western Europe kind of fell apart
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:12:55,423	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	And so there was a questioning
EDL	00:12:55,935	00:12:57,471	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	About whether or not
EDL	00:12:57,471	00:12:58,751	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	We want to be using
EDL	00:12:59,263	00:13:00,799	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	That kind of symbolism

EDL	00:13:04,895	00:13:07,455	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Away from the old world bosarts presidents
EDL	00:13:07,455	00:13:10,783	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Also the economics of Bozart style wearing possible
EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:13,343	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	It became increasingly expensive
EDL	00:13:13,343	00:13:19,743	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	To construct these buildings and pay for all of the artists and Artisans to design all of the elements of

EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:41,087	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	I felt like such a special story and it felt like
EDL	00:20:41,855	00:20:48,255	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	It was this architecture that was coming to life that like had life in it Audrey Munson personnel
EDL	00:20:48,255	00:20:50,815	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Body that was like infused in the sculptures
EDL	00:20:51,583	00:20:53,631	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	And one of the things
EDL	00:20:53,631	00:20:56,191	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	But I felt really satisfied about
EDL	00:20:56,959	00:20:59,007	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Was this one sound a guy.
EDL	00:20:59,007	00:20:59,775	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	When
EDL	00:20:59,775	00:21:01,311	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	I was trying to think like what is like
EDL	00:21:01,311	00:21:03,103	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Stone and Marble and
EDL	00:21:03,871	00:21:05,663	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Those kinds of things what kind of texture with
EDL	00:21:05,663	00:21:06,431	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Feel
EDL	00:21:06,431	00:21:07,967	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Representative of that and
EDL	00:21:08,735	00:21:15,135	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Have this thing called the Glockenspiel it's like a little xylophone that's made of metal and it's more like a Chinese kind of a saint
EDL	00:21:15,135	00:21:16,159	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Usually
EDL	00:21:16,159	00:21:19,232	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Hit it here in a lot of indie folk bands and stuff
EDL	00:21:19,232	00:21:20,768	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	So I like Toca and
EDL	00:21:21,280	00:21:22,048	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	I'd like Dennis
EDL	00:21:22,560	00:21:23,584	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Before
EDL	00:21:23,584	00:21:26,656	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Just taking a bow like a cello bow and just seeing
EDL	00:21:27,168	00:21:28,448	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	What it does with
EDL	00:21:28,448	00:21:29,216	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Pretty much anything
EDL	00:21:29,984	00:21:31,008	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Cancel
EDL	00:21:31,520	00:21:34,080	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	So do you thinking of like those kinds of exercises
EDL	00:21:34,592	00:21:36,128	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	I took the cello bow and I
EDL	00:21:36,640	00:21:37,920	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Put it on the glockenspiel
EDL	00:21:38,432	00:21:40,224	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	And it had a very kind of like
EDL	00:21:40,224	00:21:41,248	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Coarse texture
EDL	00:21:41,248	00:21:45,088	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	2 Atwell still like maintaining it's like beautiful tone like it had like a very
EDL	00:21:45,856	00:21:49,952	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Specific tone and so I like actually took two bows and I was able to like make harmonies
EDL	00:21:50,720	00:21:52,512	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	There's one specifically that
EDL	00:21:52,512	00:21:54,048	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	And the peace before the
EDL	00:21:54,048	00:21:54,816	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Credits come up
EDL	00:21:55,328	00:21:58,656	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Bap it is the screechy
EDL	00:21:58,656	00:21:59,424	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Marbley Park
EDL	00:22:00,448	00:22:02,752	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	It's like probably one of the most Amorphis
EDL	00:22:02,752	00:22:03,520	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Things I
EDL	00:22:04,032	00:22:05,824	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Done for the show and it feels really
EDL	00:22:05,824	00:22:09,408	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	We could just think that like oh yeah that's the Audrey Munson piece that's like
EDL	00:22:09,408	00:22:10,432	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	The sound of Audrey Munson
EDL	00:22:18,368	00:22:20,672	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	What is the standard operating procedure for how
EDL	00:22:21,184	00:22:23,488	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	You work on the show and where you fit in
EDL	00:22:24,000	00:22:24,768	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Structionsite
EDL	00:22:25,280	00:22:28,864	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	So it starts out with me talking with the producers about
EDL	00:22:28,864	00:22:30,656	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	The stories that they're working on
EDL	00:22:30,656	00:22:31,424	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Are giving me life
EDL	00:22:31,424	00:22:34,496	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Personalities of the people they're interviewing and
EDL	00:22:35,008	00:22:38,592	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Bigger picture ideas of what they want to convey
EDL	00:22:39,104	00:22:41,408	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	And then when there's a first draft
EDL	00:22:41,920	00:22:43,456	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	I'm reading it and I'm kind of like
EDL	00:22:44,224	00:22:44,992	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Writing
EDL	00:22:44,992	00:22:47,296	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Music as I'm reading it and trying to like
EDL	00:22:47,296	00:22:48,576	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Get an idea of pacing
EDL	00:22:49,344	00:22:49,856	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	But
EDL	00:22:50,368	00:22:51,904	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	It's really hard to
EDL	00:22:51,904	00:22:53,440	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Lock that in
EDL	00:22:53,440	00:22:56,768	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	And iiii so I make sketches basically but it's hard to lock in like
EDL	00:22:56,768	00:22:58,048	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	The timing and stuff
EDL	00:22:58,560	00:23:00,096	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Until we have
EDL	00:23:00,096	00:23:00,864	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	AR
EDL	00:23:00,864	00:23:01,888	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Read through edit
EDL	00:23:02,400	00:23:03,424	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Where we all
EDL	00:23:03,424	00:23:08,800	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Set and we read through the script and play tape and then I record that and when I have that I can actually like
EDL	00:23:08,800	00:23:10,080	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Do my recording
EDL	00:23:10,080	00:23:10,848	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	And
EDL	00:23:11,360	00:23:11,872	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Make
EDL	00:23:12,384	00:23:14,944	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Drafts of my songs Discord
EDL	00:23:14,944	00:23:15,456	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	A piece with
EDL	00:23:16,224	00:23:20,576	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	And then from there we like make a rough mix with music with the music drafts
EDL	00:23:21,088	00:23:23,136	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	And everybody gets notes on that
EDL	00:23:23,904	00:23:25,440	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	And then from there I like
EDL	00:23:25,440	00:23:26,464	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Make any changes
EDL	00:23:26,976	00:23:28,256	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	That we want and
EDL	00:23:29,792	00:23:30,816	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Do the final mixes
EDL	00:23:31,328	00:23:32,096	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	The pieces
EDL	00:23:32,608	00:23:33,376	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Play doubt
EDL	00:23:33,376	00:23:34,400	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	The first time what is the most
EDL	00:23:34,400	00:23:34,912	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Common teasel
EDL	00:23:35,680	00:23:36,448	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	That you
EDL	00:23:36,448	00:23:37,216	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Get from
EDL	00:23:37,216	00:23:37,984	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	The producers of the show
EDL	00:23:39,008	00:23:40,032	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	But things are too busy
EDL	00:23:41,312	00:23:42,336	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Is it
EDL	00:23:42,336	00:23:42,848	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	WhatsApp
EDL	00:23:43,616	00:23:44,640	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	I have a very
EDL	00:23:45,408	00:23:46,944	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Dense sense of rhythm
EDL	00:23:48,480	00:23:52,832	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	It's just kind of the way that my head works I can't I can't do anything simply
EDL	00:23:52,832	00:23:58,208	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	And it's really helpful actually to sketch things out with midi because I can like
EDL	00:23:58,208	00:23:58,720	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Just like
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:02,048	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Do a cluster of notes
EDL	00:24:02,048	00:24:06,400	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	And then kind of just like go in and individually like pick this one out pick this one out pick this one out in like
EDL	00:24:06,912	00:24:12,544	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Create a rhythm that like feels effectively the same but like isn't quite isn't going to be like
EDL	00:24:12,544	00:24:14,080	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Grabbing for your attention,
EDL	00:24:14,848	00:24:16,640	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	People are talking and trying to
EDL	00:24:17,152	00:24:17,920	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Explain
EDL	00:24:21,248	00:24:22,784	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Things about working with
EDL	00:24:22,784	00:24:23,552	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Musicians
EDL	00:24:23,552	00:24:24,576	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Scoring is that
EDL	00:24:25,088	00:24:27,136	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Some of the most interesting stuff that's going on the music
EDL	00:24:27,904	00:24:31,232	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Is in the same Zone as The narrator's Voice
EDL	00:24:31,232	00:24:32,000	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	And you at the clinic
EDL	00:24:33,536	00:24:34,560	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	So that it
EDL	00:24:34,560	00:24:35,328	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Doesn't
EDL	00:24:35,328	00:24:36,096	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Peed
EDL	00:24:36,096	00:24:38,400	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	I feel like it's a lot like being in a band like
EDL	00:24:38,400	00:24:40,192	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	It's hard to listen to music when
EDL	00:24:40,192	00:24:41,472	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Everything is like
EDL	00:24:41,984	00:24:44,288	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Really active in competing and it's just
EDL	00:24:45,312	00:24:46,080	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	I think of it like
EDL	00:24:47,104	00:24:49,664	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Whatever is happening in the story right now is
EDL	00:24:50,432	00:24:52,480	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Delete instrument and I'm
EDL	00:24:52,480	00:24:55,552	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	There to support it the other instruments aren't less import
EDL	00:24:55,552	00:24:57,600	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	For not being like the center of attention
EDL	00:24:57,600	00:24:58,880	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	It's all working together
EDL	00:24:59,648	00:25:00,416	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	So we're going to end
EDL	00:25:01,184	00:25:01,952	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	What would be
EDL	00:25:02,976	00:25:03,744	| 200_Miss_Manhattan_pt01 |	Composition
