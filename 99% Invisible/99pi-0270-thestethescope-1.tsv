EDL	00:01:08,096	00:01:08,864	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	I'm Roman Mars
EDL	00:01:12,448	00:01:15,008	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Imagine for a moment the year 1800
EDL	00:01:15,008	00:01:17,312	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	The doctor is meeting the patient
EDL	00:01:17,312	00:01:19,104	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Most likely in the patient's home
EDL	00:01:19,616	00:01:22,176	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	The patient is complaining about shortness of breath
EDL	00:01:23,456	00:01:23,968	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Fever
EDL	00:01:24,480	00:01:27,040	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	The doctor listens to the patients complaints
EDL	00:01:27,040	00:01:29,088	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Asks a ton of questions
EDL	00:01:29,088	00:01:30,112	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Scribble some notes
EDL	00:01:30,624	00:01:31,904	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Producer Emmett Fitzgerald
EDL	00:01:31,904	00:01:34,976	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	And the doctor might check the patient's pulse
EDL	00:01:35,744	00:01:39,328	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	But unlike today what's happening inside of the
EDL	00:01:39,328	00:01:40,096	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Patient is
EDL	00:01:40,096	00:01:41,376	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Basically unknowable
EDL	00:01:42,144	00:01:44,448	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	There's no MRI no x-rays
EDL	00:01:44,960	00:01:47,776	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	The living body is like a black box
EDL	00:01:48,544	00:01:49,312	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	It can't be open
EDL	00:01:50,080	00:01:53,152	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	The only way for a doctor to figure out what's wrong with a patient
EDL	00:01:53,152	00:01:53,664	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Is to ask
EDL	00:01:54,432	00:01:58,016	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	You needed the patient to tell you what was wrong and what they were suffering
EDL	00:01:58,016	00:01:59,296	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	So doctors were
EDL	00:01:59,296	00:02:05,696	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Very interested in the patient's history the story of what the symptom was how long it had been there how had it change
EDL	00:02:05,696	00:02:07,488	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	What made it better what made it worse
EDL	00:02:07,488	00:02:09,024	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	This is dr. Jacqueline Duffy
EDL	00:02:09,536	00:02:11,072	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	I am a hematologist
EDL	00:02:11,584	00:02:17,984	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	And a historian of medicine at Queen's University
EDL	00:02:17,984	00:02:19,776	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Was all the doctor had to go on
EDL	00:02:20,288	00:02:23,872	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	The symptoms were often seen as in themselves
EDL	00:02:23,872	00:02:26,688	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	So for example today if you have a fever
EDL	00:02:26,688	00:02:28,480	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	You think of it as a symptom
EDL	00:02:28,480	00:02:30,528	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Of some underlying disease
EDL	00:02:30,528	00:02:31,296	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	It's like the flu
EDL	00:02:31,808	00:02:34,368	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	But back at the turn of the 19th century
EDL	00:02:34,368	00:02:35,392	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	The fever is
EDL	00:02:35,392	00:02:37,440	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Self was considered the disease
EDL	00:02:37,440	00:02:39,232	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	They're all different kinds of fevers
EDL	00:02:39,744	00:02:42,816	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	And fever itself was a broad category of diagnosis
EDL	00:02:42,816	00:02:45,376	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Because doctors had no way of connecting symptoms
EDL	00:02:45,888	00:02:48,448	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	With what was actually going on inside the body
EDL	00:02:49,216	00:02:53,312	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Until someone built a device that would help the doctor
EDL	00:02:53,312	00:02:54,848	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Open the black box
EDL	00:02:54,848	00:03:01,248	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	And travel inside the human body
EDL	00:03:01,248	00:03:07,648	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	And suddenly the doctor could hear everything so much more clearly the heart
EDL	00:03:07,648	00:03:12,512	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Salons the brat and everything
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:20,448	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	The inventor of the stethoscope was unsurprisingly a doctor
EDL	00:03:21,984	00:03:26,080	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Rene laennec was born in Brittany in 1781
EDL	00:03:26,592	00:03:28,128	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	And she went to medical school in Paris
EDL	00:03:28,640	00:03:30,688	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Where you learn to practice percussion
EDL	00:03:30,688	00:03:35,808	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	A technique in which the doctor Taps their fingers against a patient's chest
EDL	00:03:35,808	00:03:37,856	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	And listen to the sound
EDL	00:03:37,856	00:03:39,648	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	To determine things like if
EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:41,952	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Fluid is building up in the patient's lungs
EDL	00:03:41,952	00:03:48,352	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Lennox uses the technique for years and in 1816 he's examining a patient and he produces her
EDL	00:03:48,352	00:03:49,120	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Torso
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:54,496	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	She's a little bit plump and because she's plump he's not getting much sound back from for cussing
EDL	00:03:54,496	00:03:56,544	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	He thought about putting his ear right against the
EDL	00:03:56,544	00:03:59,872	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	The patient's breast but he decided that that would be inappropriate
EDL	00:03:59,872	00:04:01,152	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	So we took a notebook
EDL	00:04:01,664	00:04:07,552	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	That he had with them and he bolted up into a little cylinder and he put one end on the patient's chest and went in on his ear
EDL	00:04:08,064	00:04:09,344	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Angie tells us
EDL	00:04:09,344	00:04:14,464	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	He was clearly he could hear her and her breath sounds
EDL	00:04:14,464	00:04:20,351	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Satisfied to hear the beating of the heart in a manner that was clearer and more distinct than I had ever heard
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:21,631	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Idirect application
EDL	00:04:21,631	00:04:22,399	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	The ear
EDL	00:04:22,399	00:04:27,775	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	She was so impressed by the quality of the sound that he said about trying to construct the
EDL	00:04:27,775	00:04:28,543	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	The perfect device
EDL	00:04:29,055	00:04:31,103	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	For listening to the internal sounds
EDL	00:04:31,103	00:04:31,871	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	The body
EDL	00:04:31,871	00:04:33,151	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	All based on that
EDL	00:04:33,151	00:04:34,175	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Same cylinder
EDL	00:04:34,687	00:04:39,551	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	People said that he became a silandro maniac has cylinder Maniac because he
EDL	00:04:39,551	00:04:40,575	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	He was convinced
EDL	00:04:40,575	00:04:42,111	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	That the instrument
EDL	00:04:42,111	00:04:43,135	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Mediating
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:44,159	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Between
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:45,695	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	The two bodies of
EDL	00:04:45,695	00:04:48,255	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	The patient and the doctor improved but the doctor
EDL	00:04:49,279	00:04:50,303	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Can use the lathe
EDL	00:04:50,815	00:04:52,351	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Car cylinders out of wood
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:54,655	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	And at first he wanted to
EDL	00:04:54,655	00:04:55,935	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Call his new device
EDL	00:04:55,935	00:04:56,959	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	The cylinder
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:04:59,263	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	But eventually he settled on the steps
EDL	00:05:00,031	00:05:00,799	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Which means
EDL	00:05:00,799	00:05:02,079	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	To explore the chest
EDL	00:05:02,847	00:05:05,663	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Line-X original stethoscope looks
EDL	00:05:05,663	00:05:07,711	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Pretty different from the ones were used to
EDL	00:05:07,711	00:05:12,319	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Do today it's a long tube-like cylinder it looks like a small handheld telescope
EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:13,599	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Line-X
EDL	00:05:13,599	00:05:18,463	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Started using his new invention to listen to the heart sounds and the breathing sound
EDL	00:05:18,463	00:05:19,487	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Sense of all of the patient
EDL	00:05:19,999	00:05:20,767	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Summit Hospital
EDL	00:05:20,767	00:05:24,607	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	And he started to invent words to describe the sounds cuz nobody
EDL	00:05:24,607	00:05:26,399	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Nobody had heard the sound before it
EDL	00:05:26,399	00:05:29,727	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Lenoch and invented a way to hear the inner workings of the human body
EDL	00:05:30,239	00:05:32,031	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	But that wasn't enough by itself
EDL	00:05:32,543	00:05:35,103	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	He wanted to connect the sounds he was hearing in his patient
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:38,687	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	With what was actually happening anatomically inside their body
EDL	00:05:39,199	00:05:44,063	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	And how do you connect sounds to what's actually happening inside a body
EDL	00:05:44,831	00:05:46,111	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	You listen to people
EDL	00:05:46,111	00:05:52,511	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Right before they died around the ward listening to all the patients documenting their
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:58,911	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Listen to The Sounds they made and then connecting them to the discoveries he would make up their autopsy when they died
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:06:05,311	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	He thought that every abnormal sound heard with a stethoscope should correspond
EDL	00:06:05,311	00:06:11,711	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Comical finding during autopsy found it equals
EDL	00:06:11,711	00:06:18,111	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	. anatomical finding later so that the stethoscope was a way of practicing the autopsy before the patient
EDL	00:06:18,111	00:06:24,511	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	I mean we're all this future cadaver is right but the stethoscope gave us a way of looking inside
EDL	00:06:24,511	00:06:29,887	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Side of a body before it was dead to see what was causing a particular medical problem
EDL	00:06:29,887	00:06:35,775	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	In a relatively short period of time my neck made some discoveries using his stethoscope
EDL	00:06:35,775	00:06:39,871	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	For example he figured out that when a person has fluid beneath their lungs
EDL	00:06:39,871	00:06:42,175	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	They make a sound kind of like a goat
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:46,783	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	A sound he called egophony
EDL	00:06:47,551	00:06:49,855	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	He also discovered sounds that attract
EDL	00:06:49,855	00:06:51,647	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	With the different stages of tuberculosis
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:54,207	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	The number one killer in Europe
EDL	00:06:54,207	00:06:54,719	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Set the time

EDL	00:08:05,887	00:08:07,167	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Became more objective
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:09,983	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Diseases went from being constellations

EDL	00:08:13,823	00:08:18,431	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Anatomical or chemical alterations inside the body detected by the doctor
EDL	00:08:19,711	00:08:22,527	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	This shift in how people thought about disease
EDL	00:08:22,527	00:08:25,599	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Change the relationships between doctors and patients
EDL	00:08:25,599	00:08:26,623	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	With the doctors
EDL	00:08:26,623	00:08:28,415	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Suddenly having a lot more power
EDL	00:08:28,927	00:08:30,719	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Show before the stethoscope
EDL	00:08:30,719	00:08:32,255	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Feel sick
EDL	00:08:35,071	00:08:36,095	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	The doctor had to find
EDL	00:08:36,607	00:08:40,703	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	But didn't matter what the patient
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:46,079	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Line-X himself actually worried that many doctors were taking his ideas too far
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:52,479	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	He believed that listening to what patients had to say was still important to understanding disease
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:56,831	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	But the Quest for objective information about disease was underway
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:08:58,623	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	In the stethoscope
EDL	00:08:58,623	00:08:59,903	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Was just the beginning
EDL	00:08:59,903	00:09:00,927	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Then we got x-rays
EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:07,327	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Which do the same thing at the end of the 19th century and now we have CT scanners and MRIs and pet scans and all of these
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:13,727	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Marvelous devices are basically trading upon the same Paradigm that the stethoscope brought along that we should be
EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:19,103	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Able somehow to image the pathological anatomical abnormalities inside the body
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:20,639	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	To reach the diagnosis
EDL	00:09:20,639	00:09:23,455	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	When is a patient has any symptoms at all or not
EDL	00:09:25,247	00:09:31,391	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	These new technologies have led to so many important discoveries about the human body and disease
EDL	00:09:32,159	00:09:32,927	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Today we can
EDL	00:09:32,927	00:09:33,951	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Spot tumors
EDL	00:09:33,951	00:09:35,231	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Before they become life threatening
EDL	00:09:35,743	00:09:38,815	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	And diagnose problems like high blood pressure
EDL	00:09:38,815	00:09:40,095	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Before it causes heart disease
EDL	00:09:41,119	00:09:45,215	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	But there are also patients today who struggle because they've got
EDL	00:09:45,215	00:09:46,239	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Tons of symptoms
EDL	00:09:46,239	00:09:49,823	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	But the doctor can't find anything quote on quote wrong with
EDL	00:09:51,103	00:09:54,431	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	The Paradigm Shift brought on by the stethoscope has
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:09:56,735	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Push doctors and patients further apart
EDL	00:09:57,503	00:10:00,319	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	The doctor is no longer visiting you in your bedroom

EDL	00:10:05,183	00:10:09,535	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	And sometimes patients end up feeling like just the collection of data point
EDL	00:10:10,047	00:10:11,071	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Rather than a whole

EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:26,431	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Help us understand
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:31,039	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	It's been 200 years since he first rolled up his notebook and pressed
EDL	00:10:31,039	00:10:32,319	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	To that patient's chest
EDL	00:10:32,831	00:10:35,647	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Medicine looks completely different than it did back
EDL	00:10:36,415	00:10:37,183	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	But somehow
EDL	00:10:37,695	00:10:38,719	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	The stethoscope
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:39,743	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Has endured
EDL	00:10:39,743	00:10:42,815	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	There are certain tools of the trade that we have
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:43,327	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Gotten rid of
EDL	00:10:43,839	00:10:44,607	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	So
EDL	00:10:44,607	00:10:46,911	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	You don't really see doctors carrying around this
EDL	00:10:46,911	00:10:47,935	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Is big black bag
EDL	00:10:47,935	00:10:49,471	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	This is dr. Andrew Bomba
EDL	00:10:49,983	00:10:51,263	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Is a nephrologist

EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:04,575	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Most doctors
EDL	00:11:04,575	00:11:07,135	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Don't wear that light on their head
EDL	00:11:07,135	00:11:08,927	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	But the stethoscope has
EDL	00:11:08,927	00:11:11,487	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Never really falling out of practice
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:14,303	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Of course doctors aren't walking around with wooden cylinders anymore
EDL	00:11:14,815	00:11:18,399	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	In the 1840s they began experimenting with flexible tubing
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:22,495	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	And soon after an Irish physician invented the binaural stethoscope design
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:24,799	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	With two earpieces that we still use
EDL	00:11:24,799	00:11:25,311	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Today
EDL	00:11:25,823	00:11:27,871	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	There are a few kinds of specialized stethoscopes
EDL	00:11:28,383	00:11:29,407	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Particular types of listening
EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:30,943	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	And more recently
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:32,735	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Companies have developed electronic stethoscope
EDL	00:11:33,247	00:11:35,807	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	With enhanced sound quality and the ability
EDL	00:11:35,807	00:11:36,319	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Need to record
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:39,903	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	But to this day when you walk into a doctor's office
EDL	00:11:39,903	00:11:41,439	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Is for a routine exam
EDL	00:11:41,439	00:11:42,463	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	You can expect
EDL	00:11:42,463	00:11:44,255	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	The field familiar stethoscope
EDL	00:11:44,255	00:11:45,535	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Sliding along your back
EDL	00:11:46,047	00:11:46,815	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	But that
EDL	00:11:46,815	00:11:47,583	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Could be changing
EDL	00:11:48,095	00:11:54,239	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Almost 200 years that trustee stethoscope has been at the Forefront of the diagnostic procedure
EDL	00:11:54,239	00:11:58,079	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	CJ constantly hanging around the necks of doctors and often used

EDL	00:12:05,503	00:12:10,111	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	X-rays and ultrasound have given doctors at Clear Window into the body than ever before
EDL	00:12:10,623	00:12:13,183	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	And with new portable ultrasound machines
EDL	00:12:13,183	00:12:16,511	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Doctors can see an image of a hole in a patient's heart
EDL	00:12:16,511	00:12:17,535	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Right from the bedside
EDL	00:12:18,303	00:12:23,679	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	The rise of portable ultrasound has some doctors arguing that we don't need the stethoscope
EDL	00:12:24,703	00:12:25,471	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	They say that
EDL	00:12:25,471	00:12:27,519	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	If you have that technology why not
EDL	00:12:27,519	00:12:28,287	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Use it right away
EDL	00:12:29,055	00:12:31,359	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	But ultrasound isn't available
EDL	00:12:31,359	00:12:32,127	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	In many developing
EDL	00:12:33,151	00:12:34,943	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	And even in the United States
EDL	00:12:34,943	00:12:35,711	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	It's
EDL	00:12:35,711	00:12:36,479	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Expensive
EDL	00:12:36,479	00:12:40,831	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Tell me if we eliminated the stethoscope and everybody got an ultrasound at every visit
EDL	00:12:40,831	00:12:42,623	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	We would bankrupt our Healthcare System

EDL	00:12:56,447	00:12:59,263	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	With every patient who comes in the emergency room
EDL	00:12:59,263	00:13:01,823	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Taking out the ultrasound machine looking in the lungs

EDL	00:13:05,407	00:13:08,991	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Right now he says the stethoscope functions as a screening tool
EDL	00:13:08,991	00:13:12,831	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	So that patients don't need to go get an expensive ultrasound unless they need one

EDL	00:13:33,311	00:13:34,847	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	A actual
EDL	00:13:34,847	00:13:36,127	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Tool of the trade
EDL	00:13:36,127	00:13:37,919	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	In terms of helping us make diagnosis
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:46,367	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Recently one of doctor bombax most
EDL	00:13:46,367	00:13:47,391	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Respected colleague
EDL	00:13:47,391	00:13:48,927	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Please ask to borrow a stethoscope
EDL	00:13:48,927	00:13:49,695	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	End
EDL	00:13:49,695	00:13:51,231	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Bombeck was embarrassed
EDL	00:13:51,231	00:13:54,303	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Because the only one he had within that day was this
EDL	00:13:54,303	00:13:55,839	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Cheap plastic disposable
EDL	00:13:56,863	00:13:58,655	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	But he handed it over anyway
EDL	00:13:59,423	00:14:03,775	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	And he said he thinks that's perfect he was walking away he's like no patience

EDL	00:14:05,055	00:14:06,847	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	When you see that I'm not going to really
EDL	00:14:06,847	00:14:07,359	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Need to use
EDL	00:14:08,383	00:14:11,199	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	And I thought that was such a funny story because
EDL	00:14:11,711	00:14:14,527	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	There's someone that I consider the consummate clinician
EDL	00:14:15,039	00:14:15,807	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	And
EDL	00:14:15,807	00:14:17,599	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	He was acknowledging that
EDL	00:14:17,599	00:14:18,111	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	The stethoscope
EDL	00:14:18,623	00:14:20,671	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Was in many ways just sort of a prop
EDL	00:14:21,439	00:14:23,487	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	But it's an omnipresent prop
EDL	00:14:23,999	00:14:25,535	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	If you do a Google image search
EDL	00:14:25,535	00:14:26,303	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	4dr
EDL	00:14:26,303	00:14:30,143	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Right away you'll notice a couple of things about what a physician is
EDL	00:14:30,143	00:14:30,911	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Supposed to look like
EDL	00:14:31,423	00:14:35,519	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Most of the doctors pictures on the first page of results are white men in white coats
EDL	00:14:36,031	00:14:38,591	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Some of them are appearing inside a patient's ears
EDL	00:14:38,591	00:14:40,383	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Others are writing something down

EDL	00:14:41,151	00:14:41,919	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	But all of them
EDL	00:14:43,199	00:14:43,711	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Stethoscope
EDL	00:14:44,223	00:14:47,295	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	But what I find so intriguing about the Google Images search
EDL	00:14:47,295	00:14:47,807	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Is 4dr
EDL	00:14:48,319	00:14:50,111	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Is knowledge every doctor wearing a

EDL	00:14:50,879	00:14:55,487	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	But they are almost all wearing the stethoscope in the exact same way
EDL	00:14:55,999	00:14:57,279	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Which is
EDL	00:14:57,279	00:14:58,303	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Like a shawl
EDL	00:14:58,303	00:14:59,583	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Around the back of the neck
EDL	00:14:59,583	00:15:02,399	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	With the earpieces on one side and the Bell on the other
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:05,215	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Baumbach says that this way of wearing a stethoscope
EDL	00:15:05,727	00:15:07,263	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Draped over the shoulders
EDL	00:15:07,263	00:15:08,799	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Is a relatively recent
EDL	00:15:08,799	00:15:09,311	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Fashion trend
EDL	00:15:09,823	00:15:11,871	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	The first time I can remember ever seeing that
EDL	00:15:11,871	00:15:13,919	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Was on the television show ER
EDL	00:15:14,943	00:15:16,735	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	And then on Scrubs
EDL	00:15:16,735	00:15:18,783	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Which is another very popular medical TV show
EDL	00:15:19,551	00:15:21,855	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Doctors used to wear their stethoscopes
EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:24,415	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Dangling down the front of the shirt like a tie
EDL	00:15:25,183	00:15:25,951	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	And this was
EDL	00:15:26,719	00:15:30,303	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	If you needed to use your stethoscope in a hurry you just
EDL	00:15:30,303	00:15:31,071	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Pop the interior
EDL	00:15:31,583	00:15:37,983	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	It's almost like this new version of wearing it like a scarf or shawl is almost a concession that is more fattening
EDL	00:15:37,983	00:15:38,751	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Accessory
EDL	00:15:38,751	00:15:40,543	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Then actually a tool that were using
EDL	00:15:41,567	00:15:45,919	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	But even if the stethoscope exam has become something of a ritual
EDL	00:15:45,919	00:15:48,479	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	It doesn't mean that doctors are ready to give it up
EDL	00:15:48,991	00:15:50,783	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	And I would never give up my son
EDL	00:15:51,551	00:15:52,319	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Because
EDL	00:15:52,319	00:15:54,111	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	I think in the very least
EDL	00:15:54,111	00:15:55,647	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	It's this conduit
EDL	00:15:55,647	00:15:56,671	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	2 connecting with the patient

EDL	00:16:02,047	00:16:03,839	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Has become increasingly rare
EDL	00:16:04,351	00:16:06,143	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	Doctor's visits are short
EDL	00:16:06,143	00:16:09,215	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	And Physicians often spend half the time staring at a

EDL	00:16:10,751	00:16:11,775	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	The status quo

EDL	00:16:15,103	00:16:16,639	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	The stethoscope is still
EDL	00:16:17,151	00:16:23,295	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	A part of the exam that is still very much aligned with that idea of the laying on of hands that A Healer can do when we go to the physical

EDL	00:16:28,159	00:16:30,207	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	And it's a much more intimate conversation
EDL	00:16:30,719	00:16:33,023	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	And even with all these powerful

EDL	00:16:47,871	00:16:48,895	| 99pi-0270-thestethescope-1 |	And
