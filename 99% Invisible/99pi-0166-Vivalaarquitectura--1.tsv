EDL	00:06:36,287	00:06:37,823	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Plants in the palm trees
EDL	00:06:37,823	00:06:40,639	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Winding Thunderman Furlan titties
EDL	00:06:40,639	00:06:41,919	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Plazas and courtyards
EDL	00:06:42,431	00:06:45,503	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	And the curving rooftops with all those vaults make them look
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:46,015	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Alive
EDL	00:06:46,527	00:06:47,039	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Dancing
EDL	00:06:48,063	00:06:49,599	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Every school has a clerestory to
EDL	00:06:50,111	00:06:51,647	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	What does very intentional symbolize
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:58,559	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	But poro School of Visual Art was the most literal imagine the School of Visual Arts or they called it
EDL	00:06:58,559	00:07:00,607	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	School of plastic Arts
EDL	00:07:00,607	00:07:07,007	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	As a building that would nurture art and artists and helped give rise to a uniquely post-revolution Cube
EDL	00:07:07,007	00:07:07,519	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Ben aesthetic
EDL	00:07:08,543	00:07:11,103	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	The school was going to give birth
EDL	00:07:11,615	00:07:14,175	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	So I try to make the school
EDL	00:07:14,175	00:07:15,199	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Plastic art
EDL	00:07:15,967	00:07:18,015	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Has the image of a goddess of fertility
EDL	00:07:19,039	00:07:20,831	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	So I put a lot
EDL	00:07:20,831	00:07:21,343	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Of breast
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:24,671	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Indicated in the domes
EDL	00:07:24,671	00:07:27,999	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	No really the Volta Jones have these nipples on them
EDL	00:07:27,999	00:07:30,815	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	And there was a special fountain in the main Piazza
EDL	00:07:31,583	00:07:34,399	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Linda Piazza I place a sculpture ideas
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:38,239	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Just like a fruit called papaya
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:39,519	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Chuba
EDL	00:07:40,031	00:07:40,799	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Assist
EDL	00:07:40,799	00:07:42,591	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Sexual feminine connotation
EDL	00:07:43,871	00:07:46,431	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Some higher-ups found this pretty scandalous
EDL	00:07:46,431	00:07:48,991	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	I was told to turn the water in the fountain off
EDL	00:07:49,503	00:07:54,367	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Yes you have. Brass and here you have the papaya which is a metaphor for
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:07:56,671	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	But everybody knows them
EDL	00:07:57,183	00:07:57,951	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	The Caribbean
EDL	00:07:57,951	00:08:02,303	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	But I think that it's wrong to overemphasize that
EDL	00:08:02,303	00:08:03,583	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Because really
EDL	00:08:03,583	00:08:06,399	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	John Loomis says that the school is a commentary
EDL	00:08:06,399	00:08:07,679	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Incubus past
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:08,447	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	And Future
EDL	00:08:08,447	00:08:10,751	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	As you're walking down those curved passageways
EDL	00:08:11,263	00:08:14,847	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	You can't see where you've been and you can't see where you're going
EDL	00:08:15,615	00:08:20,223	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	I'm in way that was a metaphor for this new chapter in Cuba you know this is a new
EDL	00:08:20,735	00:08:21,503	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Adventure
EDL	00:08:21,503	00:08:22,271	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	This new Revolution
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:29,183	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	The Revolutionary Spirit was the driving force of the design and the canoe
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:29,695	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Construction
EDL	00:08:30,207	00:08:32,767	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Decathlon Vault required a lot of Labor
EDL	00:08:32,767	00:08:36,607	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	So there's this massive crew of young Cuban workers on the golf course
EDL	00:08:36,607	00:08:37,375	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Making me structure
EDL	00:08:37,887	00:08:44,287	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Goldwork is felt a real buying because they felt that they were building the school that their children could potentially go to
EDL	00:08:44,287	00:08:45,823	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	But previously they have no hope
EDL	00:08:45,823	00:08:48,383	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Liquor children would go to University Art to an art school
EDL	00:08:48,383	00:08:54,015	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	And this endeavor was so exciting but the school is basically opened while they were still being built
EDL	00:08:54,015	00:08:58,111	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	At some point when construction began that they said well let's just use the space
EDL	00:08:58,111	00:09:01,183	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	The country club was already there with its meeting rooms and ballrooms
EDL	00:09:01,183	00:09:03,999	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Of course they had those manicured grounds and the beautiful weather
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:06,815	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Ballerinas pirouette on the putting green
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:10,399	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Interceptor canvases in the shade
EDL	00:09:10,399	00:09:11,679	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Practiced in the forest
EDL	00:09:12,191	00:09:16,031	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	And students brought water and drinks and food for the construction workers
EDL	00:09:16,031	00:09:17,823	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	And play drums to keep their spirits up
EDL	00:09:18,591	00:09:20,639	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	It was as beautiful joyous Undertaker
EDL	00:09:22,175	00:09:22,687	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Except when it was
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:24,479	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	During that time
EDL	00:09:25,503	00:09:27,807	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	And still today it's difficult to talk about
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:28,831	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	The negative
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:29,599	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Aspects of
EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:30,623	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	The revolution
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:32,927	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	So people really focused on
EDL	00:09:33,695	00:09:35,487	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	The joyous part and the optimism
EDL	00:09:35,487	00:09:37,791	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	You know cuz that's what he hold on to

EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:44,703	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	In Cuba
EDL	00:09:45,215	00:09:48,031	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	At the same time for example as artists were
EDL	00:09:48,543	00:09:50,847	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Having drum parties to finish
EDL	00:09:50,847	00:09:52,127	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	The the buildings
EDL	00:09:52,639	00:09:58,015	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Well the Masons were working and it was very beautiful and fun and joyous there were other students who were
EDL	00:09:58,015	00:09:59,295	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Sent to labor camps
EDL	00:09:59,295	00:10:00,831	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Because they were homosexual
EDL	00:10:00,831	00:10:01,855	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Or religious
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:03,647	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Or in other ways anti-revolutionary
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:06,975	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Even before this agricultural labor camp
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:08,255	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	UPS opened in 1960
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:09,023	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	C5
EDL	00:10:09,023	00:10:11,327	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	The anti-revolutionary students were
EDL	00:10:11,327	00:10:12,095	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Expelled from the art school
EDL	00:10:12,863	00:10:16,447	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Ricardo porro continue to give them classes in his home
EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:22,079	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Broken feel that the values of the Revolution we're shifting as he says in the documentary
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:23,359	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	I used to tell
EDL	00:10:23,359	00:10:23,871	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	The other actor
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:26,175	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Don't lose
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:26,943	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Your time
EDL	00:10:27,455	00:10:29,247	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Making small details
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:31,295	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Try to do
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:32,063	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Sings
EDL	00:10:32,063	00:10:32,575	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Flask
EDL	00:10:33,087	00:10:35,647	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Because perhaps one day it's going to be
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:42,559	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	After the Missile Crisis after the Bay of Pigs military defense was given a much higher priority than say
EDL	00:10:43,327	00:10:46,143	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Creating the most beautiful art schools in the world
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:47,935	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	So there was the money issue
EDL	00:10:47,935	00:10:49,471	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	But also generally
EDL	00:10:49,983	00:10:53,311	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Cuba was starting to imitate the Soviet Union in more and more ways
EDL	00:10:53,823	00:11:00,223	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	I made it very individual architecture and they wanted Soviet architecture
EDL	00:11:00,223	00:11:03,295	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Blocky functional uniform one-size-fits-all
EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:05,343	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Completely the opposite
EDL	00:11:05,343	00:11:08,415	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Of the sensuous organic malts and curves
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:09,439	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Of the arts schools
EDL	00:11:09,439	00:11:11,487	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	There was an idea that
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:14,559	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	The designs for the Cuban national art schools were
EDL	00:11:15,071	00:11:17,119	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Extravagant for
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:18,911	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	A socialist Revolution
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:20,447	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	That had to tighten its belt
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:24,799	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	And what are the earliest proponents of that argument was Roberto secretary
EDL	00:11:25,311	00:11:28,127	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Roberto segret was the architecture critic
EDL	00:11:28,639	00:11:30,175	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Like really he was the only one
EDL	00:11:30,687	00:11:31,967	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	He had tremendous influence
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:36,319	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Cigarette was not a fan of the breasts and the papaya fountain
EDL	00:11:36,319	00:11:40,159	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	I segway himself says in the film
EDL	00:11:40,159	00:11:42,719	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	I like the connection
EDL	00:11:42,719	00:11:45,791	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	These days cigarette admits that he was a bit harsh
EDL	00:11:45,791	00:11:47,583	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Now segree will say that
EDL	00:11:47,583	00:11:49,119	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	He really didn't want to write those things
EDL	00:11:49,119	00:11:49,887	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	But he was
EDL	00:11:49,887	00:11:51,167	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Under constraints
EDL	00:11:51,167	00:11:52,191	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	My people higher up
EDL	00:11:53,215	00:11:54,751	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Mostly Antonio King
EDL	00:11:55,519	00:11:59,359	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Antonio Quintana was the last of a generation of established
EDL	00:11:59,359	00:11:59,871	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Cuban architect
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:06,015	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	All his contemporaries had fled During the Revolution and this left Quintana at the top of his field by default
EDL	00:12:06,783	00:12:07,807	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	He wanted it to
EDL	00:12:07,807	00:12:08,575	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Stay that way
EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:11,135	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Quintana clearly had a
EDL	00:12:11,135	00:12:12,159	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Personal
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:13,183	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Desire not to

EDL	00:12:17,023	00:12:20,863	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Cuba architecture Quintana and the critic Roberto Sekirei helped
EDL	00:12:20,863	00:12:22,655	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Turn favored against the schools
EDL	00:12:22,655	00:12:29,055	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Workers were slowly reduce the amount of workers portals buildings were far enough finished so they were really
EDL	00:12:29,055	00:12:29,823	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Able to be brought
EDL	00:12:29,823	00:12:31,615	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	To the finish line or very very very
EDL	00:12:31,615	00:12:35,711	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Close but the schools designed by the other two architects were not so lucky
EDL	00:12:36,479	00:12:38,527	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	The theater school was only 30% complete
EDL	00:12:39,295	00:12:42,367	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	The music school was also in finished but had a few usable room
EDL	00:12:43,135	00:12:44,159	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	The most unfinished
EDL	00:12:44,671	00:12:45,439	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Was the ballet school
EDL	00:12:46,207	00:12:47,231	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Which didn't have floorboard

EDL	00:12:49,279	00:12:55,679	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	All the materials were there and it could have been finished in like 15 days and the lead of the Cuban ballet
EDL	00:12:55,679	00:12:59,007	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Alicia Alonso is a very famous Cuban ballerina
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:13:05,151	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	She visited the site I don't like it no more
EDL	00:13:06,943	00:13:07,967	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	And that was that
EDL	00:13:07,967	00:13:11,295	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	The Cuban ballet opted for a much more centrally-located Studio
EDL	00:13:11,807	00:13:14,111	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	And in July of 1965
EDL	00:13:14,111	00:13:15,135	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	The schools were just
EDL	00:13:15,135	00:13:15,647	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Declared finish
EDL	00:13:16,159	00:13:18,719	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	In all their varying states of completion
EDL	00:13:18,719	00:13:19,743	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	They had an opening
EDL	00:13:19,743	00:13:23,327	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Declared them open and they were used in the state that they were
EDL	00:13:23,327	00:13:28,703	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Even the unfinished ballet school was used very briefly as a Russian circus School
EDL	00:13:28,703	00:13:32,543	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	The Architects were scattered to different jobs within the ministry of construction

EDL	00:13:55,583	00:13:56,607	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	And I decided to leave
EDL	00:13:58,399	00:14:01,727	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	In 1966 parole left Cuba and move to Paris
EDL	00:14:02,239	00:14:03,775	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	And as for the schools themselves
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:06,847	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	The crazy thing is that they never close
EDL	00:14:07,615	00:14:10,175	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Even during some horrible spells in Cuba's history
EDL	00:14:10,175	00:14:11,711	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	When entire family is where

EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:25,535	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	But the other four arts schools continue to be among the finest in the world
EDL	00:14:25,535	00:14:27,839	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	Although they are not as big as they were meant to be
EDL	00:14:28,351	00:14:30,399	| 99pi-0166-Vivalaarquitectura--1 |	And they're pretty run down and some parts
