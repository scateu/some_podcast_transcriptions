EDL	00:03:19,168	00:03:21,216	| 99pi-0177-lawnorder-1 |	The first time I had a company do it
EDL	00:03:21,728	00:03:23,520	| 99pi-0177-lawnorder-1 |	They charged me like $1,200
EDL	00:03:24,032	00:03:28,896	| 99pi-0177-lawnorder-1 |	And I said I'm not doing this you know every time it dies Joe met with his homeowners association
EDL	00:03:29,408	00:03:31,712	| 99pi-0177-lawnorder-1 |	But they were not cutting him any slack
EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:33,504	| 99pi-0177-lawnorder-1 |	So then finally they
EDL	00:03:33,504	00:03:37,344	| 99pi-0177-lawnorder-1 |	Did some ruling that that if I didn't put sod down the whole place

EDL	00:03:50,144	00:03:55,776	| 99pi-0177-lawnorder-1 |	Shortly thereafter Joe got another letter
EDL	00:03:56,288	00:03:58,848	| 99pi-0177-lawnorder-1 |	I don't want everybody to see police coming to the house
EDL	00:03:58,848	00:04:00,128	| 99pi-0177-lawnorder-1 |	Caught me a wafer

EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:09,088	| 99pi-0177-lawnorder-1 |	So I did it to them the choir way I turn myself in
EDL	00:04:10,624	00:04:13,184	| 99pi-0177-lawnorder-1 |	At 66 years old Joe prudente
EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:16,256	| 99pi-0177-lawnorder-1 |	And otherwise law-abiding retiree from Long Island
EDL	00:04:16,256	00:04:21,375	| 99pi-0177-lawnorder-1 |	Presented himself to the Pasco County Jail wearing a grandpa gone wild t-shirt
EDL	00:04:21,887	00:04:26,495	| 99pi-0177-lawnorder-1 |	He was apprehended on allegations of failing to properly maintain his lawn
EDL	00:04:26,495	00:04:27,775	| 99pi-0177-lawnorder-1 |	To community standards
EDL	00:04:27,775	00:04:28,799	| 99pi-0177-lawnorder-1 |	There was no bail
EDL	00:04:28,799	00:04:31,359	| 99pi-0177-lawnorder-1 |	No bail until the side was done
EDL	00:04:32,127	00:04:38,527	| 99pi-0177-lawnorder-1 |	Now fortunately for Joe the local paper had written about the arrest and detainment of a senior citizen for having a

EDL	00:04:39,807	00:04:45,439	| 99pi-0177-lawnorder-1 |	Word got around and dozens of people came to help dig up Andre saw the prudente is lon
EDL	00:04:45,439	00:04:47,487	| 99pi-0177-lawnorder-1 |	Joe was released from jail the next day
EDL	00:04:50,559	00:04:54,143	| 99pi-0177-lawnorder-1 |	Most cases of homeowners brushing up against the lawn enforcement
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:56,191	| 99pi-0177-lawnorder-1 |	Do not end in jail time

EDL	00:05:20,255	00:05:21,791	| 99pi-0177-lawnorder-1 |	There's a paradox for the lawn
EDL	00:05:22,303	00:05:27,167	| 99pi-0177-lawnorder-1 |	On the one hand it is the pedestal on which sits the greatest symbol of the American dream

EDL	00:06:02,751	00:06:03,775	| 99pi-0177-lawnorder-1 |	But a lawn
EDL	00:06:03,775	00:06:05,311	| 99pi-0177-lawnorder-1 |	Is a designed object
