EDL	00:06:39,871	00:06:40,383	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	How much time is left
EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:42,943	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	The feast and usually is
EDL	00:06:42,943	00:06:43,967	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	It's like the worst
EDL	00:06:43,967	00:06:44,479	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Bannock
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:47,295	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	And you wake up and yours
EDL	00:06:47,295	00:06:47,807	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Wedding
EDL	00:06:48,575	00:06:52,415	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	You can't believe you just
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:54,975	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	I've had those where I'm on the board
EDL	00:06:54,975	00:06:59,071	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Announcing the Morning Edition on kalw and the sliders
EDL	00:06:59,071	00:07:02,399	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	I don't do anything in the Buns just don't look right
EDL	00:07:02,399	00:07:05,471	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Enter rather than try anything I'm just paralyzed with fear
EDL	00:07:05,471	00:07:10,591	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Oh yeah in my dream I'm doing a newscast with no copy and I just have the talk
EDL	00:07:10,591	00:07:12,383	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	And talk and talk and talk
EDL	00:07:12,383	00:07:15,455	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	And talk like an idiot until the clock goes
EDL	00:07:15,455	00:07:18,527	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	I haven't even seen it down clock in ages
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:23,135	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Note podcast there is no time scarcity no interlocking gears
EDL	00:07:23,135	00:07:25,183	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Of local and National broadcast
EDL	00:07:25,183	00:07:27,487	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	And that changes everything
EDL	00:07:27,999	00:07:31,583	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	But we also make a version of the show that fits inside the NPR clock
EDL	00:07:31,583	00:07:33,631	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	The c-segment of Morning Edition to be exact
EDL	00:07:34,143	00:07:36,191	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	4 minutes and 30 seconds exactly
EDL	00:07:36,703	00:07:38,495	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Over by 143
EDL	00:07:39,007	00:07:42,591	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Figure out a way to take all these ideas or at least some
EDL	00:07:42,591	00:07:44,127	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Fraction of these ideas
EDL	00:07:44,127	00:07:44,639	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Brandon
EDL	00:07:45,151	00:07:46,943	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Into a show that less than 5 minutes
EDL	00:07:47,455	00:07:48,223	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Sometimes
EDL	00:07:48,735	00:07:50,783	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	That really really sucks
EDL	00:07:51,295	00:07:55,391	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	But you'd be surprised how often I actually really like the radio version
EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:04,863	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	The first time I really internalized the difference between doing radio and doing podcast
EDL	00:08:04,863	00:08:06,399	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	When people would tell me
EDL	00:08:06,399	00:08:08,703	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	But they wanted my stories tubing longer
EDL	00:08:09,471	00:08:12,031	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	In the entire decade of radio I produce
EDL	00:08:12,031	00:08:13,311	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Tired of this podcast
EDL	00:08:13,823	00:08:19,199	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	No editor has ever asked me to go longer and I can vouch for that
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:22,271	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	You're so mean to me is so mean for 30 soccer
EDL	00:08:22,271	00:08:25,087	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	What podcasts have no constraints you can be any length
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:27,135	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	The only constraint is the content
EDL	00:08:27,135	00:08:33,279	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	And people always tell me they wish this podcast was longer but I think the show would suffer if it went on too long
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:36,351	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Until maybe there's a need for a clock
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:38,911	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Even if the clock isn't strictly required
EDL	00:08:39,423	00:08:40,191	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Constraint
EDL	00:08:40,703	00:08:41,215	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Or maybe
EDL	00:08:41,727	00:08:43,263	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Restraint in this case
EDL	00:08:43,263	00:08:44,799	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Makes for better art
EDL	00:08:44,799	00:08:47,103	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	When I started thinking about the broadcast clock
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:48,895	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	As a piece of design I wondered
EDL	00:08:49,407	00:08:51,199	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	How it all got started in public radio
EDL	00:08:51,711	00:08:55,295	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	NPR came together in the late sixties in the early 70s
EDL	00:08:55,295	00:08:56,575	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	When Network news with
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:08:59,135	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	And those broadcast shows of course
EDL	00:08:59,647	00:09:00,415	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	How to clock
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:02,975	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	But public radio news wanted to be something
EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:04,767	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Because of this guy
EDL	00:09:05,279	00:09:08,607	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	I'm Bill Sebring and I was the first director of programming for NPR
EDL	00:09:10,143	00:09:11,679	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Still simmering
EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:14,239	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	He came up with the whole idea of All Things Considered
EDL	00:09:15,007	00:09:17,567	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Which of course everyone in the business now refers to as a
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:19,871	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	In the original mission statement
EDL	00:09:19,871	00:09:20,639	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Did you see was
EDL	00:09:21,407	00:09:22,175	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Called
EDL	00:09:22,175	00:09:23,711	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Did he identify with
EDL	00:09:26,527	00:09:29,343	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	But you decided that wouldn't be a good name for the show
EDL	00:09:29,343	00:09:34,207	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Right-wing was among the earliest designers of the public radio Sound
EDL	00:09:34,207	00:09:39,071	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	That sound included lots of audio and voices from the world outside the studio
EDL	00:09:39,071	00:09:41,119	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	It called for a documentary-style approach
EDL	00:09:41,631	00:09:43,167	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Even the same day news
EDL	00:09:43,167	00:09:43,679	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	For that
EDL	00:09:44,191	00:09:46,495	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Bill designed a very open clock
EDL	00:09:46,495	00:09:48,543	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	We didn't have a lot of breaks
EDL	00:09:48,543	00:09:49,055	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Throughout it
EDL	00:09:50,079	00:09:51,103	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	And it was so
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:53,663	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	This frustrated some people because they thought
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:09:56,223	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	They wanted a very fix clock
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:09:58,527	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	There was a clock but it was
EDL	00:09:59,551	00:10:00,063	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Not that
EDL	00:10:00,831	00:10:02,367	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	I believe it was time for a we had
EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:03,391	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Join
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:05,439	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Stations but otherwise
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:07,487	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	And
EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:08,511	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	I think that's
EDL	00:10:09,791	00:10:11,071	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	What are things that made it
EDL	00:10:11,583	00:10:13,631	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Interesting to listen to because it wasn't predict
EDL	00:10:14,143	00:10:14,655	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	That way
EDL	00:10:15,423	00:10:16,447	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	And you let the
EDL	00:10:16,447	00:10:17,215	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	The stories
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:19,007	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Stories were leaving
EDL	00:10:19,519	00:10:20,287	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	I like the
EDL	00:10:20,287	00:10:24,895	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	The peace the old ATC clock only had a few slices in a lot of open space
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:28,735	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	In there one story might be 2 minutes followed by another that was 20 minutes
EDL	00:10:29,247	00:10:29,759	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	It was
EDL	00:10:30,271	00:10:32,063	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Open it was kind of like a podcast
EDL	00:10:32,575	00:10:33,599	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	But it still was saying there
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:35,903	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Not everyone appreciate
EDL	00:10:35,903	00:10:40,511	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Did that there was a conference two weeks after ATC rolled out in the station managers just
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:42,047	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Call Bill Sebring today
EDL	00:10:42,047	00:10:43,071	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Carpet for hits
EDL	00:10:43,071	00:10:44,607	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Fluffy loose sounding program
EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:51,263	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	And it was something else that they really didn't like in this is a digression here but this is a punk ass so we get to have digression
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:54,335	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	And of course I got this criticism from something about
EDL	00:10:54,335	00:10:54,847	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Women's watch
EDL	00:10:55,359	00:10:55,871	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	All that stuff
EDL	00:10:56,383	00:10:57,151	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	That
EDL	00:10:57,663	00:11:00,479	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	On FM women's voices have the high frequencies and
EDL	00:11:00,479	00:11:01,759	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	You should see the meter
EDL	00:11:02,527	00:11:03,295	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Building
EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:04,063	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Let me go
EDL	00:11:04,063	00:11:04,575	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Just come on
EDL	00:11:06,111	00:11:08,671	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Really they said women's voices were too high for FM
EDL	00:11:09,183	00:11:09,951	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Did some voices

EDL	00:11:12,255	00:11:13,535	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Oh my God
EDL	00:11:15,839	00:11:20,959	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	We have Sean build seeming was out of NBR a year-and-a-half later followed
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:25,055	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Began a long process of becoming more subdivide
EDL	00:11:25,823	00:11:28,895	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	The women he hired like Linda wertheimer and Susan Sandberg
EDL	00:11:28,895	00:11:29,919	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Are well-known
EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:33,503	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Semen on to help turn Fresh Air with Terry Gross into a national program
EDL	00:11:34,015	00:11:34,783	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Annie's the
EDL	00:11:34,783	00:11:40,159	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Kind of the patron saint of creative open style public radio including this program right here
EDL	00:11:40,159	00:11:41,951	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	But you know being loose and open
EDL	00:11:41,951	00:11:42,975	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Can also be its own form of
EDL	00:11:43,743	00:11:44,511	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	People
EDL	00:11:44,511	00:11:46,303	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Often mentioned to me. The boy
EDL	00:11:46,303	00:11:52,703	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Those were the Halcyon Days of all things considered and I was there no they weren't that's Neal Conan who's done everything
EDL	00:11:52,703	00:11:54,495	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	NPR including until
EDL	00:11:55,007	00:11:58,847	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Recently hosting the two-hour live call-in program Talk of the Nation
EDL	00:11:58,847	00:12:00,127	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	New Conan loves
EDL	00:12:00,127	00:12:02,431	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	The clock for him it's an art form until
EDL	00:12:02,431	00:12:07,039	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Itself
EDL	00:12:07,551	00:12:09,087	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	There's these little things that
EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:13,183	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	If you've never done it or impossible if you've done it forever you don't even think about doing them
EDL	00:12:14,207	00:12:16,767	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	How long is 5 Seconds
EDL	00:12:16,767	00:12:18,559	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	You can ID 3DS and say goodbye in French
EDL	00:12:19,327	00:12:22,399	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	So it's not surprising that would Neal Conan took over Talk of the Nation
EDL	00:12:24,191	00:12:24,959	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	More posts
EDL	00:12:24,959	00:12:27,007	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Because it turns out you said
EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:28,031	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Pretty much all you
EDL	00:12:28,031	00:12:29,055	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Need to say about

EDL	00:12:30,591	00:12:31,359	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	By the 40 in

EDL	00:12:36,223	00:12:39,807	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	NPR recently cancelled Talk of the Nation after 21 years
EDL	00:12:39,807	00:12:40,831	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	And he resigned
EDL	00:12:40,831	00:12:43,391	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Neal Conan says artificial constraints make us better
EDL	00:12:43,903	00:12:46,463	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	And I noticed that the person who edits audio story
EDL	00:12:47,231	00:12:49,023	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	We was perspective when we're inside the
EDL	00:12:49,023	00:12:50,815	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	The story just trying to make sense of all a report
EDL	00:12:51,839	00:12:53,119	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	We can't tell what's important anymore
EDL	00:12:53,887	00:12:57,471	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	If we don't have any constraints we can make boring and confusing
EDL	00:12:57,471	00:12:57,983	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Wingstop
EDL	00:12:58,495	00:13:01,823	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	The constraint doesn't have to be a time limit but at least the clock forces
EDL	00:13:01,823	00:13:02,847	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	To have a perm

EDL	00:13:05,663	00:13:07,199	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	And figure out what really matters
EDL	00:13:07,711	00:13:12,063	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Of course the clock and also limit what you say as well have to do in the broadcast version of this piece

EDL	00:13:17,439	00:13:20,511	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	So there was a day long ago when Neal Conan
EDL	00:13:20,511	00:13:21,535	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Was not mad
EDL	00:13:21,535	00:13:22,303	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Picture of the clock
EDL	00:13:22,815	00:13:25,119	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	When he first started at NPR in the late 70s
EDL	00:13:25,887	00:13:28,191	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	He had to direct this new show called weekend also
EDL	00:13:28,703	00:13:29,471	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Considered
EDL	00:13:29,471	00:13:31,007	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	I think briefed on the clock
EDL	00:13:31,007	00:13:34,335	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	By the event director of weekend All Things Considered Deborah Amos is

EDL	00:13:36,383	00:13:37,151	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	And
EDL	00:13:37,663	00:13:38,687	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	And my question to her was
EDL	00:13:39,455	00:13:41,247	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	You mean exactly the time
EDL	00:13:42,271	00:13:45,087	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	And I think we ended that for sure that I produced
EDL	00:13:45,087	00:13:47,135	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	About four minutes earlier I was so terrified
EDL	00:13:47,647	00:13:48,159	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	A blowing the post
EDL	00:13:48,927	00:13:50,975	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	So a while ago I went to hear Deborah Amos
EDL	00:13:51,999	00:13:54,815	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	And afterwards I asked her if this story was
EDL	00:13:54,815	00:13:55,327	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	True
EDL	00:13:55,839	00:14:00,959	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	That Neal Conan ended his first live NPR Show 4 minutes

EDL	00:14:01,983	00:14:03,263	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	And she said they did
EDL	00:14:03,263	00:14:07,615	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	And that they had to grab the longest film music they could find in the studio
EDL	00:14:08,127	00:14:11,199	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	Which was some kind of whale song
EDL	00:14:16,319	00:14:21,183	| 99pi-0088-thebroadcastclock-1 |	No super design subdivided format is telling us when the stop the story we're just kind of winging it
