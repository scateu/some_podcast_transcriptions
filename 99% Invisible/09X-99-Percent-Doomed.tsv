EDL	00:02:01,856	00:02:03,392	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	And not the radio people because
EDL	00:02:04,416	00:02:05,440	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Took a week off the radio show
EDL	00:02:06,464	00:02:07,488	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Do some other work

EDL	00:02:09,024	00:02:14,400	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	But this is actually a piece that I really want to present to you because it's an older piece I did about a year-and-a-half ago for a
EDL	00:02:14,400	00:02:15,168	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Text show pilot
EDL	00:02:15,936	00:02:19,776	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	That never got picked up so it only got the pilot itself only got hurt by about
EDL	00:02:20,288	00:02:21,056	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	15
EDL	00:02:21,056	00:02:21,568	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	20 people
EDL	00:02:22,336	00:02:26,176	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	I really love this piece I put a lot of effort into it and I liked it a lot of my job
EDL	00:02:26,688	00:02:27,712	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	In general is to
EDL	00:02:28,224	00:02:29,248	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Pilot shows in
EDL	00:02:29,248	00:02:30,272	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	And to work on new things
EDL	00:02:30,272	00:02:31,040	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Sound design
EDL	00:02:31,040	00:02:31,808	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Do programs
EDL	00:02:31,808	00:02:32,576	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	But
EDL	00:02:32,576	00:02:35,392	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	The consequences that is sometimes you make radio that
EDL	00:02:35,392	00:02:36,416	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	That isn't on the radio
EDL	00:02:36,928	00:02:37,696	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Which is weird
EDL	00:02:38,464	00:02:40,512	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	And so this is one of those pieces
EDL	00:02:41,280	00:02:44,352	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	It makes it so appropriate is this actually represent InDesign
EDL	00:02:44,352	00:02:45,376	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Problem in the problem
EDL	00:02:46,400	00:02:47,168	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Problem or design
EDL	00:02:47,168	00:02:47,936	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Challenge
EDL	00:02:47,936	00:02:49,984	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Is how do we get humans on Mars
EDL	00:02:51,264	00:02:52,032	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	There's
EDL	00:02:52,032	00:02:54,336	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Certainly technological solutions to this problem
EDL	00:02:54,848	00:02:55,616	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	There's a
EDL	00:02:55,616	00:02:57,664	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Solutions that involve a lot of willpower and
EDL	00:02:58,176	00:03:00,480	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Money maybe but there's also some out-of-the-box thinker
EDL	00:03:01,248	00:03:01,760	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Might come into play
EDL	00:03:03,040	00:03:07,136	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Some of the information in the piece is a little old so it's about a year-and-a-half old
EDL	00:03:07,136	00:03:09,184	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	There used to be a constellation project
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:10,720	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Does the Moon to Mars program that
EDL	00:03:11,488	00:03:12,256	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Obama
EDL	00:03:12,256	00:03:13,024	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	When the world ran out
EDL	00:03:13,024	00:03:13,792	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	The money
EDL	00:03:13,792	00:03:14,560	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	And
EDL	00:03:15,072	00:03:17,376	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	I think that's about it but I'll most of it is still
EDL	00:03:17,376	00:03:17,888	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Pretty relevant
EDL	00:03:18,400	00:03:19,168	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	I think it's
EDL	00:03:19,168	00:03:19,680	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	I quite enjoyed
EDL	00:03:20,960	00:03:23,776	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	So I hope you enjoy it too so this the 99% invisible this week
EDL	00:03:24,288	00:03:26,080	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	It's called one-way ticket to Mars
EDL	00:03:29,920	00:03:30,432	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Ignition
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:32,736	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	We can get tomorrow
EDL	00:03:33,248	00:03:33,760	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	That's easy
EDL	00:03:34,272	00:03:37,600	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Break Earth's gravity in hurdle towards the red planet is
EDL	00:03:37,600	00:03:40,160	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Totally doable the science fiction Park
EDL	00:03:40,160	00:03:43,744	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Detect problem NASA says we'll take four decades to solve
EDL	00:03:44,256	00:03:45,024	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	It's how to get back
EDL	00:03:45,536	00:03:47,840	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	You can't carry enough fuel for a round trip
EDL	00:03:47,840	00:03:48,864	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	To have a
EDL	00:03:48,864	00:03:51,936	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	We'll have to make new fuel up there
EDL	00:03:51,936	00:03:52,704	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Literally
EDL	00:03:52,704	00:03:54,752	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Big of mine on Mars Harvest minerals
EDL	00:03:54,752	00:03:56,032	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Whip up a nuclear reactor
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:03:57,056	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Simple rocket
EDL	00:03:57,824	00:03:58,592	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Not easy
EDL	00:03:59,360	00:04:01,408	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	But if you really want to go to Mars
EDL	00:04:01,408	00:04:04,480	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Like now if you can't possibly wait any longer
EDL	00:04:04,480	00:04:05,504	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	James McClean
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:07,040	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Has another plan
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:08,576	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	I think what we should have
EDL	00:04:09,088	00:04:10,624	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Is a short program
EDL	00:04:11,136	00:04:13,696	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Possibly a ten-year program like the Apollo program
EDL	00:04:14,464	00:04:15,232	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Where we were
EDL	00:04:15,232	00:04:16,000	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Actually
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:19,071	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Devault equipment in Land one person
EDL	00:04:20,095	00:04:20,863	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	On Mars
EDL	00:04:21,631	00:04:23,679	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	And we would keep that person we saw
EDL	00:04:23,679	00:04:24,447	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Supply
EDL	00:04:24,447	00:04:28,799	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	The prime thing that makes this feasible is that you don't plan on bringing this person back
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:31,359	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	I would have let that sink in
EDL	00:04:33,151	00:04:33,663	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Alrighty
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:40,831	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Play is now an oil and gas pipeline engineer over 20 years he worked for NASA
EDL	00:04:40,831	00:04:43,391	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Safety Systems and the International Space Station
EDL	00:04:43,391	00:04:46,719	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	I know he no longer has anything to do with space you still
EDL	00:04:46,719	00:04:47,743	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	A man on a mission
EDL	00:04:48,255	00:04:54,655	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	I began to disturb that there were options as far as space travel to other plan
EDL	00:04:54,655	00:04:56,191	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Planets that NASA wasn't
EDL	00:04:56,191	00:05:01,823	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Considering I brought up in a technical meeting once it a guy was giving a presentation about NASA's
EDL	00:05:02,335	00:05:03,871	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Plans for the future
EDL	00:05:03,871	00:05:06,431	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	He raises his hand and says this guy
EDL	00:05:06,431	00:05:08,735	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	When I send one person one way
EDL	00:05:08,735	00:05:12,575	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	One person because it cuts down on the weights applied to a manageable level
EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:15,135	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	In one way because getting them back
EDL	00:05:15,135	00:05:16,927	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	It's really really hard
EDL	00:05:16,927	00:05:21,279	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	He was just astonished that anyone would would even mention such a thing at Justice
EDL	00:05:21,279	00:05:23,071	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	It sounded almost immoral
EDL	00:05:23,583	00:05:25,887	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	But the more I thought about this the more I
EDL	00:05:26,655	00:05:29,215	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	I realize that it was it was actually
EDL	00:05:29,983	00:05:32,031	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Probably the only way that
EDL	00:05:32,031	00:05:32,543	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Wechat
EDL	00:05:33,055	00:05:37,663	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	See this thing happen and you know what in our lifetime of the current generation here on Earth
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:41,247	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Because all of the other schemes that I read about
EDL	00:05:41,247	00:05:45,343	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Involve developing a exotic equipments going to take 50 years
EDL	00:05:45,855	00:05:48,671	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	You could call it a suicide mission and many people have
EDL	00:05:48,671	00:05:53,279	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	McLean says it's really no more of a suicide mission than the early Vikings making their way to North America
EDL	00:05:53,791	00:05:56,351	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	But I think it's really no more of a suicide mission than life
EDL	00:05:56,351	00:05:56,863	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Itself
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:06:00,703	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Explore would be going to live out a life on Mars
EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:01,983	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Dramatically
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:02,751	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Shortened
EDL	00:06:02,751	00:06:04,287	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Unbelievably harsh life
EDL	00:06:05,567	00:06:06,079	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	None the less
EDL	00:06:07,615	00:06:11,711	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Well it wouldn't it would not be pleasant that's putting it mildly
EDL	00:06:11,711	00:06:14,783	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	It would be I guess like living in a submarine
EDL	00:06:14,783	00:06:18,111	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	You would probably live in a habitat that was covered with
EDL	00:06:18,879	00:06:19,647	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Dirt
EDL	00:06:19,647	00:06:21,951	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	So you would only go outside occasionally
EDL	00:06:22,463	00:06:24,511	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	The conditions would be so Danger
EDL	00:06:25,535	00:06:28,095	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Boris has a poisonous low-pressure atmosphere
EDL	00:06:28,095	00:06:29,887	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Terry spacesuit better work

EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:44,735	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Your pops
EDL	00:06:45,247	00:06:48,575	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Because it can get down to 190 degrees below zero
EDL	00:06:48,575	00:06:51,135	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Then there's the cancer-causing cosmic radiation
EDL	00:06:52,927	00:06:54,463	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	You better hope not
EDL	00:06:54,463	00:06:56,767	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	And it's only a suicide mission
EDL	00:06:56,767	00:06:58,047	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	From the astronauts perspect
EDL	00:06:58,559	00:07:00,607	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	The problem is that for NASA
EDL	00:07:00,607	00:07:01,887	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	It's more of a homicide mission
EDL	00:07:02,655	00:07:04,447	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	And that's a little harder to sell to Congress
EDL	00:07:05,471	00:07:07,519	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	But explorers get it

EDL	00:07:18,783	00:07:20,831	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Right now the space shuttle
EDL	00:07:20,831	00:07:22,623	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Has been demonstrated to be nice

EDL	00:07:34,143	00:07:39,007	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	For the chance of doing something remarkable this person is going to be more than just
EDL	00:07:39,775	00:07:41,055	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Somebody to go down in history
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:43,871	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	If this person will be it will be like a
EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:47,455	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	An Adam or Eve type figure legendary
EDL	00:07:48,735	00:07:50,271	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Plus I have to admit
EDL	00:07:50,783	00:07:52,063	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	There's something about it
EDL	00:07:52,575	00:07:53,599	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Captures the imagination
EDL	00:07:54,367	00:07:55,391	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Doom

EDL	00:08:01,023	00:08:02,559	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	It would be poetic
EDL	00:08:02,559	00:08:03,839	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Beautiful
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:05,119	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	I'm kind of inspiring
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:06,655	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	It horrible
EDL	00:08:07,167	00:08:07,935	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	McCobb
EDL	00:08:08,447	00:08:09,471	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	It would be riveting
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:14,591	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	And it's probably never going to happen I think that's a non-starter from NASA
EDL	00:08:15,359	00:08:17,663	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	We're not going to send astronauts to Mars
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:18,175	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Without the case
EDL	00:08:19,967	00:08:20,991	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	That's Chris McKay
EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:22,271	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Doctor Killjoy
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:24,575	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	I'm the deputy program scientist
EDL	00:08:25,343	00:08:26,623	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Of the constellation

EDL	00:08:27,903	00:08:28,415	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	NASA
EDL	00:08:28,927	00:08:31,487	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Turn to the moon on to Mars human exploration Pro
EDL	00:08:31,999	00:08:34,047	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	So he's actually planning NASA's manned mission
EDL	00:08:35,071	00:08:37,631	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Well I personally I I wouldn't want to go in at 1
EDL	00:08:37,631	00:08:40,959	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Play Mission and also I like the idea of that
EDL	00:08:40,959	00:08:45,567	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	We bring Mars into the sphere of human activity which means we going come and we going come
EDL	00:08:45,567	00:08:47,103	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	I don't see why we have to
EDL	00:08:47,615	00:08:49,919	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Surrender to the technological challenges
EDL	00:08:49,919	00:08:50,943	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Say okay this is impossible
EDL	00:08:51,455	00:08:52,223	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Can't do it
EDL	00:08:52,223	00:08:52,735	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	I think
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:54,271	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	That's a cop out
EDL	00:08:54,271	00:08:56,319	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	What we ought to do is say well let's build better Rock
EDL	00:08:56,319	00:08:58,367	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	It's come on you guys engineers get to work
EDL	00:08:59,135	00:08:59,647	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	One round trip
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:04,511	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Chris McKay and NASA think we should go to Mars once we're ready to establish a long-term base
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:05,791	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Something like the Antarctic base
EDL	00:09:06,303	00:09:09,375	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	But there are humans there year-round coming and going and doing research
EDL	00:09:09,887	00:09:10,911	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Boldly stay
EDL	00:09:11,423	00:09:12,447	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Paraphrasing start
EDL	00:09:12,959	00:09:13,727	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	That becomes
EDL	00:09:14,495	00:09:15,007	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Rotational
EDL	00:09:15,519	00:09:16,543	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Innocence
EDL	00:09:16,543	00:09:17,823	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	What's the rush
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:20,127	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Why why do we need to rush them
EDL	00:09:20,895	00:09:23,199	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	The author of The One Way plan James McClain is
EDL	00:09:23,199	00:09:23,967	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	64
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:24,991	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	So for him
EDL	00:09:24,991	00:09:25,503	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	There is a rush
EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:26,783	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Well it's
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:30,879	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Some of these questions would be nice to answering in my lifetime I like to know the answer
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:32,927	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	I'd like to know the answer
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:34,207	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	People say well
EDL	00:09:34,719	00:09:36,255	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	If you want to see it in your lifetime
EDL	00:09:37,023	00:09:41,375	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Respond well I'm not that old maybe I will with 40 more years
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:47,775	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Unlikely but hey I go running everyday and I don't smoke the fact that it's in my lifetime or not is really not an important
EDL	00:09:47,775	00:09:49,055	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Consideration NASA shouldn't
EDL	00:09:49,823	00:09:53,919	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Major decisions based on the lifetime of its current scientists and engineers
EDL	00:09:53,919	00:09:54,687	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	And of course
EDL	00:09:54,687	00:09:56,223	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	That makes good practical sense
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:10:02,623	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	But isn't there something to this idea of a bold Apollo like 10 year mission to excite the imagination
EDL	00:10:02,623	00:10:03,647	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	No matter what the cost
EDL	00:10:04,159	00:10:05,439	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Shouldn't we recapture
EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:07,231	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	The Thrill of the space race
EDL	00:10:07,231	00:10:08,255	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	The way you win a race
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:09,535	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Is
EDL	00:10:09,535	00:10:12,095	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	You exert yourself fully during the race
EDL	00:10:12,095	00:10:14,399	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Even if it means that after the race you clap
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:17,727	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Blob at the end of the finish line
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:22,079	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	And that's what we did at Apollo we exerted enormous effort we took our best people
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:23,615	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Push them as hard as we could
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:24,895	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	And we won the race
EDL	00:10:24,895	00:10:25,663	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	And then
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:26,431	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	We clocked
EDL	00:10:26,431	00:10:27,199	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	At the end of it
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:31,039	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	The political context for space exploration now is very different than a race
EDL	00:10:31,807	00:10:33,343	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	The Apollo president
EDL	00:10:33,343	00:10:34,367	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Is not the president
EDL	00:10:34,367	00:10:34,879	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Follow here
EDL	00:10:35,647	00:10:37,183	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	And that's a big problem
EDL	00:10:37,695	00:10:42,303	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Apollo was NASA's golden age when anyone talks about returning NASA to it
EDL	00:10:42,303	00:10:43,071	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Former glory
EDL	00:10:43,583	00:10:44,863	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	That's the model they point to
EDL	00:10:45,375	00:10:47,679	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Except for a small block of Interest training
EDL	00:10:47,679	00:10:49,471	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Space camp craze of the 80s
EDL	00:10:49,471	00:10:53,055	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	The Solera of NASA only grabbed the attention of the world
EDL	00:10:53,055	00:10:54,079	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	When there was a horrible
EDL	00:10:54,591	00:10:55,359	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Horrible track
EDL	00:10:57,151	00:11:00,479	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	James McClean ask you to imagine nightly broadcast

EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:05,599	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Over the edge of a crater five times deeper than the grand
EDL	00:11:06,367	00:11:09,439	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Hearing stories from the base of a volcano so tall
EDL	00:11:09,439	00:11:11,231	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	It nearly reaches space itself
EDL	00:11:11,743	00:11:17,119	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	That's a beautiful sight in front row seats to the greatest and coolest Hail Mary pass
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:18,399	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	The history of humankind
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:20,959	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	One man one way McLean says

EDL	00:11:24,799	00:11:26,335	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	But you can feel it and Mars
EDL	00:11:26,847	00:11:27,359	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Slipping away
EDL	00:11:28,127	00:11:30,431	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	They won't even study the option
EDL	00:11:30,431	00:11:32,479	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	If they set up a small task
EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:33,247	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Force
EDL	00:11:33,247	00:11:39,647	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Turn office to study this particular option I believe it would be obvious just from the technical stuff
EDL	00:11:39,647	00:11:42,207	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Daddy's that this is the only way it could be done
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:44,767	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Relatively low cost
EDL	00:11:44,767	00:11:47,327	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	And in a relatively short period of time
EDL	00:11:48,095	00:11:50,399	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	All of the other schemes are going to Mars
EDL	00:11:50,399	00:11:52,191	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	There's no way it's going to happen
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:53,215	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Anytime
EDL	00:11:53,215	00:11:54,239	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Futura forever
EDL	00:11:56,031	00:11:57,311	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Forever is too long
EDL	00:11:57,311	00:11:59,871	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Whether we follow the one-way plan or not
EDL	00:11:59,871	00:12:02,687	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Maybe more than out-of-the-box thinking what we really need
EDL	00:12:02,687	00:12:05,503	| 09X-99-Percent-Doomed |	Is another country to come along and start talking trash
