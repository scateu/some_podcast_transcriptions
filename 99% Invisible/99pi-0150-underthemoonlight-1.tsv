EDL	00:01:37,536	00:01:41,632	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	So it's possible that these were individual murders rather than the work of one man

EDL	00:02:13,888	00:02:17,472	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	Basically there was no outdoor lighting there was moonlight
EDL	00:02:17,472	00:02:19,008	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	When the moon was out that was about
EDL	00:02:19,520	00:02:24,384	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	And in 1894 the City of Austin decided to buy more moonlight
EDL	00:02:24,384	00:02:25,408	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	In the form of towers
EDL	00:02:26,176	00:02:27,456	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	They're called Moonlight Towers
EDL	00:02:27,456	00:02:27,968	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	Because we were supposed to
EDL	00:02:29,248	00:02:29,760	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	Full moon
EDL	00:02:30,272	00:02:32,576	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	Austin adopted Moonlight Towers
EDL	00:02:32,576	00:02:35,904	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	Was really work Powers there 15 stories high
EDL	00:02:36,416	00:02:42,816	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	Very industrial-looking made of metal scaffolding and each was crowned with a circle of six lights
EDL	00:02:42,816	00:02:45,376	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	Soaring way way high above the city
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:49,472	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	Austin wasn't the first to implement Tower lighting
EDL	00:02:49,472	00:02:52,032	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	In the eighteen-hundreds a lot of major cities had them
EDL	00:02:52,544	00:02:57,920	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	ArcLight hours illuminated streets in New York Baltimore La San Jose and Detroit
EDL	00:02:57,920	00:02:59,200	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	Detroit had a very huge
EDL	00:02:59,968	00:03:00,736	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	Much larger than Austin
EDL	00:03:01,504	00:03:03,808	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	And that's actually where Austin got their moonlight
EDL	00:03:03,808	00:03:04,576	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	Towers
EDL	00:03:04,576	00:03:06,624	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	In 1894 the city purchase
EDL	00:03:06,624	00:03:07,648	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	Just 31 of them
EDL	00:03:07,648	00:03:09,184	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	From the city of Detroit
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:10,976	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	And despite their romantic name
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:17,120	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	Be absurdly tall Moonlight Towers were actually a very practical design
EDL	00:03:17,632	00:03:20,448	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	And their height was meant to accommodate the lighting they use
EDL	00:03:20,960	00:03:22,752	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	There are clients there initially were ArcLight
EDL	00:03:22,752	00:03:24,288	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	Carbon Arc lights
EDL	00:03:24,288	00:03:26,336	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	The precursor to the incandescent bulb
EDL	00:03:26,848	00:03:29,408	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	Park lights are basically a continued Spark
EDL	00:03:29,408	00:03:30,176	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	Between two carbon
EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:32,480	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	They're extremely bright
EDL	00:03:33,248	00:03:33,760	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	Lot of glitter
EDL	00:03:35,552	00:03:41,184	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	And if you put Arc lights at street-level that's blinding will the solution that was to put it up High Enough
EDL	00:03:41,184	00:03:42,464	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	Food spread the light up
EDL	00:03:42,464	00:03:44,256	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	But even on their Hightower
EDL	00:03:44,256	00:03:46,560	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	Dark lights were still so bright
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:52,704	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	I mean they be bright by today's standards but then imagine what that would look like to you if you were an austinite in the 1890s

EDL	00:03:55,520	00:03:56,288	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	And gas lamps
EDL	00:03:56,800	00:03:59,616	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	The Gaslamp has the power of about 15 kennel
EDL	00:03:59,616	00:04:02,432	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	An arc light has the power of a couple thousand
EDL	00:04:02,432	00:04:04,992	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	It was a very intense light almost two months flight
EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:10,112	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	People would go out and enjoy the life that they would bring umbrellas in order to Shield themselves from the glare

EDL	00:04:44,927	00:04:46,975	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	Carbon Arc lights were still so exciting

EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:26,559	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	According to the Austin Statesman in 1921
EDL	00:06:35,775	00:06:41,919	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	Bruce hunt suspects of these reports were overblown

EDL	00:06:47,039	00:06:52,671	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	But the biggest problem with the towers was that their height made them a drag to maintain the arcs

EDL	00:06:55,487	00:07:00,351	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	So you had to go up and change them about once a day and I cannot emphasize enough how

EDL	00:07:25,183	00:07:28,767	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	They could really by the 1920s the city replaced it

EDL	00:07:33,887	00:07:35,167	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	Which were not as bright
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:36,191	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	But we're a lot
EDL	00:07:39,007	00:07:42,335	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	But while Austin was fussing around with different bulbs
EDL	00:07:42,335	00:07:46,175	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	Most other cities had already removed their tower lights completely

EDL	00:07:54,623	00:07:56,159	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	And so they just stayed
EDL	00:07:56,159	00:07:59,743	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	And to this day 17 of the original 31 survive

EDL	00:08:03,583	00:08:08,191	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	Although today without the arc lights the Moonlight Towers have a kind of weak and distant low
EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:09,983	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	They're easy to ignore
EDL	00:08:10,751	00:08:15,103	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	That you might know them from a little movie called Dazed and Confused

EDL	00:08:45,567	00:08:51,711	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	I went to a Moonlight tower on the side of a busy road on the corner of 9th and Guadalupe

EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:13,983	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	I guess they decided to
EDL	00:09:13,983	00:09:16,031	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	Put up out here whenever they were building the power plant
EDL	00:09:17,055	00:09:23,455	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	Actually it's a good idea I mean you got a full moon out here every day of the year you know and then they all climb up the moon tower

EDL	00:09:34,207	00:09:39,583	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	In real life these Moonlight hours would be really hard to climb which is my for this scene

EDL	00:09:42,655	00:09:45,215	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	The one in the movie had a ladder not the pulley thing
EDL	00:09:45,215	00:09:48,799	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	And it was nowhere near as tall as a real Moonlight Tower
EDL	00:09:48,799	00:09:50,335	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	And I'm terrified of heights

EDL	00:12:39,551	00:12:45,183	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	The towers have become part of the character in folklore of Austin I mean there's all sorts of
EDL	00:12:45,183	00:12:46,207	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	Some stuff about them
EDL	00:12:46,207	00:12:50,559	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	Like when I was a kid. Of course there was always a legend that somebody had climbed up on acid and falling off
EDL	00:12:50,559	00:12:52,095	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	Which is definitely not true
EDL	00:12:52,607	00:12:53,375	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	But then of course

EDL	00:13:02,079	00:13:06,175	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	And that one I think is supposed to be true right have we have we verified
EDL	00:13:07,711	00:13:11,295	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	The servant-girl annihilator story is not a myth that all that is absolutely true
EDL	00:13:12,319	00:13:13,343	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	It has nothing to do with the Moon
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:15,903	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	At least not directly

EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:32,799	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	Still the servant-girl annihilator became that awesome expel about these lines
EDL	00:13:32,799	00:13:39,199	| 99pi-0150-underthemoonlight-1 |	And the story of the servant-girl annihilator does truly illustrate the limitations of nineteenth-century
