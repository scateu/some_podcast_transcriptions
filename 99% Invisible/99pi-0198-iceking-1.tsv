EDL	00:03:05,088	00:03:10,208	| 99pi-0198-iceking-1 |	Any ice that British officers in colonial India would have had in their drinks would have started out

EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:12,768	| 99pi-0198-iceking-1 |	In Massachusetts
EDL	00:03:14,560	00:03:20,704	| 99pi-0198-iceking-1 |	The tools of the ice trade vary by location but generally it went like this so the first step is to measure the
EDL	00:03:21,216	00:03:27,104	| 99pi-0198-iceking-1 |	There's a small drill hole that's drilled in and a measurement taken of how thick the ice is because it had to be at least
EDL	00:03:27,104	00:03:30,688	| 99pi-0198-iceking-1 |	14 in thick of ice was thick enough
EDL	00:03:30,688	00:03:33,760	| 99pi-0198-iceking-1 |	The hold the team of workers and horses that would be assembled
EDL	00:03:34,272	00:03:36,064	| 99pi-0198-iceking-1 |	Usually the day after Christmas
EDL	00:03:38,880	00:03:40,160	| 99pi-0198-iceking-1 |	Clear off snow in debris
EDL	00:03:40,672	00:03:47,072	| 99pi-0198-iceking-1 |	And then the horse-drawn ice plows would start to score the ice and they would do this all over the ice until
EDL	00:03:47,072	00:03:49,376	| 99pi-0198-iceking-1 |	They had made a grid a grid on the ice
EDL	00:03:49,376	00:03:51,424	| 99pi-0198-iceking-1 |	They going to make a checkerboard let's say
EDL	00:03:51,424	00:03:57,056	| 99pi-0198-iceking-1 |	Workers would use giant hand saws Bandai spikes basically big sticks with sharp ends
EDL	00:03:57,056	00:04:01,152	| 99pi-0198-iceking-1 |	Break up the squares of ice so that they were floating in the water
EDL	00:04:01,152	00:04:05,248	| 99pi-0198-iceking-1 |	A steam powered conveyor belt with all these cakes of ice out of the water
EDL	00:04:05,760	00:04:07,552	| 99pi-0198-iceking-1 |	And they would go through a planer
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:10,112	| 99pi-0198-iceking-1 |	So each cake would become smooth
EDL	00:04:10,624	00:04:15,232	| 99pi-0198-iceking-1 |	Then they be stacked in the nearby ice house
EDL	00:04:15,232	00:04:16,256	| 99pi-0198-iceking-1 |	Hans device
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:19,071	| 99pi-0198-iceking-1 |	Ice houses often had a railroad siding
EDL	00:04:19,071	00:04:22,655	| 99pi-0198-iceking-1 |	So the ice could be loaded up onto a train and fight it off to the city
EDL	00:04:23,679	00:04:27,519	| 99pi-0198-iceking-1 |	Using the Disney movie Frozen the ice harvesting scene is
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:28,287	| 99pi-0198-iceking-1 |	Actually pretty accurate
EDL	00:04:31,615	00:04:32,639	| 99pi-0198-iceking-1 |	At its peak
EDL	00:04:32,639	00:04:37,503	| 99pi-0198-iceking-1 |	Ice harvesting happened on lakes all over New England New York Michigan
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:41,855	| 99pi-0198-iceking-1 |	In the Poconos region of Northeastern Pennsylvania it was at one time
EDL	00:04:41,855	00:04:43,391	| 99pi-0198-iceking-1 |	The major industry
EDL	00:04:43,391	00:04:46,719	| 99pi-0198-iceking-1 |	My father actually worked on the ice harvesting back in the
EDL	00:04:47,231	00:04:50,815	| 99pi-0198-iceking-1 |	1930s and 40s and in even into the 50s
EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:57,215	| 99pi-0198-iceking-1 |	This entire area the Poconos that was pretty much the only thing that you could do in the winter time for work but now
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:04:59,775	| 99pi-0198-iceking-1 |	It's gone it just disappeared entirely
EDL	00:04:59,775	00:05:01,823	| 99pi-0198-iceking-1 |	It's a bit sad in a way that
EDL	00:05:01,823	00:05:03,871	| 99pi-0198-iceking-1 |	An industry it melted away is it
EDL	00:05:03,871	00:05:08,479	| 99pi-0198-iceking-1 |	Here to also remember the Natural Ice industry is Gavin Weightman

EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:24,095	| 99pi-0198-iceking-1 |	A true story
EDL	00:05:24,095	00:05:30,495	| 99pi-0198-iceking-1 |	Maybe because even Gavin Publishers thought the prospect of cutting frozen water out of American lakes and shipping

EDL	00:05:33,055	00:05:34,847	| 99pi-0198-iceking-1 |	But that is exactly what happened
EDL	00:05:35,359	00:05:38,687	| 99pi-0198-iceking-1 |	Ice was being harvested from all over the American Northeast
