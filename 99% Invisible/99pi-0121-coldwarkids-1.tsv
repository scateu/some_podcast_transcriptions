EDL	00:07:12,895	00:07:13,919	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	And not used

EDL	00:07:16,991	00:07:19,551	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	You can close it then it has
EDL	00:07:21,087	00:07:23,647	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	3 four different types of latches to latch
EDL	00:07:23,647	00:07:24,927	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	So nobody can get in or out
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:26,719	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	I never knew that
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:28,511	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	This door just until I start to work
EDL	00:07:31,583	00:07:34,911	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	We go down a couple flights of stairs into the main hallway of
EDL	00:07:34,911	00:07:35,679	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	School
EDL	00:07:35,679	00:07:37,215	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	Basically
EDL	00:07:37,215	00:07:38,495	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	Just looks like a school
EDL	00:07:39,007	00:07:40,543	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	I mean it's windowless
EDL	00:07:40,543	00:07:44,383	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	I'm kind of drab since it hasn't been used in almost 20 years
EDL	00:07:44,895	00:07:47,455	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	But otherwise it looks a bit like others

EDL	00:07:54,367	00:07:55,903	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	Now you see back there they had a big

EDL	00:08:01,535	00:08:05,119	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	During during great school so that's what that's where it all happened
EDL	00:08:06,655	00:08:10,239	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	The kids at elbow actually got to vote on what the school mascot would be

EDL	00:08:13,055	00:08:14,335	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	They chose to be
EDL	00:08:14,335	00:08:15,615	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	The ABO gophers
EDL	00:08:16,127	00:08:19,455	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	But yeah we're underground just like the Gophers are and so
EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:21,247	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	Right through here is
EDL	00:08:22,527	00:08:23,551	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	Our generator room
EDL	00:08:24,575	00:08:26,623	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	To keep it up and running for the

EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:57,599	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	That's what I heard there's a little room but it did
EDL	00:08:57,599	00:08:59,135	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	I didn't ever see where it go
EDL	00:08:59,135	00:09:01,183	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	You know what tremendous number of bodies
EDL	00:09:01,695	00:09:02,975	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	What is the typical classroom
EDL	00:09:03,487	00:09:06,303	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	Turn there's not any windows or not any sunlight
EDL	00:09:06,815	00:09:07,327	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	But
EDL	00:09:08,095	00:09:09,375	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	We went upstairs
EDL	00:09:09,375	00:09:11,679	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	Two three times a day for
EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:12,703	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	The recreation
EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:20,127	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	The teachers reported that they generally like her school because the students weren't distracted by starting out
EDL	00:09:20,127	00:09:23,967	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	All the windows and I think the students themselves were generally proud

EDL	00:09:25,247	00:09:31,647	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	But once again this creates a huge debate with many people saying that the needs of schools
EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:35,743	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	And I need to shelter people during a nuclear attack or not come
EDL	00:09:37,023	00:09:39,839	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	That's kind of throws again author of One Nation

EDL	00:09:40,863	00:09:43,423	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	And he says in fact there was a lot of debate
EDL	00:09:43,423	00:09:45,215	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	Going on at the time about Fallout
EDL	00:09:46,239	00:09:48,543	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	The subject was virtually in Escape

EDL	00:09:52,895	00:09:54,431	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	Articles on shelters
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:09:56,479	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	Potential for
EDL	00:09:56,479	00:09:58,271	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	Survival Time Magazine published
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:10:04,671	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	An article called guns I neighbor in which they interviewed a guy who said
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:09,535	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	Chattanooga's neighbors tried to get into a fallout shelter during a nuclear attack

EDL	00:10:38,975	00:10:40,767	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	It was a brand new idea
EDL	00:10:40,767	00:10:43,839	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	Also back then it wasn't a fringe idea
EDL	00:10:43,839	00:10:46,399	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	I mean the president of the United States
EDL	00:10:46,399	00:10:48,191	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	I was telling people to build these things
EDL	00:10:48,703	00:10:51,519	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	And the whole country was involved in the debate
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:53,055	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	On one side of the debate
EDL	00:10:53,055	00:10:54,335	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	You had people against shelters
EDL	00:10:55,103	00:10:56,895	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	Those against shelter sad
EDL	00:10:56,895	00:10:58,431	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	That you're

EDL	00:11:05,087	00:11:09,951	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	Shelters would militarize America and turn the United States into a Garrison

EDL	00:11:10,719	00:11:13,535	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	And after the nuclear war had ended
EDL	00:11:13,535	00:11:15,839	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	Shelters would sort of the Americas pyramid

EDL	00:11:20,703	00:11:23,775	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	And on the other side people for shelter said
EDL	00:11:23,775	00:11:24,543	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	Wait a minute
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:26,079	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	This is just a precaution
EDL	00:11:26,079	00:11:26,847	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	Like any other
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:29,407	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	They compared Fallout shelters to Lifeboat
EDL	00:11:30,175	00:11:36,063	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	Here's a sarcastic letter that a proponent of shelters wrote to the Harvard Crimson in 1961
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:40,415	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	It's been brought to our attention to certain elements among the passengers
EDL	00:11:40,415	00:11:43,999	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	Who favored the installation of lifeboats on the ship
EDL	00:11:44,767	00:11:49,631	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	Although we share their concern will remain unaltered Lee opposed to any consideration
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:51,679	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	Other course of action for the following reasons
EDL	00:11:52,447	00:11:54,495	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	The letter gets increasingly sarcastic
EDL	00:11:54,495	00:11:56,799	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	It demonstrates a lack of faith in our cap
EDL	00:11:57,311	00:12:02,431	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	Your parents security which lifeboats offer will make our Navigators Reckless
EDL	00:12:03,199	00:12:06,783	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	These proposals will distract our attention from more important things
EDL	00:12:06,783	00:12:09,087	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	IE building Unsinkable ships
EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:12,671	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	You will only be safe for a worse fate inevitable death

EDL	00:12:16,255	00:12:18,815	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	I think in the school letter you can see
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:19,583	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	Some of the issues
EDL	00:12:20,351	00:12:21,119	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	Are being debated
EDL	00:12:22,399	00:12:27,007	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	Like what kind of world will you emerge to if you survive a nuclear war
EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:31,359	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	And whether the shelter system could somehow make our leaders more likely to engage in war
EDL	00:12:32,127	00:12:34,175	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	It's a very complicated calculus
EDL	00:12:35,199	00:12:35,967	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	This whole issue
EDL	00:12:36,479	00:12:37,247	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	Weather today

EDL	00:12:40,319	00:12:41,855	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	For the town of Artesia
EDL	00:12:41,855	00:12:43,135	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	In the early 1960s
EDL	00:12:43,647	00:12:45,951	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	The calculation seems easy enough
EDL	00:12:45,951	00:12:47,999	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	They needed a new school anyway
EDL	00:12:47,999	00:12:50,047	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	The office of civil defense
EDL	00:12:50,047	00:12:51,327	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	Agreed to pay the difference

EDL	00:12:54,911	00:12:57,215	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	Artesia was near Walker Air Force Base
EDL	00:12:57,215	00:13:01,823	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	Is closed now but at the time it was the largest Strategic Air Command base of the u.s. Air Force
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:05,151	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	It was also close to the White Sands Missile Range
EDL	00:13:05,151	00:13:06,687	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	These and other factors
EDL	00:13:06,687	00:13:09,759	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	Made Artesia feel particularly vulnerable to attack
EDL	00:13:10,271	00:13:14,367	| 99pi-0121-coldwarkids-1 |	New Mexico has always had nuclear programs going on
