EDL	00:04:09,344	00:04:15,744	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	I mean even until the Olympics are literally about to happen there all these doubts about whether
EDL	00:04:15,744	00:04:19,327	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	The Mexican Government will be organized enough to undertake the whole
EDL	00:04:19,327	00:04:20,607	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Spectacle of that magnitude

EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:30,335	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	They wanted to create a visual identity for the Olympics
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:34,687	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Do wheelies L Mexico City to all these visitors seeing it for the first time
EDL	00:04:34,687	00:04:39,039	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	So they decided to hold an international competition
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:43,391	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Define a designer who would create a logo and graphic design campaign for the Olympics
EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:48,255	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	They wanted something that looks Cosmopolitan and contemporary

EDL	00:04:50,303	00:04:52,863	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	And this is where an unlikely character comes in
EDL	00:04:53,375	00:04:56,959	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	I'm Lance Wyman I'm a designer I work here in New York
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:04:58,751	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	In 1966
EDL	00:04:58,751	00:05:01,567	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Lance Wyman was a 29 year old graphic designer
EDL	00:05:02,335	00:05:04,127	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	We heard about the competition
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:06,943	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	He knew that he and his design partner Peter Murdock
EDL	00:05:07,455	00:05:08,735	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Had to get on the short list
EDL	00:05:08,735	00:05:09,247	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Chicken tenders
EDL	00:05:09,759	00:05:15,647	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	This list included design teams from all over the world who would come down to Mexico City for a two-week trial run
EDL	00:05:16,159	00:05:17,183	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	After their two weeks
EDL	00:05:17,183	00:05:19,487	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Each team represent their design for consideration
EDL	00:05:20,255	00:05:24,863	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	And we got on the list to go down in November of 1966 and
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:28,959	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Peter and I had just started out we didn't have any money so
EDL	00:05:28,959	00:05:30,751	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Willie could only afford one way tickets
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:33,567	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	They hopped on the plane with their one way ticket
EDL	00:05:33,567	00:05:34,591	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	And landed
EDL	00:05:34,591	00:05:35,871	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	In Mexico City
EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:38,943	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	By the way neither of them had ever visited Mexico before
EDL	00:05:39,455	00:05:40,735	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	They didn't really know
EDL	00:05:40,735	00:05:41,759	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Anything about the country
EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:44,575	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	If they were going to design a logo
EDL	00:05:44,575	00:05:45,599	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	To represent Mexico
EDL	00:05:46,111	00:05:48,415	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Wyman and Murdoch would have to learn a lot
EDL	00:05:48,927	00:05:49,439	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	And fast
EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:51,487	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	They started where most tourist
EDL	00:05:52,255	00:05:53,535	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	By visiting museums
EDL	00:05:54,047	00:05:56,351	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	It's been a lot of time at the Museum of anthropology
EDL	00:05:56,351	00:05:58,655	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Where they studied artifacts from pre-columbian Mexico
EDL	00:05:59,423	00:06:00,703	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Like the Aztec sun stone
EDL	00:06:00,703	00:06:02,239	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	An ancient Mayan murals
EDL	00:06:02,751	00:06:03,775	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	I actually was
EDL	00:06:03,775	00:06:09,407	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Floored by some of the early cultures because they were doing things in the Contemporary way with Jama tree with graphics
EDL	00:06:10,943	00:06:16,319	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	The Bold lines and bright colors and geometric shapes reminded Wyman of a kind of Opera
EDL	00:06:16,319	00:06:19,135	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Art that was popular among contemporary artist back in New York
EDL	00:06:19,903	00:06:21,439	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Op art or optical art
EDL	00:06:21,951	00:06:26,559	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Uses contrast geometry and other tricks to give the viewer the impression of movement
EDL	00:06:27,327	00:06:30,655	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	And so informed by both indigenous artifacts
EDL	00:06:30,655	00:06:31,679	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	And modern
EDL	00:06:32,191	00:06:36,031	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Wyman came up with a logo that Rift on the 5 rings of the Olympic symbol
EDL	00:06:36,543	00:06:38,847	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	I realize that the geometry
EDL	00:06:38,847	00:06:39,871	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Of the Five Rings
EDL	00:06:40,383	00:06:41,919	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	To be integrated with the
EDL	00:06:42,431	00:06:43,967	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	The year of the event 68
EDL	00:06:44,479	00:06:46,271	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	He superimpose the digits
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:47,551	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	6 + 8
EDL	00:06:47,551	00:06:49,599	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Over the classic Olympic rings

EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:05,471	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	It's this very groovy looking typography

EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:11,775	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Striking almost shocking perhaps
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:12,543	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Is that
EDL	00:08:12,543	00:08:18,943	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	The fact that of course Lance Wyman is is very much unproven as a designer is very young and he hasn't had much time to

EDL	00:08:28,927	00:08:31,743	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Wyman and Murdoch ended up staying in Mexico
EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:33,535	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	For two years to work on the campaign
EDL	00:08:34,303	00:08:37,119	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	And along with a team of designers many of the mechs

EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:45,983	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Gymnastics for example was represented by a hand gripping a single suspended ring

EDL	00:10:03,391	00:10:05,183	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	In the system wasn't just for sport
EDL	00:10:05,951	00:10:10,815	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Wyman the team made universally understandable icons for 19 cultural events
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:12,351	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Happening around the city as well
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:17,471	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	We had children's painting we had folk dancing we had science programming
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:21,823	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	By following these cultural icons visitors could continue to entertain themselves

EDL	00:10:30,527	00:10:36,159	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	So Wyman designed a little outline of a dove which shop owners all over the city were given to stick in their windows
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:41,535	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Between the logo the typeface the colors the icons and the doves
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:45,631	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Wyman created a visual identity that saturated the whole city
EDL	00:10:45,631	00:10:47,167	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	It was everywhere
EDL	00:10:47,167	00:10:49,471	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	It was a total design campaign
EDL	00:10:49,471	00:10:53,567	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Holes I can pay right this design that every single

EDL	00:11:01,759	00:11:05,855	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	In the completeness of the campaign would set a precedent for years to come
EDL	00:11:05,855	00:11:07,135	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	I think it's safe to say that
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:08,671	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Although
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:11,231	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Design and architecture and

EDL	00:11:13,279	00:11:15,583	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Very powerful associated with
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:16,351	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Olympics
EDL	00:11:16,351	00:11:17,631	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Before Mexico 68
EDL	00:11:18,143	00:11:21,471	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	It's really after Mexico succeed it becomes a kind of
EDL	00:11:21,471	00:11:22,751	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Standard expectation
EDL	00:11:22,751	00:11:24,031	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Design campaigns associated with
EDL	00:11:26,079	00:11:28,127	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Well Lance Wyman was designing the
EDL	00:11:28,127	00:11:29,663	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	This extensive campaign
EDL	00:11:29,663	00:11:30,687	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	He was holed up
EDL	00:11:30,687	00:11:31,711	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Swamped with work
EDL	00:11:31,711	00:11:33,503	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	And he really didn't get a chance to go out
EDL	00:11:34,015	00:11:37,087	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Nose to the grindstone really almost through the whole thing
EDL	00:11:37,087	00:11:39,647	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	We're pretty isolated at the Olympic Committee
EDL	00:11:43,743	00:11:47,327	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	He didn't see the protest movement growing in the city around him
EDL	00:11:55,775	00:12:01,663	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	The movie was led by students who believe the long-ruling institutional revolutionary party

EDL	00:14:00,191	00:14:01,471	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	The government was desperate
EDL	00:14:01,471	00:14:03,007	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	To make the unrest go away
EDL	00:14:04,031	00:14:08,639	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	On October 2nd just 10 days before the games of Peace were set to begin
EDL	00:14:09,151	00:14:14,271	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Thousands of students gathered at the local Square in the northeast of Mexico City
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:18,111	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	To demand the release of people who have been locked up at a previous protest
EDL	00:14:21,439	00:14:25,791	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	It was a quiet Gathering of people with signs walking slowly around the Plaza
EDL	00:14:26,559	00:14:29,119	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	And with look back and there was all this

EDL	00:14:31,167	00:14:33,215	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	They started to Advanced what's a crowd
EDL	00:14:33,727	00:14:34,751	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	And at some point
EDL	00:14:35,519	00:14:36,031	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	We heard
EDL	00:14:36,799	00:14:37,311	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Sub shops
EDL	00:14:37,823	00:14:39,359	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	We didn't know where they came from
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:41,407	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	And seconds later
EDL	00:14:42,175	00:14:43,455	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	How do you say in English
EDL	00:14:44,223	00:14:45,503	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	All hell broke loose
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:55,743	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Soldiers opened fire on the protesters
EDL	00:14:56,767	00:15:00,607	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	To this day we don't know exactly how many students died in the massacre
EDL	00:15:01,375	00:15:03,167	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	But the number is likely in the hundred

EDL	00:15:09,567	00:15:12,639	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	The scene was cleared before there can be an accurate body count
EDL	00:15:12,639	00:15:14,175	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	The blood was washed away
EDL	00:15:14,687	00:15:17,503	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Thousands of protesters were arrested and locked up
EDL	00:15:18,015	00:15:20,831	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	The government took great pains to cover their tracks
EDL	00:15:20,831	00:15:22,879	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	The amount of student War
EDL	00:15:22,879	00:15:25,695	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Shot and many others were in prison
EDL	00:15:26,207	00:15:28,255	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	I forgot some time with you no cover.
EDL	00:15:28,767	00:15:31,071	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	The government claimed that the students had fired first
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:32,351	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	To provoke the military
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:34,655	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Evidence has since come to light
EDL	00:15:34,655	00:15:35,935	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	That disproves I claim
EDL	00:15:38,239	00:15:39,775	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	A shocking event

EDL	00:15:46,431	00:15:47,199	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	That's that
EDL	00:15:47,199	00:15:48,735	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Set the stage
EDL	00:15:48,735	00:15:50,783	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	For the Nevada day Dramatics
EDL	00:15:50,783	00:15:52,575	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	For the Olympics themselves
EDL	00:15:53,599	00:15:56,671	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	The massacre was so horribly devastating
EDL	00:15:56,671	00:15:57,695	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	But of course
EDL	00:15:57,695	00:15:59,231	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Lance Wyman heard about it
EDL	00:15:59,231	00:16:00,511	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	When I heard about it
EDL	00:16:00,511	00:16:02,047	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	What how severe it was
EDL	00:16:02,559	00:16:06,399	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	It was difficult situation because I felt as working for the government and
EDL	00:16:06,399	00:16:07,935	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	I couldn't do anything about it
EDL	00:16:07,935	00:16:09,727	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	But he says he really empathize
EDL	00:16:09,727	00:16:10,239	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	With the student
EDL	00:16:10,751	00:16:14,079	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	I wasn't much older than they were so late I had that feeling the car
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:18,175	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Might have felt good if I just walked away from the whole thing
EDL	00:16:18,943	00:16:20,735	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Wyman felt Stuck in the Middle
EDL	00:16:21,503	00:16:22,527	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	But in a way
EDL	00:16:22,527	00:16:25,087	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	He didn't need to choose between the governments in the protesters
EDL	00:16:25,599	00:16:28,159	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Is designs found a way to serve both sides
EDL	00:16:29,183	00:16:32,511	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Students began imitating Wyman's images and co-opting them
EDL	00:16:33,023	00:16:39,167	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	It took a poster he made with a silhouetted image of Runners racing and turned it into silhouettes of troops

EDL	00:16:45,567	00:16:48,639	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	And that very simple image of a dove and all the shop windows
EDL	00:16:49,151	00:16:52,223	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Students went around the city spring a small burst

EDL	00:16:54,783	00:16:55,807	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Like I've been shot
EDL	00:16:56,575	00:16:59,135	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	They were playing with the propaganda of the Olympics
EDL	00:16:59,647	00:17:01,951	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	And hinting at a darker political reality
EDL	00:17:03,231	00:17:03,999	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	And Wyman
EDL	00:17:04,511	00:17:05,023	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	He like that
EDL	00:17:05,535	00:17:07,583	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Email design campaign so ubiquitous
EDL	00:17:08,095	00:17:08,863	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	So resonant
EDL	00:17:09,375	00:17:10,399	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Better resistance
EDL	00:17:10,399	00:17:11,423	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Could use it to
EDL	00:17:11,423	00:17:14,495	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	And I've always been questionable where you feel good about that
EDL	00:17:14,495	00:17:17,567	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	And I guess that's why because I was in a situation where I was
EDL	00:17:17,567	00:17:18,079	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Kind of
EDL	00:17:18,591	00:17:19,359	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Torn
EDL	00:17:19,359	00:17:21,151	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	I was very sympathetic
EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:22,943	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	As far as what was happening to the students
EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:24,735	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	But I was also very
EDL	00:17:24,735	00:17:25,503	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Not wanting
EDL	00:17:25,503	00:17:26,783	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	To see the Olympics be stopped
EDL	00:17:27,295	00:17:28,063	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	And they weren't stop
EDL	00:17:28,831	00:17:30,111	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	On October 12th

EDL	00:17:31,391	00:17:33,183	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	The games began on schedule
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:35,743	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	As if nothing out of the ordinary had happened

EDL	00:17:50,847	00:17:55,199	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	The 1968 Olympics Winona become one of the most important in history of the games
EDL	00:17:55,711	00:17:57,759	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Marked not only by athletic achievement
EDL	00:17:58,271	00:18:00,575	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	But Buy open political defiance
EDL	00:18:00,575	00:18:04,159	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	You think you're represented all black athletes and doing this
EDL	00:18:05,183	00:18:06,719	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	I can say
EDL	00:18:06,719	00:18:07,743	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	I represented
EDL	00:18:07,743	00:18:08,511	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Black America
EDL	00:18:09,023	00:18:10,559	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	I'm very proud to be
EDL	00:18:10,559	00:18:11,583	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	A black man
EDL	00:18:11,583	00:18:13,119	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	And also to have won the gold medal
EDL	00:18:16,191	00:18:17,471	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Mexico 68
EDL	00:18:17,471	00:18:20,799	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Also set a new precedent for how governments would use design
EDL	00:18:21,311	00:18:24,127	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	To promote their country's image to the International Community
EDL	00:18:24,895	00:18:25,919	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	For Better or For Worse
EDL	00:18:26,687	00:18:30,783	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	The 68 games also left a permanent mark on Mexico City's infrastructure
EDL	00:18:34,879	00:18:36,927	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Mexico City is one of the largest cities in the world
EDL	00:18:37,439	00:18:40,255	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	If the largest metropolitan area in North America
EDL	00:18:40,255	00:18:45,631	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Around 4.4 million people ride on Mexico City's Metro System everyday
EDL	00:18:45,631	00:18:47,423	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Including producer Claire Mullen
EDL	00:18:47,423	00:18:48,959	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Who visited a couple months ago
EDL	00:18:48,959	00:18:52,799	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	I'm in the Metro on the pink line

EDL	00:18:58,175	00:18:58,687	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Icon
EDL	00:18:59,199	00:19:02,783	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Mexico City's Metro is incredibly crowded and very extensive
EDL	00:19:02,783	00:19:06,623	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	And yet it is often recognized as one of the easiest rail systems to navigate
EDL	00:19:07,135	00:19:09,183	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Partly because of its iconography
EDL	00:19:09,183	00:19:14,047	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	La catolica which is a big ship it looks like a pirate ship without the pirate symbol
EDL	00:19:14,815	00:19:18,655	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	And then we have Merced where there are

EDL	00:19:21,215	00:19:23,519	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Those icons are there thanks in part

EDL	00:19:24,799	00:19:27,615	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	The Metro was supposed to make its debut during the Olympics
EDL	00:19:28,127	00:19:32,223	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Excavators kept unearthing ancient architecture in the path the tracks
EDL	00:19:32,223	00:19:33,759	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	And the opening was delayed
EDL	00:19:34,271	00:19:36,831	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	But women was still involved in its design
EDL	00:19:36,831	00:19:38,111	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Specifically it's a map
EDL	00:19:38,623	00:19:44,255	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	He employed the same visual system he developed the Olympics to help International visitors navigate the trains
EDL	00:19:44,255	00:19:46,303	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	In the Olympics we relied on the graphics
EDL	00:19:47,071	00:19:49,375	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	And I thought well why Kansas City do that
EDL	00:19:49,887	00:19:54,495	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	The Wyman color-coded each line and created a unique icon for every single stop
EDL	00:19:55,519	00:19:59,615	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	So even if you're visiting from Japan and can't read any Spanish at all
EDL	00:19:59,615	00:20:00,895	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	You can say to yourself
EDL	00:20:00,895	00:20:03,455	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	I want to take the pink line to the stop of the grasshopper on
EDL	00:20:03,967	00:20:06,527	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	The station at stopped at the chapultepec
EDL	00:20:06,527	00:20:07,551	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Park
EDL	00:20:07,551	00:20:09,343	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Chapultepec means grasshopper Hill
EDL	00:20:09,855	00:20:12,415	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	In the nahuatl the Aztec language should I use the grasshopper
EDL	00:20:13,439	00:20:14,207	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Again
EDL	00:20:14,207	00:20:20,351	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Some Mexicans took issue with his young Foreigner coming in to design something that would be such a huge part of their City
EDL	00:20:21,119	00:20:24,959	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	But eventually Mexican designers took up the project and made it their own
EDL	00:20:25,471	00:20:28,799	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	UI design the first three lines of the Metro
EDL	00:20:28,799	00:20:31,359	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Are all the they have 12 lines
EDL	00:20:31,359	00:20:36,735	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Now and they were designed by Mexican designers and some of these are better than I did in the original lion you know
EDL	00:20:38,271	00:20:39,551	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	After the Olympics
EDL	00:20:39,551	00:20:40,831	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	After the Metro
EDL	00:20:40,831	00:20:42,367	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Wyman did some more work from EX
EDL	00:20:43,391	00:20:45,439	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Like the design for the 1970 World Cup
EDL	00:20:45,951	00:20:47,231	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	But he went back to the US
EDL	00:20:48,255	00:20:49,791	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Why did went on to design more map
EDL	00:20:50,303	00:20:51,071	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Big ones
EDL	00:20:51,071	00:20:53,887	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Like for the National Zoo in the DC Metro System
EDL	00:20:53,887	00:20:59,519	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	Although none of them use symbols and icons and colors as completely as in Mexico City
EDL	00:21:01,823	00:21:08,223	| 99pi-0264-mexico68-1 |	The clear iconography of the Metro system is a reminder of a complicated and sometimes terrible. In Mexico
