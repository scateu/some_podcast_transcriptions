EDL	00:05:37,663	00:05:44,063	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	This idea was inspired by Architects like Frank Lloyd Wright who believed that the design of a building should reflect the landscape
EDL	00:05:44,063	00:05:45,087	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	On which it was built

EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:55,327	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Barragan wanted to Design Homes inspired by this Majestic love
EDL	00:05:56,351	00:06:02,495	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	And so he decided that all houses in The Patriot all should be simple and modern and made from basic local materials
EDL	00:06:03,007	00:06:03,775	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Streets
EDL	00:06:03,775	00:06:06,335	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Should follow the natural Contours of The Rock
EDL	00:06:06,335	00:06:08,639	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	And lots should be kept for really large
EDL	00:06:08,639	00:06:10,687	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	How much is 30000 square feet
EDL	00:06:10,687	00:06:13,503	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	And that house is only take up a relatively small
EDL	00:06:14,015	00:06:15,807	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Percentage of those
EDL	00:06:15,807	00:06:16,575	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Lots
EDL	00:06:17,087	00:06:18,623	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	The rest to be left to Garden
EDL	00:06:19,903	00:06:21,695	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Barragan was obsessed with garden
EDL	00:06:22,463	00:06:24,255	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	This could be apocryphal but
EDL	00:06:24,255	00:06:25,279	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Supposedly he used to say
EDL	00:06:25,791	00:06:27,839	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	I don't build houses with Gardens
EDL	00:06:27,839	00:06:29,119	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Idled Gardens

EDL	00:06:30,399	00:06:35,263	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	And he wanted The Gardens of the page a gall to be Odes to this unique volcanic landscape
EDL	00:06:35,775	00:06:39,615	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	The substantial portion of the original law that should be left on site and only

EDL	00:06:59,327	00:07:00,351	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	With the volcanic landscape
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:04,191	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	The gardens featured little stairways cut into the stone
EDL	00:07:04,191	00:07:05,983	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	That allowed you to move to the space
EDL	00:07:06,495	00:07:08,543	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	There's even a spot in one of the houses where he

EDL	00:07:15,455	00:07:18,271	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Barragan's goal was to convince wealthy professionals

EDL	00:08:37,631	00:08:40,703	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	The truth is that Vision never really came to pass in the real world
EDL	00:08:41,215	00:08:43,775	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	In the early 1950s Barragan got bought out

EDL	00:09:10,399	00:09:14,495	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	And newcomers to the area didn't seem to share barragan's Rev

EDL	00:09:20,895	00:09:26,015	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	And it's easy to think about this story as a kind of Iko architectural Paradise Lost
EDL	00:09:26,527	00:09:29,343	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	In part because of the way people talk about Louis Farrakhan

EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:27,455	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	It would be fair to put that all on the lease paragon
EDL	00:10:27,967	00:10:32,063	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	But the irony is as much as he genuinely loved that lava landscape

EDL	00:11:30,687	00:11:31,711	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	A city of
EDL	00:11:31,711	00:11:32,735	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Upon the lake
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:34,271	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	This is Loretta Castroville
EDL	00:11:35,039	00:11:39,391	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	I'm I'm an architect and urban designer
EDL	00:11:39,903	00:11:45,279	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	And I do design design for the city and design with water
EDL	00:11:45,279	00:11:48,095	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Castro Rivera says that the valley of Mexico is
EDL	00:11:48,095	00:11:49,119	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Actually more of a
EDL	00:11:49,119	00:11:49,887	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Beeson
EDL	00:11:49,887	00:11:52,447	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	It's a closed Basin it's like a bowl
EDL	00:11:52,447	00:11:54,239	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Which has no natural water exit
EDL	00:11:54,751	00:11:59,359	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	So when it rains all the runoff concentrates in the lower areas of the Beijing
EDL	00:11:59,871	00:12:00,639	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:12:00,639	00:12:02,431	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	This bowl starts filling up
EDL	00:12:02,943	00:12:06,271	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	For centuries the Basin was filled with a series of rainwater leg
EDL	00:12:06,783	00:12:07,807	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	The Aztecs
EDL	00:12:07,807	00:12:08,831	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Built their capital
EDL	00:12:08,831	00:12:09,855	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Tenochtitlan
EDL	00:12:09,855	00:12:11,903	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	On an island in the middle of one of those legs
EDL	00:12:12,415	00:12:14,975	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	It'll causeways and canals and floating Garden
EDL	00:12:15,743	00:12:17,023	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	It was like the Venice
EDL	00:12:17,023	00:12:17,791	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Spell mesoamerica
EDL	00:12:18,303	00:12:21,375	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	But when Spanish conquistadors satenaw tri-bond
EDL	00:12:21,375	00:12:23,423	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	They rebuilt the city as if it was
EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:25,215	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Just any old city in Spain
EDL	00:12:25,215	00:12:26,751	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	With a centralized grid
EDL	00:12:26,751	00:12:29,055	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	So that's when real trouble starts happen
EDL	00:12:30,591	00:12:34,943	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Nearly every year when the seasonal rains came the colonial City would flood
EDL	00:12:34,943	00:12:36,479	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	We're talking serious flooding
EDL	00:12:36,479	00:12:38,527	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	After the flood of 1629
EDL	00:12:38,527	00:12:40,063	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Mexico City was under water for
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:40,831	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	4 years
EDL	00:12:41,599	00:12:42,623	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	And in that moment
EDL	00:12:43,135	00:12:44,671	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	That the government
EDL	00:12:45,695	00:12:46,975	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Viceroy decided
EDL	00:12:47,487	00:12:48,767	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	To open the first
EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:50,559	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Canal
EDL	00:12:50,559	00:12:51,327	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Deadwood
EDL	00:12:51,327	00:12:53,375	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Sorry to draining the lake system
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:12:56,447	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Over the course of the next several centuries
EDL	00:12:56,447	00:12:59,263	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Is Mexico City built an elaborate system of tunnels
EDL	00:12:59,263	00:13:03,103	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Designed to evacuate rainwater out of the Basin and prevent flooding
EDL	00:13:03,871	00:13:05,151	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Little by little the city
EDL	00:13:05,151	00:13:05,663	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Drain the
EDL	00:13:06,431	00:13:07,455	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	An expanded out
EDL	00:13:07,455	00:13:08,479	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Open the dry lake bed
EDL	00:13:09,247	00:13:12,319	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	But Mexico City also suffers from a second water
EDL	00:13:12,831	00:13:14,879	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	One that seems almost paradoxical
EDL	00:13:15,647	00:13:18,975	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Even as it gets inundated every year with rains and floods
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:19,999	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	The city
EDL	00:13:20,511	00:13:21,535	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Is running out
EDL	00:13:22,047	00:13:22,559	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Of water
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:27,679	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	In the middle of the 20th century Mexico City population
EDL	00:13:28,191	00:13:28,959	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Bloated
EDL	00:13:28,959	00:13:30,495	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	And all those people needed
EDL	00:13:30,495	00:13:31,007	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	To drink
EDL	00:13:31,519	00:13:35,103	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Seasonal rain could have provided a reliable source of freshwater
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:37,151	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	The Mexico City had just built a mass
EDL	00:13:37,151	00:13:38,943	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Subsystem of infrastructure designs
EDL	00:13:38,943	00:13:39,967	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Specifically to get rid of it
EDL	00:13:40,479	00:13:43,807	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	And now with the 23 million inhabitants in the city
EDL	00:13:43,807	00:13:45,343	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	There's not enough
EDL	00:13:45,343	00:13:49,183	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Drinking water to satisfy the necessities of all this
EDL	00:13:49,183	00:13:50,463	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Enormous population
EDL	00:13:50,463	00:13:53,791	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Today many neighborhoods in Mexico City don't have reliable run
EDL	00:13:53,791	00:13:54,559	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Water
EDL	00:13:54,559	00:13:57,375	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	And then when the rainy season comes those same neighborhoods
EDL	00:13:57,375	00:13:58,655	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Get far too much water
EDL	00:13:58,655	00:13:59,167	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	All at once
EDL	00:13:59,679	00:14:01,983	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	So we live in this Paradox of
EDL	00:14:01,983	00:14:02,751	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Irving Plaza
EDL	00:14:03,263	00:14:04,543	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	And water scarcity
EDL	00:14:05,055	00:14:07,615	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	To solve the scarcity issue the city took to approach
EDL	00:14:08,383	00:14:10,687	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	A pipe water in from far away
EDL	00:14:10,687	00:14:11,967	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	And they pumped it up
EDL	00:14:11,967	00:14:12,479	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	From the uncle
EDL	00:14:12,991	00:14:13,503	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Blueground
EDL	00:14:14,015	00:14:16,063	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Which in turn created a third problem
EDL	00:14:17,599	00:14:20,415	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	In the early twenties of last century
EDL	00:14:20,415	00:14:21,951	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Some Engineers saw
EDL	00:14:22,463	00:14:24,255	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Doug D city was sinking
EDL	00:14:24,255	00:14:30,655	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	This is Manuel perlakuan he's director of The Institute for social research at the national
EDL	00:14:30,655	00:14:31,679	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Autonomous University of Maine

EDL	00:14:36,031	00:14:36,799	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Fight
EDL	00:14:36,799	00:14:38,335	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Centimeters per year
EDL	00:14:38,847	00:14:39,615	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	On some of them
EDL	00:14:40,639	00:14:42,175	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	The reason was pretty straightforward
EDL	00:14:42,687	00:14:45,247	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	As more and more people took more and more water
EDL	00:14:45,247	00:14:46,271	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	The aquifer every year
EDL	00:14:46,783	00:14:49,343	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	The muddy lake bed soil began to crack
EDL	00:14:49,343	00:14:50,111	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	And crumble
EDL	00:14:50,623	00:14:51,903	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Like a stale cookie
EDL	00:14:51,903	00:14:53,951	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	And that's why the city began to
EDL	00:14:55,743	00:14:58,815	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Today Mexico City is pumping water out of the aquifer
EDL	00:14:58,815	00:14:59,839	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Twice as fast
EDL	00:14:59,839	00:15:00,607	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Does it can replenish
EDL	00:15:01,119	00:15:04,191	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	And the city has song about 30 ft over the past Century
EDL	00:15:04,703	00:15:08,031	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Did you walk around Mexico City today you can see this in the landscape
EDL	00:15:08,031	00:15:08,799	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Crooked
EDL	00:15:08,799	00:15:11,103	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Skyline sinkholes in places
EDL	00:15:11,103	00:15:12,895	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	With the ground is completely uneven
EDL	00:15:13,407	00:15:14,687	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Mexico City is
EDL	00:15:14,687	00:15:15,455	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Flooded
EDL	00:15:15,455	00:15:16,735	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Thirsty and sinking
EDL	00:15:17,503	00:15:20,319	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	And climate change is only going to make all of it more extreme
EDL	00:15:21,087	00:15:23,391	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	It's an impossibly complicated problem
EDL	00:15:23,391	00:15:24,927	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	With no easy solution
EDL	00:15:25,951	00:15:28,255	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	But with impossibly complicated problems
EDL	00:15:28,255	00:15:29,023	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	You have to start somewhere
EDL	00:15:29,791	00:15:32,351	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	And Pedro, Reina thinks that one place worth
EDL	00:15:32,351	00:15:35,423	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Considering is the lava Fields about patriarchal
EDL	00:15:35,423	00:15:36,959	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Let's take a look

EDL	00:15:40,287	00:15:41,567	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Why this water

EDL	00:15:52,063	00:15:53,855	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	In most places we charge just

EDL	00:15:55,135	00:15:56,927	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	The ground beneath the old lake is made

EDL	00:16:02,047	00:16:04,607	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	But in a few places around the edges of the old
EDL	00:16:05,375	00:16:07,679	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	The landscape is Rocky and permeable

EDL	00:16:13,311	00:16:15,359	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Because biggest lava fields

EDL	00:18:49,215	00:18:52,543	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Pedro wants to shift how people in Mexico City think about garden
EDL	00:18:53,311	00:18:54,847	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	A while back he was asked
EDL	00:18:54,847	00:18:56,127	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	China Garden to go with
EDL	00:18:56,127	00:18:56,639	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	The public Arts
EDL	00:18:57,151	00:18:59,455	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	It was built in The Patriot golf 40 years earlier
EDL	00:18:59,967	00:19:02,271	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	And instead of planning a bunch of flowers
EDL	00:19:02,271	00:19:03,039	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Shrubs
EDL	00:19:03,551	00:19:05,087	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Just started digging
EDL	00:19:05,599	00:19:07,903	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	So I create that Garden
EDL	00:19:08,671	00:19:11,743	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Only by Excavating digging
EDL	00:19:11,743	00:19:15,327	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Gardening by subtraction Pedro calls this
EDL	00:19:15,327	00:19:18,911	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Landscape archaeology we start with three guys
EDL	00:19:19,679	00:19:20,447	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Old guys
EDL	00:19:21,215	00:19:21,727	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Digging
EDL	00:19:22,239	00:19:24,031	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Like archaeological site
EDL	00:19:24,799	00:19:26,847	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	They start to remove plants
EDL	00:19:26,847	00:19:27,615	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Then
EDL	00:19:27,615	00:19:28,383	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Soil
EDL	00:19:29,919	00:19:31,455	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Then starts to appear
EDL	00:19:31,967	00:19:32,735	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	The lava field
EDL	00:19:33,247	00:19:33,759	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Beautiful
EDL	00:19:34,527	00:19:36,575	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	It's a lot more work than planting tulips
EDL	00:19:36,575	00:19:41,439	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	But Pedro says that people in The Patriot all can do landscape archaeology on their own property
EDL	00:19:41,951	00:19:47,071	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Uncover the lava and build Aragon style dry Rock Gardens that don't require any irrigation
EDL	00:19:47,583	00:19:49,119	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	But it's a tough sell
EDL	00:19:49,119	00:19:51,423	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	People want Gardens that look like Versailles
EDL	00:19:51,935	00:19:55,775	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Yes we are very independent emotionally dependent in Europe
EDL	00:19:56,287	00:19:57,311	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	We still
EDL	00:19:58,079	00:19:59,871	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Design Gardens like in France
EDL	00:20:00,639	00:20:01,151	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	I mean
EDL	00:20:02,175	00:20:02,943	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Is ridiculous
EDL	00:20:03,967	00:20:05,503	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Because we don't have the landscaper
EDL	00:20:05,503	00:20:09,087	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	France we don't have the weather we don't have the soil is mems very different
EDL	00:20:09,855	00:20:13,951	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Pedro told me that there is one house in Los jardines del Pedregal
EDL	00:20:14,463	00:20:18,047	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Where you can still see a true Mexican lava rock garden
EDL	00:20:18,815	00:20:20,607	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	It's actually one of the first houses built in
EDL	00:20:21,375	00:20:23,167	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Design by Barragan himself
EDL	00:20:23,167	00:20:23,935	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Back in the forties
EDL	00:20:24,447	00:20:27,519	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	The property underwent a lot of changes in the decade since
EDL	00:20:28,031	00:20:29,055	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	But a few years ago
EDL	00:20:29,055	00:20:31,359	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	A new owner a man named Cesar Cervantes
EDL	00:20:31,359	00:20:34,175	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Decided to restore the house the way it looked in Barragan
EDL	00:20:34,943	00:20:38,271	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	San Pedro convinced him to uncover the original lava rock
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:39,807	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	And he did it
EDL	00:20:40,831	00:20:41,599	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	But now
EDL	00:20:41,599	00:20:42,623	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Everybody told me

EDL	00:23:14,688	00:23:16,736	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	They didn't even know they lived on top of
EDL	00:23:16,736	00:23:17,248	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Lava fields

EDL	00:26:40,768	00:26:44,352	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	But what she kept coming back to with me was a fundamentally
EDL	00:26:44,352	00:26:47,168	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	The city has to change its relationship to rain
EDL	00:26:48,960	00:26:52,032	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Mexico City is different than
EDL	00:26:52,032	00:26:57,152	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	A lot of other cities that are facing water shortages around the world and if they do get
EDL	00:26:57,152	00:27:01,248	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Brain if it rains it rains that you know Cape Town South Africa would love
EDL	00:27:01,248	00:27:03,296	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	To have as much rain as Mexico City does
EDL	00:27:04,320	00:27:06,368	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	But because of his history with flooding which
EDL	00:27:06,368	00:27:06,880	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	We heard about
EDL	00:27:07,392	00:27:10,208	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	In the piece yeah they've learned that rainwater is
EDL	00:27:10,208	00:27:10,720	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Is bad
EDL	00:27:11,488	00:27:12,512	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	The problem for us
EDL	00:27:12,512	00:27:13,792	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Seawater as our enemy
EDL	00:27:14,304	00:27:17,120	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	We have learned that water that falls
EDL	00:27:17,632	00:27:18,656	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Is a problem
EDL	00:27:18,656	00:27:20,448	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	And we've learned that for the last
EDL	00:27:21,216	00:27:22,240	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	700 years
EDL	00:27:22,752	00:27:24,032	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	So it's really hard
EDL	00:27:24,544	00:27:25,312	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Change
EDL	00:27:25,312	00:27:27,872	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	The way in which we see rain water
EDL	00:27:28,384	00:27:29,920	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	But they really have to because
EDL	00:27:29,920	00:27:31,712	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	That rainwater is an asset
EDL	00:27:31,712	00:27:32,992	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	That has been waist
EDL	00:27:32,992	00:27:34,016	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Stood for so long
EDL	00:27:35,296	00:27:36,832	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Literally hundreds of years
EDL	00:27:36,832	00:27:39,904	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Focusing on the rainwater out of the valley
EDL	00:27:39,904	00:27:41,952	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Fast as you can so that we don't flat out
EDL	00:27:42,464	00:27:47,840	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	And you know the consequence of doing that for so long has been like the desiccation of the Watershed
EDL	00:27:48,608	00:27:50,400	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	So this is Enrique lomnitz

EDL	00:27:57,312	00:27:58,848	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	And the whole

EDL	00:28:05,248	00:28:06,272	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Bring water into an asset
EDL	00:28:06,784	00:28:09,856	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	And to do this what they do as they design and in
EDL	00:28:09,856	00:28:11,904	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Install rainwater harvesting

EDL	00:28:13,952	00:28:14,976	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	And Enrique
EDL	00:28:14,976	00:28:18,560	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Says that this makes sense for a couple different reasons one because
EDL	00:28:18,560	00:28:20,096	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	It provides people with reliable
EDL	00:28:20,096	00:28:21,376	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Play clean water
EDL	00:28:21,376	00:28:24,704	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	N2 because it reduces the pressure on the groundwater aquifer
EDL	00:28:25,472	00:28:31,872	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Rainwater harvesting systems like we used they help you avoid pulling water out of the ground and they help you avoid

EDL	00:28:33,920	00:28:34,944	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	And the help of family
EDL	00:28:35,456	00:28:38,272	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	In parts of the city that are having big water problems
EDL	00:28:38,272	00:28:44,160	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	In 2009 in a neighborhood that had particularly bad

EDL	00:28:45,184	00:28:51,584	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Like people are starting to open their tops and have like brown water come out of the top number or just not have any water coming out of the
EDL	00:28:51,584	00:28:53,120	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	The top sometimes for weeks on end
EDL	00:29:00,800	00:29:01,312	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Apparently
EDL	00:29:01,824	00:29:06,944	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	What is the weather for a Skype tape
EDL	00:29:06,944	00:29:13,344	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	But anyway designed assistance for individual homes
EDL	00:29:13,344	00:29:15,136	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Is rainwater from the roof of the house
EDL	00:29:15,136	00:29:15,904	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Filters out
EDL	00:29:16,416	00:29:18,720	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	All the kinds of impurities that you might have an in

EDL	00:29:22,048	00:29:23,840	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	It's a pretty simple
EDL	00:29:23,840	00:29:28,960	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Design intervention but the thing that makes it the work really challenging is that
EDL	00:29:28,960	00:29:32,544	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	You can't just mass-produce this system in and ship it out
EDL	00:29:32,544	00:29:34,848	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Every house is different now so everyone wants these things
EDL	00:29:34,848	00:29:36,384	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	System is like a custom install
EDL	00:29:37,664	00:29:39,968	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Every family has to be
EDL	00:29:39,968	00:29:43,296	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Trained and taught how to use rainwater harvesting system and
EDL	00:29:43,808	00:29:47,648	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	What is for and how to use it and how not to use it and what's be careful of
EDL	00:29:47,648	00:29:50,720	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Cancel the work ends up being really social you know you can't
EDL	00:29:50,720	00:29:52,000	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Drop the technology
EDL	00:29:52,000	00:29:53,280	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	People you have to
EDL	00:29:53,280	00:29:55,584	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	It's a cultivate relationships and get them onboard
EDL	00:29:56,864	00:29:57,888	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Cancel can you
EDL	00:29:57,888	00:29:59,680	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Drink the water that clean water
EDL	00:30:00,192	00:30:02,496	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	So no it's not clean enough to drink
EDL	00:30:02,496	00:30:04,032	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	But it is clean enough for
EDL	00:30:04,032	00:30:09,408	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	For just about every other household uses could have that makes up the vast majority of the water that home
EDL	00:30:09,920	00:30:10,688	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Music music
EDL	00:30:11,456	00:30:15,296	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	And so what is the scale that they're working on how many of these water systems are they
EDL	00:30:15,296	00:30:16,320	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Tranny installed around
EDL	00:30:16,832	00:30:23,232	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Yeah so at this point they built about 11,000 rainwater harvesting system so it's a lot but it's not
EDL	00:30:23,232	00:30:26,304	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Not a lot in the grand scheme of things and mostly they've been
EDL	00:30:26,816	00:30:31,936	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Doing this on a fairly small scale and going kind of neighborhood to Neighborhood very Grassroots approach
EDL	00:30:32,448	00:30:38,848	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	But things even in the last couple years are really starting to scale-up and then Mexico City just elected in
EDL	00:30:38,848	00:30:39,616	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	You meher
EDL	00:30:39,616	00:30:42,432	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Her name is Claudia sheinbaum and she's
EDL	00:30:42,432	00:30:43,712	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	A scientist who spent
EDL	00:30:43,712	00:30:50,112	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Haha yeah scientists
EDL	00:30:50,112	00:30:51,136	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Any country really
EDL	00:30:51,136	00:30:57,536	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	But she spent her whole career studying environmental issues water issues specifically she's got an engineering background
EDL	00:30:57,536	00:30:59,840	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	This is all like really up her alley
EDL	00:30:59,840	00:31:03,680	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	And since her election you know just this past year
EDL	00:31:03,680	00:31:09,312	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	The government the city government has started to work much more closely with this liar bana ends and they really want to push
EDL	00:31:09,824	00:31:11,616	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Rainwater harvesting on a really large
EDL	00:31:11,616	00:31:12,384	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Scale
EDL	00:31:12,384	00:31:18,784	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	The Mexico City government was like dude this is an important project and we need to do a huge knowing all of the parts of the city that don't have
EDL	00:31:18,784	00:31:24,416	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	And we're installing we're going to be installing 10000 rainwater harvesting systems there this year
EDL	00:31:24,928	00:31:30,816	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	And if all goes well financed inflation like a hundred thousand or more rainwater harvesting systems over the next few years
EDL	00:31:31,328	00:31:36,448	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	So it's definitely a large-scale experiment at this point it's kind of one of its kind in the world
EDL	00:31:36,960	00:31:38,240	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Possibly like scaling up
EDL	00:31:39,776	00:31:46,176	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Threatened
EDL	00:31:46,176	00:31:47,712	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Harvesting is the solution
EDL	00:31:48,480	00:31:49,760	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	It's really going to take
EDL	00:31:49,760	00:31:50,272	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Home
EDL	00:31:50,784	00:31:52,832	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Basket of different strategies
EDL	00:31:52,832	00:31:54,368	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	To get Mexico City out of this mess
EDL	00:31:54,880	00:31:58,208	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	We're going to get out of this situation by doing a whole bunch of things together
EDL	00:31:58,208	00:31:59,488	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	But that's fundamentally
EDL	00:32:00,000	00:32:01,280	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Just create
EDL	00:32:01,280	00:32:03,328	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Balance between how much water
EDL	00:32:03,328	00:32:06,144	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	We actually put into the ground and how much water we pull out of
EDL	00:32:08,960	00:32:09,728	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Basic
EDL	00:32:10,752	00:32:13,824	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	And without a Milo Reddick Astro Regatta the architect
EDL	00:32:13,824	00:32:19,968	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	We are from earlier it's focusing on designing parks and other sorts of public spaces that also function as water in infrastructure
EDL	00:32:20,992	00:32:24,320	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	You don't like a public sister and then things like rain for a lot of
EDL	00:32:24,320	00:32:25,088	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	People
EDL	00:32:25,088	00:32:31,488	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Or a public park that has an in ground water infiltration component where you've actually got rain water flowing back
EDL	00:32:31,488	00:32:32,256	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	To the aquifer
EDL	00:32:32,256	00:32:38,656	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	And so her goal is to create a whole network of green infrastructure so that when
EDL	00:32:38,656	00:32:39,424	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	And those rains
EDL	00:32:39,424	00:32:40,704	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Cam the city
EDL	00:32:40,704	00:32:42,752	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Can take that water in and make use of a
EDL	00:32:42,752	00:32:44,288	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Innocent sandwiches
EDL	00:32:44,288	00:32:46,592	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	The city could really be, a sponge
EDL	00:32:46,592	00:32:48,640	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	So when we have one of these
EDL	00:32:48,640	00:32:49,664	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Rain storms
EDL	00:32:50,432	00:32:52,992	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Oldest public spaces somehow are evil
EDL	00:32:52,992	00:32:54,016	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Who holds Rainwater
EDL	00:32:55,040	00:32:56,064	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	And keep it there
EDL	00:32:56,576	00:32:57,600	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Until the storm
EDL	00:32:58,112	00:32:58,624	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Passes
EDL	00:32:59,392	00:33:00,416	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	On that way
EDL	00:33:00,416	00:33:04,256	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Theoretically a big rainstorm could be something that people are
EDL	00:33:04,256	00:33:07,072	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Looking forward to and then hoping for rather than something that they fear
EDL	00:33:07,584	00:33:08,608	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Because it would
EDL	00:33:08,608	00:33:15,008	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Both collect water that they need and also mitigate flooding because the water would be drained to the offer instead of being on the
EDL	00:33:15,008	00:33:17,056	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Surface and trap they're destroying things
EDL	00:33:17,056	00:33:23,456	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	It's true it's true yeah if you can if you can hold that water you're also preventing at water from turning into dangerous runoff
EDL	00:33:23,456	00:33:25,248	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Does problems you know I mean
EDL	00:33:25,760	00:33:32,160	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	You should go to Power that like flooding requires its own you know the in order to solve the flooding problem there's other things that are
EDL	00:33:32,160	00:33:34,976	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Are needed there are Architects that are actually thinking about
EDL	00:33:34,976	00:33:39,072	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	No bringing back remnants of the old Lake systems as ways to
EDL	00:33:39,072	00:33:41,120	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Allow water to flood into these
EDL	00:33:41,120	00:33:47,520	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Spaces I can hold and retain water and teeth people say if you know you know there's all kinds of things that
EDL	00:33:47,520	00:33:51,872	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Fashion designers are thinking about their men Engineers to the big problem if it leaks
EDL	00:33:51,872	00:33:53,920	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	The whole water system is old and filled with leeks
EDL	00:33:53,920	00:33:55,712	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Some people estimate their losing as much as
EDL	00:33:55,712	00:33:59,296	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Is 40% of water and leaks so they let you know in terms of blow
EDL	00:33:59,296	00:34:01,088	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	A fruit that's a great place
EDL	00:34:01,088	00:34:02,880	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Start also Wastewater
EDL	00:34:02,880	00:34:09,280	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Wastewater reuse you know there's so many different things that need to happen and Loretta's points basically like we need all of it
EDL	00:34:09,280	00:34:15,680	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Not waiting around to the best solution we need an all of all of the above strategy
EDL	00:34:15,680	00:34:17,216	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Because what I see
EDL	00:34:17,216	00:34:21,312	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	At this moment is that we have enough infrastructure
EDL	00:34:21,312	00:34:23,104	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	To keep the city safe
EDL	00:34:23,104	00:34:24,128	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	For 30 years
EDL	00:34:24,640	00:34:25,664	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	So we can sink
EDL	00:34:25,664	00:34:28,224	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Window of 30 years
EDL	00:34:28,224	00:34:30,016	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	We have a very big up
EDL	00:34:30,016	00:34:30,784	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Opportunity
EDL	00:34:30,784	00:34:33,856	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Putting up all this alternate Water Management
EDL	00:34:33,856	00:34:34,624	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Strategies right
EDL	00:34:35,136	00:34:37,184	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Then we could really use this 30
EDL	00:34:37,184	00:34:38,720	| 01_355_Depave_Paradise_pt_01 |	Yours for our best benefit
