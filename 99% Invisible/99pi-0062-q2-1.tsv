EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:24,288	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	Americans generally don't use the word cue and referring to an ordered list or line until

EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:27,616	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	Is very clear to me at least

EDL	00:03:29,408	00:03:32,224	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	Refusing a lot that it would probably was the wrong way
EDL	00:03:32,992	00:03:34,784	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	For the US market
EDL	00:03:35,296	00:03:37,344	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	People see this word q u e u e
EDL	00:03:37,856	00:03:39,392	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	And they have no idea how to pronounce it
EDL	00:03:40,928	00:03:43,744	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	Way too many weird pronunciations of that word
EDL	00:03:43,744	00:03:46,304	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	From quetta que yo to
EDL	00:03:46,304	00:03:49,888	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	All kinds of weird and wonderful things that it's him
EDL	00:03:49,888	00:03:50,656	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	Quite bizarre
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:56,288	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	And so I have been lobbying for about a decade to change the word Q2
EDL	00:03:56,288	00:03:57,056	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	A list

EDL	00:03:58,592	00:03:59,872	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	Unfortunately
EDL	00:03:59,872	00:04:03,456	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	The marketing department was very attached to the ownable

EDL	00:04:23,935	00:04:25,471	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	For how many Americans
EDL	00:04:25,983	00:04:28,287	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	Know this word today
EDL	00:04:28,287	00:04:30,591	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	I would say that you could make a case
EDL	00:04:31,103	00:04:31,871	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	Because of Netflix
EDL	00:04:32,383	00:04:33,919	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	That this word even has a
EDL	00:04:34,943	00:04:36,223	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	Understanding
EDL	00:04:36,223	00:04:36,735	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	Recognition
EDL	00:04:37,247	00:04:38,527	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	That's out there today
EDL	00:04:38,527	00:04:40,063	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	It seems like a really comes out of you
EDL	00:04:41,087	00:04:47,487	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	Well I guess that's possible indeed I have to say this probably thinks that I'm more proud of introducing

EDL	00:05:07,711	00:05:10,783	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	But the queue is still Central to Netflix's existence
EDL	00:05:11,295	00:05:12,063	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	Because

EDL	00:06:11,455	00:06:12,479	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	This idea that

EDL	00:06:19,647	00:06:20,415	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	It's actually
EDL	00:06:20,415	00:06:21,183	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	Brutal
EDL	00:06:21,183	00:06:23,743	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	Because what it does is train consumers
EDL	00:06:24,255	00:06:26,047	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	Not to want to watch now

EDL	00:06:49,855	00:06:54,207	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	The idea of net neutrality
EDL	00:06:54,719	00:06:57,023	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	At least all the data of a given type

EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:15,711	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	Her concern about the cable companies in net neutrality goes Way Beyond
EDL	00:07:18,271	00:07:23,391	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	Focusing on Netflix in some ways is a little misleading because it's just an application like another
EDL	00:07:23,903	00:07:27,231	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	Imagine instead
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:29,791	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	Backup of all your files on your computer
EDL	00:07:29,791	00:07:35,423	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	Really good connection to do that
EDL	00:07:35,935	00:07:39,263	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	What is the standing in the middle
EDL	00:07:39,263	00:07:43,359	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	Who could charge whatever he wanted to for your ability to run your business

EDL	00:07:46,687	00:07:49,247	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	Subject to this kind of highway robbery

EDL	00:07:51,295	00:07:57,695	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	What Susan Crawford wants us to understand is that if companies like Comcast succeed and cable eyes and be in

EDL	00:08:07,423	00:08:10,751	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	Was not how the internet was originally designed the funk
EDL	00:08:11,519	00:08:12,799	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	Totally
EDL	00:08:12,799	00:08:13,567	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	Different
EDL	00:08:13,567	00:08:14,079	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	Model
EDL	00:08:15,359	00:08:17,407	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	We have these two models that are clashing
EDL	00:08:17,407	00:08:18,431	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	Like planet

EDL	00:08:19,711	00:08:20,223	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	Definitely
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:24,831	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	The other planet is the basic idea telecommunications in
EDL	00:08:25,855	00:08:27,903	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	Where everybody gets the same service
EDL	00:08:27,903	00:08:33,023	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	At a reasonable price and that allows all kinds of interesting things to happen

EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:47,615	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	The debate is the idea that
EDL	00:08:48,127	00:08:49,663	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	Access to telecommunication
EDL	00:08:50,431	00:08:50,943	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	Be transparent

EDL	00:08:53,759	00:08:56,319	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	Sort of like a good old-fashioned

EDL	00:09:05,535	00:09:08,095	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	But you're all standing in line and take your policing

EDL	00:09:25,759	00:09:28,063	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	Is that what we used to think of as a
EDL	00:09:28,063	00:09:30,879	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	Basic affordances everybody got at a reasonable price
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:33,439	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	Has become more and more

EDL	00:09:47,519	00:09:48,031	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	Goes out the window

EDL	00:09:53,919	00:09:56,223	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	Need to be policed and regulated
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:09:59,039	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	Because they don't consider their networks parts
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:10:01,343	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	Of America's information infrastructure
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:03,647	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	This is why we never had a telephone nutria
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:05,695	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	Because the telephone
EDL	00:10:05,695	00:10:07,999	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	Was considered a vital component of
EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:09,279	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	America's Telecommunications
EDL	00:10:10,047	00:10:12,607	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	It used to be that all Americans had itself

EDL	00:10:22,847	00:10:26,687	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	And the telephone company had no say over what business

EDL	00:11:10,975	00:11:13,279	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	Disappeared a long time ago
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:15,839	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	We used to think that competition

EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:38,623	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	And it never really occurred to me why

EDL	00:11:40,927	00:11:44,255	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	Cable company became the only option for a lot of people when it come

EDL	00:11:48,607	00:11:49,119	| 99pi-0062-q2-1 |	The internet
