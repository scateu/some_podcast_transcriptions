EDL	00:02:57,920	00:02:58,688	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	It just is
EDL	00:02:59,456	00:03:01,760	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	What we do so we're about words
EDL	00:03:01,760	00:03:03,552	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	And where about where they're catching

EDL	00:03:10,720	00:03:11,744	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	They have named
EDL	00:03:11,744	00:03:12,512	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	As they put it
EDL	00:03:13,024	00:03:14,304	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Everything except
EDL	00:03:14,304	00:03:14,816	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	A car
EDL	00:03:15,584	00:03:20,704	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	You might think hey I need my dog or my kids or my band or my
EDL	00:03:20,704	00:03:21,472	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	But
EDL	00:03:21,472	00:03:24,544	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	There are a number of things to consider when designing the name
EDL	00:03:24,544	00:03:27,872	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Just think of all the associations with every word
EDL	00:03:27,872	00:03:29,152	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Take for example
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:29,920	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Photoshop
EDL	00:03:31,456	00:03:32,480	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Sweet name Photoshop
EDL	00:03:33,504	00:03:34,272	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	But we did
EDL	00:03:34,272	00:03:35,552	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Come up with the elements
EDL	00:03:36,064	00:03:38,112	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	And that word
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:41,696	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Took a lot of work because Photoshop was looking to Market a lesson
EDL	00:03:41,696	00:03:46,304	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Expensive version of their software that had all the same capabilities as regular Photoshop
EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:48,096	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Just without all the bells and whistles
EDL	00:03:48,608	00:03:55,008	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	You would think that that would be easy but it wasn't so they didn't want to use Photoshop template for Photoshop basic or anything that sound
EDL	00:03:55,008	00:03:55,520	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Founded compromise
EDL	00:03:56,288	00:03:58,080	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	So we went through a really large
EDL	00:03:58,080	00:03:59,104	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Operation of
EDL	00:03:59,104	00:04:00,384	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	All the different ways that we could
EDL	00:04:00,384	00:04:02,432	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Say just as good but
EDL	00:04:02,432	00:04:03,456	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Not as
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:04,224	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Full
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:04,736	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Pledge
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:07,552	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	And with the essentials wheel
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:10,880	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Just every word elements
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:12,160	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	For its subtlety
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:14,208	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Elements are the most basic
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:14,720	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Parts that
EDL	00:04:15,232	00:04:16,768	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Can have but they're essentially have anything
EDL	00:04:18,047	00:04:20,351	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	So that's the word that we eventually chose
EDL	00:04:21,119	00:04:22,143	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	And that's why you hire that
EDL	00:04:23,167	00:04:24,191	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	To consider this stuff
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:26,239	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	And they don't come cheap
EDL	00:04:26,239	00:04:26,751	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	The
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:30,591	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Vast majority of naming companies like us
EDL	00:04:30,591	00:04:31,615	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Are pretty expensive
EDL	00:04:32,127	00:04:34,687	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Maven companies don't just make up names
EDL	00:04:34,687	00:04:38,271	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	They also check what names are available for URLs in for trademark
EDL	00:04:38,783	00:04:41,599	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	And they see which names mean bad things in other languages
EDL	00:04:41,599	00:04:42,623	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	We can take
EDL	00:04:42,623	00:04:45,695	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	I need list of names and check them in any language in the world and say
EDL	00:04:46,207	00:04:46,719	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Is it pronounced
EDL	00:04:47,487	00:04:53,887	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Does it have negative meaning and outside of the u.s. is it is there a brand already existing in your country or
EDL	00:04:53,887	00:04:57,471	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Some of like a TV show that has the same name that we should be aware of
EDL	00:04:58,495	00:05:02,079	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	And you can't underestimate the importance of linguistic checks
EDL	00:05:02,079	00:05:04,127	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Once they were naming a little Gadget toy
EDL	00:05:04,639	00:05:06,687	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	And one of the names that we could come up with
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:07,711	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	For them
EDL	00:05:07,711	00:05:13,343	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Turned out in Japanese to be a word that meant a small device that doesn't work
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:19,999	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	But more than anything else Laurel and her team at catchword Just Produce 8
EDL	00:05:19,999	00:05:25,887	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Con of names as Laurel see that there is a direct relationship between quantity
EDL	00:05:26,399	00:05:27,167	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	And quality
EDL	00:05:27,167	00:05:33,567	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	You know the first 500 names that you come up with are going to be really obvious things are already taken or not going to be that in
EDL	00:05:33,567	00:05:34,335	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Interesting
EDL	00:05:34,335	00:05:35,359	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	You kind of have to get that out
EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:36,895	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	So catch word
EDL	00:05:36,895	00:05:37,663	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Will generate
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:40,223	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Over 2000 names
EDL	00:05:40,735	00:05:41,759	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	And they present
EDL	00:05:41,759	00:05:43,295	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	3252 the client
EDL	00:05:43,295	00:05:46,367	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Because
EDL	00:05:46,367	00:05:49,439	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	They come up with names across the naming Spectrum
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:51,487	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Spectrum
EDL	00:05:52,255	00:05:53,279	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Because we're talking about languages
EDL	00:05:54,559	00:05:55,583	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	So at one end of the Spectre
EDL	00:05:56,095	00:05:56,863	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	You have descriptive
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:05:59,167	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	And those are names that absolutely just
EDL	00:05:59,167	00:06:00,447	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Describe what the thing is
EDL	00:06:00,959	00:06:01,983	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Classic example
EDL	00:06:02,751	00:06:04,031	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Raisin Bran benefits of
EDL	00:06:04,031	00:06:05,055	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Descriptive names
EDL	00:06:05,055	00:06:10,175	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	They are self-explanatory that's what that stuff is right it's a box its brand and it has raisins in it
EDL	00:06:11,199	00:06:12,223	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	You would never
EDL	00:06:12,223	00:06:15,551	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	How to explain to anybody with this stuff is Shredded Wheat
EDL	00:06:15,551	00:06:19,903	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	That's what that is it's weird and it's been shredded
EDL	00:06:19,903	00:06:26,303	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	They are hard to own normally you can't trademark names like this in fact Raisin Bran and shredded we are not trademark
EDL	00:06:26,303	00:06:32,447	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Anybody can have cereal and call it Raisin Bran or shorted me so a lot of descriptive names tend to get modified
EDL	00:06:32,959	00:06:35,007	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	International Business Machines
EDL	00:06:35,007	00:06:36,543	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Freedom descriptive
EDL	00:06:36,543	00:06:38,335	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Overtime they've convinced that
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:43,711	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	IBM the other big drawback is that descriptive names can be limited if you remember there were companies called things like
EDL	00:06:43,711	00:06:44,479	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Like
EDL	00:06:44,479	00:06:45,247	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Stamps
EDL	00:06:45,247	00:06:46,015	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Right
EDL	00:06:46,015	00:06:48,575	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	If you ever want to do anything but sell electronic stamps you're screwed
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:50,879	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	On the other end of the spectrum
EDL	00:06:50,879	00:06:51,903	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	You got so-called
EDL	00:06:51,903	00:06:52,671	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Arbitrariness
EDL	00:06:53,439	00:06:55,487	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	And apple is a great example of
EDL	00:06:55,999	00:06:58,047	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	It doesn't tell you anything about what they do
EDL	00:06:58,047	00:06:58,815	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Which allows
EDL	00:06:58,815	00:07:02,655	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	For flexibility they used to just make computers now they do media
EDL	00:07:02,655	00:07:09,055	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	They could do anything under that I mean they can make cars
EDL	00:07:09,055	00:07:15,455	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Associations maybe Apple implies learning
EDL	00:07:15,455	00:07:19,807	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	I don't know but it doesn't apply to me
EDL	00:07:19,807	00:07:22,879	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Arbitrary names can also just be completely made up
EDL	00:07:22,879	00:07:25,183	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	And these kinds are called empty vessels
EDL	00:07:25,183	00:07:31,583	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Some examples of Hulu or Exxon or Xerox or Kodak Kodak has absolutely no meaning
EDL	00:07:31,583	00:07:36,447	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	They only chose it because that great hardcover sound is very
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:42,847	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Acoustically relevant that is it really cuts through we tend to say that things that start with that hard k sound
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:45,407	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Are strong things that start with T
EDL	00:07:45,407	00:07:51,807	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Also the same way it's kind of a strong or aggressive sounding name whereas an F sound is very soft
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:57,951	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Too harder to hear it and people just don't respond as well to it the benefits of arbitrary names and empty vessel name
EDL	00:07:58,463	00:07:59,743	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	They're easy to trademark
EDL	00:07:59,743	00:08:06,143	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Easy to get the domain name for and usually good in languages around the world
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:09,983	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Explaining to people even get a lot of money behind these kinds of names.
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:11,519	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Tell people what they mean
EDL	00:08:11,519	00:08:13,055	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Right okay so you've got this
EDL	00:08:13,055	00:08:15,103	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Descriptive on one end of the spectrum
EDL	00:08:15,103	00:08:16,383	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	An arbitrary on the other
EDL	00:08:17,151	00:08:20,223	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	And most names fall somewhere between the two
EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:23,551	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	And Laurel called all these names in the middle suggestiveness
EDL	00:08:24,319	00:08:27,647	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	They're not exactly arbitrary and they're not exactly descriptive
EDL	00:08:27,647	00:08:28,927	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Like Microsoft
EDL	00:08:28,927	00:08:29,695	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Microsoft
EDL	00:08:30,207	00:08:36,607	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Software for micro computers right it kind of says what it does but not really because it's those two words that
EDL	00:08:36,607	00:08:37,119	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Taylor Swift together
EDL	00:08:37,887	00:08:38,655	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Microsoft
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:40,959	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Is an example of a coined word
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:44,031	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	A word that doesn't exist in the English dictionary
EDL	00:08:44,031	00:08:47,103	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	But it's made up of familiar words word parts
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:52,223	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Or sounds Spotify and Nescafe and Netflix are also coin worth
EDL	00:08:52,223	00:08:58,367	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	They sound like English words but they're not in Laurel and her team generator
EDL	00:08:58,367	00:08:59,391	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	A root words
EDL	00:08:59,391	00:09:04,511	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	You try to find the right vocabulary for the client and what they trying to convey in this name make a list of vocabulary and then you
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:05,023	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Okay
EDL	00:09:05,535	00:09:08,607	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	How can I modify these words and then we have lists
EDL	00:09:09,631	00:09:11,679	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Prefixes and suffixes in English
EDL	00:09:12,191	00:09:14,239	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	And then you just start pairing them up
EDL	00:09:14,239	00:09:16,543	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	For example take the route name
EDL	00:09:17,055	00:09:23,199	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	From there you can get name Ling namely rename name spot name proprof name
EDL	00:09:24,223	00:09:25,759	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	But okay let's be honest
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:32,159	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	There are lots of websites that can match prefixes and suffixes to words and generate big long list for you
EDL	00:09:32,671	00:09:34,719	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	But websites are not linguist
EDL	00:09:35,487	00:09:41,375	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	They can't tell you what names are actually good that's where the skill and the creative Talent comes in is
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:42,655	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Figuring out what's a good word
EDL	00:09:43,167	00:09:44,191	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	And you wouldn't think it
EDL	00:09:44,191	00:09:46,751	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	But suggested names are really difficult to create
EDL	00:09:46,751	00:09:48,543	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Because you want them to have meaning
EDL	00:09:49,055	00:09:50,335	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Walmart Aiken
EDL	00:09:50,335	00:09:52,383	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Taken for domain names and trademarks
EDL	00:09:52,895	00:09:54,943	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	And as Laurel sees it it doesn't hurt to have
EDL	00:09:54,943	00:09:55,967	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	2000 option
EDL	00:09:56,479	00:09:58,015	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	But it doesn't have to be this way
EDL	00:09:58,527	00:10:01,087	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	There are other people who do a very differently they do
EDL	00:10:01,087	00:10:02,111	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	10 names at a time
EDL	00:10:02,623	00:10:06,207	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	That works for them I think it depends on whether you come from
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:11,071	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	More strictly an evening background or whether you come from an ad agency background
EDL	00:10:11,071	00:10:12,863	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Didn't you do it that way
EDL	00:10:13,631	00:10:16,191	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	We tend to present around
EDL	00:10:16,703	00:10:17,983	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	12 names
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:18,751	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Because
EDL	00:10:19,263	00:10:21,823	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	To present too many in the value of any given name
EDL	00:10:22,335	00:10:24,127	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	It's drastically reduced
EDL	00:10:24,127	00:10:27,711	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Eli Altman is the creative director at a hundred monkeys
EDL	00:10:27,711	00:10:34,111	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Another name a company only a few miles away
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:35,903	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Riders you're bound to get a good name
EDL	00:10:35,903	00:10:37,439	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	It's kind of a joke about the process
EDL	00:10:37,951	00:10:39,743	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	They give their client a list of 12 names
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:42,559	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	It's not like a hundred monkeys produces
EDL	00:10:42,559	00:10:44,351	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Fewer names because they're lazier
EDL	00:10:44,351	00:10:46,655	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	You guys just have a really different philosophy
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:47,167	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Safita Nae Nae
EDL	00:10:47,679	00:10:50,239	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Some people think that naming is about linguistics
EDL	00:10:50,751	00:10:52,287	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	We are not of that philosophy
EDL	00:10:52,799	00:10:55,615	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Names are all about the stories that they begin to tell
EDL	00:10:55,615	00:10:59,199	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Eli and his team do not make coin words are empty vessels
EDL	00:10:59,199	00:11:00,223	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	I just don't think
EDL	00:11:00,223	00:11:00,735	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	That's
EDL	00:11:03,039	00:11:03,807	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Think about names
EDL	00:11:07,903	00:11:08,415	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Things like that
EDL	00:11:08,927	00:11:10,463	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	We're much more interested in
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:12,511	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	History of a word

EDL	00:11:15,839	00:11:18,911	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Really these guys are very intimate ology and narrative
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:20,447	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	At the meeting I said in on
EDL	00:11:20,447	00:11:24,287	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	What name was the small town in Europe where a famous mathematician was born
EDL	00:11:24,287	00:11:27,359	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Others were inspired by anatomical charts and constellations
EDL	00:11:28,127	00:11:32,479	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	100 monkeys has the dinner party in mind names that lead to conversation
EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:33,503	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	And in this way
EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:37,087	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Eli and his team have named front porch senior living communities
EDL	00:11:37,087	00:11:37,599	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	The lot

EDL	00:12:51,327	00:12:52,351	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	They're just a lot of option
EDL	00:12:52,863	00:12:59,263	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	It mostly comes down to what kind of story if any you want behind your name some clients really want
EDL	00:12:59,263	00:13:00,031	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	I'm meeting with name
EDL	00:13:00,031	00:13:05,919	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Remember made up names are easier to register domains are trademarks for and are less likely to offend
EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:11,551	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	And if it's a meaningless word if it's just a completely coined made-up word you can make up any story you want around it
EDL	00:13:11,551	00:13:13,087	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Anemic Hulu for example
EDL	00:13:13,599	00:13:19,999	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	As far as I know doesn't actually have any real meaning I know that Hulu the the inventors of that have a story around
EDL	00:13:19,999	00:13:23,839	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	And that name I don't think it's true it's a cool name because it's short it's easy to remember
EDL	00:13:23,839	00:13:25,375	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Visually it's very interesting looking
EDL	00:13:26,143	00:13:27,935	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	So now you don't need to have a story around
EDL	00:13:28,447	00:13:30,239	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Is this
EDL	00:13:30,239	00:13:33,567	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	If you got enough money you could pick any old name to do it
EDL	00:13:33,567	00:13:37,919	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	You could pick a name as meaningless as hello yep moneytalks
EDL	00:13:37,919	00:13:39,199	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	If you have a ton of money
EDL	00:13:39,711	00:13:41,503	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Basically the name could be any
EDL	00:13:41,503	00:13:43,807	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Remember when the iPad was about to come out
EDL	00:13:43,807	00:13:50,207	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Everyone thought it was the silliest and you heard all kinds of sanitary napkin jokes but now do cheer
EDL	00:13:50,207	00:13:52,511	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Force of will and advertising dollars
EDL	00:13:52,511	00:13:54,303	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	You don't think twice about it
EDL	00:13:54,303	00:13:57,119	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	But with a name like iPad at least you can pronounce it
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:14:00,703	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Can you imagine reading Xerox for the first time

EDL	00:14:10,687	00:14:15,295	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Before they get their new name companies and products usually have little internal codenames or nickname
EDL	00:14:15,807	00:14:16,831	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Like Project X
EDL	00:14:16,831	00:14:18,111	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Store they get named after someone
EDL	00:14:18,111	00:14:19,135	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Cat or something like that
EDL	00:14:19,647	00:14:20,671	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Sometimes
EDL	00:14:20,671	00:14:21,695	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Unfortunately
EDL	00:14:22,207	00:14:25,279	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	With the companies will often happen they will have a code name
EDL	00:14:25,791	00:14:28,607	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	That someone internally has chosen which is actually pretty good
EDL	00:14:29,375	00:14:30,911	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	And people get buried
EDL	00:14:30,911	00:14:31,423	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	To it
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:35,263	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	And then we have to convince them that they can't use it
EDL	00:14:35,263	00:14:36,031	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Because
EDL	00:14:36,031	00:14:37,823	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	It's probably not available as a trademark
EDL	00:14:38,335	00:14:39,103	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	So
EDL	00:14:39,103	00:14:40,383	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Sometimes we have a little
EDL	00:14:41,919	00:14:42,431	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Ceremony
EDL	00:14:42,943	00:14:43,967	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Like a grave
EDL	00:14:43,967	00:14:47,807	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Seriously we've actually done this where we we have
EDL	00:14:47,807	00:14:49,087	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	In our briefing
EDL	00:14:49,087	00:14:50,879	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Will put up a little slide
EDL	00:14:50,879	00:14:51,903	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Where it shows
EDL	00:14:51,903	00:14:58,047	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	A grave and then we'll have the code name on there almost okay now we could have a moment of silence for your code name because you can't have it
EDL	00:14:58,047	00:14:59,327	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	So you have to let it go
EDL	00:15:00,607	00:15:01,375	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	We also there for
EDL	00:15:04,703	00:15:05,983	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Name
EDL	00:15:10,079	00:15:11,359	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	So what should we name this episode
EDL	00:15:12,895	00:15:15,455	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Was going to call it what's in a name
EDL	00:15:15,455	00:15:18,527	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	I will I will slap you so hard if you call it what's in a name
EDL	00:15:18,527	00:15:22,111	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	I really will so yeah apparently everybody's use that title to talk about naming
EDL	00:15:22,623	00:15:24,927	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	And then I thought I'd go for something you know settler
EDL	00:15:24,927	00:15:25,695	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	Like
EDL	00:15:25,695	00:15:28,511	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	A rose by any other
EDL	00:15:29,535	00:15:34,911	| 99pi-0109-titletk-1 |	90% of the articles that we've been quoted in have either been what's in a name or a rose by
