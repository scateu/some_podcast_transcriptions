EDL	00:07:43,359	00:07:49,759	| 47-US-Postal-Service-Stamps |	Which also has an ingenious resemblance to the line drawing cartoons from those doctors office pamphlets that
EDL	00:07:49,759	00:07:51,807	| 47-US-Postal-Service-Stamps |	Explain how to give a self breast exam

EDL	00:07:55,903	00:07:57,439	| 47-US-Postal-Service-Stamps |	They have removed that and
EDL	00:07:58,207	00:07:59,487	| 47-US-Postal-Service-Stamps |	Put in a slogan

EDL	00:08:02,815	00:08:04,863	| 47-US-Postal-Service-Stamps |	It was a brilliant design
EDL	00:08:04,863	00:08:07,423	| 47-US-Postal-Service-Stamps |	But not all social awareness stamps are wildly
EDL	00:08:08,447	00:08:14,079	| 47-US-Postal-Service-Stamps |	I think one of the biggest examples of a stamp gone wrong as many years ago before I join the group there was a stamp
EDL	00:08:14,591	00:08:15,871	| 47-US-Postal-Service-Stamps |	Stamp Out alcoholism
EDL	00:08:16,639	00:08:20,223	| 47-US-Postal-Service-Stamps |	But unfortunately it was one of the biggest failures we ever had because
EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:21,247	| 47-US-Postal-Service-Stamps |	When the message
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:22,015	| 47-US-Postal-Service-Stamps |	It was sent to
EDL	00:08:22,527	00:08:25,087	| 47-US-Postal-Service-Stamps |	Another person that person received it and
EDL	00:08:25,599	00:08:28,671	| 47-US-Postal-Service-Stamps |	Got the impression that the sender was saying you're an alcoholic
EDL	00:08:28,671	00:08:29,183	| 47-US-Postal-Service-Stamps |	You need help
EDL	00:08:29,951	00:08:31,743	| 47-US-Postal-Service-Stamps |	And I had a phone that a friend service
EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:32,767	| 47-US-Postal-Service-Stamps |	That's tempting
EDL	00:08:32,767	00:08:33,279	| 47-US-Postal-Service-Stamps |	Not work
EDL	00:08:35,327	00:08:41,471	| 47-US-Postal-Service-Stamps |	A technology pulls us deeper into electronic correspondence and away from snail mail
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:43,007	| 47-US-Postal-Service-Stamps |	By the way the USPS
EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:44,031	| 47-US-Postal-Service-Stamps |	Has lost billions
EDL	00:08:44,031	00:08:44,799	| 47-US-Postal-Service-Stamps |	The dollars
EDL	00:08:44,799	00:08:45,823	| 47-US-Postal-Service-Stamps |	But it's trying to keep
EDL	00:08:45,823	00:08:47,103	| 47-US-Postal-Service-Stamps |	Keep up and stay relevant
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:51,967	| 47-US-Postal-Service-Stamps |	To that end in the fall of 2011 they changed one of the biggest rules governing stamp subject selection
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:54,015	| 47-US-Postal-Service-Stamps |	It used to be that
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:56,063	| 47-US-Postal-Service-Stamps |	First you have to be dead longer
EDL	00:08:56,575	00:08:57,343	| 47-US-Postal-Service-Stamps |	To be honest app
EDL	00:08:58,367	00:09:00,159	| 47-US-Postal-Service-Stamps |	And there were lots of reasons for that
EDL	00:09:00,671	00:09:03,487	| 47-US-Postal-Service-Stamps |	In the beginning it was they have to be dead 10 years
EDL	00:09:03,487	00:09:04,511	| 47-US-Postal-Service-Stamps |	They shifted that.
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:05,279	| 47-US-Postal-Service-Stamps |	The five
EDL	00:09:05,279	00:09:06,815	| 47-US-Postal-Service-Stamps |	And as most people know
EDL	00:09:06,815	00:09:09,631	| 47-US-Postal-Service-Stamps |	They've just shifted that to even living people can be on
EDL	00:09:09,631	00:09:10,143	| 47-US-Postal-Service-Stamps |	Stamps
EDL	00:09:11,167	00:09:12,959	| 47-US-Postal-Service-Stamps |	Now you have to start looking and saying
EDL	00:09:13,983	00:09:15,007	| 47-US-Postal-Service-Stamps |	Who's the first one
EDL	00:09:16,031	00:09:18,335	| 47-US-Postal-Service-Stamps |	I had a feeling Terry knew the answer to that one
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:19,871	| 47-US-Postal-Service-Stamps |	Yes I do
EDL	00:09:20,895	00:09:22,175	| 47-US-Postal-Service-Stamps |	But I'm not at Liberty to say
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:27,295	| 47-US-Postal-Service-Stamps |	It will not be Lady Gaga
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:30,111	| 47-US-Postal-Service-Stamps |	Seat when the USPS change the deceased
EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:32,415	| 47-US-Postal-Service-Stamps |	Subject rule to allow living people on stamps
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:35,743	| 47-US-Postal-Service-Stamps |	They asked the public to nominate someone for the first living Sam
EDL	00:09:35,743	00:09:38,303	| 47-US-Postal-Service-Stamps |	Tragically nominations were accepted online
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:39,839	| 47-US-Postal-Service-Stamps |	No stamps required
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:43,423	| 47-US-Postal-Service-Stamps |	And besides Bob Dylan at the time living Steve Jobs
EDL	00:09:43,423	00:09:45,983	| 47-US-Postal-Service-Stamps |	Lady Gaga was right there near the top of the list
EDL	00:09:46,751	00:09:48,287	| 47-US-Postal-Service-Stamps |	Well you get what you ask for
EDL	00:09:49,567	00:09:51,103	| 47-US-Postal-Service-Stamps |	Not that Lady Gaga's bad II
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:52,127	| 47-US-Postal-Service-Stamps |	I love her music

EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:05,183	| 47-US-Postal-Service-Stamps |	Get Lady Gaga fans to buy stamps
EDL	00:10:05,183	00:10:08,255	| 47-US-Postal-Service-Stamps |	It will not be Lady Gaga
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:09,791	| 47-US-Postal-Service-Stamps |	For the people who design stamps
EDL	00:10:10,303	00:10:11,327	| 47-US-Postal-Service-Stamps |	Sure they want you to buy it
