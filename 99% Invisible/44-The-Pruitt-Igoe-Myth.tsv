EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:11,263	| 44-The-Pruitt-Igoe-Myth |	And so St Louis was undergoing the same process where they just had the crowds and crowds of people coming into the city
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:15,871	| 44-The-Pruitt-Igoe-Myth |	And so the idea was well we need to find a place to put all of these new people

EDL	00:08:51,199	00:08:53,503	| 44-The-Pruitt-Igoe-Myth |	And this process was aided by the exact
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:59,135	| 44-The-Pruitt-Igoe-Myth |	Same 1949 Federal Housing Act that offered federally underwritten loans to buy houses

EDL	00:09:00,671	00:09:02,463	| 44-The-Pruitt-Igoe-Myth |	I really started to see
EDL	00:09:02,463	00:09:06,559	| 44-The-Pruitt-Igoe-Myth |	A population's dip pruitt-igoe was undercut by the very law that created

EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:13,727	| 44-The-Pruitt-Igoe-Myth |	And that Trend continues to this day
EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:18,335	| 44-The-Pruitt-Igoe-Myth |	What happens if you build this massive project to house all these people were coming into the city
EDL	00:09:18,847	00:09:23,199	| 44-The-Pruitt-Igoe-Myth |	And when those people don't come and the people who you attended to
EDL	00:09:23,199	00:09:24,735	| 44-The-Pruitt-Igoe-Myth |	Be letting their move out
EDL	00:09:24,735	00:09:26,271	| 44-The-Pruitt-Igoe-Myth |	All the sudden you have a vacancy
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:27,807	| 44-The-Pruitt-Igoe-Myth |	Crisis and that's really what

EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:34,207	| 44-The-Pruitt-Igoe-Myth |	So given that the major architectural or design flaw that chat attributes
EDL	00:09:34,207	00:09:35,743	| 44-The-Pruitt-Igoe-Myth |	Am I the pruitt-igoe was
EDL	00:09:36,255	00:09:38,047	| 44-The-Pruitt-Igoe-Myth |	Sheer scale of the project
EDL	00:09:38,047	00:09:39,839	| 44-The-Pruitt-Igoe-Myth |	It was built so big
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:43,935	| 44-The-Pruitt-Igoe-Myth |	And they're just simply weren't enough people to populate it by the 1970
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:48,543	| 44-The-Pruitt-Igoe-Myth |	But it's something that is very difficult to predict as well
EDL	00:09:48,543	00:09:50,335	| 44-The-Pruitt-Igoe-Myth |	The scale Dune pruitt-igoe from
EDL	00:09:50,335	00:09:55,199	| 44-The-Pruitt-Igoe-Myth |	Start the high vacancy rate meant that the Housing Authority couldn't collect enough money to pay the main

EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:08,255	| 44-The-Pruitt-Igoe-Myth |	Everything just got worse and worse
EDL	00:10:11,327	00:10:12,863	| 44-The-Pruitt-Igoe-Myth |	I mean often like to say that
EDL	00:10:12,863	00:10:14,143	| 44-The-Pruitt-Igoe-Myth |	Pruitt-igoe is
EDL	00:10:14,143	00:10:14,911	| 44-The-Pruitt-Igoe-Myth |	An easy scapegoat
EDL	00:10:15,423	00:10:16,959	| 44-The-Pruitt-Igoe-Myth |	It's high rise
EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:17,983	| 44-The-Pruitt-Igoe-Myth |	Sending that something in

EDL	00:10:20,287	00:10:22,079	| 44-The-Pruitt-Igoe-Myth |	Is viewed negatively in some circles
EDL	00:10:22,591	00:10:23,615	| 44-The-Pruitt-Igoe-Myth |	It's public housing

EDL	00:10:24,895	00:10:25,663	| 44-The-Pruitt-Igoe-Myth |	Can housing
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:28,223	| 44-The-Pruitt-Igoe-Myth |	And it's demographics are
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:29,503	| 44-The-Pruitt-Igoe-Myth |	Extraordinary
EDL	00:10:29,503	00:10:31,807	| 44-The-Pruitt-Igoe-Myth |	And almost 100% black
EDL	00:10:31,807	00:10:32,575	| 44-The-Pruitt-Igoe-Myth |	And so
EDL	00:10:33,087	00:10:34,623	| 44-The-Pruitt-Igoe-Myth |	What I like to do when discussing
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:38,975	| 44-The-Pruitt-Igoe-Myth |	Pruitt-igoe is to try to like think about a different scenario
EDL	00:10:38,975	00:10:42,047	| 44-The-Pruitt-Igoe-Myth |	And conveniently that scenario happened across the street

EDL	00:10:43,583	00:10:44,607	| 44-The-Pruitt-Igoe-Myth |	In the late 1960
EDL	00:10:45,375	00:10:46,655	| 44-The-Pruitt-Igoe-Myth |	And you were too

EDL	00:10:56,639	00:10:57,407	| 44-The-Pruitt-Igoe-Myth |	That exists across
EDL	00:10:58,431	00:11:00,223	| 44-The-Pruitt-Igoe-Myth |	What you would see would be

EDL	00:11:02,015	00:11:03,551	| 44-The-Pruitt-Igoe-Myth |	You would see the same

EDL	00:11:11,999	00:11:16,607	| 44-The-Pruitt-Igoe-Myth |	And oftentimes you'd actually see higher crime rates in the surrounding neighborhoods and you saw pruitt-igoe
EDL	00:11:16,607	00:11:23,007	| 44-The-Pruitt-Igoe-Myth |	And no one really ever talks about those low-rise private Market houses that existed around crude I get with all
