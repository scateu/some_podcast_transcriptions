EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:58,111	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	And because there was no Central list of who had attended
EDL	00:08:58,111	00:09:01,439	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	They distributed questionnaires to hundreds of Legion Post

EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:15,263	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	And through all this research it became clear early on that this was not the major flu pandemic that some had feared

EDL	00:09:33,951	00:09:35,743	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	And it increase the fear

EDL	00:10:08,511	00:10:12,607	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	Perhaps this iconic landmark of the city was the Killer
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:18,239	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	Investigators flagged it in the reports and it didn't take long for this to become a media Frenzy

EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:30,687	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	Because
EDL	00:11:31,199	00:11:32,479	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	There were rooms available
EDL	00:11:32,991	00:11:34,527	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	And we got a good price

EDL	00:12:20,863	00:12:21,631	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	First
EDL	00:12:21,631	00:12:24,703	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	The more time people spend in the lobby of the hotel
EDL	00:12:24,703	00:12:27,263	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	The more at risk they were for Contracting the disease
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:28,543	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	And second
EDL	00:12:28,543	00:12:32,383	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	The more time people spent just outside the hotel on the sidewalk
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:33,151	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	The greater the risk
EDL	00:12:33,919	00:12:38,527	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	Even some people who had nothing to do with a hotel or the convention had gotten sick
EDL	00:12:38,527	00:12:41,087	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	If they spent time on the sidewalk
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:47,487	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	None of David Fraser staff became ill while staying in the hotel but they also couldn't figure out what it was about the place
EDL	00:12:47,487	00:12:49,279	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	Forgotten everyone else sick
EDL	00:12:49,279	00:12:51,839	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	And so people's fear of the building persistence
EDL	00:12:52,351	00:12:54,143	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	And in November of 1976
EDL	00:12:54,655	00:12:57,471	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	The grand AMA Broad Street was forced to close
EDL	00:12:57,983	00:13:02,591	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	It already been in financial trouble but the outbreak was the final fatal blow
EDL	00:13:04,383	00:13:09,503	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	It was the end of an era for very elegant hotel with all kinds of memories in Philadelphia history
EDL	00:13:10,271	00:13:15,903	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	It was the final day today for the grand old Bellevue Stratford Hotel in Philadelphia battered
EDL	00:13:15,903	00:13:22,047	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	Finally done in by the fact that people died after attending the American Legion convention there
EDL	00:13:22,559	00:13:26,911	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	Vinyl party hornstein helps lock the place up
EDL	00:13:26,911	00:13:29,727	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	We had to put the chains on the door at the front door and
EDL	00:13:29,727	00:13:30,751	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	We put it around the
EDL	00:13:30,751	00:13:32,031	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	Grab handles
EDL	00:13:32,031	00:13:34,335	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	Couldn't open with a padlock
EDL	00:13:34,847	00:13:36,383	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	It was like a death sentence
EDL	00:13:36,383	00:13:39,711	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	I don't think they'll ever be out another hotel that big and bustling
EDL	00:13:39,711	00:13:41,503	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	Like that one was on Broad Street
EDL	00:13:45,855	00:13:47,647	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	Back in the CBC labs
EDL	00:13:47,647	00:13:50,719	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	Scientist continued reviewing samples and running more tests
EDL	00:13:51,487	00:13:52,767	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	Weeks went by
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:55,071	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	It was a very high pressure
EDL	00:13:55,071	00:13:56,863	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	Very frustrating
EDL	00:13:56,863	00:13:59,935	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	David Fraser and his colleagues were eventually called in to
EDL	00:13:59,935	00:14:00,703	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	To Congress
EDL	00:14:00,703	00:14:01,983	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	To account for why they
EDL	00:14:01,983	00:14:03,263	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	Still haven't solved the miss
EDL	00:14:03,775	00:14:06,079	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	We expected to be raked over the coals
EDL	00:14:06,079	00:14:07,359	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	For failing to solve
EDL	00:14:07,359	00:14:11,199	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	Not break and we were raped over the coals it was a very unpleasant couple of hours
EDL	00:14:11,711	00:14:13,759	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	Fraser worried about morale
EDL	00:14:13,759	00:14:19,135	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	Some of the CDC scientist had spent years trying to solve other outbreaks with no success
EDL	00:14:19,135	00:14:21,951	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	Which I was afraid was going to set in with legionnaire
EDL	00:14:23,487	00:14:25,535	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	Did you think maybe it would take years
EDL	00:14:26,815	00:14:27,327	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	Yes
EDL	00:14:28,351	00:14:29,631	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	I hope
EDL	00:14:29,631	00:14:30,911	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	It would only take years
EDL	00:14:32,959	00:14:35,007	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	5 and a half months have passed since the first death
EDL	00:14:35,519	00:14:37,055	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	Around 30 people had died
EDL	00:14:37,567	00:14:38,847	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	The grand Dom had closed
EDL	00:14:39,615	00:14:41,151	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	Things were not looking good
EDL	00:14:42,431	00:14:43,967	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	And then finally
EDL	00:14:43,967	00:14:45,503	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	The CDC caught a break
EDL	00:14:46,527	00:14:52,671	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	A scientist named Joseph McDade was coming through all the biological specimens they collected from victims lung
EDL	00:14:53,183	00:14:54,463	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	And re-examining them
EDL	00:14:54,463	00:14:56,255	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	Looking for something he might have missed
EDL	00:14:57,023	00:15:02,655	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	McDade said this process was like looking for a contact lens on the floor of a basketball court
EDL	00:15:02,655	00:15:03,679	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	But then
EDL	00:15:03,679	00:15:05,471	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	Finally on December 27
EDL	00:15:05,983	00:15:07,519	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	He found that contact lens
EDL	00:15:08,031	00:15:12,127	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	In his microscope it look like a red cluster of tiny rods
EDL	00:15:12,127	00:15:15,967	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	MacDade ran tests and found these tiny rods were part of the bacteria
EDL	00:15:15,967	00:15:17,503	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	One they hadn't seen before
EDL	00:15:18,271	00:15:23,135	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	Within a few weeks they confirm that this was indeed the bacteria that it cause the disease
EDL	00:15:24,159	00:15:25,695	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	On January 17th
EDL	00:15:25,695	00:15:27,487	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	1977
EDL	00:15:27,487	00:15:28,767	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	CDC scientist

EDL	00:15:30,815	00:15:31,583	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	Fanfare
EDL	00:15:32,351	00:15:33,375	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	I was so excited
EDL	00:15:33,375	00:15:36,703	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	This was such a spec Tidings of great weight off my
EDL	00:15:37,215	00:15:37,727	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	Shoulders
EDL	00:15:38,495	00:15:40,287	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	And a great discovery
EDL	00:15:40,287	00:15:43,103	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	Very very special discovery
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:45,151	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	They called the new bacteria
EDL	00:15:45,151	00:15:46,687	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	Legionella pneumophila
EDL	00:15:47,199	00:15:49,247	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	They had found the Fatal bacteria
EDL	00:15:49,247	00:15:52,575	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	David Fraser and his colleagues went from being humiliated
EDL	00:15:52,575	00:15:53,599	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	To congratulate it
EDL	00:15:56,671	00:15:57,439	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	But wait a minute
EDL	00:15:57,951	00:15:59,743	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	Where have the bacteria come from
EDL	00:16:00,255	00:16:05,119	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	This question wouldn't be answered until a couple years after the bacteria was to
EDL	00:16:05,119	00:16:05,631	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	Discovered

EDL	00:16:11,263	00:16:13,823	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	Nearly 40 years after the outbreak
EDL	00:16:14,335	00:16:18,175	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	The Grand Hotel was restored and reopened in 1979
EDL	00:16:18,687	00:16:20,991	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	He points up to the very top of the building group
EDL	00:16:21,503	00:16:22,783	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	There are cooling towers

EDL	00:16:27,647	00:16:29,183	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	From from the hotel
EDL	00:16:29,183	00:16:33,279	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	Further explains that Legionella bacteria occurs naturally in the environment
EDL	00:16:34,047	00:16:36,095	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	Can make it hard to pin down a specific

EDL	00:16:37,119	00:16:39,423	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	But it really likes to grow in warm water
EDL	00:16:39,935	00:16:43,775	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	And one ideal environment is the warm water basins in air conditioning
EDL	00:16:45,055	00:16:47,359	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	Window systems convert warm water into

EDL	00:16:48,127	00:16:49,151	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	A produce a mess
EDL	00:16:49,151	00:16:50,175	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	As a by-product
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:51,455	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	And that Miss
EDL	00:16:51,455	00:16:53,247	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	Can come across the
EDL	00:16:53,759	00:16:55,039	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	Edge of the roof
EDL	00:16:55,039	00:16:57,087	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	And layer down the side of a building
EDL	00:16:57,599	00:17:00,671	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	One of the curious things about airflow in cities
EDL	00:17:00,671	00:17:04,511	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	If that missed carries Legionella bacteria and is inhaled
EDL	00:17:04,511	00:17:05,535	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	I can make you sick
EDL	00:17:06,303	00:17:11,935	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	That's why people who are right outside the hotel and inside the front lobby where most likely to get infected

EDL	00:17:16,287	00:17:17,311	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	Would have likely
EDL	00:17:17,311	00:17:19,359	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	Drop down the side of the hotel
EDL	00:17:19,359	00:17:20,639	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	Exposing people on the sidewalk
EDL	00:17:21,407	00:17:23,455	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	And then I hear some of these

EDL	00:17:24,223	00:17:27,807	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	Vets here it also would have been stuck into event near the ground
EDL	00:17:27,807	00:17:29,343	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	But we've right into the front lobby
EDL	00:17:29,855	00:17:30,879	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	Frozen people there
EDL	00:17:33,183	00:17:39,327	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	The air conditioning system had always been a possible culprit as a breeding ground for the Legionella bacteria
EDL	00:17:39,839	00:17:46,239	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	The CBC couldn't say for sure right away because the bellevue-stratford is cooling system have been thoroughly cleaned follow
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:46,751	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	Outbreak
EDL	00:17:47,263	00:17:49,823	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	By the time the CDC got there to get samples
EDL	00:17:49,823	00:17:52,127	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	There was no Legionella bacteria present
EDL	00:17:52,895	00:17:54,431	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	But as the years passed
EDL	00:17:54,431	00:17:57,759	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	There were more outbreaks of legionnaires in other places
EDL	00:17:57,759	00:17:59,295	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	And in those instances
EDL	00:17:59,295	00:18:01,855	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	They were able to confirm that the bacteria
EDL	00:18:01,855	00:18:02,879	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	Had come from the cooling
EDL	00:18:04,159	00:18:08,767	| 99pi-0211-thegrandedameofbroadstreet-1 |	Researchers retroactively link the bacteria to previously unsolved outbreak
