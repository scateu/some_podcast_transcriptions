EDL	00:06:55,999	00:06:57,791	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	America had inherited this old

EDL	00:06:59,583	00:07:02,399	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	It had its roots in Roman and Anglo-Saxon units
EDL	00:07:02,911	00:07:06,239	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	And then evolved over thousands of years before American independence
EDL	00:07:06,751	00:07:08,287	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	Around the same time
EDL	00:07:08,287	00:07:10,847	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	French revolutionaries were heading in a New Direction
EDL	00:07:11,615	00:07:14,175	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	Tempted to throw out their old system
EDL	00:07:14,175	00:07:15,199	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	Which I found this

EDL	00:07:34,655	00:07:37,983	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	Arguing that it would encourage trade and bring the world together
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:39,007	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	And it took off
EDL	00:07:39,519	00:07:43,103	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	By the mid-nineteenth century there was a growing adoption

EDL	00:07:45,663	00:07:50,015	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	And As the metric system spread some people in the US started to feel left out

EDL	00:07:52,319	00:07:55,135	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	They wanted the US to get with the program and officially
EDL	00:07:55,135	00:07:55,903	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	Go metric
EDL	00:07:55,903	00:07:58,207	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	The Glens of really well to scientific

EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:01,279	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	And for educators
EDL	00:08:01,279	00:08:04,095	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	It's really easy to teach turn it and send it makes a lot of sense
EDL	00:08:04,607	00:08:09,215	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	But abandoning the US customary system did not sit well with a lot of paper
EDL	00:08:09,727	00:08:11,519	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	It was tremendous resist
EDL	00:08:11,519	00:08:15,103	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	The resistance came from a few different quarters some of which overlap
EDL	00:08:15,103	00:08:16,127	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	But the most interesting
EDL	00:08:16,639	00:08:18,175	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	Was a group of

EDL	00:08:37,119	00:08:40,447	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	And at that biblical basis was Mark

EDL	00:08:42,495	00:08:44,031	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	And the architecture of that

EDL	00:18:00,831	00:18:01,343	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	Which ones
EDL	00:18:02,879	00:18:05,695	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	Yeah I thought I'd say which ones
EDL	00:18:06,207	00:18:06,719	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	Yeah I have no idea
EDL	00:18:07,487	00:18:09,279	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	Well this is how you remember it
EDL	00:18:09,279	00:18:10,047	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	A leader
EDL	00:18:10,559	00:18:12,095	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	Is a leader bit more
EDL	00:18:15,679	00:18:16,447	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	Fantastic
EDL	00:18:18,495	00:18:22,335	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	Sorry you've got the huge multinationals on one end of the spectrum

EDL	00:18:25,663	00:18:26,175	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	It's on the other
EDL	00:18:26,943	00:18:30,015	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	But you both took a lot of business caught somewhere in between
EDL	00:18:30,015	00:18:31,551	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	Which is where it gets really tricky
EDL	00:18:32,575	00:18:34,879	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	Some companies end up having to maintain
EDL	00:18:34,879	00:18:37,951	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	Two separate production lines even two separate warehouses
EDL	00:18:38,463	00:18:40,767	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	To manage all the different versions of their products
EDL	00:18:41,535	00:18:42,559	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	It's a total headache
EDL	00:18:43,583	00:18:44,351	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	Expensive to
EDL	00:18:46,399	00:18:47,935	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	So that's where we're at
EDL	00:18:47,935	00:18:53,823	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	We got a nation stretched out across a Continuum of metrication dual units and conversion confusion

EDL	00:18:56,639	00:19:02,783	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	And it's all mixed in with a serious cultural resistance to the system of measurement adopted around the world
EDL	00:19:03,551	00:19:09,183	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	This cultural resistance highlights the difficulties of introducing a new system of measurement anywhere
EDL	00:19:09,695	00:19:11,743	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	Even the average French citizen
EDL	00:19:11,743	00:19:12,767	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	Hated than you

EDL	00:19:16,863	00:19:17,887	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	The bottom line is this
EDL	00:19:18,399	00:19:21,471	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	It's really difficult to get people to change from a measurement system

EDL	00:19:26,591	00:19:27,103	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	To overcome
EDL	00:19:27,615	00:19:28,895	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	Yeah when I think about
EDL	00:19:28,895	00:19:33,759	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	Alright what's harder occupying a country conquering it and putting it under your
EDL	00:19:33,759	00:19:38,111	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	Coquille or getting a new adopter unit of weights and measures that you can do the first

EDL	00:19:43,487	00:19:45,279	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	It's even if people do it
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:50,399	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	On the face of it they're constantly converting back into the to the ghost units that are

EDL	00:19:52,447	00:19:52,959	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	How to do it
EDL	00:19:53,471	00:19:59,871	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	But resistance to the metric system in the US continues to have a subtext that goes beyond just preferring a familiar

EDL	00:20:00,639	00:20:02,687	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	Today maybe more than ever
EDL	00:20:02,687	00:20:06,527	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	Resistance to metric is about the rise of a new kind of national

EDL	00:20:07,551	00:20:10,623	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	Take the case of Sally Mitchell who you heard from earlier
EDL	00:20:10,623	00:20:13,439	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	She's the high school science teacher from upstate New York
EDL	00:20:13,951	00:20:15,743	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	Back in 2014 GMC step
EDL	00:20:15,743	00:20:19,839	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	Right into the middle of the whole metric vs. US units debate

EDL	00:20:21,631	00:20:26,495	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	It actually started out in Syracuse when the airport had gotten a new sign
EDL	00:20:26,495	00:20:32,127	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	Syracuse airport is an international airport and the old sign and display the temperature in both Fahrenheit and Celsius

EDL	00:20:34,687	00:20:38,271	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	But the Selfies option had been activated on this new sign
EDL	00:20:38,271	00:20:39,807	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	Is only showing Fahrenheit
EDL	00:20:39,807	00:20:46,207	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	So I called and they said I'll be forgot to program it let me do it'll be ready by tomorrow and I think I posted
EDL	00:20:46,207	00:20:47,743	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	Did something online it said
EDL	00:20:48,255	00:20:49,791	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	Don't you worry
EDL	00:20:49,791	00:20:51,583	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	It'll be fixed by tomorrow
EDL	00:20:52,095	00:20:58,495	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	And then the next thing you know what the newspaper with calling me and they wanted to do a story on this I said no no
EDL	00:20:58,495	00:20:59,263	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	Not a story
EDL	00:20:59,263	00:21:01,311	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	Please don't know her story on this
EDL	00:21:01,311	00:21:02,847	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	But they did a story anyway
EDL	00:21:03,359	00:21:04,639	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	And then a radio station
EDL	00:21:04,639	00:21:06,175	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	Cold and did an interview with
EDL	00:21:06,687	00:21:10,015	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	And a host of that radio show with decidedly antimatter
EDL	00:21:10,527	00:21:14,111	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	And they said do you want a teacher that wants to drill her
EDL	00:21:14,111	00:21:16,672	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	Metric agenda into people's heads
EDL	00:21:17,184	00:21:20,000	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	How dare she and things like that
EDL	00:21:20,000	00:21:22,560	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	And they were mean and they were awful
EDL	00:21:22,560	00:21:24,608	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	Next thing you know it phone calls
EDL	00:21:25,120	00:21:25,632	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	School I had
EDL	00:21:26,144	00:21:28,192	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	Threats on Facebook
EDL	00:21:28,192	00:21:29,984	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	Threats through email
EDL	00:21:29,984	00:21:33,056	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	I had people writing to me demanding that I be
EDL	00:21:33,056	00:21:34,080	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	Tired
EDL	00:21:34,080	00:21:37,920	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	Because I just wanted the sign to display Celsius again
EDL	00:21:38,432	00:21:39,968	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	It got really crazy
EDL	00:21:39,968	00:21:41,248	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	The threats were so bad
EDL	00:21:41,248	00:21:43,552	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	And I had to report that to the police
EDL	00:21:44,064	00:21:47,648	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	And I thought wow people need to get a life or something or
EDL	00:21:48,160	00:21:49,440	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	Or really
EDL	00:21:49,440	00:21:52,768	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	Why why are you doing this I'm doing this
EDL	00:21:52,768	00:21:57,632	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	For science I'm doing this for International Communication I'm doing this as an educator
EDL	00:21:58,912	00:22:03,264	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	Sometimes When Sally Mitchell talks about the metric system you get the sense she's talking about
EDL	00:22:03,264	00:22:04,800	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	A lot more than the Metro
EDL	00:22:05,568	00:22:07,104	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	People like me
EDL	00:22:07,104	00:22:08,384	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	Are starting to speak
EDL	00:22:09,152	00:22:10,432	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	And we're not going to have it anymore
EDL	00:22:10,944	00:22:14,784	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	This is not the way we are wearing intelligent Nation
EDL	00:22:14,784	00:22:20,928	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	And we want what's best for our children we want what's best for our communities around us
EDL	00:22:21,440	00:22:25,536	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	And so that's why I'm speaking up now I'm more vocal than I
EDL	00:22:25,536	00:22:26,304	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	Ever
EDL	00:22:26,304	00:22:26,816	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	Ever been
EDL	00:22:27,328	00:22:28,864	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	And I'm just not going to take it anymore
EDL	00:22:29,376	00:22:31,424	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	I'm not going to let the ignorant

EDL	00:22:37,824	00:22:41,152	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	But those antiemetic trolls that Sally had to deal with
EDL	00:22:41,664	00:22:44,480	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	She's pretty much guaranteed to have the last laugh
EDL	00:22:45,248	00:22:49,088	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	Because those customer US units inches and pounds
EDL	00:22:49,088	00:22:51,136	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	Actually defined
EDL	00:22:51,136	00:22:52,672	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	Relative to the metrics

EDL	00:22:58,048	00:23:01,376	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	They're at the grocery store they made by a gallon of milk
EDL	00:23:01,376	00:23:05,728	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	Or they're at the gas station and they buy a gallon of gas they think well
EDL	00:23:06,240	00:23:10,080	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	I'm using all of these us customary units all the time in my life
EDL	00:23:10,080	00:23:13,664	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	That must mean the United States hasn't really adopted the metric system
EDL	00:23:15,200	00:23:20,320	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	But the system that make sure I gallon of gas in Oakland is the same as a gallon of gas in Omaha
EDL	00:23:20,832	00:23:23,392	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	That system relies on Metric standard
EDL	00:23:24,160	00:23:26,720	| 99pi_0280_halfmeasure_1 |	A gallon is officially defined as
