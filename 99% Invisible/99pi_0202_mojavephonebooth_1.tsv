EDL	00:01:30,112	00:01:35,232	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	At their peak in the mid-90s there were about two and a half million payphones in the US
EDL	00:01:35,232	00:01:39,840	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Adoption of cell phones has brought that number down further and further every year

EDL	00:01:44,704	00:01:46,496	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	That is exceptionally rare
EDL	00:01:46,496	00:01:48,544	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Only four of those are left in New York City
EDL	00:01:49,824	00:01:55,968	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	After several decades these little pieces of single-use architecture just disappeared from the landscape
EDL	00:01:56,480	00:01:59,808	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	They simply weren't popular enough to justify their existence
EDL	00:02:00,320	00:02:02,880	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	But there's always an exception to the rule
EDL	00:02:02,880	00:02:04,160	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	20 years ago
EDL	00:02:04,160	00:02:08,768	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	A man discovered a phone booth in the middle of the desert that became his obsession
EDL	00:02:08,768	00:02:11,840	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	An obsession that he then passed on to the World At Large
EDL	00:02:12,352	00:02:18,496	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	From the great radio program snap judgment of Oakland California producer Joe Rosenberg tells the story of a very
EDL	00:02:19,776	00:02:20,800	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	In the middle of nowhere
EDL	00:02:34,368	00:02:35,392	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Okay
EDL	00:02:35,392	00:02:41,792	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	So the story starts out back in the mid-90s in Phoenix we're Godfrey Daniels given name is Godfrey Daniels but I

EDL	00:02:55,104	00:02:57,920	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	So as I was walking home I was kind of flipping through it and
EDL	00:02:58,432	00:02:59,200	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	What about the
EDL	00:02:59,200	00:03:02,784	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	34th page of a couple of letters to the editor and one of them mentioned
EDL	00:03:03,296	00:03:04,832	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	That there was a phone booth
EDL	00:03:04,832	00:03:06,112	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	In the Mojave Desert
EDL	00:03:06,624	00:03:10,208	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Miles and miles from a pavement just sitting by itself
EDL	00:03:11,488	00:03:12,512	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	And this for dock
EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:15,328	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Just made no sense
EDL	00:03:15,328	00:03:16,608	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	I wasn't sure they believed it
EDL	00:03:17,120	00:03:18,144	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Why not
EDL	00:03:18,912	00:03:20,192	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Well I didn't have any reason to play
EDL	00:03:20,960	00:03:22,496	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	I mean I don't know if
EDL	00:03:23,008	00:03:24,800	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	And the in the age of cell phones
EDL	00:03:24,800	00:03:25,824	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	If it's the same
EDL	00:03:25,824	00:03:27,872	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	But when you were on the desert and those days
EDL	00:03:27,872	00:03:28,640	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	You are on your own
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:30,432	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	You can call people
EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:32,992	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	So the idea that there could be this f****** puth
EDL	00:03:33,504	00:03:35,808	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Just sitting out in an uncontactable place
EDL	00:03:36,320	00:03:39,904	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	It's kind of like if somebody was on the moon you know when you can talk to somebody on the moon
EDL	00:03:42,208	00:03:44,000	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Where did he say it was exactly
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:45,024	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Nearest
EDL	00:03:45,792	00:03:46,816	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Recognizable landmarks
EDL	00:03:47,328	00:03:49,888	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	He didn't say it was a really short little paragraph
EDL	00:03:50,400	00:03:53,728	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	It was any solid information other than the number
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:03:57,056	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Okay
EDL	00:03:57,056	00:03:58,080	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Why not give it a shot
EDL	00:03:58,080	00:04:04,480	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Captain the number and it just rang and I let it ring for a long time
EDL	00:04:04,480	00:04:10,880	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	I was just imagining making a phone ring how where presumably
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:16,512	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Hear it except the coyotes but then there was also in the back your mind the thought what if
EDL	00:04:17,024	00:04:20,863	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	What if somebody's wondering why who would be out there
EDL	00:04:20,863	00:04:25,471	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Who would pick up it just really grabbed me and so
EDL	00:04:25,983	00:04:27,263	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	I hung up and then
EDL	00:04:27,263	00:04:29,567	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	I just kept thinking about it I kept thinking about it
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:32,895	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	All Night Lights was thinking about it as I fell asleep and it just it just
EDL	00:04:33,663	00:04:35,199	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Somehow got me into its clutches
EDL	00:04:35,711	00:04:38,015	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	So the next morning I called again
EDL	00:04:38,783	00:04:40,319	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	I just kind of became obsessed
EDL	00:04:40,319	00:04:44,415	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Founders of confounded all the time
EDL	00:04:44,415	00:04:47,999	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	My friend visited his house he put their arm and make them call it
EDL	00:04:47,999	00:04:54,399	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Supposed to know in the bathroom here it just said did you remember to call the Mojave Desert today
EDL	00:04:54,399	00:04:55,423	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	It turned off
EDL	00:04:55,423	00:04:57,215	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	I didn't need it because I used to call
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:04:59,007	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Many times to take
EDL	00:04:59,519	00:05:00,799	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Like how many times
EDL	00:05:01,311	00:05:05,151	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	If I was supposed to be working I was probably calling at least once an hour
EDL	00:05:05,663	00:05:09,247	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	And again this is all assuming that actually existed which I had no proof of
EDL	00:05:10,015	00:05:12,319	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Like on speakerphone or like you would
EDL	00:05:12,319	00:05:13,343	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Stop everything
EDL	00:05:13,855	00:05:16,415	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	No no no no cuz that would require explanation
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:19,743	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	I would just didn't have it and have the the phone kind of cradle against my ear
EDL	00:05:20,255	00:05:21,791	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Yeah just listening to it rain
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:24,351	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Stop it was weird
EDL	00:05:24,351	00:05:26,399	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Keep calling a number with no one on the other end
EDL	00:05:26,911	00:05:28,447	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	If he was ever pressed about it
EDL	00:05:28,959	00:05:30,751	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	It was like being a ham radio operator
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:32,543	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Little person
EDL	00:05:32,543	00:05:34,591	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Sending a signal as far as you couldn't to be either
EDL	00:05:35,359	00:05:37,151	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Wondering if another person without their
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:39,455	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Waiting to be contacted
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:41,503	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	That uncontactable place
EDL	00:05:43,295	00:05:45,087	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	So I figured I would be doing this
EDL	00:05:45,855	00:05:46,367	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Forever
EDL	00:05:46,879	00:05:48,159	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	I really didn't think anybody would ever pick up
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:51,487	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Then just one month after he started calling
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:53,791	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Just doing my daily call and
EDL	00:05:56,863	00:05:57,631	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	I got a busy signal
EDL	00:06:01,727	00:06:03,775	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Actually mastercorp that call
EDL	00:06:04,543	00:06:06,335	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	I look I look like I'm an idiot
EDL	00:06:06,335	00:06:07,615	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Because I keep saying wow
EDL	00:06:11,967	00:06:12,735	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	And
EDL	00:06:14,015	00:06:14,783	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	I thought well
EDL	00:06:15,295	00:06:16,575	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	I must have misdialed
EDL	00:06:18,879	00:06:21,183	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	So I dialed it again
EDL	00:06:21,183	00:06:22,975	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Send it was a busy signal again
EDL	00:06:28,607	00:06:33,215	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	I realized okay either something has gone wrong with the phone company here or
EDL	00:06:35,519	00:06:37,311	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	She is using imabi phone
EDL	00:06:37,311	00:06:37,823	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Right now
EDL	00:06:39,359	00:06:40,383	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	I was
EDL	00:06:41,151	00:06:47,551	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Totally hyperactive my main thing was I didn't want them to get away like I was thinking I need to catch it right when they a
EDL	00:06:47,551	00:06:52,927	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Hang up that phone so I just read and then it rang and
EDL	00:06:53,695	00:06:57,023	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Earring for five times
EDL	00:06:57,791	00:07:00,351	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	And then
EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:04,191	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	I Heard a Voice say hello
EDL	00:07:05,983	00:07:06,751	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Deadly
EDL	00:07:06,751	00:07:09,055	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Dog was only able to properly record his own words
EDL	00:07:09,567	00:07:11,103	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	This now historic moment
EDL	00:07:11,871	00:07:13,663	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	But as many times that I called
EDL	00:07:13,663	00:07:14,943	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	I had given
EDL	00:07:14,943	00:07:17,247	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Remarkably little thought
EDL	00:07:17,247	00:07:19,295	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	If anyone would say
EDL	00:07:22,623	00:07:23,135	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Hello
EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:25,951	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Are you in the Mojave Desert
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:27,487	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	She said yeah
EDL	00:07:27,487	00:07:28,255	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	I said
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:28,767	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	You are
EDL	00:07:29,535	00:07:30,047	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Okay
EDL	00:07:32,095	00:07:33,375	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Why are you in the middle of Mojave Desert
EDL	00:07:33,887	00:07:34,655	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	She said
EDL	00:07:34,655	00:07:35,679	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	I'm making my calls
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:39,519	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	And you don't have a phone
EDL	00:07:40,031	00:07:44,127	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	I got it when I looked at the transfer it was kind of funny cuz like
EDL	00:07:44,639	00:07:48,223	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	You think everything's cool if you're like and she's like
EDL	00:07:48,223	00:07:49,759	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Undermining
EDL	00:07:49,759	00:07:53,855	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Did you like cinder blocks so cool
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:07:57,951	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	End
EDL	00:07:58,719	00:07:59,999	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	She said that
EDL	00:08:00,511	00:08:02,303	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	She never heard the phone ring before
EDL	00:08:02,303	00:08:03,583	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Tell your name
EDL	00:08:04,095	00:08:05,887	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Her name's Doreen
EDL	00:08:06,655	00:08:07,679	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Brain is nice to meet you
EDL	00:08:15,871	00:08:17,663	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Was there was there any sense of disappointment
EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:22,527	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Disappointment about what
EDL	00:08:23,295	00:08:24,575	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Got it all
EDL	00:08:25,343	00:08:26,879	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Well let me put it this way, it's kind of like
EDL	00:08:27,903	00:08:30,207	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	The idea that this phone is ringing out there in the desert
EDL	00:08:31,487	00:08:31,999	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	And
EDL	00:08:32,511	00:08:33,535	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Anyone can pick up
EDL	00:08:34,303	00:08:36,095	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	But then finally someone picked up and stiff Lorraine
EDL	00:08:37,119	00:08:40,447	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Oh no no see I look at it the exact opposite way
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:42,751	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Somebody did pick up
EDL	00:08:42,751	00:08:44,287	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	And I and I had no
EDL	00:08:44,287	00:08:46,335	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	I had no right to expect any one ever would
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:48,383	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	So this was great
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:51,711	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	To hear to hear a human voice
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:55,039	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	In place of the ringing you know I mean this with this was
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:56,063	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	This was a payoff
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:08:58,111	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	It just encouraged me more
EDL	00:08:58,623	00:09:03,487	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	And the instant I hung up I kicked myself because I had forgotten to ask her what
EDL	00:09:03,487	00:09:06,303	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Probably the most important question which is where was the phone booth
EDL	00:09:06,815	00:09:07,583	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Of course
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:08,607	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Haddon Heights
EDL	00:09:08,607	00:09:10,399	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	I have no way to get in touch with her except
EDL	00:09:10,399	00:09:10,911	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Define the thing
EDL	00:09:12,703	00:09:19,103	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Soda called around doesn't sleuthing in a few months later gets his hands on the equivalent of an x marks the spot map showing
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:20,639	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	The supposed location
EDL	00:09:20,639	00:09:27,039	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	A blob that we're all set stove my friend
EDL	00:09:27,039	00:09:33,183	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	And I took off traveled all day for the Mojave Desert and this is in the middle of August and so scorching-hot just scored
EDL	00:09:34,207	00:09:39,839	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Basically as far as you could see you saw Joshua trees and then we saw this little dirt path
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:43,679	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	That was Mark Trevino danger danger warning not maintain blah blah blah
EDL	00:09:44,191	00:09:45,983	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	That was the road we were supposed to take
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:50,335	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Yeah we're just going along go along in the first I thought this is not bad at all
EDL	00:09:50,335	00:09:56,735	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	But the further along that we went the road would narrow and the thing was it the sun was going down
EDL	00:09:56,735	00:10:03,135	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	And the daytime you got these Grand huge Vistas and you kind of have a sense of where you are but when the darkness drops
EDL	00:10:03,135	00:10:09,023	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	It's just whatever you can see right in front of him and we were ring by storms there was lightning
EDL	00:10:09,535	00:10:15,935	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Almost in every direction is so then I started to think we have any kind of a problem unless we do find
EDL	00:10:15,935	00:10:18,239	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	The phone booth
EDL	00:10:18,239	00:10:21,055	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Letting people know we're really in trouble that at a certain point
EDL	00:10:21,823	00:10:25,663	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Just barely in the reach of the headlights I thought I saw a line of telephone poles
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:32,063	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	And there was a little a little jet to the left and then a little jet to the right and I brought the van
EDL	00:10:32,063	00:10:38,463	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Stop with the headlights just shining right on the Mojave phone booth
EDL	00:10:38,463	00:10:44,863	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	It was really quite a moment and it's full of holes in it there's no class it's all busted out
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:49,215	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	It's kind of a wreck you know but to me it was just it was beautiful
EDL	00:10:52,031	00:10:53,311	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	I needed to hear that phone ring
EDL	00:10:53,823	00:10:54,847	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	I needed to hear
EDL	00:10:54,847	00:10:55,871	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	What I have been
EDL	00:10:55,871	00:10:57,407	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Causing to happen
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:10:59,711	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Conference time out there so I called the
EDL	00:11:00,223	00:11:01,247	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	I called my friends
EDL	00:11:01,247	00:11:01,759	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Pager
EDL	00:11:02,271	00:11:03,551	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	And here I am
EDL	00:11:04,063	00:11:07,647	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Out in the Mojave surrounded by Joshua trees
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:09,439	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Lightning
EDL	00:11:09,439	00:11:14,303	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Desert and now that's a familiar
EDL	00:11:14,815	00:11:17,119	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Twist it was so loud
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:18,143	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	It was really loud
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:19,935	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	That was just
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:20,959	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Crazy loud
EDL	00:11:21,727	00:11:23,263	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Pray for me that was kind of D moment
EDL	00:11:23,775	00:11:24,287	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Is
EDL	00:11:25,055	00:11:26,335	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Hearing that phone ring
EDL	00:11:27,103	00:11:29,407	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	It was everything that I had been imagining when I was calling
EDL	00:11:31,199	00:11:31,711	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	For that
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:33,503	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	The story was over
EDL	00:11:34,271	00:11:35,295	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	They keep calling me
EDL	00:11:36,063	00:11:36,831	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	After all
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:37,599	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Turn up to pick up
EDL	00:11:38,367	00:11:39,391	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	That was just for him
EDL	00:11:40,415	00:11:42,207	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	I never really expected anyone else to care
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:46,559	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Until we did something which would not seem risky back in 1997
EDL	00:11:47,583	00:11:50,143	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Today is obviously very
EDL	00:11:50,143	00:11:50,655	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Barry
EDL	00:11:52,447	00:11:53,215	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Naked Juice
EDL	00:11:53,727	00:11:54,495	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	What page
EDL	00:11:55,263	00:11:59,103	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	And in those days the internet there wasn't that much on it that's why I thought that was about
EDL	00:11:59,103	00:12:00,127	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	As far as it would go
EDL	00:12:00,127	00:12:00,895	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	But yeah
EDL	00:12:00,895	00:12:01,663	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	What happened
EDL	00:12:03,199	00:12:06,015	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Next thing you know how to go to my PO box and there would be
EDL	00:12:06,015	00:12:09,343	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Clippings about the Mojave phone booth some newspapers
EDL	00:12:09,343	00:12:11,391	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	In languages that I didn't read
EDL	00:12:11,391	00:12:17,791	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	It just spread so I thought well this unexpected
EDL	00:12:17,791	00:12:19,071	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Initial visit
EDL	00:12:19,071	00:12:21,375	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	They got their this phone
EDL	00:12:21,375	00:12:27,263	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Wing out in the middle of nowhere
EDL	00:12:27,263	00:12:29,055	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	It was ringing off the hook
EDL	00:12:31,103	00:12:32,639	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	You didn't have to call anybody
EDL	00:12:32,639	00:12:33,151	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	It was just
EDL	00:12:33,919	00:12:35,711	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	As soon as you would hang up the phone
EDL	00:12:38,015	00:12:40,319	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	I was just crazy you pick it up and
EDL	00:12:40,319	00:12:42,111	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Who's the Spurs going to be
EDL	00:12:42,111	00:12:43,135	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Where are they going to be
EDL	00:12:43,135	00:12:44,927	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	And you had no idea it could be somebody from
EDL	00:12:45,951	00:12:46,975	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Vietnam
EDL	00:12:46,975	00:12:49,023	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Iran or just anywhere
EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:51,071	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Some people would call
EDL	00:12:51,071	00:12:52,607	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	And you couldn't talk to them because
EDL	00:12:53,375	00:12:54,143	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Didn't speak English
EDL	00:12:54,655	00:12:57,983	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	And again you know most of the time it wasn't about the content
EDL	00:12:57,983	00:13:00,799	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	You know you're not really saying anything it's really not the point
EDL	00:13:00,799	00:13:03,359	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	It's just it's just the connection
EDL	00:13:03,359	00:13:05,407	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	An old trucker guy called and
EDL	00:13:05,407	00:13:07,455	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	I think he just wanted to be listened to
EDL	00:13:07,455	00:13:10,527	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	He wanted to tell stories about his Trucking days
EDL	00:13:10,527	00:13:13,343	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	And I didn't have anybody to tell him to
EDL	00:13:13,855	00:13:15,391	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	How many calls did you end up taking up there
EDL	00:13:17,183	00:13:19,231	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	It would be over a hundred guaranteed
EDL	00:13:19,231	00:13:25,631	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Nan admittedly he said he shouldn't phone rang after awhile be like you get to know you get its return you get it
EDL	00:13:25,631	00:13:27,935	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Eventually had to take it off the hook so we could sleep
EDL	00:13:27,935	00:13:30,751	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	Going to put it back on the hook the next morning
EDL	00:13:30,751	00:13:33,311	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	So they can leave there wouldn't have been a way to leave
EDL	00:13:34,079	00:13:35,615	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	In silence I mean

EDL	00:16:26,879	00:16:27,903	| 99pi_0202_mojavephonebooth_1 |	And they would go
