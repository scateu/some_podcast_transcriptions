EDL	00:04:47,231	00:04:49,279	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	That's kind of funny because skateboarding
EDL	00:04:49,279	00:04:51,839	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	Was pretty dorky back when it was just getting started
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:55,679	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	The very first skateboard was called the skateboard scooter
EDL	00:04:55,679	00:04:57,215	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	And it was a scooter
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:04:58,239	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	This is Stacy Peralta

EDL	00:05:12,063	00:05:13,087	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	I just rode the board
EDL	00:05:13,599	00:05:15,903	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	And probably emulated surfing
EDL	00:05:15,903	00:05:16,927	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	And so what happened was
EDL	00:05:17,439	00:05:19,999	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	Skateboarding had a very very brief
EDL	00:05:19,999	00:05:22,047	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	Appearance in 1960

EDL	00:05:23,583	00:05:25,375	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	Skateboards were sold in toy stores
EDL	00:05:25,887	00:05:27,679	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	And skateboarding briefly became a fad
EDL	00:05:28,191	00:05:29,727	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	But then as quickly as it started
EDL	00:05:29,727	00:05:30,751	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	Died out again
EDL	00:05:30,751	00:05:31,775	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	It was like a hula hoop
EDL	00:05:32,287	00:05:33,567	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	It has come and gone
EDL	00:05:34,335	00:05:37,151	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	As a skateboard fad was receding into the distance
EDL	00:05:37,663	00:05:40,223	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	Stacy was growing up in Venice Beach California
EDL	00:05:40,735	00:05:44,831	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	Was the early 70s and Stacy was a little surf rat with long blond hair

EDL	00:05:47,903	00:05:52,255	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	Guinness friends wanted something to do what we really wanted to do was emulate surfing
EDL	00:05:52,767	00:05:54,047	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	They wanted to surf
EDL	00:05:54,047	00:05:55,327	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	On land
EDL	00:05:55,327	00:05:57,631	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	And they discovered old skateboards
EDL	00:05:57,631	00:06:01,983	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	One of my friends his older brothers at skateboarding in the very early 60s
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:06,079	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	And they had two skateboards left in their garage that they never touched
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:08,127	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	So we started riding those boards
EDL	00:06:08,127	00:06:10,175	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	Early skateboards
EDL	00:06:10,175	00:06:13,503	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	Hard clunky wheels made out of clay or Steel

EDL	00:06:31,935	00:06:33,471	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	That's basically what you could do
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:36,799	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	DC was really young like maybe 7 years old
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:39,359	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	You can remember skating for the first time
EDL	00:06:39,871	00:06:41,663	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	Even with those big clunky clay wheel
EDL	00:06:42,175	00:06:43,455	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	Little Stacy found
EDL	00:06:43,455	00:06:45,247	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	A blissful Stillness
EDL	00:06:46,015	00:06:47,807	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	It was so profound that
EDL	00:06:47,807	00:06:49,087	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	From that point forward
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:52,415	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	I needed to get back on that board and find that Stillness because
EDL	00:06:53,439	00:06:56,255	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	I'm more relaxed when I stand on a skateboard that I'm when I walk
EDL	00:06:56,767	00:07:00,607	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	What season is friends were discovering skateboards while the rest of the country was forgetting them
EDL	00:07:01,375	00:07:06,495	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	Stacy had that old board heat on Earth then his friend the garage after I wore that out there was no more boards
EDL	00:07:06,495	00:07:08,031	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	Casino that I can buy in stores
EDL	00:07:08,031	00:07:10,847	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	You couldn't buy a skateboard back then so instead
EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:11,871	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	Cece and his friends
EDL	00:07:11,871	00:07:12,895	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	Thrift store
EDL	00:07:12,895	00:07:13,919	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	And buy a pair of roller skates
EDL	00:07:14,431	00:07:16,479	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	Which had clay or metal or hard place
EDL	00:07:16,479	00:07:16,991	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	Classic Wheels
EDL	00:07:17,503	00:07:18,271	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	And maybe
EDL	00:07:18,271	00:07:20,319	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	Stacy would take the left skate and his friend would
EDL	00:07:20,319	00:07:21,087	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	Pick the right skate
EDL	00:07:21,599	00:07:24,159	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	And then cut the bases out the wheels and put them
EDL	00:07:24,159	00:07:25,183	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	Are plank of wood
EDL	00:07:25,183	00:07:28,767	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	And then ride that back and forth and back and forth and back and forth and back and forth for hours
EDL	00:07:28,767	00:07:35,167	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	And the hours that we spent doing it would be equivalent to a kid today you know jumping up and down for 8 hours in a pogo
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:38,239	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	You know every single day 7 days a week and
EDL	00:07:38,239	00:07:39,519	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	You probably goat cheese
EDL	00:07:40,031	00:07:43,359	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	Maybe we should tell this kid that there's no future in this
EDL	00:07:43,359	00:07:48,735	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	Then in the early 70s invention comes along that would revolutionize skateboarding
EDL	00:07:49,247	00:07:50,527	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	The urethane wheel
EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:55,135	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	This soft plastic will have more give to it and held the ground
EDL	00:07:55,135	00:07:57,951	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	Unlike those clunky dangerous claywheels leprosy today
EDL	00:07:58,463	00:08:02,815	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	These soft Wheels were intended for roller skaters at the dawn of the roller disco era
EDL	00:08:03,327	00:08:07,935	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	But a small company called creative urethane begin producing urethane Wheels
EDL	00:08:07,935	00:08:08,959	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	Pacifically

EDL	00:08:16,383	00:08:22,527	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	Hunter Werner skate shop and they were advertised in Surfer magazine
EDL	00:08:22,527	00:08:26,623	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	Anime summer of 1974 sales of urethane Wheels went
EDL	00:08:26,623	00:08:27,647	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	Gangbusters
EDL	00:08:27,647	00:08:29,951	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	Suddenly we had a wheel that could grip
EDL	00:08:30,463	00:08:33,023	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	And I could roll over bumps in Little Rock's
EDL	00:08:33,023	00:08:38,655	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	A little louder us to attack terrain that previously were not we were not able to attack
EDL	00:08:38,655	00:08:40,191	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	Now they could skate all surfaces
EDL	00:08:41,215	00:08:43,263	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	Greater Los Angeles was theirs
EDL	00:08:43,263	00:08:49,151	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	Claim it so that means School yards that meant in garages City buildings it was any place
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:50,943	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	Anything was rideable
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:53,247	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	But none of this was designed for us
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:53,759	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	None of it
EDL	00:08:54,527	00:08:58,367	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	These young kids were jumping fences and trespassing breaking things
EDL	00:08:58,367	00:09:00,159	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	On search of new surfaces to ride
EDL	00:09:00,671	00:09:02,463	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	They were reinterpreting the city around them
EDL	00:09:03,231	00:09:05,791	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	Finding the beauty in the pavement and the concrete
EDL	00:09:08,607	00:09:09,631	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	And then
EDL	00:09:09,631	00:09:10,655	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	In the mid-70s
EDL	00:09:11,167	00:09:12,191	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	There's a drought

EDL	00:09:44,447	00:09:45,471	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	And in Los Angeles
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:47,263	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	There a lot of swimming pool
EDL	00:09:48,031	00:09:49,311	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	And they're very

EDL	00:09:50,335	00:09:52,895	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	What we had in Los Angeles if we had the big

EDL	00:10:06,463	00:10:07,487	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	Like Keyhole

EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:23,103	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	During the drought in the 70s
EDL	00:10:23,103	00:10:24,383	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	They were all

EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:32,319	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	We're so beautifully conceived and designed and
EDL	00:10:33,087	00:10:34,623	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	We fell in love with the shape
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:37,183	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	Stacy and his friends with a hunt for pool
EDL	00:10:37,951	00:10:43,327	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	They find a house under construction or Patrol the fancy part of town where they knew they'd find the most sumptuous

EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:53,567	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	There's a little bit of old dirty water in the pool they drain it out themselves
EDL	00:10:53,567	00:10:56,895	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	Buckets they brought or trash cans a pound or eventually
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:10:59,455	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	They bring an industrial vacuum along with them
EDL	00:10:59,967	00:11:00,991	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	And then
EDL	00:11:00,991	00:11:03,551	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	Up and down the pool
EDL	00:11:03,551	00:11:05,343	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	They go so fast they could go up
EDL	00:11:05,343	00:11:06,879	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	The wall
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:09,439	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	Escape like they were surfing a wave
EDL	00:11:09,439	00:11:11,743	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	When we finally got to write swimming pools
EDL	00:11:11,743	00:11:13,023	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	And feel weightless
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:15,327	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	Like going up a vertical wall
EDL	00:11:15,327	00:11:17,119	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	Weightlessness is pretty extraordinary
EDL	00:11:18,143	00:11:20,703	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	Skateboarding became a form of choreography
EDL	00:11:21,471	00:11:24,031	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	We're trying to do as much as possible in The Limited space of the

EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:29,407	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	Here we were a bunch of Scruffy kids
EDL	00:11:29,407	00:11:35,295	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	And here we are riding in Backyard Pools and we know what we're doing is beautiful and we get to feel beautiful
EDL	00:11:35,295	00:11:37,343	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	And this beauty attracted attention
EDL	00:11:38,367	00:11:41,183	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	Back in the first wave of skateboarding in the early 60s
EDL	00:11:41,183	00:11:43,231	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	There'd been a magazine called simply

EDL	00:11:44,255	00:11:46,559	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	It went out of business from skateboarding fad died out
EDL	00:11:47,071	00:11:48,863	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	But in the mid-70s
EDL	00:11:48,863	00:11:50,143	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	The magazine came back
EDL	00:11:50,911	00:11:51,935	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	And it featured
EDL	00:11:51,935	00:11:53,471	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	Stacy and his friends

EDL	00:11:56,287	00:12:00,639	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	At that point every kid in America and all over the world wanted to get inside a swim
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:02,943	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	That was that was the Holy Grail
EDL	00:12:02,943	00:12:04,479	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	Instilled the drought
EDL	00:12:05,247	00:12:07,295	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	Really acted as a wonderful midwife
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:08,063	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	To the skateboarding

EDL	00:28:25,472	00:28:28,544	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	Was inspired by the soft bends in a Finnish Lake
EDL	00:28:29,312	00:28:33,152	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	Or maybe also was just excited about his ability to make wavy forms
EDL	00:28:33,152	00:28:36,224	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	Since that kind of became his signature in his furniture and homewares
EDL	00:28:36,992	00:28:42,368	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	Who knows maybe he was inspired by a some other curvy pool somewhere else in the world that we don't know about
EDL	00:28:42,880	00:28:45,184	| 99pi-0265-thepoolandthestream-1 |	Although didn't like to talk about his inspiration
