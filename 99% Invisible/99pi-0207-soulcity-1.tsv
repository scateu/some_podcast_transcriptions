EDL	00:13:27,423	00:13:33,567	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	And so in 1968 mckissick looks at the new field of presidential candidates and asks himself

EDL	00:16:20,735	00:16:24,319	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	The design was inspired by the planned community of Columbia Maryland
EDL	00:16:24,319	00:16:27,647	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	What which was meant to have racial diversity and a small town feel
EDL	00:16:28,159	00:16:31,487	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	Soul City had a choir 3600 acres of land
EDL	00:16:31,487	00:16:35,839	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	They hope to have a population of about 2,000 people by 1978
EDL	00:16:36,351	00:16:40,959	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	By the end of 30 years they wanted to be up to around 40000 people

EDL	00:17:00,159	00:17:01,951	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	Then you here you get all of this
EDL	00:17:04,767	00:17:05,791	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	It's a miracle
EDL	00:17:06,303	00:17:09,375	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	David seems to me was just an amazing time to be

EDL	00:17:18,079	00:17:22,943	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	We spend some time traveling and campaigning for Nixon when he ran for his second term

EDL	00:17:24,479	00:17:28,575	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	But most of mckissick time was spent at seoul City when he was here
EDL	00:17:29,343	00:17:29,855	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	She was
EDL	00:17:30,367	00:17:31,647	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	In the middle of the community
EDL	00:17:31,647	00:17:33,695	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	He was never a part of above
EDL	00:17:34,463	00:17:36,767	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	You know I didn't have his education to have a statue
EDL	00:17:37,279	00:17:37,791	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	But he was
EDL	00:17:38,303	00:17:39,071	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	He's my brother
EDL	00:17:40,863	00:17:44,703	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	Mckissick I decided on Warren County because he grown up in North Carolina
EDL	00:17:44,703	00:17:45,727	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	Estate
EDL	00:17:45,727	00:17:51,871	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	But also because black residents had left the south in droves during the Great Migration to cities of the North
EDL	00:17:52,383	00:17:56,735	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	He wanted to give Urban blacks up place in the South to return to if they want it
EDL	00:17:56,735	00:17:58,783	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	And give people who are already there

EDL	00:18:00,319	00:18:03,391	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	In order to create jobs makesex Hope was to attract
EDL	00:18:03,391	00:18:04,415	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	Industry
EDL	00:18:04,415	00:18:06,207	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	She wanted a big company like
EDL	00:18:06,207	00:18:08,511	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	General Motors to come down and build a
EDL	00:18:10,047	00:18:13,631	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	But before that can happen Soul City needed basic infest
EDL	00:18:14,399	00:18:15,935	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	Like Water and Electric
EDL	00:18:16,447	00:18:22,847	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	Soul City built-in electrical grid and partnered with a few other counties to build a huge Regional water system from a

EDL	00:18:24,127	00:18:26,687	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	Between 74 and 76

EDL	00:18:38,975	00:18:39,743	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	How many C
EDL	00:18:39,743	00:18:40,767	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	They build a health clinic
EDL	00:18:41,279	00:18:43,071	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	Elko public swimming pool
EDL	00:18:43,839	00:18:49,727	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	Both of which brought people from all over the county the road
EDL	00:18:50,239	00:18:51,775	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	And they built a huge sick
EDL	00:18:51,775	00:18:53,055	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	60000 Square
EDL	00:18:53,055	00:18:54,591	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	But industrial building

EDL	00:19:02,271	00:19:07,647	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	Soltech one completed in 1975 was designed by architect Harvey Gantt
EDL	00:19:08,159	00:19:14,303	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	And it was meant to be an incubator for new industry could get started and then moved bigger facilities
EDL	00:19:14,303	00:19:19,423	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	If need be but despite there being moments where I felt like real growth was happening
EDL	00:19:19,423	00:19:21,471	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	Soul city was not hitting his targets
EDL	00:19:22,239	00:19:25,567	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	By the mid-1970s the population was fewer than 200 people
EDL	00:19:26,335	00:19:29,151	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	Do small manufacturers set up in the soltec building
EDL	00:19:29,663	00:19:32,479	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	But no one that could offer a substantial number of jobs
EDL	00:19:32,991	00:19:35,295	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	Without enough residents it was hard to attract industry
EDL	00:19:35,807	00:19:37,087	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	It without the industry
EDL	00:19:37,087	00:19:38,367	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	It was hard to attract new residence
EDL	00:19:39,135	00:19:41,695	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	And then there was the problem of the name
EDL	00:19:42,207	00:19:43,743	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	And then the name
EDL	00:19:44,255	00:19:44,767	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	So
EDL	00:19:45,791	00:19:48,607	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	I meant they were people who said you should change the name
EDL	00:19:49,119	00:19:52,959	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	Have a project and though you know Floyd just refused
EDL	00:19:52,959	00:19:53,983	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	To do that
EDL	00:19:54,495	00:19:58,847	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	We have three Souls on my cell phone
EDL	00:19:59,359	00:20:02,943	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	It was a time to receive the name as being to Black
EDL	00:20:07,551	00:20:08,831	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	SolarCity was not
EDL	00:20:08,831	00:20:09,343	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	An all-black
EDL	00:20:10,111	00:20:14,207	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	In fact Gordon Carey who played an important role in the leadership was white
EDL	00:20:14,719	00:20:15,743	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	And some of the residents
EDL	00:20:16,767	00:20:18,815	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	But it could never really escape the
EDL	00:20:18,815	00:20:19,583	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	Perception
EDL	00:20:19,583	00:20:20,607	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	Being an all black

EDL	00:20:21,631	00:20:22,655	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	And in some ways
EDL	00:20:22,655	00:20:23,935	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	It never really wanted to
EDL	00:20:24,959	00:20:28,287	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	How many people over the years have said oh yeah why is it all black
EDL	00:20:28,287	00:20:30,847	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	I'm not just after an old enough to say now
EDL	00:20:31,359	00:20:34,687	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	Why not it was a multiracial community always was
EDL	00:20:34,687	00:20:35,967	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	Still got it

EDL	00:22:37,056	00:22:39,872	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	The point where the growth isn't going to come unless we have more in fast

EDL	00:22:51,136	00:22:57,280	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	10 years ago Floyd mckissick a civil rights activist set out to build a city for blacks
EDL	00:22:57,280	00:23:01,376	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	Mckissick said that in 30 years it would be home to 46000 people
EDL	00:23:01,888	00:23:08,032	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	But today Soul city is a broken dream in the government has begun foreclosure action to seize the property
EDL	00:23:18,784	00:23:20,320	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	It was forced into foreclosure
EDL	00:23:20,320	00:23:22,880	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	And most of the land at Seoul said it was sold off

EDL	00:23:33,632	00:23:36,192	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	Thrived and that was
EDL	00:23:36,192	00:23:37,984	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	A place called The Woodlands which is
EDL	00:23:37,984	00:23:38,496	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	Is just North
EDL	00:23:39,008	00:23:39,776	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	Buy Houston
EDL	00:23:39,776	00:23:42,848	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	The Woodlands was more generously subsidize from the beginning
EDL	00:23:42,848	00:23:44,896	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	And had the benefit of being on the outskirts of

EDL	00:23:47,200	00:23:49,504	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	The other twelve towns all failed
EDL	00:23:49,504	00:23:50,272	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	Meaning
EDL	00:23:50,272	00:23:51,552	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	People might still live there
EDL	00:23:52,064	00:23:54,112	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	They did not continue on autonomously
EDL	00:23:54,880	00:23:57,440	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	Some became suburbs or neighborhoods a bigger town

EDL	00:24:03,072	00:24:04,864	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	Is the primary reason for failure

EDL	00:24:11,520	00:24:13,568	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	So they were truly starting from nothing
EDL	00:24:14,080	00:24:16,640	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	Is that a strong dose of races
EDL	00:24:20,224	00:24:22,272	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	That might be the way you laugh when you ask
EDL	00:24:22,272	00:24:23,040	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	Actually want to

EDL	00:24:29,696	00:24:32,256	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	There was the investigation by Jesse Helms
EDL	00:24:32,256	00:24:33,536	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	The negative press
EDL	00:24:33,536	00:24:37,632	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	And the government play junior size was always looking over their shoulder

EDL	00:25:02,208	00:25:08,608	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	This little strip right here was built as the beginning of
EDL	00:25:08,608	00:25:12,960	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	Kind of a commercial place there were several little businesses
EDL	00:25:13,472	00:25:16,032	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	Still feels like a really rural area
EDL	00:25:16,032	00:25:17,568	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	There's a pond and some Woods
EDL	00:25:18,080	00:25:19,616	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	Few clusters of houses
EDL	00:25:20,384	00:25:23,712	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	Some of the buildings are abandoned like the health clinic
EDL	00:25:23,712	00:25:29,088	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	And this building here on the aleph this was healthco healthco
EDL	00:25:30,112	00:25:31,904	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	When we get to a new building
EDL	00:25:32,416	00:25:32,928	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	Big one

EDL	00:25:36,512	00:25:37,024	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	Failed
EDL	00:25:38,048	00:25:43,424	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	And this is the prison
EDL	00:25:44,960	00:25:46,496	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	In 1993
EDL	00:25:46,496	00:25:49,312	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	The Warren County Correctional Facility was built
EDL	00:25:49,312	00:25:52,640	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	It's a high-security prison designed to house about 800 inmates
EDL	00:25:53,152	00:25:54,432	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	And next door to the Press

EDL	00:26:21,824	00:26:24,896	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	It's not hard to see the tragic irony in this
EDL	00:26:24,896	00:26:28,224	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	Back at Jane's house I asked her and Dora's how they felt

EDL	00:26:52,032	00:26:57,152	| 99pi-0207-soulcity-1 |	It is an insult is an insult to Floyd memory is an insult to all the
