EDL	00:06:14,271	00:06:18,367	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	In 1928 Congress decided to study rivers and their basin
EDL	00:06:18,367	00:06:21,951	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	Especially the Mississippi and it's enormous basin
EDL	00:06:21,951	00:06:23,999	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	Which includes more than 30 States
EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:25,535	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	And not just study them but
EDL	00:06:25,535	00:06:26,303	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	Also changed
EDL	00:06:27,071	00:06:30,143	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	The Flood Control Act charged the US Army Corps of Engineers

EDL	00:06:40,639	00:06:42,943	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	With the Army Corps of Engineers face a dilemma
EDL	00:06:43,455	00:06:47,807	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	The river control system that they had been tasked with creating needed to be
EDL	00:06:47,807	00:06:51,647	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	Huge much bigger than anything they never built before
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:55,743	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	And I didn't want to just jump into building something until they knew it would work
EDL	00:06:55,743	00:06:58,047	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	They started constructing scale model
EDL	00:06:58,047	00:07:00,351	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	Different parts of the Mississippi River basin
EDL	00:07:00,351	00:07:02,143	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	In order to understand them
EDL	00:07:02,143	00:07:03,167	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	Hammocks at the river
EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:07,263	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	The earliest ones were ditches cut into the dirt with water running through

EDL	00:07:16,223	00:07:21,087	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	But the Army Corps of Engineers wanted a way to test the entire river system all at once
EDL	00:07:21,599	00:07:27,999	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	So in 1941 they started building a model to represent all 1.25 million square
EDL	00:07:27,999	00:07:30,047	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	Square miles of the Mississippi River basin
EDL	00:07:30,047	00:07:34,655	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	When you think of a scale model you might be thinking of something you can peer into a museum
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:36,191	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	Not so with this one
EDL	00:07:36,703	00:07:38,239	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	This would be bigger than
EDL	00:07:38,239	00:07:40,543	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	Anything they could ever fit into a display case
EDL	00:07:41,055	00:07:43,871	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	Is a jungle out there
EDL	00:07:43,871	00:07:47,967	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	The Mississippi Basin model located just outside of Jackson Mississippi
EDL	00:07:48,479	00:07:51,295	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	Is a scale replica of the entire Basin region
EDL	00:07:51,295	00:07:54,623	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	An area that spans from Appalachia to the Rocky Mountains

EDL	00:07:58,719	00:07:59,999	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	We'll have to crawl through here
EDL	00:08:00,767	00:08:04,863	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	Check I hope we don't get your equipment
EDL	00:08:07,423	00:08:10,751	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	I went out to see the model with a woman named Jamie Vaughn

EDL	00:08:13,823	00:08:15,871	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	Before it was decommissioned in the early 90s
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:18,431	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	Jenny showed me how to sneak in

EDL	00:09:12,703	00:09:15,263	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	It's hard to overstate how enormous this model is
EDL	00:09:15,775	00:09:18,079	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	Is about 2 1/2 times the size of Disneyland

EDL	00:09:22,687	00:09:24,991	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	This does not prepare you to Caesars thing
EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:27,551	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	It's awesome isn't it
EDL	00:09:28,063	00:09:30,879	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	Just also
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:33,183	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	You just can't take it all in at once

EDL	00:09:37,791	00:09:40,351	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	If you climb up this for story observations
EDL	00:09:41,119	00:09:42,655	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	There's also a water tower

EDL	00:09:54,943	00:09:55,967	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	Envisioned when they
EDL	00:09:56,991	00:09:57,503	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	Built this
EDL	00:09:58,271	00:09:58,783	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	It's just
EDL	00:09:59,295	00:10:00,063	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	Fantastic
EDL	00:10:01,087	00:10:02,879	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	Back when the model was operational
EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:04,415	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	There were little sign
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:05,695	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	For pretty much every town in
EDL	00:10:06,207	00:10:10,559	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	That would be one for Vicksburg and Rolling Fork
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:11,583	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	And all along
EDL	00:10:12,095	00:10:16,191	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	The signs are gone now but Jamie still knows the geography of this place

EDL	00:10:19,263	00:10:22,591	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	So you can go from Baton Rouge up to St Louis in about
EDL	00:10:23,103	00:10:23,871	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	10 minutes
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:33,087	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	The Army Corps of Engineers started work on the Mississippi Basin model in 1941
EDL	00:10:33,087	00:10:33,855	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	And it first
EDL	00:10:33,855	00:10:35,903	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	They faced a massive labor shortage
EDL	00:10:36,415	00:10:38,463	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	Start of the model came about during World War II
EDL	00:10:39,743	00:10:40,511	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	No labor
EDL	00:10:41,023	00:10:41,791	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	What's available
EDL	00:10:42,303	00:10:46,143	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	Everybody was off at War there wasn't troops are people here to do it
EDL	00:10:46,911	00:10:53,311	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	So they built a bill to be Camp here to supply the labor German prisoners-of-war help with every fast
EDL	00:10:53,311	00:10:54,335	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	Of the construction
EDL	00:10:54,335	00:10:57,151	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	And they did the groundwork and the
EDL	00:10:58,175	00:11:00,479	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	Typography layout and the drainage system
EDL	00:11:00,479	00:11:00,991	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	For the model
EDL	00:11:02,015	00:11:04,063	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	By 1949 the model was ready
EDL	00:11:04,831	00:11:10,975	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	Staff of 600 engineers and technicians with calibrate the model by recreating past floods in the region
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:13,023	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	Then they'd forecast new flow
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:16,863	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	They would run thousands of gallons of water through the model
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:18,143	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	Recording the waters height
EDL	00:11:19,679	00:11:20,959	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	After it was all done
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:22,239	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	Did change a few variables
EDL	00:11:23,263	00:11:26,079	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	More sandbags over here open this
EDL	00:11:26,079	00:11:28,639	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	Spillway over there they played around with the motto
EDL	00:11:28,639	00:11:31,967	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	Gathering data on how each piece of the river system
EDL	00:11:31,967	00:11:32,479	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	Affected the whole
EDL	00:11:33,247	00:11:36,575	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	Then they could use that data to come up with better plans for
EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:37,343	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	The future
EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:38,623	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	Like they did in 1950
EDL	00:11:39,391	00:11:42,207	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	When Council Bluffs in Sioux City Iowa were threatened with a
EDL	00:11:43,231	00:11:44,767	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	1952
EDL	00:11:44,767	00:11:46,303	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	The model predicted
EDL	00:11:46,303	00:11:48,351	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	Where the ladies were going over top
EDL	00:11:48,351	00:11:51,679	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	Overtop as in where the water would spill over the Levee
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:58,079	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	And so they ran the model night and day as they were fighting the flood what they were doing here it'll overtop here
EDL	00:11:58,079	00:11:59,871	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	Your put your sandbags but you working this area
EDL	00:12:00,639	00:12:03,967	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	And of a predicted stages with into tenths of a foot
EDL	00:12:03,967	00:12:07,039	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	Meaning the model mimics the actual behavior of them
EDL	00:12:07,039	00:12:08,575	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	Mississippi to Within
EDL	00:12:08,575	00:12:09,087	| 99pi-0221-america-slasttopmodel-1 |	Inches
