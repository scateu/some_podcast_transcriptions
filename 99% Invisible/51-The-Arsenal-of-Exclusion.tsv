EDL	00:03:24,288	00:03:25,056	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	A city that I
EDL	00:03:25,568	00:03:27,104	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	Love and admire very much
EDL	00:03:27,104	00:03:28,640	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	It's a wonderful place
EDL	00:03:28,640	00:03:31,712	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	But it's a city that has been honing its arsenal of exclusion
EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:32,480	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	For decades
EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:36,320	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	Baltimore was once to be invisible while building industry with Detroit was

EDL	00:03:53,984	00:03:55,008	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	Before we go
EDL	00:04:01,408	00:04:03,200	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	Where we going to go and what we're doing
EDL	00:04:05,760	00:04:06,272	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	How to get there
EDL	00:04:06,784	00:04:07,296	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	Give me a second
EDL	00:04:10,112	00:04:13,952	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	Dandy yoga and I are driving north on Greenmount Avenue in East Baltimore
EDL	00:04:14,464	00:04:19,071	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	I can't think of Green Mountain North 33rd to Cold Spring
EDL	00:04:19,071	00:04:25,215	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	As a kind of Museum of of exclusion on Greenmount Avenue North of 30
EDL	00:04:25,727	00:04:29,311	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	It's clear that Greenmount Avenue is a dividing line but
EDL	00:04:29,311	00:04:33,151	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	Between rich and poor and black and white but what's not immediately obvious
EDL	00:04:33,663	00:04:34,175	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	Is why
EDL	00:04:35,455	00:04:37,247	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	Just to give you a sense
EDL	00:04:37,247	00:04:39,551	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	As we drive north on Greenmount to our right
EDL	00:04:40,831	00:04:44,927	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	Eastside is Waverly Waverly is lower-income and around 80%
EDL	00:04:46,207	00:04:47,999	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	16% of a bachelor's degree
EDL	00:04:47,999	00:04:51,071	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	Median income is $40,000 and on the other side
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:52,607	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	On the west side or left
EDL	00:04:52,607	00:04:54,655	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	What is oakenshaw and then Guildford
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:04:56,447	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	Well to the north of that
EDL	00:04:56,447	00:04:58,751	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	A really aswan area buffered by a middle-income
EDL	00:04:59,519	00:05:00,543	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	Only about seven percent
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:06,431	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	Can 75% have a bachelor's degree in the median income is $75,000
EDL	00:05:06,431	00:05:12,831	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	And then you'll be okay as view it's not the wide Greenmount Avenue that keeps these neighborhoods apart
EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:13,855	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	Total and invisible
EDL	00:05:13,855	00:05:15,391	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	Get totally intentional
EDL	00:05:15,903	00:05:17,439	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	The teepees neighborhood sepehr
EDL	00:05:17,439	00:05:19,999	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	Demographically The Divide is very strict
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:24,095	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	And severe you can just see all these physical measures that
EDL	00:05:24,095	00:05:24,863	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	Deployed
EDL	00:05:24,863	00:05:27,167	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	To keep people from getting from one side
EDL	00:05:27,167	00:05:29,727	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	To the other Crossing Greenmount on foot is annoying
EDL	00:05:30,239	00:05:35,871	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	To crosswalks in that 1.25 Mile Stretch but what's more interesting is when we talk about the grid
EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:38,175	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	Greenmount is where the grid end
EDL	00:05:38,687	00:05:41,247	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	The grid is there in Waverly on the east side
EDL	00:05:41,247	00:05:43,039	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	Notice that on the right
EDL	00:05:43,039	00:05:46,879	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	There's the grid is 37th Street 38th Street
EDL	00:05:46,879	00:05:53,279	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	We can make a right into Waverly no problem but on our left there's no grit right it stops to notice we're heading North now
EDL	00:05:53,279	00:05:55,839	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	If we try to make a left we're going to be confronted with
EDL	00:05:55,839	00:05:58,143	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	Dead End Street Ballard
EDL	00:05:58,143	00:06:03,007	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	If they're like these security poles that you can stick in the ground
EDL	00:06:03,007	00:06:07,615	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	Oh here's a wall right there's this long row of middle-income houses on the Westside
EDL	00:06:08,127	00:06:09,663	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	What kind of a buffer against the
EDL	00:06:10,175	00:06:11,455	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	Really wealthy Guildford stuff
EDL	00:06:12,223	00:06:12,735	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	Just behind
EDL	00:06:13,247	00:06:17,855	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	Almost all of the roads dead and the houses and the few street that do go through
EDL	00:06:17,855	00:06:20,671	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	Are mostly one-way streets coming the opposite direction
EDL	00:06:20,671	00:06:21,439	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	Outon
EDL	00:06:21,439	00:06:23,487	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	Greenmount is no way for us to
EDL	00:06:23,487	00:06:23,999	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	Baguette
EDL	00:06:24,511	00:06:26,815	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	Left into open shop or Guilford
EDL	00:06:27,327	00:06:29,887	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	There has to be some way to get into the neighborhood
EDL	00:06:29,887	00:06:35,519	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	Well there is but on Guilford Eastside you really have to go out of your way to find a street that will let you in
EDL	00:06:35,519	00:06:37,567	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	Tomorrow in Guilford finally
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:39,871	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	And then once you're inside you'll notice two things
EDL	00:06:40,383	00:06:41,919	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	The houses are super nice
EDL	00:06:41,919	00:06:44,223	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	And the roads are super weird
EDL	00:06:44,735	00:06:46,015	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	The roads are winding
EDL	00:06:46,015	00:06:48,063	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	And they feel disproportionately small
EDL	00:06:48,063	00:06:51,647	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	Next to these houses giant lawn and you need a permit to park
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:53,695	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	Another interesting
EDL	00:06:53,695	00:06:54,975	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	Residential parking permit
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:56,255	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	Residential parking
EDL	00:06:57,023	00:06:59,327	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	Case you're wondering you do not need a permit
EDL	00:06:59,327	00:07:01,375	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	Spark in the less affluent Waverly neighborhood
EDL	00:07:01,887	00:07:05,727	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	But back to Guilford the weirdest thing about these roads is that it's hard to know what direction
EDL	00:07:06,751	00:07:08,799	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	And could you tell if you snore
EDL	00:07:09,311	00:07:14,943	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	Westar South Philly how to tell right I would imagine we're actually going east
EDL	00:07:14,943	00:07:16,223	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	Greenmount Avenue
EDL	00:07:17,759	00:07:24,159	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	Super Outsiders and we don't know our way around Guilford we were shunted out of the neighborhood on a one-way Street
EDL	00:07:24,159	00:07:26,207	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	Greenmount Avenue
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:30,815	| 51-The-Arsenal-of-Exclusion |	This is one of the one-way streets heading out of the neighborhood I got shall we really
