EDL	00:00:32,512	00:00:35,584	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	The great Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges once said

EDL	00:00:44,544	00:00:46,592	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	I'm a graduate student in creative writing
EDL	00:00:46,592	00:00:51,200	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	And for the past two years I taught fiction writing to undergrads at the University of Virginia
EDL	00:00:51,712	00:00:55,552	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	I assign a lot of reading but mostly it's in the form of photocopy pages
EDL	00:00:56,064	00:00:57,856	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	But don't worry The Print Shop pays for the rice
EDL	00:00:58,624	00:01:04,000	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	I don't want to force my students to buy too much but I always make sure I assign at least one physical book
EDL	00:01:04,768	00:01:06,560	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	I always try to pick something that's beautiful
EDL	00:01:07,072	00:01:11,936	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	When was the nice font a lovely page design a pleasing paper grain an intriguing cover
EDL	00:01:12,704	00:01:14,752	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Don't get me wrong the words inside matter too
EDL	00:01:15,264	00:01:18,848	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	But I think it's important for my students to have an object that accentuates
EDL	00:01:18,848	00:01:20,640	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	The pleasure of the physical act of reading
EDL	00:01:21,152	00:01:23,200	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	It's something that would hold onto after the class attendance
EDL	00:01:23,712	00:01:27,808	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	I personally caused hundreds of pages of radio scripts and recycling bin every month
EDL	00:01:28,320	00:01:30,880	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	But I would have a really hard time throwing away

EDL	00:01:36,256	00:01:37,792	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	It would feel wrong
EDL	00:01:37,792	00:01:39,840	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Like you're spitting on knowledge itself
EDL	00:01:40,608	00:01:41,888	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	It's so hard
EDL	00:01:41,888	00:01:42,656	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	To get ready
EDL	00:01:42,656	00:01:43,424	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Set up box

EDL	00:01:51,872	00:01:52,896	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	It starts with an earthquake
EDL	00:01:54,432	00:01:57,760	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Just go in the background and we zoom into kilo stick

EDL	00:01:58,784	00:02:02,368	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	It was the most Bay Area sporting event imaginable

EDL	00:02:11,328	00:02:12,608	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	The A's were in the lead
EDL	00:02:13,120	00:02:16,704	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	They won the first two games
EDL	00:02:16,704	00:02:18,752	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	And he fails to get Dave Parker
EDL	00:02:19,264	00:02:21,824	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	But just as the third game was about to kick-off
EDL	00:02:27,968	00:02:29,504	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	The TV broadcast cut out
EDL	00:02:31,296	00:02:33,088	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	When the signal came back
EDL	00:02:34,112	00:02:35,648	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	It was no longer a baseball
EDL	00:02:36,928	00:02:41,792	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	This is Cheryl Jennings on the channel 7 news room as you may have noticed our power was knocked out

EDL	00:02:46,144	00:02:52,544	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	This was the first major earthquake ever to be broadcast live on national TV

EDL	00:03:05,088	00:03:06,368	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	But this is a story
EDL	00:03:06,368	00:03:09,952	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	About what happened to the San Francisco Public Library
EDL	00:03:09,952	00:03:11,232	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	After this earthquake
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:14,048	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	And because of this earthquake
EDL	00:03:17,120	00:03:19,424	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	The library suffered a lot of damage
EDL	00:03:19,424	00:03:21,472	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Especially on the higher floors
EDL	00:03:21,472	00:03:23,776	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	So one of the things about an earthquake is
EDL	00:03:23,776	00:03:26,848	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Daily effective it is intensified the higher up you go
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:29,152	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	On the upper levels of the library
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:29,920	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Fluorescent cave
EDL	00:03:30,688	00:03:34,272	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Jason Gibbs was a new library in there but he couldn't go to work
EDL	00:03:34,272	00:03:35,552	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	For two months after the quake
EDL	00:03:36,320	00:03:37,088	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	It was too dangerous
EDL	00:03:37,856	00:03:41,696	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	He says bookshelves would collapse sideways or falling on their faces
EDL	00:03:41,696	00:03:43,488	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	And books lie in piles everywhere
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:46,304	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Like the books have been tossed around by
EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:47,584	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Some
EDL	00:03:47,584	00:03:48,608	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Angry Forest
EDL	00:03:48,608	00:03:51,424	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	No one was injured at the San Francisco Public Library
EDL	00:03:51,936	00:03:52,960	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	But the earthquake
EDL	00:03:52,960	00:03:55,264	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Dumped half a million books on the floor
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:03:57,824	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Even after 2 months of repairs
EDL	00:03:57,824	00:04:02,176	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	The post earthquake situation in the San Francisco Public Library was still pretty bad
EDL	00:04:02,176	00:04:04,736	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Library management determines the stacks weren't safe
EDL	00:04:05,248	00:04:07,296	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	And designated a new room for public browser
EDL	00:04:07,808	00:04:11,136	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Librarians curated a selection of books that they thought the public would most likely
EDL	00:04:11,136	00:04:13,184	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	And those books went in that room
EDL	00:04:13,696	00:04:16,256	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	But they realized along the way that
EDL	00:04:16,256	00:04:17,536	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Not every book was going to
EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:18,815	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	To fit in other words
EDL	00:04:18,815	00:04:22,911	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Even this window down selection of books was too large for the available space
EDL	00:04:23,423	00:04:25,727	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	They need to win it down even more
EDL	00:04:25,727	00:04:28,543	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Earthquake just happen we don't have this shelving anymore
EDL	00:04:28,543	00:04:29,567	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	We need to make space
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:30,079	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	That's
EDL	00:04:30,591	00:04:33,919	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	A reasonable thing to do if you approach it in a thoughtful way
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:36,991	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Biggest libraries do get rid of books
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:38,271	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	All the time
EDL	00:04:38,783	00:04:40,063	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Earthquake or not
EDL	00:04:40,575	00:04:45,951	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Put simply there are so many new books coming in every day and only a finite amount of libraries face
EDL	00:04:46,719	00:04:50,303	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Practice of freeing up library space is called
EDL	00:04:50,303	00:04:56,703	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Wieting if you think about it if it sounds ugly but it is a really good description

EDL	00:05:46,623	00:05:47,391	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	New copy of it
EDL	00:05:47,391	00:05:50,207	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	If it hasn't been checked out in the last 3 years I would probably consider

EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:17,855	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	These are the tricky ones

EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:47,039	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Sometimes
EDL	00:06:47,551	00:06:49,343	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Withdrawing the things that are not as though
EDL	00:06:50,367	00:06:53,439	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Although some sections according to the library guidelines are
EDL	00:06:53,439	00:06:54,719	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Generally self weeding
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:56,255	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	In other words
EDL	00:06:56,255	00:06:57,279	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	They disappear
EDL	00:06:57,279	00:06:58,303	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	How people feel
EDL	00:06:58,303	00:07:01,119	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Certain sections of the library at 10 to disa

EDL	00:07:01,887	00:07:03,679	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Books about marijuana the Bible
EDL	00:07:04,191	00:07:07,519	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	They called are probably the biggest ones I can think of
EDL	00:07:07,519	00:07:09,567	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	But for the sections that do have to get weed
EDL	00:07:10,335	00:07:12,127	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Weeding is generally a touchy subject
EDL	00:07:12,895	00:07:15,199	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	The reason why is probably already clear to you
EDL	00:07:15,967	00:07:18,783	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	People don't like the idea of books being thrown away
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:19,807	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	We like la
EDL	00:07:21,599	00:07:23,647	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Perhaps no one loves books more
EDL	00:07:24,159	00:07:24,927	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	The librarian
EDL	00:07:25,695	00:07:31,839	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	There's a part of you that just winces every time you have to remove a book I need a legal books are dear to us
EDL	00:07:31,839	00:07:34,399	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Hardy Weinberg sure has a librarian is
EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:35,935	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	To get over that a little bit
EDL	00:07:36,703	00:07:38,751	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Yes reading is normal and necessary
EDL	00:07:39,519	00:07:45,407	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	But after the 1989 earthquake the San Francisco Public Library started weeding and unusual
EDL	00:07:45,407	00:07:46,175	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Amount of books
EDL	00:07:46,687	00:07:48,223	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	The Librarians were told to move quickly
EDL	00:07:48,735	00:07:49,759	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	And I didn't use musty
EDL	00:07:50,271	00:07:52,063	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Or any sort of comprable system
EDL	00:07:52,831	00:07:58,719	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	The Librarians were ordered to go through each collection book by buck and insert a slip of paper into each
EDL	00:07:58,719	00:08:00,511	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Green yellow and red
EDL	00:08:01,023	00:08:02,815	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Green metal bucket been checked out that
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:06,399	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Yellow metal bucket been checked out in the last 2 years
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:10,495	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	And red meant it had been over two years since somebody had checked out that
EDL	00:08:11,263	00:08:12,287	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	And the read books
EDL	00:08:13,055	00:08:15,103	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	We're the ones that were
EDL	00:08:15,103	00:08:16,639	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	In potential Danger
EDL	00:08:16,639	00:08:19,199	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Danger because management had decided
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:20,223	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	At the Redbox
EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:20,991	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Had to go
EDL	00:08:21,759	00:08:24,063	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Compared to the careful consideration of musty
EDL	00:08:24,063	00:08:26,623	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	The system of the green yellow and red card
EDL	00:08:26,623	00:08:28,159	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Prices of rather blunt instruments
EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:29,695	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	It's really not the only measure
EDL	00:08:29,695	00:08:31,231	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Weather somebody is borrowed at
EDL	00:08:31,231	00:08:31,999	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Within the last
EDL	00:08:31,999	00:08:32,511	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Period of time
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:35,071	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Felt rather arbitrary
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:40,191	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	And it wasn't really clear where the red card books were going to go or if they would ever be used again
EDL	00:08:40,703	00:08:41,471	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	And json gives us a
EDL	00:08:41,983	00:08:42,751	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	For example
EDL	00:08:42,751	00:08:44,031	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	The art and music collection
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:48,127	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	The discarded books got sent to an abandoned Hospital owned by the city
EDL	00:08:48,127	00:08:50,175	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Because there was nowhere else to put them
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:52,991	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Even battle-hardened Librarians like Gibbs
EDL	00:08:52,991	00:08:55,551	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Stop the wedding was happening too fast
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:58,879	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	You had Librarians and different sections weeding furiously
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:09:00,159	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	And not really communicating with
EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:01,695	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Are the consequence
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:03,487	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Lots and lots of books
EDL	00:09:03,487	00:09:04,255	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Swirl remover
EDL	00:09:04,255	00:09:05,023	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	From the library
EDL	00:09:05,535	00:09:07,071	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	And no one quite knew how many
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:08,863	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Because no one was
EDL	00:09:08,863	00:09:09,631	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Keeping track
EDL	00:09:09,631	00:09:10,399	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	It was
EDL	00:09:10,399	00:09:13,215	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Ultimately I think a weakness of management from the top
EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:15,519	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Jason Gibbs is a pretty even-keeled guy
EDL	00:09:16,031	00:09:17,823	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	But that's a diplomatic way of saying that
EDL	00:09:17,823	00:09:19,103	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	The problems began with the
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:19,871	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	The head librarian
EDL	00:09:21,151	00:09:21,919	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	A man named
EDL	00:09:21,919	00:09:22,943	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Kenneth Dowling
EDL	00:09:23,711	00:09:26,015	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	We're going to hear it to you could be visiting the public
EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:26,527	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Library
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:28,575	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Without leaving your home
EDL	00:09:29,087	00:09:30,623	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Since this is the years leading up
EDL	00:09:30,623	00:09:31,647	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	The 1989 North
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:36,511	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	The San Francisco Public Library was starting to rethink its whole approach the books
EDL	00:09:37,791	00:09:38,815	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	The new little thing
EDL	00:09:39,327	00:09:40,095	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Call the internet
EDL	00:09:40,607	00:09:44,703	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Imagine plugging a computer like this one into any telephone in the world
EDL	00:09:44,703	00:09:46,239	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	And being able to search
EDL	00:09:46,239	00:09:48,031	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Any library in the world
EDL	00:09:48,031	00:09:51,359	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	And a big part of this pivot was when in 1987
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:55,199	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	San Francisco hired Kenneth Dowling as its new city librarian
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:09:57,247	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	San Francisco city librarian
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:10:03,391	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Kindling must make sure that two million people have access to 18 million books and other information on a limited
EDL	00:10:04,927	00:10:06,719	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Stalin was all about the internet
EDL	00:10:07,231	00:10:10,303	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Did recently published a book called the electronic library
EDL	00:10:10,303	00:10:13,887	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	In which he argued that technology was changing the way people use information
EDL	00:10:14,399	00:10:16,191	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	And therefore changing the role of librarian
EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:17,471	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	This is a clip
EDL	00:10:18,239	00:10:20,031	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Internet web world
EDL	00:10:20,799	00:10:21,311	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Uwell
EDL	00:10:21,823	00:10:22,847	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Collapses time
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:24,895	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Classes distance
EDL	00:10:24,895	00:10:25,407	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	And is clamped
EDL	00:10:26,943	00:10:30,015	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	If it sounds unremarkable not to mention a bit quaint
EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:31,295	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Keep in mind that Dowling
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:32,575	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Wisin all this stuff
EDL	00:10:32,575	00:10:34,111	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	As early as 1984
EDL	00:10:34,623	00:10:37,183	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	He certainly understood at an early stage
EDL	00:10:37,183	00:10:39,743	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	What the internet was going to do for communication
EDL	00:10:41,023	00:10:45,119	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	But there was a flip side to dowling's Visionary concept of digitally net
EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:45,631	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Worth library
EDL	00:10:46,399	00:10:49,983	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Some people felt that Dowlen had a distressing lack of concern
EDL	00:10:49,983	00:10:50,495	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Starbucks
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:52,287	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	There was a sense that
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:53,823	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	When it came to the
EDL	00:10:53,823	00:10:55,871	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Physical collections he didn't
EDL	00:10:55,871	00:10:57,663	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	You just didn't have any interest
EDL	00:10:58,175	00:11:02,527	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Dowling was also overseeing the design of a new main library for the city of Sanford
EDL	00:11:02,527	00:11:03,295	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Francisco
EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:05,855	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Which would complete his vision of the library of the future
EDL	00:11:06,367	00:11:12,255	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	The city is building a new 100 million dollar library that is wired for computers as well as television
EDL	00:11:12,255	00:11:13,535	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	This new library would have
EDL	00:11:13,535	00:11:15,071	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Twice as much space as the old one
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:18,143	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	But a big chunk of that face wasn't going to be for shelving books
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:19,679	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Instead
EDL	00:11:19,679	00:11:22,495	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Much of the library's interior was devoted to an atrium
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:23,775	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	In the middle of the building
EDL	00:11:23,775	00:11:26,847	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	We should rise 86ft to a conical glass roof
EDL	00:11:27,615	00:11:31,967	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Lots of librarians worried that this big empty Atrium wouldn't leave a lot of space
EDL	00:11:31,967	00:11:32,479	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	4 books
EDL	00:11:32,991	00:11:37,855	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	The Atrium was evidence that books were not the sole priority of this building
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:41,183	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	And darling wasn't going to let a good crisis go to waste
EDL	00:11:41,695	00:11:45,023	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Earthquake was a perfect excuse to do what he wanted to do anyway
EDL	00:11:45,535	00:11:49,119	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Shrink the physical collection before the move to the new space
EDL	00:11:50,143	00:11:53,215	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Gallons Administration started sending books to landfills
EDL	00:11:53,727	00:11:55,263	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	In the days after the quake
EDL	00:11:55,263	00:11:57,055	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Books are being sent out by the truckload
EDL	00:11:57,567	00:11:58,591	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Several times a week
EDL	00:11:59,103	00:12:00,895	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	This is not normal Library practice
EDL	00:12:01,663	00:12:03,199	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	27 librarian
EDL	00:12:03,199	00:12:04,223	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Sign a petition
EDL	00:12:04,223	00:12:06,783	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Asking Kenneth Dowling for the weeding to stop
EDL	00:12:06,783	00:12:07,551	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	But that didn't work
EDL	00:12:08,063	00:12:10,111	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	To Jason Gibbs and his colleagues
EDL	00:12:10,111	00:12:11,135	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Decided to do something

EDL	00:13:58,911	00:14:00,447	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Stop dating in 1991

EDL	00:14:14,527	00:14:17,087	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	It wasn't just a matter of nostalgia or personal preference

EDL	00:15:16,223	00:15:19,295	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	A lot the San Francisco Public Library had a very ornate
EDL	00:15:19,807	00:15:20,831	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Beautiful

EDL	00:15:36,447	00:15:38,495	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	The gorilla Librarians reached out to Baker for help
EDL	00:15:39,263	00:15:40,799	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	But now it was 1996
EDL	00:15:41,311	00:15:43,103	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	And the new library was nearing completion

EDL	00:15:50,271	00:15:53,343	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	In their email to Nicholson Baker the Librarians wrote
EDL	00:15:53,855	00:15:55,135	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	You are the only one
EDL	00:15:55,135	00:15:56,159	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Can save it now
EDL	00:15:56,159	00:15:57,951	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Part of me thought of goddesses
EDL	00:15:57,951	00:15:58,719	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Just going to catch
EDL	00:15:58,719	00:15:59,231	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Complicated
EDL	00:16:00,511	00:16:03,071	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	The time Baker was living just across the bay in Berkeley
EDL	00:16:03,583	00:16:05,631	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	So we made a formal request
EDL	00:16:05,631	00:16:06,399	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	To inspect
EDL	00:16:06,399	00:16:07,167	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	The card catalog
EDL	00:16:07,679	00:16:09,471	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Can a felon deny that request
EDL	00:16:10,239	00:16:12,031	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	So Baker sued the library
EDL	00:16:12,031	00:16:12,543	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	For access
EDL	00:16:13,055	00:16:13,823	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	To the card catalog
EDL	00:16:14,335	00:16:16,127	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Never Sue anything
EDL	00:16:16,127	00:16:18,175	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	If you can avoid it and don't Sue kleiber
EDL	00:16:19,199	00:16:21,503	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	This lawsuit took a while it was a bit of a mess
EDL	00:16:22,271	00:16:25,599	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	But it automatically classify the card catalog is a public document
EDL	00:16:26,367	00:16:27,647	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Now the library had to keep
EDL	00:16:28,415	00:16:30,975	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	And then Baker and the gorilla librarian
EDL	00:16:30,975	00:16:31,999	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Got to work
EDL	00:16:31,999	00:16:32,511	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	In secret
EDL	00:16:33,023	00:16:34,815	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	You know you can imagine this with
EDL	00:16:34,815	00:16:35,327	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Kind of
EDL	00:16:36,351	00:16:38,655	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Mission Impossible music on yes please
EDL	00:16:41,215	00:16:44,543	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	The gorilla librarian snuck into off-limits areas in the library
EDL	00:16:44,543	00:16:46,335	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	They took away books that were going to be destroyed
EDL	00:16:46,847	00:16:47,871	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	In other words
EDL	00:16:48,383	00:16:49,407	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	They stole them
EDL	00:16:49,919	00:16:56,319	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	The Gorillaz stockpiled hundreds and hundreds of library discards in their homes and their cars and their offices and

EDL	00:16:57,599	00:17:00,671	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	All in the hope that they would someday be returned

EDL	00:17:08,607	00:17:11,423	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Full of books that I had actually
EDL	00:17:11,423	00:17:12,447	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Found in

EDL	00:17:15,263	00:17:17,567	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Baker ignored the staff only sign
EDL	00:17:17,567	00:17:19,359	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	And walked right into the deselection room
EDL	00:17:20,127	00:17:21,407	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	The basement storage
EDL	00:17:21,407	00:17:22,431	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	All the places

EDL	00:17:39,583	00:17:40,095	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Car catalog
EDL	00:17:40,863	00:17:42,911	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	As a cross reference the two lists
EDL	00:17:42,911	00:17:43,935	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	It turned out
EDL	00:17:43,935	00:17:44,959	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Got a lot of books
EDL	00:17:44,959	00:17:45,471	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Books were missing
EDL	00:17:45,983	00:17:47,775	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Way more than anyone had expect
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:51,359	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Let me tell you what an opening-day celebration today
EDL	00:17:52,383	00:17:55,455	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	At last in April of 1996
EDL	00:17:55,455	00:17:57,503	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	The new main library opened its doors
EDL	00:17:58,015	00:18:00,575	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	With Panache
EDL	00:18:00,575	00:18:06,719	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Nothing less than a parachute jump into Civic Center with the man holding the symbolic key to the new library
EDL	00:18:07,487	00:18:09,279	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	And weather in may of 1996
EDL	00:18:09,791	00:18:11,327	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	About a month after the library open
EDL	00:18:11,839	00:18:14,143	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	The gorilla Librarians organize an event
EDL	00:18:14,143	00:18:15,167	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Anna Library Auditorium
EDL	00:18:15,679	00:18:19,007	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Or Baker delivered a speech stating what he had found
EDL	00:18:19,519	00:18:23,615	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Baker contended the Dowlen was responsible for a massive destruction of books
EDL	00:18:24,127	00:18:30,527	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	The systematic removal to a landfill that at least 200 thousand volumes
EDL	00:18:30,527	00:18:35,391	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Set it right there in the library itself and
EDL	00:18:35,903	00:18:37,951	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	How to get really startled people
EDL	00:18:37,951	00:18:42,559	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	The phrase that got Baker the most attention was when he called this Mass disposal
EDL	00:18:42,559	00:18:43,071	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	A quote
EDL	00:18:43,583	00:18:45,631	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Hate crime directed at the pass
EDL	00:18:46,399	00:18:47,423	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	This relate
EDL	00:18:47,423	00:18:49,983	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Set Library management
EDL	00:18:50,495	00:18:52,799	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Kind of minor dustup in san francisco
EDL	00:18:53,311	00:18:56,895	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Where did began to spread that Baker was writing another story for the New Yorker
EDL	00:18:57,407	00:18:59,711	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	One specifically about this whole weeding to buy
EDL	00:19:00,735	00:19:04,063	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	So the president of the library commission road to the New Yorker zaditor at that
EDL	00:19:04,575	00:19:06,879	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Attempted to kill the Peace by discrediting Baker
EDL	00:19:07,647	00:19:08,415	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	It didn't work
EDL	00:19:08,415	00:19:11,231	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	And Baker's article came out in October of 1996
EDL	00:19:11,999	00:19:13,023	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	It was called
EDL	00:19:13,023	00:19:14,303	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	The author versus the library
EDL	00:19:14,815	00:19:20,959	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Current New Yorker article called it the Great Book Purge climbing more than 100,000 rare and one-of-a-kind book
EDL	00:19:20,959	00:19:21,983	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Sprawled the job
EDL	00:19:23,007	00:19:25,055	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	And then things got a little out of hand
EDL	00:19:26,079	00:19:27,359	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	The library hit back
EDL	00:19:27,359	00:19:28,383	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Condemning Baker
EDL	00:19:28,383	00:19:29,407	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Accusing them of
EDL	00:19:29,407	00:19:29,919	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Hate crime
EDL	00:19:30,431	00:19:32,223	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	I'm saying that he misunderstood the problem
EDL	00:19:32,991	00:19:36,319	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	They also tried to discredit him because of some bad Matthew have reported
EDL	00:19:36,831	00:19:37,855	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	It turns out
EDL	00:19:37,855	00:19:41,183	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	One of the Guerrilla Librarians had messed up the measurements
EDL	00:19:41,183	00:19:42,463	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	The old library shelves
EDL	00:19:43,231	00:19:45,023	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	In fact the new library
EDL	00:19:45,023	00:19:46,303	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Had much more space for boy
EDL	00:19:46,815	00:19:47,327	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Turn the old one
EDL	00:19:47,839	00:19:50,399	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	It was a very bad area was very embarrassing
EDL	00:19:50,399	00:19:53,983	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Although it didn't change the fact of a library had taken so many books to the dump
EDL	00:19:54,495	00:19:56,543	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Then both side started logging into
EDL	00:19:56,543	00:19:57,311	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Tell tell each other
EDL	00:19:57,311	00:20:00,383	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Has the local and national press piled on
EDL	00:20:00,383	00:20:03,199	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	One paper compared Baker to the Unabomber
EDL	00:20:03,199	00:20:05,247	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	It was basically an analog Twitter
EDL	00:20:06,015	00:20:09,343	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	I wasn't prepared to be part of it I didn't know that
EDL	00:20:09,343	00:20:10,111	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	I was
EDL	00:20:10,111	00:20:10,879	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Getting into that
EDL	00:20:11,391	00:20:11,903	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Times of battle
EDL	00:20:12,671	00:20:13,951	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	It was really ugly
EDL	00:20:14,719	00:20:17,279	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	And even from gorillas librarian Jason Gibbs a stamp
EDL	00:20:18,047	00:20:20,351	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	The whole Wheaton controversy got a little blown out of
EDL	00:20:20,351	00:20:21,375	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Proportion
EDL	00:20:21,375	00:20:23,167	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Probably was not as
EDL	00:20:23,167	00:20:26,239	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Horrible is Nicholson Baker made it out but it was horrible enough
EDL	00:20:27,007	00:20:30,591	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Meanwhile the new library itself had already been built
EDL	00:20:30,591	00:20:33,151	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	And it was judging from the influx of visitors
EDL	00:20:33,151	00:20:33,919	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	A success
EDL	00:20:34,431	00:20:36,479	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	The charges and counter-charges fly
EDL	00:20:36,479	00:20:40,575	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Three times as many visitors stream for the doors of the new library
EDL	00:20:40,575	00:20:43,391	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Indication that some book-lovers welcome the chain
EDL	00:20:45,183	00:20:51,583	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Some of those books saved by the gorillas Librarians and boxes and lockers were transferred back into the collection
EDL	00:20:51,583	00:20:55,167	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	All the books and Jason Gibbs Department are in music made it back
EDL	00:20:55,167	00:20:57,727	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	He says that many of the other books did
EDL	00:20:57,727	00:20:59,007	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	They stayed gone
EDL	00:20:59,007	00:20:59,775	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	And many of them
EDL	00:20:59,775	00:21:01,055	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Probably got the scar.
EDL	00:21:01,567	00:21:04,639	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Nicholson Baker says he still has some of the Booksy stockpile
EDL	00:21:05,407	00:21:07,711	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Given the painful experience of the controversy
EDL	00:21:07,711	00:21:10,015	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	The library wasn't really interested in resolving them
EDL	00:21:11,039	00:21:12,319	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	What is the end of the day
EDL	00:21:12,319	00:21:14,879	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	The controversy wasn't only about what to do with old books
EDL	00:21:15,647	00:21:17,440	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	It was a debate about what books are
EDL	00:21:18,208	00:21:20,000	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Are they beautiful objects that week
EDL	00:21:20,000	00:21:21,280	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Can smell and touch and collect
EDL	00:21:21,792	00:21:26,400	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Or are they Eternal sources of knowledge accessible to everyone in The Ether
EDL	00:21:27,424	00:21:28,704	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	And it's both
EDL	00:21:29,216	00:21:30,752	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	In a given research Quest
EDL	00:21:31,264	00:21:33,056	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	You and I might want to
EDL	00:21:33,056	00:21:34,336	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Find out what is in a book
EDL	00:21:34,848	00:21:35,616	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	In the fastest
EDL	00:21:36,640	00:21:37,664	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Well nowadays it
EDL	00:21:37,664	00:21:38,688	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	It cements miraculous
EDL	00:21:39,456	00:21:40,480	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Sometimes
EDL	00:21:40,480	00:21:41,248	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	You want
EDL	00:21:41,248	00:21:46,112	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	The words sometimes you want more than the words you want the words laid out on the page
EDL	00:21:47,136	00:21:49,184	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Clearly Nicholson Baker can see dalian
EDL	00:21:49,184	00:21:49,696	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Perspective
EDL	00:21:50,208	00:21:53,024	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	The baker maintains that we shouldn't give up on the printed page
EDL	00:21:53,792	00:21:56,608	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	His argument and the public battle around it in the 90s
EDL	00:21:56,608	00:22:00,448	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Was a big reason why the San Francisco Public Library totally overhauled
EDL	00:22:00,448	00:22:00,960	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Collections
EDL	00:22:01,984	00:22:03,008	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	They made it a policy
EDL	00:22:03,008	00:22:06,848	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	But if a library branch is considering weeding the last copy of some book
EDL	00:22:07,360	00:22:10,688	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	They must send a copy to a subject specialist
EDL	00:22:10,688	00:22:12,736	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Who will decide if it can be weeded or not
EDL	00:22:13,504	00:22:14,784	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	And for the books to do have to go
EDL	00:22:15,296	00:22:18,880	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	The San Francisco Public Library develop the community redistribution program
EDL	00:22:19,392	00:22:21,440	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	To make sure the extra copies of popular book
EDL	00:22:21,440	00:22:22,976	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Bugs can live on somewhere else
EDL	00:22:22,976	00:22:23,744	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	We
EDL	00:22:23,744	00:22:25,536	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Distribute them to schools
EDL	00:22:25,536	00:22:27,328	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	City colleges in prisons
EDL	00:22:28,352	00:22:29,376	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Strangely enough
EDL	00:22:29,376	00:22:32,192	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	One of the biggest changes to the modern practice of weeding
EDL	00:22:32,704	00:22:34,752	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	It's something that kind of down on himself
EDL	00:22:34,752	00:22:35,776	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Help establish
EDL	00:22:36,544	00:22:37,824	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Online communication

EDL	00:22:40,896	00:22:43,200	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	You might want to have every book that we just
EDL	00:22:43,200	00:22:46,016	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Don't have the Shelf space for every book so either you
EDL	00:22:46,016	00:22:48,832	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Rely on somebody else's shelves to hold the book
EDL	00:22:49,344	00:22:53,440	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Some Library spell musty with an i and an e at the end instead of a y
EDL	00:22:53,952	00:22:56,512	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	For misleading ugly superseded
EDL	00:22:56,512	00:22:58,304	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Trivial irrelevant
EDL	00:22:58,304	00:22:59,072	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Or elsewhere
EDL	00:22:59,584	00:23:02,656	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Like if a copy of the book is at another Library nearby
EDL	00:23:03,424	00:23:08,288	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Jason Gibbs at the sfpl and Sharon McKellar across the bay at the Oakland Public Library
EDL	00:23:08,800	00:23:11,104	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Can now communicate with each other instantly
EDL	00:23:11,104	00:23:14,944	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	So they can share book space and make different volumes available to readers in both cities
EDL	00:23:15,456	00:23:19,296	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	And this has huge implications for what gets we did and why
EDL	00:23:19,296	00:23:20,064	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	In this respect
EDL	00:23:20,576	00:23:21,344	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Kenneth Dallas
EDL	00:23:21,344	00:23:22,624	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Was very right
EDL	00:23:22,624	00:23:23,904	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	He certainly
EDL	00:23:23,904	00:23:27,488	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Failed in terms of managing the collection by the
EDL	00:23:27,488	00:23:29,280	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Succeeded to the extent of
EDL	00:23:29,280	00:23:30,048	| 354_Weeding_is_Fundamental_pt01 |	Bringing us
