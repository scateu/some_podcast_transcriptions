EDL	00:02:36,672	00:02:38,208	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	Amazing for our time

EDL	00:02:43,584	00:02:46,144	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	Is a scene from The Rubber Soul on the Chicago River
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:48,704	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	And the reason that photo is famous
EDL	00:02:48,704	00:02:50,752	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	Are these famous enough for me but I've seen it
EDL	00:02:50,752	00:02:53,568	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	Is because the reversal of the Chicago River
EDL	00:02:53,568	00:02:56,384	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	Was an enormous engineering project that was
EDL	00:02:56,384	00:02:57,408	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	Successful
EDL	00:02:59,712	00:03:06,112	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	But you got to figure there were countless other photographs depicting similarly awe-inspiring Feats of engineering prowess
EDL	00:03:06,112	00:03:07,392	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	That we have never seen

EDL	00:03:15,328	00:03:17,632	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	Today with the story of one such failure which

EDL	00:03:20,192	00:03:22,496	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	Probably also wants included a moment

EDL	00:03:35,808	00:03:36,576	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	These men
EDL	00:03:36,576	00:03:38,112	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	A few of them in bowler hats
EDL	00:03:38,624	00:03:40,672	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	Are standing on a wide flat boat
EDL	00:03:40,672	00:03:41,184	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	With a winch
EDL	00:03:42,720	00:03:46,304	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	A chain and hook dangle down from the winch and they're holding up a

EDL	00:03:47,328	00:03:50,400	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	Boats in a narrow muddy river and it's surrounded by
EDL	00:03:50,400	00:03:53,984	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	Huge piles of broken up trees and other debris floating in the water
EDL	00:03:54,752	00:03:55,264	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	The boat's name

EDL	00:04:00,384	00:04:01,664	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	Growing up in Dallas
EDL	00:04:01,664	00:04:02,944	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	I never saw a pic
EDL	00:04:02,944	00:04:05,504	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	Pictures of things like the snagboat Dallas of Dallas
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:07,808	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	I never heard of the failed project
EDL	00:04:07,808	00:04:10,624	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	Generations of Dallas people spent their lives pursuing
EDL	00:04:11,136	00:04:13,440	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	Even though it concerns an engineering project
EDL	00:04:13,440	00:04:14,208	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	So massive
EDL	00:04:14,720	00:04:16,000	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	But it was once compared to
EDL	00:04:16,000	00:04:17,791	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	Do both the Panama Canal
EDL	00:04:17,791	00:04:19,583	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	And the Great Pyramids of Giza
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:21,631	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	This is the story
EDL	00:04:21,631	00:04:22,655	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	Deport
EDL	00:04:22,655	00:04:23,167	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	Of Dallas
EDL	00:04:28,799	00:04:31,359	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	If you know anything about Texas geography
EDL	00:04:31,359	00:04:33,919	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	You probably at least know that Dallas is not
EDL	00:04:33,919	00:04:34,431	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	Close to the ocean
EDL	00:04:34,943	00:04:35,711	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	At all
EDL	00:04:36,223	00:04:38,015	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	It's more than 300 miles
EDL	00:04:38,015	00:04:38,527	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	To the Gulf of Mex
EDL	00:04:39,295	00:04:45,695	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	That's like trying to build a port to the Pacific Ocean in Reno Nevada report to the Atlantic and Eastern Tennessee
EDL	00:04:45,695	00:04:49,023	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	But unlike Reno or Eastern Tennessee Dallas is at least
EDL	00:04:49,023	00:04:50,815	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	Located on the river that flows to the ocean
EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:51,839	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	The trinity
EDL	00:04:52,607	00:04:54,911	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	In Dallas though the Trinity is really low
EDL	00:04:55,423	00:04:55,935	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	And very narrow
EDL	00:04:56,447	00:05:02,591	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	So narrow that there are stories of Dallas's first ferry boat on the Trinity turning itself sideways to act as a bridge
EDL	00:05:03,103	00:05:04,127	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	From time to time
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:06,687	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	So the Trinity was not a great way to move
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:07,711	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	People are Farm crops to
EDL	00:05:08,479	00:05:10,271	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	But neither was the alternative
EDL	00:05:10,271	00:05:15,391	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	In the early days of Dallas in the 1840s and 1850s getting mood on a boat
EDL	00:05:15,903	00:05:18,975	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	They were in the back of a wagon getting pulled by a team of oxen
EDL	00:05:19,487	00:05:22,047	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	Railroad came to Dallas in 1872
EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:26,143	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	The railroad companies could and did raise their rates whenever they felt like it
EDL	00:05:26,911	00:05:31,519	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	Dallas leaders wanted River navigation to keep access to the outside world
EDL	00:05:31,519	00:05:32,287	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	Affordable
EDL	00:05:32,287	00:05:34,591	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	But in addition to being low and narrow
EDL	00:05:34,591	00:05:37,663	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	The Trinity River is incredibly long and winding
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:41,503	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	Even though Dallas is about 300 miles to the ocean
EDL	00:05:42,015	00:05:42,527	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	Crow flies
EDL	00:05:43,295	00:05:44,831	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	With all the trinities Meandering
EDL	00:05:45,343	00:05:47,391	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	It's closer to 700 miles River
EDL	00:05:47,903	00:05:50,463	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	The few boats that made it to Dallas from the Gulf
EDL	00:05:50,463	00:05:51,999	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	Nearly a year doing it
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:54,303	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	One of them was the aforementioned
EDL	00:05:54,303	00:05:55,327	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	Snag boat Dallas
EDL	00:05:55,327	00:05:56,095	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	Dallas
EDL	00:05:56,095	00:05:58,911	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	Which clear debris called snags out of the water
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:06:00,191	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	To make a river navigable
EDL	00:06:00,191	00:06:00,703	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	Steamship
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:04,287	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	One of the first of those was the steamboat Har-Ber
EDL	00:06:05,567	00:06:10,175	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	When the AHA Harvey Jr finally made it to Dallas in 1893
EDL	00:06:10,175	00:06:11,455	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	The city went
EDL	00:06:11,455	00:06:12,223	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	Nuts
EDL	00:06:12,223	00:06:13,247	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	There was a massive

EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:22,527	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	It turned downtown Dallas into

EDL	00:08:45,823	00:08:48,383	| 99pi-0133-portofdallas-1 |	But the part that really excited Dallas leaders
