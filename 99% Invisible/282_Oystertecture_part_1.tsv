EDL	00:01:42,400	00:01:46,496	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	But had a few blocks south and suddenly you're at the edge of the continent

EDL	00:02:04,416	00:02:05,696	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	And up until that point
EDL	00:02:06,208	00:02:09,280	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Like a lot of New Yorkers I didn't really pay that much attention
EDL	00:02:09,280	00:02:10,048	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	To the Sea
EDL	00:02:10,048	00:02:12,352	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	If I want to go to the ocean I would go to

EDL	00:02:14,144	00:02:17,472	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	But then he started noticing all these Maritime building
EDL	00:02:17,984	00:02:19,520	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Like the old Fulton Fish
EDL	00:02:20,032	00:02:22,080	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Where fishermen used to sell their catch to rest
EDL	00:02:22,848	00:02:25,152	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	I certainly was her to confront with the fact that
EDL	00:02:25,152	00:02:28,992	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	New York Manhattan is really a very buccini kind of place
EDL	00:02:30,784	00:02:33,344	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Greenberg actually writes about the ocean for a living
EDL	00:02:33,344	00:02:35,648	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	His most recent book is called American Cash
EDL	00:02:36,160	00:02:40,256	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	And he started to research the relationship between New York City and the sea
EDL	00:02:40,768	00:02:46,656	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	But then in 2012 something happened that made that relationship impossible to ignore
EDL	00:02:47,168	00:02:48,192	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Hurricane Sandy
EDL	00:02:48,192	00:02:49,728	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Crashing on shore

EDL	00:03:04,320	00:03:06,112	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Are whipping the river around
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:11,744	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Hurricane Sandy storm surge inundated neighborhoods throughout New York City
EDL	00:03:12,256	00:03:13,536	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	See water poured into the street
EDL	00:03:14,048	00:03:16,608	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Putting out apartment buildings and filling the subway tunnels
EDL	00:03:17,632	00:03:21,216	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Greenberg and his family waited out the storm in their tent floor apart
EDL	00:03:21,984	00:03:25,312	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	We sat there in the storm hit and things started to rock and roll
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:30,944	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Then everything went black Sandy knocked out power across lower Manhattan
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:35,552	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	The day after I immediately wanted to get a sense of what it was like
EDL	00:03:36,064	00:03:37,344	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	So he walked down to the water
EDL	00:03:37,856	00:03:39,392	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Passed a bunch of bars and rest
EDL	00:03:40,160	00:03:40,928	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	And when you
EDL	00:03:40,928	00:03:42,208	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Peered in the windows
EDL	00:03:42,720	00:03:45,536	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	It looked as if there'd been a horrible bar fight
EDL	00:03:45,536	00:03:47,328	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Because the water come in
EDL	00:03:47,328	00:03:49,120	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Flooded up to eight or nine feet
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:51,936	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Have thrown all the chairs and tables up in the air
EDL	00:03:52,448	00:03:57,568	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	But as he surveyed the damage Greenberg also started to notice things about his neighborhood
EDL	00:03:57,568	00:03:58,592	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	That he never had
EDL	00:03:59,616	00:04:02,176	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Turns out that Broadway and I live on Broadway
EDL	00:04:02,176	00:04:03,200	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Is it Ridgeline
EDL	00:04:03,200	00:04:05,504	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	It's the high point between east and west
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:06,784	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	And when
EDL	00:04:06,784	00:04:08,320	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Hurricane Sandy hit
EDL	00:04:08,320	00:04:09,600	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Lower Manhattan
EDL	00:04:09,600	00:04:12,160	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Safer and safer and dryer and dryer
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:13,440	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Closer You Are
EDL	00:04:13,440	00:04:14,208	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Broadway
EDL	00:04:14,720	00:04:21,119	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	He says the storm forced New Yorkers to see the relationship between their City
EDL	00:04:21,119	00:04:22,143	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Much more intimate way
EDL	00:04:22,655	00:04:24,191	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Nothing acquaints you
EDL	00:04:24,191	00:04:26,495	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	With your city's topography like
EDL	00:04:26,495	00:04:28,287	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Living in the eye of a hurricane
EDL	00:04:28,287	00:04:32,639	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	And feeling that water flow up in and rise up and literally start to swallow the city
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:40,575	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Sandy took the lives of over 100 people in the United States and cause upwards of fifty billion dollars in damage

EDL	00:04:44,415	00:04:46,975	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Are the reason why the storm was so destructive
EDL	00:04:46,975	00:04:48,255	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Has to do with climate change
EDL	00:04:49,023	00:04:53,375	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Scientists have calculated that because of sea level rise driven by climate change
EDL	00:04:53,887	00:04:57,215	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Sandy flooded in additional 27 square miles

EDL	00:04:59,775	00:05:00,799	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Then it would have otherwise

EDL	00:05:03,871	00:05:04,639	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	And there's a lesson
EDL	00:05:04,639	00:05:05,407	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	He learned
EDL	00:05:05,407	00:05:06,943	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	This is Governor Andrew Cuomo
EDL	00:05:06,943	00:05:08,479	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Speaking in the storm's aftermath
EDL	00:05:08,479	00:05:11,807	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	There's a reality that has existed for a long time
EDL	00:05:11,807	00:05:12,831	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	That we've been blind
EDL	00:05:14,367	00:05:15,391	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	And that is

EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:53,951	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Because oysters are kind of special
EDL	00:06:54,463	00:06:56,255	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	They are unique among
EDL	00:06:57,023	00:06:59,583	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Mollusks in that they build in three dimensions
EDL	00:07:00,095	00:07:01,887	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	So there really architects in a sense
EDL	00:07:02,655	00:07:04,959	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Oysters like to grow on top of other oyster
EDL	00:07:05,471	00:07:08,031	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Actually since the chemical basicness

EDL	00:07:09,311	00:07:15,711	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	And they will see directly on top of other waster so you get these aggregations these clumps that build build build

EDL	00:07:19,807	00:07:20,831	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Kind of like coral reef

EDL	00:07:34,911	00:07:37,471	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Like coral reefs they cut down on Coastal erosion
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:40,031	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	And we're home to all different kinds of fish

EDL	00:07:51,295	00:07:53,343	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	The rough texture would increase friction

EDL	00:07:58,719	00:07:59,743	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Well actually

EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:41,727	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	You could just walk down to the shore anywhere

EDL	00:09:08,607	00:09:11,423	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Oysters were sold in Street carts and Bar
EDL	00:09:11,423	00:09:12,959	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	But also fancy restaurant
EDL	00:09:13,471	00:09:15,775	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	And they were served in all different kinds of ways
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:19,871	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	I was there were lots of things they were like oyster loaves

EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:33,183	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	They were so plentiful

EDL	00:09:36,511	00:09:39,583	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Shows were burned crate lime ground up for Mortar
EDL	00:09:39,583	00:09:40,607	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Were used to pave streets

EDL	00:09:59,551	00:10:04,159	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Well nature could not produce enough oysters for the all the place

EDL	00:10:05,183	00:10:07,743	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	A lot of places it was more than the natural bed
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:08,767	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Provide
EDL	00:10:09,279	00:10:13,631	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	By the mid-1800s New York natural oyster population had been depleted
EDL	00:10:13,631	00:10:17,727	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Humans had nearly eaten the city's protective shellfish barrier out of existence
EDL	00:10:18,495	00:10:20,799	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	But that wasn't the end of oysters in New York
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:27,199	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	When I started to run out of oysters in New York city seed from the Chesapeake Bay

EDL	00:10:35,391	00:10:38,207	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Quite well and it is kind of the next launch

EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:43,071	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Need more oysters than grow there with nature you just grow some of yourself
EDL	00:10:44,095	00:10:46,911	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Oyster farming continue throughout the 19th century
EDL	00:10:46,911	00:10:51,775	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	And by the 1880s the city was producing over 700 million oysters per year
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:54,335	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	But there was a problem lurking in the water
EDL	00:10:55,103	00:10:55,871	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	4 years
EDL	00:10:55,871	00:11:01,247	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	City had been dumping industrial pollutants and sewage straight into the harbor without a second thought
EDL	00:11:01,759	00:11:07,903	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	It didn't seem to register with people that dumping raw sewage on a food supply would be unhealthy
EDL	00:11:07,903	00:11:09,695	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	It seems sort of intuitive to me
EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:13,023	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	They didn't really they didn't worry about that
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:18,143	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	That is until the early 1900's when New York was hit with deadly outbreaks

EDL	00:11:20,191	00:11:23,519	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Public Health officials were able to track the disease is back
EDL	00:11:23,519	00:11:24,031	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	The source
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:27,615	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Turned out that most of these epidemics are coming from
EDL	00:11:28,383	00:11:31,711	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	And so one by one the city started shutting down the Oyster Bay
EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:33,759	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Which was really upset

EDL	00:13:19,999	00:13:21,535	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	From an average depth
EDL	00:13:21,535	00:13:23,327	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	20 ft two places where
EDL	00:13:23,327	00:13:24,863	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Now it's more than 50 ft
EDL	00:13:25,375	00:13:27,423	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	And the bottom looks very different
EDL	00:13:27,423	00:13:29,215	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Right now our Harbor has a
EDL	00:13:29,215	00:13:31,263	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Flat Muddy Bottom
EDL	00:13:31,263	00:13:36,895	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	But you know if you were to look at say 1850 1880 this would have been
EDL	00:13:36,895	00:13:39,967	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Extremely kind of rough ER
EDL	00:13:39,967	00:13:41,759	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Three dimensional mosaic
EDL	00:13:41,759	00:13:43,295	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	This is Kate orff
EDL	00:13:43,295	00:13:46,623	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	She's a landscape architect and founder of the firm skate
EDL	00:13:46,623	00:13:47,903	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Beast in Manhattan
EDL	00:13:47,903	00:13:51,231	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	And she is the author of the new book towards an Urban Ecology
EDL	00:13:51,743	00:13:55,583	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	She also just became the first landscape architect to win a MacArthur genius award
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:14:00,703	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	An orc says that a flat Muddy Bottom just does not work well for
EDL	00:14:00,703	00:14:01,471	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Oysters
EDL	00:14:01,471	00:14:07,615	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	There's no places are very few places for oysters to grab onto and to attack
EDL	00:14:08,639	00:14:12,223	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Right now there's some oyster larvae floating around out there
EDL	00:14:12,223	00:14:14,271	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	But they don't really stand a chance
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:15,551	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Any oyster that
EDL	00:14:15,551	00:14:20,159	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Lands on the bottom of the base bed will then immediately be covered with soap
EDL	00:14:20,159	00:14:20,927	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Do we need to
EDL	00:14:20,927	00:14:27,327	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Lift those oysters off of the bay floor and we need to provide substrate for these creature
EDL	00:14:27,327	00:14:28,351	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Pictures to attach onto
EDL	00:14:29,631	00:14:33,727	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	That challenge gave orphan idea that spawned one of my favorite portmantos
EDL	00:14:34,239	00:14:35,007	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Oyster tecture
EDL	00:14:35,775	00:14:39,103	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	The concept was to build giant Nets made of fuzzy Marine rope
EDL	00:14:39,103	00:14:41,151	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	And Elevate them off the seafloor
EDL	00:14:41,663	00:14:42,943	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	They would then see the net
EDL	00:14:42,943	00:14:45,759	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Oyster larvae and let the oysters grow from there
EDL	00:14:46,271	00:14:51,647	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	So it agglomerates in the sense of becoming a mega structure at Scales up out of
EDL	00:14:51,647	00:14:53,439	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Very small organisms
EDL	00:14:54,463	00:15:00,351	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	With a relatively small architectural intervention you could have a new piece of protective interest
EDL	00:15:01,375	00:15:02,399	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	An artificial oyster
EDL	00:15:03,167	00:15:03,935	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Which in turn would
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:05,727	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Filter the water
EDL	00:15:05,727	00:15:10,079	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Slow the water and create a safer relationship with that water
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:17,247	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Kate orff debuted her oyster texture proposal in 2010 as part of an exhibit at the Museum of Modern
EDL	00:15:17,247	00:15:18,783	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Art called Rising currents
EDL	00:15:19,551	00:15:21,599	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	And it was a speculative
EDL	00:15:21,599	00:15:23,647	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Check that sparked a ton of conversation
EDL	00:15:23,647	00:15:25,439	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	But it was never actually built
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:33,119	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Did Hurricane Sandy brought new attention to sea-level rise and open new funding avenues for Coastal resilience projects
EDL	00:15:33,631	00:15:37,727	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	In 2013 the federal government launched its Hurricane Sandy rebuilding task force

EDL	00:16:00,511	00:16:03,583	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Staten Island was particularly hard hit by Hurricane Sandy
EDL	00:16:04,095	00:16:05,375	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	This is Gina worth
EDL	00:16:05,375	00:16:07,679	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Another one of the Architects from scape
EDL	00:16:07,679	00:16:09,727	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Explaining the choice of location
EDL	00:16:09,727	00:16:11,519	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	And the wave action from The Surge
EDL	00:16:11,519	00:16:14,847	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Landed right on Staten Island and really dramatically impacted
EDL	00:16:15,359	00:16:16,127	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	The plan.
EDL	00:16:16,895	00:16:21,759	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Staten Island was also one of the epicenters of New York historic oyster economy
EDL	00:16:21,759	00:16:24,063	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	So it's it's not the first time
EDL	00:16:24,063	00:16:26,623	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	That people have been trying to
EDL	00:16:26,623	00:16:29,695	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Cultivate and expand oysters within the bay
EDL	00:16:30,719	00:16:37,119	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	You know hundreds of years ago they were doing it for food production and today we're trying to do it for a more robust and resilient
EDL	00:16:37,119	00:16:37,631	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Shoreline
EDL	00:16:38,911	00:16:43,775	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	The design has evolved a lot from The Original Oyster texture Proposal with the Marine rope
EDL	00:16:44,543	00:16:48,127	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	The plan now is to build a necklace of offshore Breakwater
EDL	00:16:48,639	00:16:49,919	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Out of large Rock
EDL	00:16:49,919	00:16:52,735	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	A special material called Eco concrete
EDL	00:16:52,735	00:16:54,271	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Which shellfish like to grow on
EDL	00:16:54,783	00:16:56,831	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	They will then see the breakwaters with oysters
EDL	00:16:57,343	00:16:58,367	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	So they grow into reefs
EDL	00:16:59,135	00:17:03,999	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Much like a natural oyster Reef the living breakwaters are designed to slow down the water
EDL	00:17:03,999	00:17:06,303	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	And break up dangerous waves
EDL	00:17:06,303	00:17:07,071	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Before they reach
EDL	00:17:07,071	00:17:10,143	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	The shore as the oysters grow a really help
EDL	00:17:10,143	00:17:12,959	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Add fractions the water column and and break waves
EDL	00:17:13,983	00:17:17,311	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	The living breakwaters should reduce Coastal erosion
EDL	00:17:17,311	00:17:18,079	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Build up Beach
EDL	00:17:18,591	00:17:20,127	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	And make storms last names
EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:27,295	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Modeling by scientists at the Stevens Institute has shown that the breakwaters could have reduced the height of waves during
EDL	00:17:28,319	00:17:29,599	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	By 326 ft
EDL	00:17:30,367	00:17:33,439	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	But they won't keep flood water out of Staten Island all together
EDL	00:17:33,439	00:17:34,463	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	And they're not meant to
EDL	00:17:34,975	00:17:37,279	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Breakwater's let the water through
EDL	00:17:37,279	00:17:43,167	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	We can reduce the wave action we can reduce the intensity and the velocity of that water
EDL	00:17:43,167	00:17:44,703	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	But we live in a coastal Edge
EDL	00:17:45,215	00:17:49,311	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	And wants to design a way to make that Coastal Edge safer and healthier
EDL	00:17:49,311	00:17:51,871	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Both for humans and for marine life
EDL	00:17:51,871	00:17:54,943	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	In addition to reducing waves and filtering the water
EDL	00:17:54,943	00:17:56,991	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	The living breakwaters will provide
EDL	00:17:56,991	00:17:59,551	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Some of the habitats that oyster reefs once did
EDL	00:18:00,575	00:18:06,719	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Staten Island historical mysteries were filled with all these nooks and crannies were juvenile fish like to hide
EDL	00:18:07,231	00:18:09,279	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	With the help of marine biologist
EDL	00:18:09,279	00:18:11,071	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	The architect's design pocket
EDL	00:18:11,071	00:18:12,351	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	It's within the Breakwater structure
EDL	00:18:12,863	00:18:14,143	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	They call them Reef Street
EDL	00:18:14,655	00:18:16,191	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	So within the reef Street
EDL	00:18:16,703	00:18:20,543	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Juvenile Fisher able to come into these kind of underwater canyon
EDL	00:18:20,543	00:18:21,823	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	And feed in the street
EDL	00:18:22,335	00:18:25,151	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	And shelter and hide from predators in the structure
EDL	00:18:25,663	00:18:27,455	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Where says that as a landscape architect
EDL	00:18:27,455	00:18:28,735	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	I think your clients are usually people
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:33,087	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	But we're also trying to think about who are our underwater clients
EDL	00:18:33,087	00:18:38,719	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Who are the fish species that might use the system like
EDL	00:18:38,719	00:18:40,255	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	If you are a fish swimming in the water
EDL	00:18:40,767	00:18:42,047	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	What would look like a safe
EDL	00:18:42,047	00:18:46,655	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Play like a totally different mentality to have when designing than what a person looks for
EDL	00:18:49,215	00:18:53,055	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Construction hasn't begun yet on the physical structure of the Breakwater
EDL	00:18:53,567	00:18:56,127	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	But some of the oysters are already growing
EDL	00:18:57,919	00:19:01,759	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Nightwish is growing over here
EDL	00:19:02,271	00:19:04,319	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	This is Asia Salgado

EDL	00:19:06,879	00:19:09,183	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	On Governors Island
EDL	00:19:10,719	00:19:14,559	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	The Harbour School runs a program called the billion oyster project
EDL	00:19:14,559	00:19:17,375	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Which aims to restore oysters throughout the harbor
EDL	00:19:17,887	00:19:21,471	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	And in the process teach young New Yorkers all about the Marine

EDL	00:19:29,663	00:19:31,711	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	They're actually leftover shells from rest
EDL	00:19:32,479	00:19:34,783	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	So we'll go around and we'll collect
EDL	00:19:35,295	00:19:36,319	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Shelf
EDL	00:19:36,319	00:19:36,831	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Different
EDL	00:19:38,367	00:19:40,671	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	And on the surface of every shell
EDL	00:19:40,671	00:19:42,719	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	There are little oysters growing
EDL	00:19:42,719	00:19:45,535	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Utilities big brown dots over yeah
EDL	00:19:45,535	00:19:46,559	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Those are always
EDL	00:19:47,583	00:19:49,631	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	They look like little blobs
EDL	00:19:49,631	00:19:50,399	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Brown jelly
EDL	00:19:50,911	00:19:52,959	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	But if you get really close
EDL	00:19:52,959	00:19:55,007	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	You can see the beginnings of an oyster
EDL	00:19:55,775	00:20:00,127	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	You can try to tell on this one this one has like stripes on it that's how you know what that's like it's
EDL	00:20:00,127	00:20:01,663	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Don't shout slowly growing
EDL	00:20:01,663	00:20:04,223	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	I want to gets bigger obviously it'll look like one of you show
EDL	00:20:04,735	00:20:05,247	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	But
EDL	00:20:06,271	00:20:06,783	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Getting there

EDL	00:21:48,672	00:21:52,256	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Proactively see this is an Urban Design opportunity
EDL	00:21:52,768	00:21:53,536	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	And not

EDL	00:22:33,984	00:22:35,008	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	I certainly hope so
EDL	00:22:36,544	00:22:37,824	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	I hope so too
EDL	00:22:37,824	00:22:40,384	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Because New York is a city by the ocean

EDL	00:25:11,424	00:25:14,496	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	And then the other building and structures and buildings is sometimes
EDL	00:25:14,496	00:25:15,520	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Thought about is something that
EDL	00:25:16,032	00:25:16,800	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Separate

EDL	00:25:35,744	00:25:36,512	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	We've got to go with
EDL	00:25:37,024	00:25:38,048	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	With beavers
EDL	00:25:38,048	00:25:42,400	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	What are some of the most obvious example but they really are
EDL	00:25:42,400	00:25:43,424	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Pretty special architect
EDL	00:25:44,192	00:25:45,984	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	First of all they build PC
EDL	00:25:45,984	00:25:46,496	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Incredible houses
EDL	00:25:47,008	00:25:49,312	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	The Lodges out of sticks and mud and they've got you

EDL	00:25:52,896	00:25:56,736	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Mi amor amazingly they completely re-engineered
EDL	00:25:56,736	00:26:00,064	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	The landscape by cutting down trees with their teeth
EDL	00:26:00,064	00:26:02,368	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Damn
EDL	00:26:02,368	00:26:03,136	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Is that
EDL	00:26:03,136	00:26:05,696	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Essentially will turn you know what's a river
EDL	00:26:05,696	00:26:08,512	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	System into a peaceful Pond for them to live in
EDL	00:26:10,048	00:26:14,400	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	And and I was sort of looking into this and I found this one scientist
EDL	00:26:14,400	00:26:20,032	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Think that they've discovered the largest beaver dam in the world in Northern Alberta
EDL	00:26:20,032	00:26:22,592	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Canada and its its

EDL	00:26:27,712	00:26:28,480	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Which
EDL	00:26:28,480	00:26:31,808	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Is a larger than thin
EDL	00:26:31,808	00:26:34,368	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Yeah human dance with large gray Hoover Dam
EDL	00:26:36,672	00:26:40,000	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Set this was built in / many / like multiple generation
EDL	00:26:40,000	00:26:43,584	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Sounds of beavers Vino different families contributing to the
EDL	00:26:43,584	00:26:44,352	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Misfits mask
EDL	00:26:44,352	00:26:48,704	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Sedan to create sort of a little Beaver Paradise up there in in Alberta
EDL	00:26:48,704	00:26:49,472	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Why would think
EDL	00:26:49,984	00:26:50,752	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Generations
EDL	00:26:50,752	00:26:51,776	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Remarkable
EDL	00:26:53,824	00:26:54,592	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Switch
EDL	00:26:54,592	00:26:59,456	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	All right so moving on to Insects their tongues of great examples of Android architect
EDL	00:27:01,248	00:27:02,528	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	But I'm going to go with
EDL	00:27:02,528	00:27:03,040	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Termites

EDL	00:27:14,816	00:27:20,960	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	And and you can get your shoes they can be upwards of like 30 ft tall and mmm really why
EDL	00:27:21,984	00:27:23,520	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	He's really really really large structures
EDL	00:27:24,032	00:27:26,592	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	And if you think about that relative
EDL	00:27:27,104	00:27:27,872	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	The size of a
EDL	00:27:27,872	00:27:29,408	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	A termites body it's like
EDL	00:27:29,408	00:27:31,712	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Even more impressive
EDL	00:27:31,712	00:27:32,736	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Tall structure
EDL	00:27:33,248	00:27:35,552	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Interino for a termite that's
EDL	00:27:36,064	00:27:37,600	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	If you serve scale that up
EDL	00:27:37,600	00:27:38,368	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	2R size
EDL	00:27:38,880	00:27:42,976	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	It would be something like close to a mile high so they really are
EDL	00:27:42,976	00:27:43,488	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Building
EDL	00:27:44,000	00:27:44,768	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Incredible
EDL	00:27:44,768	00:27:46,816	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Dylan Sprayberry
EDL	00:27:46,816	00:27:48,608	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	My favorite thing about
EDL	00:27:48,608	00:27:49,888	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Termite Mounds really does
EDL	00:27:49,888	00:27:50,912	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	They exist
EDL	00:27:50,912	00:27:53,216	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Really to provide ventilation
EDL	00:27:53,216	00:27:53,984	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	2
EDL	00:27:53,984	00:27:58,592	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	The termite colonies The Colony exists even under ground and spreads out beneath
EDL	00:27:58,592	00:28:00,640	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	You know over a greater distance than it's just
EDL	00:28:01,152	00:28:01,664	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	The termite Mound
EDL	00:28:02,176	00:28:04,224	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	But if you get really really hot underground
EDL	00:28:04,736	00:28:08,576	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Especially in these dry climates and so they'll build this structure upwards and
EDL	00:28:09,088	00:28:10,112	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	It's super porous
EDL	00:28:10,112	00:28:10,880	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Senso
EDL	00:28:10,880	00:28:11,904	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Cool breezes
EDL	00:28:11,904	00:28:12,672	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Catch
EDL	00:28:14,208	00:28:14,976	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	And it's
EDL	00:28:14,976	00:28:17,280	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Built in such a way that it ventilate
EDL	00:28:17,280	00:28:18,816	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	The entire colony
EDL	00:28:18,816	00:28:21,888	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Keeps them and it helps them regulate their temperature
EDL	00:28:21,888	00:28:24,960	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Which is just a pretty amazing
EDL	00:28:25,472	00:28:31,616	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Is level of innovation for a tiny insect
EDL	00:28:32,384	00:28:34,688	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	They been digging and just live in
EDL	00:28:34,688	00:28:36,736	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	It really is a purpose-built solution to solve
EDL	00:28:40,064	00:28:42,880	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Yeah and their end anytime
EDL	00:28:43,392	00:28:44,672	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Of different animals and obviously it's like
EDL	00:28:45,952	00:28:52,352	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	It's not it's not like a single person who has an idea like solution to a problem is like
EDL	00:28:52,352	00:28:58,752	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Evolutionary solution of an adaptation that they developed over a long period of time
EDL	00:28:58,752	00:29:00,800	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Walkable to me I don't know either
EDL	00:29:00,800	00:29:01,312	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	That's amazing
EDL	00:29:02,848	00:29:09,248	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Alright so this is our last one is is my my personal favorite really does feel like the Artistry of it but
EDL	00:29:09,248	00:29:14,112	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	There's this bird in that lives in the forest of New Guinea called the vocal cup
EDL	00:29:14,112	00:29:18,720	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Bowerbird a bottle cop is my my personal favorite
EDL	00:29:18,720	00:29:22,816	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	And it's totally unassuming looking birds like a little brown
EDL	00:29:22,816	00:29:24,608	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Looks kind of like a sparrow
EDL	00:29:25,120	00:29:27,168	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	So this is unassuming bird but
EDL	00:29:27,168	00:29:29,216	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	The male bowerbird in order to get
EDL	00:29:29,216	00:29:30,496	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Attention
EDL	00:29:30,496	00:29:31,776	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	They will spend
EDL	00:29:31,776	00:29:32,800	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Several years
EDL	00:29:33,312	00:29:35,104	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Building these elaborate
EDL	00:29:35,104	00:29:36,896	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	Structures called Bowers
EDL	00:29:36,896	00:29:39,456	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	And there really aren't there like they're so beautiful. Like these
EDL	00:29:40,736	00:29:42,784	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	They're like these beautiful fat

EDL	00:29:43,552	00:29:44,320	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	That they
EDL	00:29:44,320	00:29:46,880	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	If they construct using little twigs and sticks
EDL	00:29:46,880	00:29:49,696	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	But they're so carefully done if you came across one
EDL	00:29:49,696	00:29:53,792	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	In the forest you would like you wouldn't even consider that a bird made that it looks like
EDL	00:29:53,792	00:29:55,072	| 282_Oystertecture_part_1 |	It was designed by like
