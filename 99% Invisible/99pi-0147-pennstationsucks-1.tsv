EDL	00:05:46,623	00:05:48,927	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	But the Vanderbilts just couldn't be outdone by the
EDL	00:05:48,927	00:05:54,303	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Other train station clearly how embarrassing Grand Central needed a little touch up
EDL	00:05:55,071	00:05:59,167	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	The Vanderbilts decided to tear it down and build a newer shinier
EDL	00:05:59,167	00:06:01,471	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Grandeur Grand Central Station
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:03,007	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	The one we know today
EDL	00:06:03,007	00:06:07,871	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	So there was this very early connection between the two
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:09,663	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	So Penn Station and Grand Central
EDL	00:06:10,175	00:06:11,455	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Started out as enemies
EDL	00:06:11,967	00:06:17,855	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	But as the years passed they were like the last two drunks at the party trying to keep the night from coming to an end
EDL	00:06:17,855	00:06:21,695	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Country was in a very different sort of mindset that
EDL	00:06:21,695	00:06:26,559	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Who was good and flying was good and cars were good and transfer bad
EDL	00:06:26,559	00:06:31,167	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Penn Station was only 40 years old at this point but already it's days were numbered
EDL	00:06:31,167	00:06:34,495	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Passenger trains just weren't as popular anymore
EDL	00:06:35,263	00:06:37,823	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Pennsylvania Railroad was just bleeding money
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:40,383	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	The company couldn't afford the upkeep
EDL	00:06:40,383	00:06:41,919	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Penn Station's grandeur
EDL	00:06:41,919	00:06:44,479	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Everything that I've been glorious about it really
EDL	00:06:44,479	00:06:49,343	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	I got sort of covered with Grime and it was dirty and they didn't fix a broken windows in there all these
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:54,719	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Pigeons flying around it's really hard to wash pigeon poop off of Forestry Arch glass ceiling
EDL	00:06:54,719	00:06:55,487	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	So
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:56,767	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	People did not
EDL	00:06:56,767	00:06:58,559	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Feel that this was this
EDL	00:06:58,559	00:07:00,095	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Glorious place
EDL	00:07:00,095	00:07:06,239	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	They felt it was really crummy a lot of people Penn Station had become a money-sucking albatross of a stage
EDL	00:07:06,751	00:07:11,103	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	They also set of precious Midtown Manhattan real estate
EDL	00:07:11,871	00:07:13,663	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Remember this is New York City
EDL	00:07:14,175	00:07:16,991	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Real estate in New York is in the airspace
EDL	00:07:16,991	00:07:20,831	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Pennsylvania Railroad Executives knew that they can make tons of money
EDL	00:07:20,831	00:07:25,439	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	If they could rent out the space above the station to a big tall building
EDL	00:07:25,439	00:07:29,279	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	There were proposals to build a parking garage Amphitheater
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:31,327	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	40 story office tower
EDL	00:07:31,327	00:07:37,727	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	But the one that one out was the futuristic sports and entertainment Palace known as Madison Square Garden
EDL	00:07:37,727	00:07:41,823	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	The deal that Pennsylvania Railroad cut with a developer Irving Felts
EDL	00:07:41,823	00:07:46,943	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	What's the keep the tracks below Penn Station and sell the rights to the airspace on top
EDL	00:07:46,943	00:07:47,967	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	And blow up
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:49,503	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Penn Station in the process
EDL	00:07:50,783	00:07:55,135	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Here's what I wish we could say that the whole city banded together to save the station
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:08:01,023	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	But actually no one really cared except for a small group of activists architects
EDL	00:08:01,791	00:08:04,607	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	The action group for better architecture in New York
EDL	00:08:04,607	00:08:05,631	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Agony
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:06,911	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	The terrible acronym
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:08,959	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	But definitely a cause I can support
EDL	00:08:08,959	00:08:11,007	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Peter Sampson was one of those architects
EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:13,055	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	I went over to his house on the upper west side
EDL	00:08:13,567	00:08:17,663	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Let me look through old photographs from the only march to save Penn Station
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:18,175	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Is me
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:20,991	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Oh I think this was my sign
EDL	00:08:21,503	00:08:22,783	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Right here that said
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:24,319	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Don't sell LCD short
EDL	00:08:24,831	00:08:26,367	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	The date was August 2nd
EDL	00:08:26,367	00:08:27,903	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	1962
EDL	00:08:27,903	00:08:29,951	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	There were 200 Rowdy architects
EDL	00:08:30,975	00:08:32,255	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	We would have to wear
EDL	00:08:32,767	00:08:34,559	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Respectable clothing
EDL	00:08:34,559	00:08:36,607	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Cuz otherwise they wouldn't take us seriously
EDL	00:08:36,607	00:08:42,495	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Just kidding about the Rowdy part these were Architects the men wear suits the women wear white gloves and pearls
EDL	00:08:43,263	00:08:45,567	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Weed sort of pride ourselves on
EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:52,223	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	I'm doing better lettering than the next sign they marched up and down 7th Avenue shouting powerstone tomorrow
EDL	00:08:52,991	00:08:56,319	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Save Our Heritage things like that is what we would say
EDL	00:08:56,319	00:08:57,599	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Keep in mind
EDL	00:08:58,111	00:09:00,415	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	We know none of us were ever on a picket line
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:02,207	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	You don't say still
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:04,511	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	The protest made the front page of the New York Times
EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:07,327	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Architects fight Penn Station plan
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:08,607	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	But it was too late
EDL	00:09:08,607	00:09:10,143	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	September 28th
EDL	00:09:10,143	00:09:11,679	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	1963
EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:12,959	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	At 9 a.m.
EDL	00:09:12,959	00:09:16,287	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Jackhammers Turin to Penn Station granite slabs
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:18,079	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	The demolition took a long time
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:19,103	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	About three years
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:21,919	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Edward was like a great animal because
EDL	00:09:22,687	00:09:24,991	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Are you saw the black on the outside
EDL	00:09:25,503	00:09:28,831	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	And then you saw the inside which was all this beautiful pink
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:31,135	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	So it was like the flesh
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:32,671	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	What's open now
EDL	00:09:33,695	00:09:34,463	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	With a knife
EDL	00:09:35,999	00:09:40,095	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	And after three years most of the original Penn station remains
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:42,911	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Dark column the granite and travertine details
EDL	00:09:43,679	00:09:44,447	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	All of that
EDL	00:09:44,447	00:09:46,751	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	I've been dumped into a New Jersey swamp
EDL	00:09:47,775	00:09:50,591	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	And of course they gave us a new Penn Station
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:53,407	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	One that was summarily hated by everyone
EDL	00:09:53,919	00:09:59,295	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	1968 architectural historian Vincent Scully famously remark that whereas before
EDL	00:09:59,295	00:10:01,599	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	One entered the city like a god
EDL	00:10:02,111	00:10:03,647	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	1 skulls in now
EDL	00:10:04,159	00:10:04,671	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Like a rat
EDL	00:10:06,207	00:10:12,607	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	How did the destruction of Penn Station mayor Robert Wagner created the first landmarks preservation Commission
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:13,631	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	1065
EDL	00:10:13,631	00:10:16,959	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	The group helped pass the city's first-ever landmarks law
EDL	00:10:17,471	00:10:22,079	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Submit something as drastic as the destruction of Penn Station could never happen again
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:25,663	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	But the landmark laws were flawed it was a joke
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:27,199	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	New Yorkers are so blunt
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:28,479	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	That's Roberta Gratz
EDL	00:10:28,479	00:10:34,111	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	She wrote award-winning stories about the problems with the cities Landmark laws for the New York Post in the 1970s
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:38,719	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	For those of you who are too young to know that the New York Post used to be a really good newspaper
EDL	00:10:39,231	00:10:41,791	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	There are number of problems with the landmark laws
EDL	00:10:41,791	00:10:45,887	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	The biggest one though was that the landmarks commission didn't mean all that much
EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:47,423	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Playmat for 6 months
EDL	00:10:47,423	00:10:52,543	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Every three years if you missed your window to get your favorite New York City building landmark
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:58,943	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Tough luck and in the meantime the bulldozer operated at will has a lot of
EDL	00:10:58,943	00:11:02,015	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Even after the landmark laws were passed
EDL	00:11:02,015	00:11:05,599	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Like the singer building which was once the tallest building in the world
EDL	00:11:05,599	00:11:07,391	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	In the old Metropolitan Opera House
EDL	00:11:07,903	00:11:09,439	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	And the Astor Hotel
EDL	00:11:09,439	00:11:10,719	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	And then in 1968
EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:14,047	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Penn Station's old rival Grand Central Station
EDL	00:11:14,047	00:11:17,119	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Was poised to be yet another pile of rubble
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:24,799	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Beer in the casino like places of the terminal itself Robin heart of a nation's recovery
EDL	00:11:24,799	00:11:28,383	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	You have a right I love Grand Central Station

EDL	00:11:31,711	00:11:34,271	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Welcome to Grand Central terminal
EDL	00:11:35,039	00:11:38,367	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Kent Barwick is just as excited as I am to be here
EDL	00:11:39,135	00:11:42,719	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	He's been involved in Saving New York City's historic buildings for decades
EDL	00:11:43,487	00:11:49,119	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	We're standing under Grand Central beautiful vaulted green ceiling which is decorated with constellations
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:51,167	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	I just love looking up at it
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:55,263	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	You and every other person
EDL	00:11:55,263	00:11:57,055	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	It's rare to communicate without
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:11:58,591	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Finding somebody

EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:01,407	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Look this one races
EDL	00:12:03,455	00:12:05,759	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Grand Central feels like a throwback
EDL	00:12:05,759	00:12:10,879	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	I feel like the old Penn Station must have been like just like the original Penn Station
EDL	00:12:10,879	00:12:13,439	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Grand Central was a hard building to keep clean
EDL	00:12:13,951	00:12:16,767	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Kent bar with points to a small patch of black
EDL	00:12:16,767	00:12:20,607	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Far corner of the ceiling seems to be
EDL	00:12:21,119	00:12:24,959	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	A piece of dirty limestone in the piece of dirty ceiling I think that's the
EDL	00:12:25,471	00:12:25,983	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Chose
EDL	00:12:26,751	00:12:28,031	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	But the ceiling was like
EDL	00:12:28,543	00:12:30,847	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Which is essentially nicotine coatings
EDL	00:12:31,359	00:12:34,687	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Hours for that everybody smoked all the time
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:41,087	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	That black ceiling Square was left on purpose to remind people what Grand Central was like back in the day
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:47,487	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	In the 1960s Grand Central history was almost a carbon copy of Penn Station's they were losing money
EDL	00:12:47,487	00:12:52,607	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Because the building was so expensive to maintain and fewer people were taking trains
EDL	00:12:52,607	00:12:59,007	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Just like Penn Station needed to sell the air space on top of the station and invite

EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:12,319	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	But here's where the story of Grand Central and Penn Station The Verge
EDL	00:13:12,831	00:13:14,879	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Remember those landmark
EDL	00:13:14,879	00:13:18,207	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Happened in the years after the original Penn Station was demolished
EDL	00:13:20,767	00:13:24,351	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	They did manage to get Grand Central designated as a landmark
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:28,447	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	So the city denies the railroad executive plans
EDL	00:13:28,447	00:13:31,007	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	The owners of Grand Central were not placed
EDL	00:13:31,519	00:13:36,383	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	They wanted the money they were going to get from selling there are rides the space above Grand Central
EDL	00:13:36,383	00:13:37,919	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	So they sued the city
EDL	00:13:37,919	00:13:39,711	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	The case was a long one
EDL	00:13:39,711	00:13:41,759	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	It went on for nearly a decade
EDL	00:13:41,759	00:13:45,855	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	It was a bit of a nail-biter grand central nearly lost in 1975
EDL	00:13:45,855	00:13:49,951	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	With a state judge ruled against the city's designation of it as a landmark

EDL	00:15:17,503	00:15:19,295	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	And all of these years later
EDL	00:15:19,295	00:15:23,391	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	One of the ways people Comfort themselves about the loss of the original Penn Station
EDL	00:15:23,903	00:15:25,183	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Is with this idea
EDL	00:15:25,183	00:15:28,255	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	But the laws that came out of the destruction of Penn Station

EDL	00:15:30,559	00:15:31,583	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	So you know it's okay
EDL	00:15:32,095	00:15:33,119	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Because it died for a Cause
EDL	00:15:33,887	00:15:37,215	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	I don't think Grand Central would have been saved without Penn Station

EDL	00:15:52,063	00:15:53,855	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	And the saving of Grand Central
EDL	00:15:54,367	00:15:55,903	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Is actually kind of tenuous
EDL	00:15:56,671	00:15:57,951	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Ferber the grass
EDL	00:15:57,951	00:15:58,975	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	It was Jackie O

EDL	00:16:17,663	00:16:21,247	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	A sacrificial lamb like Penn Station can only do so much
EDL	00:16:21,247	00:16:24,831	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	People have to actually fight and win like they did with Grand Central
EDL	00:16:24,831	00:16:26,367	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	The laws that have teeth
EDL	00:16:26,367	00:16:28,671	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Roberta Gratz was actually one of those people
EDL	00:16:29,183	00:16:31,487	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	The reporting she did on the landmarks Commission
EDL	00:16:31,999	00:16:36,095	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Is just one of the things that led to the landmark laws ultimately being strengthened
EDL	00:16:36,607	00:16:38,143	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	And of course the Supreme Court
EDL	00:16:38,143	00:16:40,447	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Holding those laws in the Grand Central case
EDL	00:16:40,447	00:16:41,983	| 99pi-0147-pennstationsucks-1 |	Set an important precedent
