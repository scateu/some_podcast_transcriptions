EDL	00:03:09,952	00:03:10,464	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Ja
EDL	00:03:11,232	00:03:16,352	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	It's a manufactured home and it is built stronger and better than 90% of visual tracking

EDL	00:03:23,776	00:03:26,336	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Mobile homes don't get a lot of love in our culture
EDL	00:03:26,336	00:03:29,408	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	They represent a lot of the affordable housing in the United States

EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:35,296	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Mobile homes made up about two-thirds of new affordable housing
EDL	00:03:35,296	00:03:40,672	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Charlene bought her mobile home or manufactured home in 1994
EDL	00:03:40,672	00:03:43,744	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	She was divorced for kids were grown up and out of the house
EDL	00:03:43,744	00:03:45,536	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	She wanted to buy her own place
EDL	00:03:45,536	00:03:48,352	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	But you couldn't afford a tract home in the suburbs
EDL	00:03:48,352	00:03:50,144	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	When I thought I was just excited to think
EDL	00:03:50,656	00:03:53,216	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	I can actually now have a beautiful home
EDL	00:03:53,728	00:03:54,496	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	That I can afford
EDL	00:03:55,008	00:03:56,544	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Does tract homes I can afford
EDL	00:03:57,312	00:03:58,336	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	I had to borrow money
EDL	00:03:59,360	00:04:03,456	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	And the loan on the borrowing of the money plus the pet fee
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:05,504	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Which less than what I was paying

EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:09,088	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	But when you buy a manufactured home
EDL	00:04:09,088	00:04:11,904	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	The structure itself is only half of the equation
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:13,696	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Then you need to find a place to put it
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:16,768	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Angeline found what seems like the perfect spot
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:19,583	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	A small quiet mobile home park with an empty lot
EDL	00:04:20,095	00:04:24,191	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	When we moved here I moved here February 1994 thought I'd died and gone to heaven
EDL	00:04:24,191	00:04:24,959	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	I have a little
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:28,031	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Beautiful backyard and I plan a little bit of the garden
EDL	00:04:29,311	00:04:31,359	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	I love tomato on my cucumber
EDL	00:04:31,359	00:04:32,895	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	I want just a little bit of crayons
EDL	00:04:33,407	00:04:34,687	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	And this is just enough
EDL	00:04:34,687	00:04:35,455	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	That's perfect
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:39,039	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	But it wasn't actually perfect
EDL	00:04:39,551	00:04:43,135	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	The same Dynamic that made this housing situation great for Shirlene
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:44,671	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Also made her vulnerable
EDL	00:04:44,671	00:04:46,463	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Because the mobile home was hers
EDL	00:04:46,975	00:04:47,999	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	The land underneath it
EDL	00:04:48,511	00:04:49,023	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Wasn't
EDL	00:04:49,535	00:04:52,863	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Part of the Paradox at the heart of manufactured housing is that
EDL	00:04:53,887	00:04:55,423	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Precisely the thing that makes
EDL	00:04:55,423	00:04:56,703	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	It's so affordable
EDL	00:04:56,703	00:04:57,983	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	That also makes this

EDL	00:05:05,663	00:05:08,479	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Who studies the relationship between poverty and housing
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:13,343	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	She says that about a third of mobile home owners live in Parks like Applewood
EDL	00:05:13,343	00:05:15,391	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Where they rent a plot of land for their home
EDL	00:05:15,903	00:05:20,767	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	She called this Arrangement halfway home ownership because it's filled with all this uncertain

EDL	00:05:31,007	00:05:32,031	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	So they are subject
EDL	00:05:32,031	00:05:33,311	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Too often times

EDL	00:05:37,663	00:05:39,455	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	And eventually
EDL	00:05:39,455	00:05:40,735	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	They can be subject to
EDL	00:05:40,735	00:05:44,063	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Park closure and Redevelopment with very little notice

EDL	00:05:53,791	00:05:54,815	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	It's not going to
EDL	00:05:54,815	00:05:56,351	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	$89
EDL	00:05:56,351	00:05:56,863	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Per month
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:05:59,167	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	And in six months
EDL	00:05:59,167	00:06:00,703	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	It's going to go up another
EDL	00:06:00,703	00:06:01,727	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	$89

EDL	00:06:16,319	00:06:17,087	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Are you kidding
EDL	00:06:17,599	00:06:21,439	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	They managed to negotiate the increases down to $70 each
EDL	00:06:21,439	00:06:27,583	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	But still in a six month. The rent for each lot went from $320 to 460
EDL	00:06:28,607	00:06:30,399	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	And rumors started swirling
EDL	00:06:30,399	00:06:33,983	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	That the increases might just be the first step in a plan to force them out
EDL	00:06:34,751	00:06:37,311	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Shirleen started digging into what was going on
EDL	00:06:37,311	00:06:41,407	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	And pretty soon she discovered that the new landlords had submitted a plan to the city
EDL	00:06:41,407	00:06:43,455	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	To build a 3-story apartment
EDL	00:06:44,735	00:06:45,759	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Right on top of Apple
EDL	00:06:47,039	00:06:48,575	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Then we understood why
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:50,111	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	They were trying to
EDL	00:06:50,623	00:06:51,391	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Financially

EDL	00:06:53,439	00:06:55,231	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	But Charlene wasn't just going to up and leave
EDL	00:06:55,743	00:06:56,767	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	She got to figure something out
EDL	00:06:57,791	00:07:02,655	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Owning your own home has long been seen as a Cornerstone of middle-class stability in this country
EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:08,543	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Home ownership helps you build wealth and as long as you're able to pay your mortgage you don't have to worry about getting evicted
EDL	00:07:09,055	00:07:11,615	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	That security is kind of Why We Buy Houses
EDL	00:07:12,127	00:07:14,943	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	But that security just isn't there for many mobile home owner
EDL	00:07:15,455	00:07:16,991	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Including Shirleen still open
EDL	00:07:16,991	00:07:18,527	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	And the rest of the community at Applewood
EDL	00:07:19,039	00:07:25,439	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Bring it back to their story in the second but to understand how a mobile home owners ended up in the precarious position
EDL	00:07:25,439	00:07:27,487	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	End of owning a home without land
EDL	00:07:27,487	00:07:29,279	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	We have to go back to the early 20th century
EDL	00:07:30,047	00:07:31,583	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	And the dawn of the automobile
EDL	00:07:32,351	00:07:33,375	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	People
EDL	00:07:33,375	00:07:34,911	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Add cars for the first time in

EDL	00:07:40,799	00:07:44,127	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Of their model T's or whatever cars they had
EDL	00:07:44,639	00:07:46,431	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	This is Andrew Hurley
EDL	00:07:46,431	00:07:49,247	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	History professor at the University of Missouri st. Louis
EDL	00:07:49,759	00:07:53,087	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	He says that the first trailer owners were wealthy vacationers
EDL	00:07:54,111	00:07:55,391	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Tin Can tourist
EDL	00:07:55,391	00:08:00,255	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Trailer happy as can be
EDL	00:08:07,167	00:08:09,215	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	But then came the Great Depression
EDL	00:08:09,215	00:08:11,263	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	When migrant workers started Living
EDL	00:08:11,263	00:08:14,591	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	And trailers full time as they travel the country looking for work
EDL	00:08:15,103	00:08:18,175	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	And so there were thousands of it
EDL	00:08:18,175	00:08:20,735	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Generant individuals and Families
EDL	00:08:20,735	00:08:22,527	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	In search of work that
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:24,319	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Didn't really know
EDL	00:08:24,319	00:08:25,087	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	One day
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:27,391	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Or if they would be coming back to
EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:28,671	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Where they had originated
EDL	00:08:28,671	00:08:30,463	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Han Solo trailer
EDL	00:08:30,463	00:08:32,511	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Was something that they could
EDL	00:08:33,279	00:08:35,327	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Attached to the back of their
EDL	00:08:35,327	00:08:36,095	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Car
EDL	00:08:36,095	00:08:38,143	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	And just take their home along with them
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:39,935	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	And
EDL	00:08:39,935	00:08:42,239	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	They started the site these homes
EDL	00:08:42,239	00:08:43,775	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Together in
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:46,335	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Basically what became the first mobile home park
EDL	00:08:47,615	00:08:49,663	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	These Parks were really seen as a
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:50,943	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Major
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:51,711	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Drain

EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:56,575	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Writings of the timer for two bees as trailer slum
EDL	00:08:57,599	00:09:03,231	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	This was the beginning of a kind of classes trailer stigma that is still very much around today
EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:08,607	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	But the event that really solidified the trailer as a viable form of American housing
EDL	00:09:09,375	00:09:10,399	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Was World War II
EDL	00:09:11,935	00:09:15,007	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	American industry has met the challenge of Horror
EDL	00:09:15,519	00:09:17,823	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	American factories have achieved The Impossible
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:20,639	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	American mass production is delivering the goods
EDL	00:09:21,407	00:09:22,943	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Is the war got underway
EDL	00:09:22,943	00:09:26,015	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Factories popped up in all these remote parts of the country
EDL	00:09:26,527	00:09:28,063	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	But because
EDL	00:09:28,063	00:09:30,879	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	They had been undeveloped
EDL	00:09:30,879	00:09:31,903	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	It was no
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:32,671	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Housing
EDL	00:09:32,671	00:09:33,695	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	And
EDL	00:09:33,695	00:09:37,535	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	There was no capacity to build a new housing
EDL	00:09:38,047	00:09:40,351	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Because Construction
EDL	00:09:40,863	00:09:41,631	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Materials
EDL	00:09:41,631	00:09:44,447	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Upward prioritized for war production
EDL	00:09:44,959	00:09:49,055	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	So the government bought thousands of trailers to house the wartime Workforce
EDL	00:09:49,567	00:09:51,103	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	But this was always supposed to be at
EDL	00:09:51,103	00:09:52,383	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Temporary solution
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:58,015	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	When the war ended the expectation was that people would give up their trailers and move back in the conventional home
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:10:00,063	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	That didn't happen
EDL	00:10:00,063	00:10:06,463	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Trailers continue to be an affordable housing option for people who didn't have the money to buy a home in the expanding
EDL	00:10:06,463	00:10:07,231	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Suburbs
EDL	00:10:07,231	00:10:13,375	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	And a lot of these mobile home owners rented pads in one of the many mobile home parks that were popping up all over the country
EDL	00:10:13,887	00:10:15,167	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Esther Sullivan says
EDL	00:10:15,167	00:10:19,263	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	These parts continue to spread throughout the 60s 70s and 80s
EDL	00:10:19,263	00:10:21,567	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	As the government was investing less and less
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:22,591	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Public housing
EDL	00:10:23,359	00:10:24,895	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	So just as
EDL	00:10:24,895	00:10:26,431	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	We've increasingly
EDL	00:10:26,431	00:10:28,991	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Slashed the budget of Hud
EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:31,807	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	And the production of affordable housing

EDL	00:10:41,791	00:10:43,071	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	To fill that Gap
EDL	00:10:44,095	00:10:48,959	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Mobile homes were never really able to shake off the stigma that began during the Great Depression
EDL	00:10:49,471	00:10:52,799	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	People just did not want a home parks built in their backyard
EDL	00:10:53,311	00:10:54,079	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	In fact
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:58,943	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Cities use all the tools in the urban planning tool kit to render mobile home parks
EDL	00:10:58,943	00:10:59,455	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Invisible
EDL	00:11:00,223	00:11:02,527	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	For the last half of a century
EDL	00:11:02,527	00:11:05,343	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Planning and zoning laws have required
EDL	00:11:05,343	00:11:06,879	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	That Mobile Home Park
EDL	00:11:08,159	00:11:09,695	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Walled in
EDL	00:11:09,695	00:11:10,719	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Fenced off

EDL	00:11:24,799	00:11:28,639	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	These Parks were often built on marginal land on the outskirts of cities
EDL	00:11:29,151	00:11:34,015	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Bill's mobile homes are legally classified as a form of transportation other than housing
EDL	00:11:34,015	00:11:37,087	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	They can be built on land that wasn't zoned residential
EDL	00:11:37,599	00:11:38,879	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	So separate them
EDL	00:11:38,879	00:11:39,647	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	From
EDL	00:11:39,647	00:11:41,439	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Residences and single-family homes
EDL	00:11:42,463	00:11:45,791	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	More often Place mobile homes in

EDL	00:11:49,375	00:11:51,679	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	As well as in hazardous places like

EDL	00:11:59,359	00:12:02,175	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	I can be bought up and redevelop into something more profitable

EDL	00:12:18,303	00:12:20,095	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	And the Redevelopment of a mobile home park
EDL	00:12:20,607	00:12:22,399	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Means math addiction

EDL	00:12:32,895	00:12:34,687	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	To make way for an apartment complex
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:41,343	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	I asked everyone I met at Applewood if they consider the possibility of Redevelopment and eviction when they moved in
EDL	00:12:41,343	00:12:43,647	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	I just hadn't thought about that fat

EDL	00:12:53,887	00:12:56,703	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Having to move out I never thought that was possible
EDL	00:12:58,239	00:12:59,775	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Until they told me
EDL	00:12:59,775	00:13:00,287	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	That it was
EDL	00:13:02,079	00:13:07,967	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	A lot of people including many developers assume that if you evict a mobile home park the residence
EDL	00:13:07,967	00:13:09,759	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	I got their houses and moving somewhere else
EDL	00:13:10,527	00:13:11,551	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	But the truth is

EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:18,207	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	In the mid-twentieth century the mobile home industry split into
EDL	00:13:18,207	00:13:21,535	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	One branch continued making travel trailers and RV's
EDL	00:13:21,535	00:13:25,887	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Well the other started manufacturing houses designed to be lived in full time
EDL	00:13:25,887	00:13:31,775	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	These mobile home started to look less like trailers and more like conventional single family houses with
EDL	00:13:31,775	00:13:34,591	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Multiple rooms and hallways in in for bathrooms
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:37,407	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	And they got harder and harder to move
EDL	00:13:37,919	00:13:41,503	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	The term mobile home is more or less in the snow
EDL	00:13:43,295	00:13:44,063	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Ended
EDL	00:13:44,063	00:13:46,367	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	To be mobile except when it is
EDL	00:13:46,367	00:13:48,671	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	First transported from the factory
EDL	00:13:48,671	00:13:49,951	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	And installed on the side
EDL	00:13:50,463	00:13:52,511	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	And if you try to move it again
EDL	00:13:52,511	00:13:54,559	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	It requires specialized
EDL	00:13:54,559	00:13:58,655	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Trucking and Hauling at Great expense to homeowners it can cause between
EDL	00:13:59,167	00:14:01,215	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	5 + $15,000
EDL	00:14:01,215	00:14:01,983	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	First to move one of these
EDL	00:14:03,263	00:14:06,335	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Moving can also cause serious structural problems
EDL	00:14:06,847	00:14:09,919	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	It can damage the home so severely that it becomes unlivable
EDL	00:14:11,199	00:14:14,783	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	And even if residents of Applewood were willing to take that risk
EDL	00:14:14,783	00:14:17,855	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Had a spare $15,000 lying around
EDL	00:14:17,855	00:14:20,927	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Finding a new place to put their home could be next to Impossible
EDL	00:14:21,439	00:14:24,511	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Because there has not been any new manufactured
EDL	00:14:25,535	00:14:26,303	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Home
EDL	00:14:26,303	00:14:26,815	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Community
EDL	00:14:27,839	00:14:28,607	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Built
EDL	00:14:28,607	00:14:29,375	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Utah
EDL	00:14:29,375	00:14:30,655	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	For a long long time
EDL	00:14:31,167	00:14:32,703	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	There's not that many spaces
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:34,751	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	In any of these parks to put
EDL	00:14:34,751	00:14:35,775	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	56 homes
EDL	00:14:36,287	00:14:37,567	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	This is Charlene stovin again
EDL	00:14:38,079	00:14:41,919	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	She says that if she got evicted she would probably have to abandon her home
EDL	00:14:41,919	00:14:43,711	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	And move in with one of her kids
EDL	00:14:43,711	00:14:45,759	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	But some of these people have no family
EDL	00:14:45,759	00:14:47,295	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Or their family so far away
EDL	00:14:48,319	00:14:49,087	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Where would they go
EDL	00:14:51,391	00:14:54,463	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Charlene was determined not to let that happen at Applewood
EDL	00:14:54,463	00:14:58,559	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	And she talked to some local community organizer to advisor to start a homeowners assoc
EDL	00:14:59,327	00:15:03,935	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	So first meeting with a carport I can't remember which Powerpuff Girl one of the car parts are we all met
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:06,751	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Decided this is what we needed to do save ourselves
EDL	00:15:08,287	00:15:09,055	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Interested
EDL	00:15:09,055	00:15:10,847	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Of course
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:12,895	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	And I thought okay what do I do now
EDL	00:15:13,407	00:15:14,175	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	I'm clueless
EDL	00:15:14,943	00:15:20,319	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	But she kept asking people for help and little by little they started rallying people to their cause
EDL	00:15:20,319	00:15:22,111	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	The residents started a petition
EDL	00:15:22,111	00:15:24,927	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	To save a boy and got over 2600 signatures
EDL	00:15:25,439	00:15:28,511	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Charlene testify before the mayor and the city council
EDL	00:15:28,511	00:15:29,535	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	And told them
EDL	00:15:29,535	00:15:31,327	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	If we allow this guess what
EDL	00:15:31,327	00:15:32,095	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	You're going to have
EDL	00:15:32,607	00:15:33,631	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	56
EDL	00:15:33,631	00:15:34,655	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Homeowners
EDL	00:15:34,655	00:15:35,167	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	That will be
EDL	00:15:37,727	00:15:39,007	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	And what are you going to do with it
EDL	00:15:40,031	00:15:45,151	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Homelessness is a huge problem in Utah right now and it's been exacerbated by a housing shortage
EDL	00:15:45,663	00:15:51,039	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	And apartment complexes are going up all over the Salt Lake Valley to try and meet a growing demand
EDL	00:15:51,807	00:15:53,343	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Charlene says that's good
EDL	00:15:53,343	00:15:54,111	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	You need the apartment
EDL	00:15:56,927	00:15:58,719	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Displaced people in order to do it
EDL	00:15:59,999	00:16:04,351	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Charlene in the other residents of Applewood fought for several years to stay in their homes
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:08,191	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	There were a lot of twists and turns and late nights in a whole lot of emails
EDL	00:16:08,703	00:16:09,471	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	But eventually
EDL	00:16:09,471	00:16:11,007	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	After a lot of public pressure
EDL	00:16:11,007	00:16:13,567	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	The development company gave up on the project
EDL	00:16:13,567	00:16:15,871	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	He decided to put Applewood up for sale
EDL	00:16:16,383	00:16:20,479	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Her that she remembered an organization that she thought might be able to help them out
EDL	00:16:20,991	00:16:21,759	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	I was called
EDL	00:16:21,759	00:16:23,039	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Rock USA
EDL	00:16:23,039	00:16:26,623	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Yasso Roc stands for Resident owned communities
EDL	00:16:27,135	00:16:32,255	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	And we help homeowners in mobile home parks by their communities as Co-op
EDL	00:16:32,767	00:16:34,303	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	This is Paul Bradley
EDL	00:16:34,303	00:16:35,839	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	The president of Rock USA
EDL	00:16:35,839	00:16:36,863	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Which is based in New Hampshire
EDL	00:16:37,631	00:16:42,495	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Bradley began organizing mobile home coops with the New Hampshire Community Loan Fund
EDL	00:16:42,495	00:16:43,263	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Back in the 80s
EDL	00:16:43,775	00:16:49,919	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	They even got legislation passed in New Hampshire that gives mobile homeowners a first option to purchase the land whenever
EDL	00:16:50,431	00:16:50,943	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Close up for sale
EDL	00:16:51,455	00:16:54,015	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Today about 27% of the
EDL	00:16:54,015	00:16:56,575	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Manufactured home communities are Mobile Home Park
EDL	00:16:56,575	00:16:58,111	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	In New Hampshire are resident owned
EDL	00:16:58,623	00:17:02,207	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Now so that's a hundred and twenty-seven or so communities
EDL	00:17:02,207	00:17:08,351	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Bradley thinks we need to build more affordable housing but he also wants to protect the affordable housing we already have
EDL	00:17:08,863	00:17:13,983	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Right now mobile homes represent the largest source of unsubsidized affordable housing produced in this country
EDL	00:17:14,495	00:17:18,591	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Bradley says that if we can help mobile home owners by the land beneath their parks
EDL	00:17:19,103	00:17:21,407	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Then the risk of mass eviction disappears
EDL	00:17:22,687	00:17:25,759	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	And so in 2008 Bradley launch Rock USA
EDL	00:17:25,759	00:17:29,599	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Effort to spread New Hampshire is cooperative ownership model Nationwide
EDL	00:17:30,111	00:17:31,647	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	So far they've been really successful
EDL	00:17:32,159	00:17:36,767	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	National network of just over 220 communities 14000 homeowners
EDL	00:17:37,279	00:17:39,583	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	And we're operating with coops
EDL	00:17:39,583	00:17:40,607	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	15 states
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:45,727	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	When Charlene called Paul Bradley things were not looking good for Applewood
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:49,311	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	The land had already been sold to to new Developers
EDL	00:17:49,311	00:17:51,615	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	44.8 million dollars
EDL	00:17:51,615	00:17:54,687	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	But Charlene Paul approach the new owners explain the situation
EDL	00:17:55,199	00:17:57,759	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	They talked about how difficult it would be to move their homes
EDL	00:17:57,759	00:18:01,087	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	And ask if the new owners would be willing to sell the park to the residence
EDL	00:18:01,599	00:18:02,111	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	And they said
EDL	00:18:02,879	00:18:09,023	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	We didn't realize you you wanted to purchase the property but if you if you want to and you can do it within the next
EDL	00:18:09,023	00:18:11,071	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Couple of months will sell it to you
EDL	00:18:11,071	00:18:12,351	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Otherwise if we're going to
EDL	00:18:12,351	00:18:15,167	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	We're going to own it eventually we're going to close it down
EDL	00:18:15,935	00:18:20,031	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Buying a mobile home park worth at least 4.8 million dollars
EDL	00:18:20,031	00:18:23,103	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Seems like a very tall order for the residence of Applewood
EDL	00:18:23,615	00:18:25,407	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Individually no one in the park
EDL	00:18:25,407	00:18:27,711	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Even come close to getting a mortgage for that kind of money
EDL	00:18:28,223	00:18:31,295	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	But together as a co-op the financial picture was different
EDL	00:18:32,063	00:18:37,183	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Rock USA was willing to give the residence of very low interest loan for 3.6 million
EDL	00:18:37,183	00:18:43,583	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	They would still need to find some more money though and so they went to a low income housing form in Utah called the Olene Walker house
EDL	00:18:43,583	00:18:44,351	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Housing Loan Fund
EDL	00:18:45,119	00:18:46,399	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	So there I am again
EDL	00:18:48,191	00:18:48,959	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Pleading
EDL	00:18:49,471	00:18:50,495	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Mycase
EDL	00:18:50,495	00:18:53,055	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	And Gloria who is the director
EDL	00:18:53,055	00:18:53,567	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Sad
EDL	00:18:54,335	00:18:56,127	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	I thought about this the last 3 months
EDL	00:18:57,407	00:18:58,431	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	And I've decided
EDL	00:18:58,943	00:18:59,967	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	We need to help
EDL	00:18:59,967	00:19:00,479	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	These people
EDL	00:19:01,247	00:19:03,551	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	We need to give them the money they need
EDL	00:19:04,063	00:19:06,623	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	So between it all we finally come up with
EDL	00:19:06,623	00:19:08,159	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	5 million that we needed
EDL	00:19:09,439	00:19:10,975	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	And on February 9th
EDL	00:19:10,975	00:19:11,487	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Resigned
EDL	00:19:11,999	00:19:12,511	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	So we own
EDL	00:19:15,071	00:19:18,143	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	After four and a half years of fighting for their little piece of ground
EDL	00:19:18,655	00:19:22,239	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Bland officially belongs to the Applewood Homeowners cooperative
EDL	00:19:23,007	00:19:29,151	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	To pay off their Collective mortgage the residents agreed to pay $60 more a month than they had previously been paying in rent
EDL	00:19:29,919	00:19:31,711	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	It's going to be a challenge for some of them
EDL	00:19:31,711	00:19:34,527	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	But the monthly cost be stable from here on out
EDL	00:19:34,527	00:19:36,575	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Worried about eviction
EDL	00:19:37,087	00:19:41,439	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	We can breathe again I got to worry about losing our home and everything would have had in it
EDL	00:19:41,439	00:19:42,719	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Or we can order home
EDL	00:19:43,231	00:19:43,999	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Fieldease
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:49,887	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	This is Russell Durfee who lives in Applewood with his wife Beth who you heard from earlier
EDL	00:19:50,399	00:19:52,191	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	He says that at their age
EDL	00:19:52,191	00:19:53,471	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	They're just happy to have us
EDL	00:19:53,471	00:19:54,495	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Secure place to live
EDL	00:19:55,007	00:19:57,311	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	We're getting so old and feeble
EDL	00:19:58,079	00:20:02,687	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	But we don't know how much longer we're going to live so I want to go grocery shopping or dare
EDL	00:20:02,687	00:20:03,455	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Everybody Green from

EDL	00:24:49,152	00:24:53,504	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	When Emmett was reporting the story he discovered all the different names for these things
EDL	00:24:53,504	00:24:58,624	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	And that they were used interchangeably but also had different meanings for different people

EDL	00:25:05,792	00:25:08,352	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	And how that design evolved over time
EDL	00:25:08,864	00:25:11,680	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Right and Emma was telling me that
EDL	00:25:11,680	00:25:18,080	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	But when he was interviewing people for the story like everybody was just using a different term for sort of the same thing and put this actual
EDL	00:25:18,080	00:25:18,592	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Turn mobile
EDL	00:25:19,360	00:25:20,640	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	According to Stewart brand
EDL	00:25:20,640	00:25:22,176	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Really excellent book
EDL	00:25:22,176	00:25:22,944	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	How buildings learn
EDL	00:25:23,456	00:25:25,504	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Was actually coined by a man named Elmer Frey
EDL	00:25:26,272	00:25:27,808	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	And I helped build a verify that
EDL	00:25:28,320	00:25:34,464	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Independently but Frey did play a big role in popular I think it is nothing else and he's this really interesting character in love
EDL	00:25:34,976	00:25:38,048	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	40s he started a mobile home manufacturing business in Wisconsin
EDL	00:25:38,560	00:25:40,864	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	And he sold a lot of these 8 ft wide homes
EDL	00:25:40,864	00:25:44,960	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	We also lobbied to be able to transport 10-foot wides on public Road
EDL	00:25:44,960	00:25:48,288	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	And what is the big difference between an 8-foot wide home in it
EDL	00:25:48,288	00:25:49,056	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Infant White
EDL	00:25:50,336	00:25:53,152	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	So if you think about a typical mobile home at the time
EDL	00:25:53,152	00:25:55,200	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	The real limitation is that horizontal to me
EDL	00:25:55,712	00:25:59,808	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	You can make one that stuff in the feet long fence really hard to fit in
EDL	00:25:59,808	00:26:01,344	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Balls in hallway
EDL	00:26:01,344	00:26:02,112	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	It's too thin
EDL	00:26:02,112	00:26:03,904	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	So if you add a few feet of width
EDL	00:26:04,416	00:26:06,208	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	You can certainly subdivide space
EDL	00:26:06,208	00:26:06,976	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Create rooms
EDL	00:26:07,488	00:26:09,024	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	And connecting the outside chords
EDL	00:26:10,048	00:26:11,584	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	So now you can walk
EDL	00:26:11,584	00:26:16,192	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Pastis fully-enclosed individual spaces rather than always stepping through one room to
EDL	00:26:16,192	00:26:16,704	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	To another
EDL	00:26:17,216	00:26:20,032	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	That means you got privacy and you can fit a Pamela more comfortable
EDL	00:26:20,800	00:26:22,592	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Sabillasville to make one
EDL	00:26:22,592	00:26:23,616	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Expand on site

EDL	00:26:28,736	00:26:30,784	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	And as you make these leaves
EDL	00:26:30,784	00:26:32,832	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	It sounds like mobile home is already coming
EDL	00:26:32,832	00:26:34,112	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Less and less mobile
EDL	00:26:34,112	00:26:34,880	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Actually
EDL	00:26:34,880	00:26:41,024	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Exactly is Pennywise in the 12 I've gained popularity they were increasingly created to just be shipped out sat down and lived
EDL	00:26:41,792	00:26:45,888	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Do you know the US Department of Housing and Urban Development this post
EDL	00:26:45,888	00:26:50,240	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	The problem a lot of these relatively new mobile homes were not being construct
EDL	00:26:50,240	00:26:52,288	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	The same standards as normal Lotto
EDL	00:26:53,568	00:26:55,872	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	So in the mid-1970s Congress pass

EDL	00:26:58,944	00:27:01,248	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	Which basically was to make sure that
EDL	00:27:01,248	00:27:03,296	| 307_Immobile_Homes_pt01 |	New manufactured homes will be more energy of
