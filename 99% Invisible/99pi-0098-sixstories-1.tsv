EDL	00:06:19,135	00:06:21,695	| 99pi-0098-sixstories-1 |	Admittedly he was higher than 18 before
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:23,999	| 99pi-0098-sixstories-1 |	A three stories instead of two
EDL	00:06:25,023	00:06:27,071	| 99pi-0098-sixstories-1 |	But there's no way this thing was going to catch on
EDL	00:06:28,095	00:06:31,679	| 99pi-0098-sixstories-1 |	Because who in their right mind was going to ride a three-story elevator

EDL	00:06:44,991	00:06:51,391	| 99pi-0098-sixstories-1 |	And then bring it down like an executioner slicing the ropes that held up the platform
EDL	00:06:51,391	00:06:52,415	| 99pi-0098-sixstories-1 |	Naughty screen
EDL	00:06:54,207	00:06:55,231	| 99pi-0098-sixstories-1 |	And then they cheered
EDL	00:07:01,887	00:07:03,935	| 99pi-0098-sixstories-1 |	Elijah Otis didn't invent the elevator
EDL	00:07:05,215	00:07:06,239	| 99pi-0098-sixstories-1 |	He invented the break
EDL	00:07:07,007	00:07:12,639	| 99pi-0098-sixstories-1 |	The little metal piece that catches the car and stops it from plummeting if the cable that holds it up

EDL	00:07:16,991	00:07:19,551	| 99pi-0098-sixstories-1 |	But his son's kind of invented the modern world
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:24,927	| 99pi-0098-sixstories-1 |	The Otis Brothers convince the world to aim higher
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:32,351	| 99pi-0098-sixstories-1 |	The tallest building back in the 19th century the tallest buildings that weren't churches or lighthouses which were all show off
EDL	00:07:32,351	00:07:33,375	| 99pi-0098-sixstories-1 |	Aspires anyway
EDL	00:07:33,375	00:07:38,751	| 99pi-0098-sixstories-1 |	We just a few stories tall in part these buildings were held down by the lack of engineering know-how
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:45,151	| 99pi-0098-sixstories-1 |	But just as much as they were held down by stairs people could only climb so many
EDL	00:07:45,151	00:07:49,503	| 99pi-0098-sixstories-1 |	So the brothers Otis came up with a killer sales pitch
EDL	00:07:49,503	00:07:51,551	| 99pi-0098-sixstories-1 |	Higher was better
EDL	00:07:52,063	00:07:58,463	| 99pi-0098-sixstories-1 |	They targeted hotels 1st and convince them to turn the idea of luxury quite literally
EDL	00:07:58,463	00:08:02,815	| 99pi-0098-sixstories-1 |	Before the elevator the best rooms are on the bottom floor
EDL	00:08:02,815	00:08:04,095	| 99pi-0098-sixstories-1 |	You didn't have to walk
EDL	00:08:04,095	00:08:05,887	| 99pi-0098-sixstories-1 |	Stairs are for suckers
EDL	00:08:05,887	00:08:10,239	| 99pi-0098-sixstories-1 |	But the oldest Brothers convince hotels it should be the other way around
EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:13,055	| 99pi-0098-sixstories-1 |	The first floor is in the one on the street

EDL	00:14:09,663	00:14:11,455	| 99pi-0098-sixstories-1 |	He was looking to make a lot more in real estate
EDL	00:14:11,967	00:14:14,783	| 99pi-0098-sixstories-1 |	He bought some land in a prime location to 50 Broadway

EDL	00:14:20,927	00:14:22,207	| 99pi-0098-sixstories-1 |	But there was a problem
EDL	00:14:23,231	00:14:26,047	| 99pi-0098-sixstories-1 |	The lot was less than 22 ft wide
EDL	00:14:27,327	00:14:29,887	| 99pi-0098-sixstories-1 |	There are rules that dictate what you can build and how
EDL	00:14:29,887	00:14:34,495	| 99pi-0098-sixstories-1 |	Rules of physics and rules of men who sit on various bureaucratic boards and bodies
EDL	00:14:35,519	00:14:41,407	| 99pi-0098-sixstories-1 |	And those rules dictated that if Stearns wanted to build one of those 10-story office towers that were all the rage in 1888
EDL	00:14:42,175	00:14:46,271	| 99pi-0098-sixstories-1 |	He would need to build walls of stone and brick that were 5 feet thick

EDL	00:15:02,143	00:15:06,239	| 99pi-0098-sixstories-1 |	And he would be asking the quintessential modern Titan of American industry

EDL	00:15:08,031	00:15:10,847	| 99pi-0098-sixstories-1 |	Better suited for a monk Illuminating a manuscript
EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:14,943	| 99pi-0098-sixstories-1 |	Stearns asked all the best Architects for a solution

EDL	00:15:25,695	00:15:26,463	| 99pi-0098-sixstories-1 |	Weather Flagstaff
EDL	00:15:27,743	00:15:30,559	| 99pi-0098-sixstories-1 |	What Stearns wanted was a blade of grass
EDL	00:15:31,583	00:15:34,143	| 99pi-0098-sixstories-1 |	And they weren't in the blade of grass building business
EDL	00:15:34,143	00:15:35,679	| 99pi-0098-sixstories-1 |	They told him it couldn't be done
EDL	00:15:36,447	00:15:37,983	| 99pi-0098-sixstories-1 |	Everyone except Bradford Gilbert
EDL	00:15:39,007	00:15:42,847	| 99pi-0098-sixstories-1 |	The in-house architect for the New York Lake Erie and Western Railroad
EDL	00:15:42,847	00:15:43,615	| 99pi-0098-sixstories-1 |	Had an idea
EDL	00:15:44,127	00:15:49,503	| 99pi-0098-sixstories-1 |	Even the simplest train trip between two of his Backwater stations often required stunning Feats of engineering
EDL	00:15:50,271	00:15:54,623	| 99pi-0098-sixstories-1 |	Hundreds of tons of cars in cargo hurdle over thin trestles and bridges everyday
EDL	00:15:55,647	00:15:57,439	| 99pi-0098-sixstories-1 |	What if he turned one of those bridges
EDL	00:15:59,231	00:16:02,559	| 99pi-0098-sixstories-1 |	What if he was one of the steel frame that so capably carry trains
EDL	00:16:03,327	00:16:04,351	| 99pi-0098-sixstories-1 |	And built it up
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:05,631	| 99pi-0098-sixstories-1 |	Instead of out
EDL	00:16:06,399	00:16:08,447	| 99pi-0098-sixstories-1 |	He told Stern that if he did this
EDL	00:16:08,447	00:16:10,239	| 99pi-0098-sixstories-1 |	The walls wouldn't have to be 5 feet 6
EDL	00:16:11,263	00:16:12,543	| 99pi-0098-sixstories-1 |	They could be 9 in
EDL	00:16:13,311	00:16:16,127	| 99pi-0098-sixstories-1 |	I'm in the 20-foot wide office spaces that that would create
EDL	00:16:16,639	00:16:20,735	| 99pi-0098-sixstories-1 |	The quintessential modern Titan of American industry would have room to stretch out of legs
