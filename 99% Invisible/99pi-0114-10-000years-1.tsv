EDL	00:07:39,519	00:07:42,079	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	So they'd have kind of two separate thinking process

EDL	00:07:46,431	00:07:47,711	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Delete down the ground rules
EDL	00:07:47,711	00:07:49,503	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	They told us to assume

EDL	00:07:58,463	00:08:03,071	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	But who's alive 500 or 5000 or 10000 years from now
EDL	00:08:03,583	00:08:05,119	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	How can you make a message

EDL	00:08:08,959	00:08:09,727	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	And why
EDL	00:08:09,727	00:08:10,495	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Why
EDL	00:08:10,495	00:08:11,519	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	10000 years
EDL	00:08:11,519	00:08:17,919	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	As far as I can determine the the logic seem to be well if we told him to design a marker to last two
EDL	00:08:17,919	00:08:21,503	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	150000 years is that clearly or ridiculous and absurd proposition
EDL	00:08:22,015	00:08:24,575	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	2000 years doesn't sound quite so crazy
EDL	00:08:24,575	00:08:27,391	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	It was it was just pulled out of the air
EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:33,023	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	In other words even though this site is going to be radioactive for hundreds of thousands of years
EDL	00:08:33,023	00:08:37,887	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	This panel is only responsible for keeping this place efficiently labeled for humans

EDL	00:08:41,215	00:08:43,519	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Think about where Humanity was 10000 years ago
EDL	00:08:44,287	00:08:47,359	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Back then there was a hot new technology taking the World by storm

EDL	00:08:54,783	00:09:01,183	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Biologically we are the same people we were 10000 years ago going back over 40
EDL	00:09:01,183	00:09:01,951	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	A Thousand Years
EDL	00:09:01,951	00:09:05,535	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	But culturally we share almost nothing with these people
EDL	00:09:05,535	00:09:07,071	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Definitely not language
EDL	00:09:07,071	00:09:09,375	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Well no cuz the linguist

EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:17,311	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	And it's half life
EDL	00:09:17,311	00:09:18,079	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Isn't very long

EDL	00:10:04,927	00:10:06,975	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	It's just as confusing on the written page

EDL	00:10:18,239	00:10:21,055	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	There are some languages that are very resistant

EDL	00:11:47,583	00:11:53,727	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	It was designed to be put on cleaning products and other household poisons to let kids know at whatever's inside

EDL	00:11:56,799	00:11:58,335	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	And so thinking along those lines
EDL	00:11:58,847	00:12:00,639	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	They considered another logo
EDL	00:12:00,639	00:12:02,431	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Which they thought might be Universal

EDL	00:12:10,111	00:12:11,391	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	You just need the right symbol
EDL	00:12:11,903	00:12:12,415	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	And

EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:47,231	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Huh at Adams School
EDL	00:12:47,743	00:12:49,791	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	And the bones are the symbol of the Resurrection
EDL	00:12:50,815	00:12:52,863	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	So instead of it being a symbol of death
EDL	00:12:52,863	00:12:54,911	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	It was a symbol of resurrection and rebirth
EDL	00:12:55,679	00:12:57,983	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	But fast forward a couple of centuries
EDL	00:12:58,495	00:13:04,383	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	There's a lot of trade going on Merchant ships traveling to and fro and in the ship's log
EDL	00:13:04,383	00:13:05,919	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	If a sailor died
EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:10,015	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	The captain would put a little skull and crossbones next to his name
EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:14,623	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	And a lot of the sailors came to associate that symbol
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:21,023	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	With death the rebirth part of it was kind of lost fast forward another Century you got time
EDL	00:13:21,023	00:13:27,423	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Without marauding on the high seas they plundered other boats and stole their cargo and along the way some Pirates realize
EDL	00:13:27,423	00:13:31,775	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	We could use a symbol to let their targets know who they were
EDL	00:13:31,775	00:13:38,175	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	A branding campaign to terrify they're targets into compliance clear
EDL	00:13:38,175	00:13:41,247	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Pirates and if you don't surrender
EDL	00:13:41,247	00:13:45,087	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	We're going to kill you if your guess
EDL	00:13:46,111	00:13:48,415	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	But there are actually several different icon
EDL	00:13:48,415	00:13:49,695	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	That pirates used
EDL	00:13:49,695	00:13:51,231	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	For example a heart
EDL	00:13:51,743	00:13:53,535	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	With blood dripping out of it
EDL	00:13:53,535	00:13:58,143	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	That was a popular pirate flag and an even more popular symbol with an hourglass
EDL	00:13:58,143	00:14:00,191	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	An hourglass an hourglass

EDL	00:14:00,959	00:14:03,263	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	If you don't surrender in a certain amount of time
EDL	00:14:03,775	00:14:09,151	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	We're going to kill you all so The Hourglass for a while was the was the most feared
EDL	00:14:09,151	00:14:10,175	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Pirate symbol
EDL	00:14:11,455	00:14:17,087	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	But then one of the Calico Jack Rackham
EDL	00:14:17,087	00:14:18,623	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Was captured and put on trial
EDL	00:14:19,391	00:14:20,159	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	In the legal proceedings
EDL	00:14:20,671	00:14:23,231	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	It came out that two of the Pirates and Calico Jack's
EDL	00:14:23,231	00:14:23,999	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	True
EDL	00:14:23,999	00:14:24,511	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	We're women
EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:26,303	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	And that one of them was
EDL	00:14:26,303	00:14:27,839	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Pregnant with Calico Jack's child
EDL	00:14:28,607	00:14:29,375	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	This was
EDL	00:14:29,375	00:14:31,167	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	D tablets game of the day
EDL	00:14:31,167	00:14:34,495	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Everyone in England was reading about this trial
EDL	00:14:35,007	00:14:36,543	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Anyway it just so happened that

EDL	00:14:38,079	00:14:39,359	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Was the Jolly Roger
EDL	00:14:39,871	00:14:42,431	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Though in his case the bones were replaced with a pair of

EDL	00:14:43,967	00:14:44,991	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Quick aside
EDL	00:14:44,991	00:14:48,831	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	The name Jolly Roger is probably an English Corruption of the French

EDL	00:14:50,111	00:14:50,879	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Work
EDL	00:14:50,879	00:14:51,903	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Pretty red
EDL	00:14:51,903	00:14:53,695	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Because the original pirate flag
EDL	00:14:53,695	00:14:54,719	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Or red
EDL	00:14:54,719	00:14:55,487	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Not black
EDL	00:14:55,999	00:14:56,767	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	After that trial
EDL	00:14:57,279	00:14:59,839	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Installing crossbones started showing up on book covers
EDL	00:14:59,839	00:15:05,471	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Treasure Island kind of novels and crossbones with permeating culture as a symbol of danger
EDL	00:15:05,471	00:15:07,263	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Jump Ahead to the late 1800s
EDL	00:15:07,775	00:15:11,871	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Dye factories in Germany started using the skull and crossbones with the symbol for poison
EDL	00:15:12,639	00:15:18,015	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Half a century later than Nazis adopted it as the symbol for their SS death head

EDL	00:15:19,295	00:15:20,831	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Skull and crossbones
EDL	00:15:20,831	00:15:23,135	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Came to be associated with danger and death
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:23,903	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Around the world
EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:25,439	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	But
EDL	00:15:25,439	00:15:26,463	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Did it become Universal
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:27,487	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Not really
EDL	00:15:27,999	00:15:29,535	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Think about what's happened with
EDL	00:15:29,535	00:15:30,303	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Discount crossbow
EDL	00:15:30,303	00:15:31,583	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Last 20-30 years
EDL	00:15:32,351	00:15:33,119	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Gone mainstream
EDL	00:15:33,887	00:15:36,959	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Now you'll see it on kids book bags on onesies for infants
EDL	00:15:36,959	00:15:39,007	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	You can even buy water bottle
EDL	00:15:39,007	00:15:40,031	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	With the skull and crossed
EDL	00:15:41,055	00:15:42,335	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	So much for the whole
EDL	00:15:42,335	00:15:43,103	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Play something
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:49,503	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	In the original meaning as it pertained to Adam and the resurrection is long gone
EDL	00:15:49,503	00:15:50,527	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	We took from this
EDL	00:15:50,527	00:15:51,039	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Is that
EDL	00:15:51,807	00:15:52,575	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Symbols
EDL	00:15:52,575	00:15:53,599	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Can change
EDL	00:15:53,599	00:15:55,135	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Iconographic adrift
EDL	00:15:55,135	00:15:55,647	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Haven't
EDL	00:15:56,159	00:15:58,719	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	And we haven't even touched on cultural interpretation
EDL	00:15:59,231	00:16:01,023	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Like there's a candy company in Mex
EDL	00:16:01,023	00:16:02,047	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Call la Catrina
EDL	00:16:02,559	00:16:05,887	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	And their logo the logo that goes on the packaging for their sweet
EDL	00:16:06,399	00:16:07,167	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Is a

EDL	00:16:07,935	00:16:12,543	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	And so to bring us back to the website in New Mexico
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:15,871	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Realize that symbols couldn't be trusted to mean the same things over.
EDL	00:16:16,895	00:16:19,711	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Next idea we could tell a little story
EDL	00:16:19,711	00:16:20,479	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Using sticks
EDL	00:16:20,991	00:16:22,271	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Visual storytelling
EDL	00:16:22,783	00:16:26,111	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Let's stick together like any five-year-old can draw
EDL	00:16:26,111	00:16:26,879	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	A circle on top
EDL	00:16:27,391	00:16:28,927	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Trunk two arms and two legs
EDL	00:16:29,439	00:16:30,207	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Why
EDL	00:16:30,207	00:16:31,999	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Well there are two things
EDL	00:16:31,999	00:16:33,791	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	It seemed to be Universal
EDL	00:16:34,303	00:16:35,071	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Inhuman or
EDL	00:16:35,583	00:16:36,863	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	What is a stick figure
EDL	00:16:37,375	00:16:43,519	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	And you find them or drawing on the walls of the caves in the cave paintings that are 25000 years old
EDL	00:16:44,031	00:16:50,175	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Which by the way maybe the only piece of graphic art survive in for more than 10,000 years
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:51,455	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Art food we can draw meaning
EDL	00:16:51,967	00:16:54,783	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	And John says there's another convention that is universal
EDL	00:16:54,783	00:16:56,575	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	A sequence of events
EDL	00:16:56,575	00:16:58,879	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	First this happened then this happened then this house
EDL	00:16:59,647	00:17:01,439	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	So like a narrative
EDL	00:17:01,439	00:17:03,999	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	A story storyboard a comic strip
EDL	00:17:05,279	00:17:06,047	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	You just find it everywhere

EDL	00:17:21,919	00:17:26,527	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	That child is a little bit bigger now and the sapling behind him has grown a little bit

EDL	00:24:58,880	00:25:00,416	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Yeah I started wondering like
EDL	00:25:01,952	00:25:02,976	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	A bit ridiculous
EDL	00:25:04,256	00:25:05,792	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	What was researching the story

EDL	00:25:24,480	00:25:28,064	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Anyway it turned out that this plant was never very good about dealing with it
EDL	00:25:29,088	00:25:31,904	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Beryllium dust and other toxins made their way

EDL	00:25:55,200	00:25:56,224	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Dragging out the lawsuit
EDL	00:25:56,992	00:25:58,784	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	The reason I bring this up
EDL	00:25:58,784	00:26:01,088	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	It's because Lockheed Martin happens to be the
EDL	00:26:01,088	00:26:02,880	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Parent company of Sandia National Lab
EDL	00:26:03,648	00:26:06,208	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	The corporation that runs the website over in New Mexico
EDL	00:26:06,976	00:26:08,000	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	And this piece of Taliban
EDL	00:26:08,512	00:26:09,536	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Is hardly unique
EDL	00:26:10,304	00:26:12,864	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	There are literally thousands of towns across United
EDL	00:26:13,376	00:26:13,888	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Many of them
EDL	00:26:14,400	00:26:15,936	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Low income or communities

EDL	00:26:18,240	00:26:19,008	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	It in similar ways
EDL	00:26:21,824	00:26:25,664	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	And so the 10000 year with marker system
EDL	00:26:26,176	00:26:27,712	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	But maybe a little misguided
EDL	00:26:28,736	00:26:31,808	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	I am all for taking care of people 10000 years in the future

EDL	00:26:34,368	00:26:37,440	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Is to start taking care of people that are alive
EDL	00:26:37,440	00:26:37,952	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	Today
EDL	00:26:38,976	00:26:41,536	| 99pi-0114-10-000years-1 |	That way there might be humans in 10000 years
