EDL	00:03:19,936	00:03:22,752	| 99pi-0261.5-199-rebroad-yinandyangofbasketball.1 |	That continues to define the way the game is played

EDL	00:03:34,272	00:03:38,112	| 99pi-0261.5-199-rebroad-yinandyangofbasketball.1 |	Naismith chose to hang the peach basket at 10 feet above the porch floor
EDL	00:03:38,624	00:03:41,440	| 99pi-0261.5-199-rebroad-yinandyangofbasketball.1 |	There was a running track that went around the court at that level
EDL	00:03:41,440	00:03:44,000	| 99pi-0261.5-199-rebroad-yinandyangofbasketball.1 |	But otherwise the decision was pretty random
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:46,560	| 99pi-0261.5-199-rebroad-yinandyangofbasketball.1 |	And just a little higher or a little lower
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:48,352	| 99pi-0261.5-199-rebroad-yinandyangofbasketball.1 |	And everything would be different
EDL	00:03:50,912	00:03:52,448	| 99pi-0261.5-199-rebroad-yinandyangofbasketball.1 |	That arbitrary decision

EDL	00:03:59,104	00:04:00,384	| 99pi-0261.5-199-rebroad-yinandyangofbasketball.1 |	But it happened gradually
EDL	00:04:00,384	00:04:03,968	| 99pi-0261.5-199-rebroad-yinandyangofbasketball.1 |	In fact in the beginning the game was played by shorter less imposing

EDL	00:05:13,087	00:05:18,207	| 99pi-0261.5-199-rebroad-yinandyangofbasketball.1 |	Mike and with such a force they actually had to change some rules in the game to offset his advantage
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:22,047	| 99pi-0261.5-199-rebroad-yinandyangofbasketball.1 |	For example the rule against goaltending came about because it might
