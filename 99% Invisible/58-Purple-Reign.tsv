EDL	00:05:11,039	00:05:11,807	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Then
EDL	00:05:11,807	00:05:13,343	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Slowly over time
EDL	00:05:13,343	00:05:15,647	| 58-Purple-Reign |	It became Lincoln Woods most infamous building

EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:40,735	| 58-Purple-Reign |	That's not why everyone in the area knows the building
EDL	00:05:40,735	00:05:43,295	| 58-Purple-Reign |	If you know nothing of its history it's still
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:45,343	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Pretty hard to miss

EDL	00:06:52,671	00:06:54,463	| 58-Purple-Reign |	And I was the designer of the purple
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:56,255	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Finally
EDL	00:06:56,767	00:07:00,351	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Now you have to understand that when I say the building is purple
EDL	00:07:00,351	00:07:03,423	| 58-Purple-Reign |	I don't mean the kind of purple of saying Iris
EDL	00:07:03,423	00:07:04,191	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Store a plum
EDL	00:07:04,703	00:07:07,007	| 58-Purple-Reign |	It's purple as an lavender
EDL	00:07:07,007	00:07:11,615	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Lavender purple glazed brick all over pretty much the entire thing
EDL	00:07:11,615	00:07:14,431	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Which needless to say makes it stand out
EDL	00:07:14,943	00:07:16,479	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Depending on how you look at it
EDL	00:07:16,479	00:07:18,015	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Like a prized Jewel
EDL	00:07:18,015	00:07:19,295	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Or sore thumb
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:22,623	| 58-Purple-Reign |	What are the few buildings if you see it once you know it
EDL	00:07:22,623	00:07:25,439	| 58-Purple-Reign |	You single forever you can't feel
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:30,815	| 58-Purple-Reign |	It is so purple that after it changed hands the new owners renamed it
EDL	00:07:32,095	00:07:33,119	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Purple
EDL	00:07:33,119	00:07:33,631	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Hotel
EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:36,447	| 58-Purple-Reign |	WBEZ architecture critic
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:36,959	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Wee Bey
EDL	00:07:37,471	00:07:40,031	| 58-Purple-Reign |	I think that it's worth looking at
EDL	00:07:40,543	00:07:46,175	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Absent the break the brick I like but I wish you could eat also prom glasses I can filter it out so you don't see
EDL	00:07:46,175	00:07:46,943	| 58-Purple-Reign |	The Brick
EDL	00:07:46,943	00:07:48,479	| 58-Purple-Reign |	At least in one trip
EDL	00:07:48,479	00:07:51,551	| 58-Purple-Reign |	And really see how the building hold yourself together structure
EDL	00:07:51,551	00:07:53,087	| 58-Purple-Reign |	I think it's really
EDL	00:07:53,087	00:07:56,671	| 58-Purple-Reign |	The way the John was able to put those supports on the outside of the hotel
EDL	00:07:56,671	00:08:01,535	| 58-Purple-Reign |	To get larger floor plates in the middle versus what you want what you want big function spaces
EDL	00:08:02,047	00:08:04,607	| 58-Purple-Reign |	And then I get a little mix of green space in the way that I'm
EDL	00:08:05,119	00:08:10,495	| 58-Purple-Reign |	So the building is going to stick together with a lot of good things going on there
EDL	00:08:10,495	00:08:12,543	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Architecture
EDL	00:08:14,079	00:08:17,151	| 58-Purple-Reign |	The thing that everybody notices first including architects
EDL	00:08:18,175	00:08:18,687	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Would be the
EDL	00:08:19,455	00:08:23,039	| 58-Purple-Reign |	I mean I think that if anybody saying that it's not the color that they're lying
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:24,575	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Because you can't really look at the building
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:25,599	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Stop noticing
EDL	00:08:26,111	00:08:26,623	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Purple
EDL	00:08:27,647	00:08:30,207	| 58-Purple-Reign |	So it's the only purple building around but then
EDL	00:08:30,719	00:08:36,351	| 58-Purple-Reign |	You know after that initial wave of color hits you you notice really what a great modernist structure it has
EDL	00:08:36,863	00:08:38,655	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Structure is expressed on the owl
EDL	00:08:38,655	00:08:41,471	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Side which is also not something you see everyday anymore
EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:43,775	| 58-Purple-Reign |	I think it's a wonder
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:49,151	| 58-Purple-Reign |	That was Jackie cool founding principle of the architectural firm coo and Associates

EDL	00:08:51,199	00:08:55,039	| 58-Purple-Reign |	The first the story of why and how the building got to be so
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:56,063	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Purple
EDL	00:08:56,575	00:08:57,599	| 58-Purple-Reign |	My dad
EDL	00:08:57,599	00:08:58,367	| 58-Purple-Reign |	John Maxson
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:09:01,183	| 58-Purple-Reign |	It was commissioned by the pritzkers
EDL	00:09:01,695	00:09:03,743	| 58-Purple-Reign |	The Benedict family in Chicago
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:05,535	| 58-Purple-Reign |	And it was
EDL	00:09:06,303	00:09:08,351	| 58-Purple-Reign |	The first Hyatt Hotel
EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:09,887	| 58-Purple-Reign |	In the Midwest
EDL	00:09:10,399	00:09:11,423	| 58-Purple-Reign |	It was called
EDL	00:09:11,423	00:09:12,191	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Hiatus
EDL	00:09:12,703	00:09:13,983	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Have nothing to do with it
EDL	00:09:13,983	00:09:16,287	| 58-Purple-Reign |	The purple by the way the purple came
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:20,639	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Because one of the pritzker say and the big man among them
EDL	00:09:21,407	00:09:22,687	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Fiskars in the family
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:24,479	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Ask me what
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:24,991	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Color
EDL	00:09:25,503	00:09:27,039	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Play style I want the news
EDL	00:09:27,551	00:09:29,087	| 58-Purple-Reign |	And I wanted to use Gray
EDL	00:09:29,087	00:09:30,623	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Adhesive install
EDL	00:09:30,623	00:09:32,671	| 58-Purple-Reign |	I like something brighter
EDL	00:09:33,183	00:09:35,487	| 58-Purple-Reign |	So I made a mistake of showing him
EDL	00:09:35,487	00:09:36,511	| 58-Purple-Reign |	The samples

EDL	00:09:44,447	00:09:45,215	| 58-Purple-Reign |	It sure enough
EDL	00:09:45,727	00:09:46,751	| 58-Purple-Reign |	You pick the purple
EDL	00:09:47,263	00:09:49,311	| 58-Purple-Reign |	And you don't argue with a n pritzker
EDL	00:09:55,711	00:09:59,551	| 58-Purple-Reign |	My father tells me the story but I suspect differently
EDL	00:09:59,551	00:10:02,879	| 58-Purple-Reign |	He's always gravitated toward bold color choices
EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:08,767	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Our current argument is over bright orange balconies on a building that we always passed he loves them
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:09,791	| 58-Purple-Reign |	And I hate
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:14,911	| 58-Purple-Reign |	When I was growing up his favorite color was blue a color that to me uses
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:16,447	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Suspiciously close
EDL	00:10:16,447	00:10:17,471	| 58-Purple-Reign |	To purple
EDL	00:10:17,471	00:10:19,775	| 58-Purple-Reign |	In fact every house we ever lived in
EDL	00:10:19,775	00:10:22,591	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Brick bungalow summer house in the woods
EDL	00:10:22,591	00:10:24,383	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Suburban Barn shaped house
EDL	00:10:24,383	00:10:27,199	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Mustard colored siding all had bright
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:28,223	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Blue front doors
EDL	00:10:28,735	00:10:29,759	| 58-Purple-Reign |	That my father painted
EDL	00:10:30,271	00:10:33,343	| 58-Purple-Reign |	My elementary school bus driver used to call me Blue Door
EDL	00:10:33,855	00:10:35,391	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Upon interrogation
EDL	00:10:35,391	00:10:38,207	| 58-Purple-Reign |	My father coughed up is strange Hungarian Lodge
EDL	00:10:38,975	00:10:40,255	| 58-Purple-Reign |	In the near East
EDL	00:10:41,279	00:10:43,071	| 58-Purple-Reign |	But ultimately I come from
EDL	00:10:43,583	00:10:46,399	| 58-Purple-Reign |	The blue color on the doors blue and green
EDL	00:10:46,911	00:10:49,471	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Is to keep the evil spirits away
EDL	00:10:50,495	00:10:51,775	| 58-Purple-Reign |	So that's a reason
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:53,055	| 58-Purple-Reign |	I always suspected
EDL	00:10:53,567	00:10:54,079	| 58-Purple-Reign |	The
EDL	00:10:54,591	00:10:55,615	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Entrance Door

EDL	00:10:56,895	00:10:58,431	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Blue to keep the evil spirits
EDL	00:10:59,199	00:10:59,711	| 58-Purple-Reign |	If it did
EDL	00:11:00,479	00:11:01,247	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Do you think it works
EDL	00:11:01,247	00:11:02,015	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Hotel
EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:06,111	| 58-Purple-Reign |	So you don't think the purple kept away the evil eye from the hotel
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:07,647	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Not really
EDL	00:11:08,159	00:11:08,927	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Because
EDL	00:11:08,927	00:11:12,511	| 58-Purple-Reign |	And that was a murder in the hotel actually there were two
EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:13,279	| 58-Purple-Reign |	But I digress
EDL	00:11:14,559	00:11:17,119	| 58-Purple-Reign |	The beauty of that building is the exposed
EDL	00:11:18,143	00:11:19,167	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Concrete strain
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:20,959	| 58-Purple-Reign |	How to tell him sorry
EDL	00:11:21,471	00:11:23,007	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Pulled out of the stuff
EDL	00:11:23,007	00:11:24,031	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Showing
EDL	00:11:25,567	00:11:27,103	| 58-Purple-Reign |	It's like a human being
EDL	00:11:27,103	00:11:29,663	| 58-Purple-Reign |	The skeleton will be on the exterior
EDL	00:11:29,663	00:11:30,687	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Especially
EDL	00:11:30,687	00:11:33,759	| 58-Purple-Reign |	That would be weird right now that's that's stick
EDL	00:11:33,759	00:11:35,807	| 58-Purple-Reign |	The building is that column set
EDL	00:11:36,319	00:11:36,831	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Pose.
EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:38,111	| 58-Purple-Reign |	The slap site
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:39,903	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Slightly pulled out
EDL	00:11:39,903	00:11:40,927	| 58-Purple-Reign |	It's a Building B
EDL	00:11:41,439	00:11:42,975	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Reviews
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:43,999	| 58-Purple-Reign |	It's structures
EDL	00:11:45,023	00:11:47,327	| 58-Purple-Reign |	And that is architectural
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:49,119	| 58-Purple-Reign |	The interesting thing about
EDL	00:11:52,703	00:11:53,471	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Dudley lullaby
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:55,263	| 58-Purple-Reign |	It could be green
EDL	00:11:55,263	00:11:55,775	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Okay
EDL	00:11:56,799	00:11:58,847	| 58-Purple-Reign |	It would be the same good or bad built
EDL	00:11:59,871	00:12:01,919	| 58-Purple-Reign |	So as an architect I have to ask you
EDL	00:12:03,455	00:12:06,015	| 58-Purple-Reign |	This is a perfect example of
EDL	00:12:06,783	00:12:07,551	| 58-Purple-Reign |	What the
EDL	00:12:07,551	00:12:09,599	| 58-Purple-Reign |	But the difference between what the public sees
EDL	00:12:10,367	00:12:11,135	| 58-Purple-Reign |	And what the Arctic
EDL	00:12:12,927	00:12:15,231	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Because the public sees purple brick
EDL	00:12:15,231	00:12:16,255	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Ark
EDL	00:12:16,255	00:12:18,815	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Protecta sitting here saying the purple is so
EDL	00:12:19,327	00:12:20,351	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Unimportant
EDL	00:12:20,351	00:12:21,375	| 58-Purple-Reign |	In the scheme of the building
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:23,167	| 58-Purple-Reign |	It means nothing
EDL	00:12:23,167	00:12:25,215	| 58-Purple-Reign |	It's just such a tiny thing but to the
EDL	00:12:25,215	00:12:26,495	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Public that's all it is
EDL	00:12:27,263	00:12:29,311	| 58-Purple-Reign |	That's right because the public is ignorant
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:34,175	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Truly ignorant
EDL	00:12:34,943	00:12:36,991	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Well you can't really argue with them there
EDL	00:12:36,991	00:12:39,551	| 58-Purple-Reign |	But in our defense and account myself is
EDL	00:12:39,551	00:12:41,599	| 58-Purple-Reign |	One of the public in the scenario
EDL	00:12:41,599	00:12:47,999	| 58-Purple-Reign |	It's really really purple Smite how far the purple Hotel fell from its original Glory the
EDL	00:12:47,999	00:12:52,607	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Dilapidation the murderer the drug-fueled sex parties and a demolition order
EDL	00:12:52,607	00:12:54,399	| 58-Purple-Reign |	It was not torn down
EDL	00:12:54,399	00:12:55,423	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Time passed
EDL	00:12:55,423	00:12:56,959	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Economy fell to pieces
EDL	00:12:56,959	00:12:59,007	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Mid-century architecture
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:13:00,799	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Slowly came back into Vogue
EDL	00:13:00,799	00:13:02,335	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Mad Men was on TV
EDL	00:13:02,847	00:13:08,991	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Purple brick was kind of retro cool. However dim was starting to shine on the building and its future
EDL	00:13:09,759	00:13:15,903	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Then the purple Hotel was nominated for landmark status a place on the historic registry
EDL	00:13:16,415	00:13:19,231	| 58-Purple-Reign |	There was talk of finding a buyer talk of renovation
EDL	00:13:19,231	00:13:23,839	| 58-Purple-Reign |	And then while I was searching and interviewing for this very story
EDL	00:13:23,839	00:13:25,119	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Purple Hotel
EDL	00:13:25,119	00:13:25,887	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Went up
EDL	00:13:25,887	00:13:29,727	| 58-Purple-Reign |	For auction there was a lot of Pomp and Circumstance in the beginning of
EDL	00:13:30,239	00:13:33,823	| 58-Purple-Reign |	You know the auctioneer yelling and saying
EDL	00:13:33,823	00:13:35,103	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Are you ready
EDL	00:13:37,151	00:13:39,199	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Booming voice and then and then
EDL	00:13:39,199	00:13:39,711	| 58-Purple-Reign |	And then
EDL	00:13:40,735	00:13:41,503	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Really
EDL	00:13:41,503	00:13:42,783	| 58-Purple-Reign |	There was only one bidder so
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:52,767	| 58-Purple-Reign |	And that bitter was Jake Weiss of Weiss properties in Skokie which happens to be right next to Lincolnwood
EDL	00:13:53,279	00:13:55,327	| 58-Purple-Reign |	He bought the purple Hotel
EDL	00:13:55,327	00:13:59,679	| 58-Purple-Reign |	And why why is a shrewd businessman with a Keen Eye and good instincts
EDL	00:13:59,679	00:14:01,471	| 58-Purple-Reign |	This particular purchase
EDL	00:14:01,471	00:14:02,495	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Was also
EDL	00:14:02,495	00:14:06,847	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Labor of love when you have some of that really is just not realizing of the value and it's
EDL	00:14:06,847	00:14:07,615	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Potential
EDL	00:14:07,615	00:14:08,383	| 58-Purple-Reign |	That is such
EDL	00:14:08,383	00:14:12,735	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Prime piece of property that bothers you you know it it's part of your neighbor as part of your community
EDL	00:14:13,247	00:14:16,831	| 58-Purple-Reign |	And it's something that you really want to see be an asset to the community instead of a blight
EDL	00:14:16,831	00:14:18,879	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Here comes the love part
EDL	00:14:18,879	00:14:20,671	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Separately from that when my
EDL	00:14:21,183	00:14:22,719	| 58-Purple-Reign |	And more importantly I think
EDL	00:14:22,719	00:14:25,023	| 58-Purple-Reign |	We almost lived at the purple hotel for a period of time
EDL	00:14:25,535	00:14:26,303	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Maya
EDL	00:14:26,815	00:14:29,375	| 58-Purple-Reign |	When my grandfather passed away and my father was saying.
EDL	00:14:29,375	00:14:30,399	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Traditional Cottage
EDL	00:14:30,399	00:14:32,191	| 58-Purple-Reign |	That's the Jewish prayer for the Dead
EDL	00:14:32,191	00:14:36,287	| 58-Purple-Reign |	There was no synagogue anywhere in close proximity to where he lived at the time
EDL	00:14:36,799	00:14:39,615	| 58-Purple-Reign |	And because we're Orthodox when I drive on the Sabbath
EDL	00:14:39,615	00:14:41,663	| 58-Purple-Reign |	That was a little bit prohibitive to
EDL	00:14:41,663	00:14:42,175	| 58-Purple-Reign |	City college
EDL	00:14:42,687	00:14:43,967	| 58-Purple-Reign |	There's a very
EDL	00:14:44,991	00:14:51,391	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Convenient show right down the block so I'm
EDL	00:14:51,391	00:14:53,695	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Every single job is for a year
EDL	00:14:53,695	00:14:55,999	| 58-Purple-Reign |	How we would move into the purple Hotel
EDL	00:14:55,999	00:14:57,791	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Had to accommodate my fathers
EDL	00:14:57,791	00:14:59,839	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Responsibility to say the kaddish for his father
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:03,679	| 58-Purple-Reign |	So we lived there for about a year every single weekend
EDL	00:15:04,191	00:15:07,775	| 58-Purple-Reign |	And you know me my sister at the hotel was our playground
EDL	00:15:08,287	00:15:13,919	| 58-Purple-Reign |	And the architect Weiss is chosen to redesign the purple hotel and bring it back to its original luster
EDL	00:15:13,919	00:15:16,479	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Is Jackie COO of Jackie Cooper and Associates
EDL	00:15:16,991	00:15:17,759	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Also
EDL	00:15:17,759	00:15:20,575	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Former student of my father the original architect
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:21,343	| 58-Purple-Reign |	John Maxon
EDL	00:15:22,111	00:15:25,695	| 58-Purple-Reign |	One of the things that we're looking into is more of a historic
EDL	00:15:26,207	00:15:27,999	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Restoration of the building
EDL	00:15:27,999	00:15:32,607	| 58-Purple-Reign |	That would be wonderful I'm especially since we have some of the old drawings
EDL	00:15:32,607	00:15:36,959	| 58-Purple-Reign |	The original drawings from the 60s 1961 when it was constructed
EDL	00:15:36,959	00:15:41,311	| 58-Purple-Reign |	And there are a lot of pieces that are still left in the building such as this wonderful
EDL	00:15:41,311	00:15:47,711	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Monumental Terrazzo stair with this wood wall behind it I mean you can really see it as a
EDL	00:15:47,711	00:15:48,223	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Kind of
EDL	00:15:48,735	00:15:54,879	| 58-Purple-Reign |	You know late 50s early 60s kind of Mad Men era
EDL	00:15:54,879	00:15:56,415	| 58-Purple-Reign |	Pan Am sort of
