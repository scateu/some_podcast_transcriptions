EDL	00:09:32,671	00:09:33,951	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	I got to wondering
EDL	00:09:33,951	00:09:34,719	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	How close is
EDL	00:09:34,719	00:09:35,231	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	Is 2 closed
EDL	00:09:35,743	00:09:37,279	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	I want to play a game
EDL	00:09:37,279	00:09:40,351	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	Basically I'm just going to give you
EDL	00:09:40,351	00:09:41,887	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	Potential logos
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:46,495	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	Like whether or not I would think that they would be an infringement
EDL	00:09:46,495	00:09:47,007	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	Okay
EDL	00:09:47,519	00:09:48,799	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	Let's say you saw my stomach
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:51,103	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	Stomach
EDL	00:09:53,407	00:09:54,943	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	I guess I would say yes
EDL	00:09:54,943	00:09:57,503	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	I bike Melbourne eye and then a bicycle and
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:09:59,807	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	I mean
EDL	00:09:59,807	00:10:01,087	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	I guess I guess
EDL	00:10:02,111	00:10:06,975	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	I would have to see it it's all about like the design and like what the visual is invoking
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:10,815	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	CMG is Vigilant about trademark protection because they have to be
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:14,143	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	The way the law works is that if you don't defend your trademark well enough
EDL	00:10:14,143	00:10:14,911	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	You can lose it
EDL	00:10:15,423	00:10:17,983	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	So you think someone is ripping off work that you've tried more
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:19,263	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	And you try to sue them
EDL	00:10:19,263	00:10:22,591	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	If they can prove that you've done a bad job enforcing that trademark in the past
EDL	00:10:23,103	00:10:24,639	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	I just want to study with them
EDL	00:10:24,639	00:10:29,247	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	So it's cmg's job to err on the side of thinking that something is an infringement
EDL	00:10:29,247	00:10:31,039	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	My position is that everything is a nymph
EDL	00:10:32,319	00:10:36,671	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	Wait why because it's my job to protect the mark
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:42,815	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	So just because Claire thinks something is infringement it doesn't always mean there's a cease-and-desist letter in the mail from CMG
EDL	00:10:43,327	00:10:47,935	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	They send out about 200 I Love NY related cease-and-desist for year
EDL	00:10:47,935	00:10:52,287	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	Ironically one of the people to receive such a letter with Milton Glaser
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:53,567	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	Who remember
EDL	00:10:53,567	00:10:56,895	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	Did the original I Love NY design for free
EDL	00:10:56,895	00:10:58,175	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	2001
EDL	00:10:58,175	00:11:01,503	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	Right after 9/11 in an effort to raise money for local New York charities
EDL	00:11:02,015	00:11:05,343	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	Glazier created a new modified design that red
EDL	00:11:05,343	00:11:07,647	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	I Love NY more than ever
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:12,255	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	The state of New York land of apologizing to Glaser and chalked it up to a bureaucratic misunderstanding
EDL	00:11:13,279	00:11:18,143	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	Now we can go back and forth about whether or not this indicates something is broken and trademark law
EDL	00:11:18,143	00:11:20,447	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	Really the more interesting question is
EDL	00:11:20,447	00:11:24,799	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	Why does CMG eat a whole team of people working on I Love NY
EDL	00:11:24,799	00:11:31,199	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	I mean who would have thought that a government ad campaign from the 70s we need to be defended by a team of lawyers
EDL	00:11:31,199	00:11:35,295	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	I'm getting stolen and we mixed and modified in the countless permutations
EDL	00:11:35,807	00:11:36,575	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	I don't get it
EDL	00:11:37,087	00:11:38,367	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	I just
EDL	00:11:38,367	00:11:41,951	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	Totally don't understand that I have done a lot of things that are persistent
EDL	00:11:42,719	00:11:43,487	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	In the culture
EDL	00:11:43,487	00:11:44,767	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	It all started last
EDL	00:11:44,767	00:11:45,535	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	S560
EDL	00:11:46,303	00:11:47,327	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	Nothing like this
EDL	00:11:47,327	00:11:49,631	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	That doesn't make any sense at all
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:51,423	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	And you can probably guess who this
EDL	00:11:51,935	00:11:54,239	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	My name is William gleyzerman designer
EDL	00:11:55,263	00:11:59,359	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	And I spend my day pushing things around until they look good
EDL	00:11:59,359	00:12:00,127	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	That's what I do
EDL	00:12:00,639	00:12:02,943	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	It was clear from the beginning of our conversation
EDL	00:12:02,943	00:12:04,223	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	That Milton Glaser is
EDL	00:12:04,223	00:12:06,527	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	Really over talking about I love
EDL	00:12:06,527	00:12:07,295	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	And why
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:08,831	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	He's done a ton of other work
EDL	00:12:09,343	00:12:12,415	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	He didn't iconic Bob Dylan poster in Philip Roth book covers
EDL	00:12:12,927	00:12:14,719	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	He co-founded New York Magazine
EDL	00:12:15,231	00:12:17,791	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	And the 84 years old he's still working
EDL	00:12:17,791	00:12:21,887	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	Just recently he designed entire visual identity for Brooklyn Brewery
EDL	00:12:22,399	00:12:24,191	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	It for all his expertise as a designer
EDL	00:12:24,703	00:12:27,263	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	Even she doesn't understand the success of I Love NY
EDL	00:12:28,031	00:12:31,871	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	I would have thought it would have lost meaning a long time ago in fact I thought
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:34,687	| 99pi-0087-iheartny-tm-1 |	Better would be a 6 month campaign
