EDL	00:01:59,552	00:02:01,856	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	By the summer of 1961
EDL	00:02:01,856	00:02:04,160	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	There were 115 satellite

EDL	00:02:05,696	00:02:11,840	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	It was during that summer that the US launched an unmanned rocket carrying the transit for a satellite
EDL	00:02:11,840	00:02:18,240	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	And about 2 hours after launch the rocket blew up it was the first
EDL	00:02:18,240	00:02:24,640	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	Known object to unintentionally explode in space and it created about 300 fragment
EDL	00:02:24,640	00:02:31,040	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	Of totally useless space junk some of these pieces got pulled into the atmosphere and burn
EDL	00:02:31,040	00:02:31,808	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	Burned up
EDL	00:02:31,808	00:02:34,880	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	But around 200 are still up there today
EDL	00:02:35,648	00:02:41,024	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	At the time most people weren't all that concerned about a few bits of metal floating around in the vastness

EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:08,672	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	Is finite
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:11,488	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	And the amount that we use regularly
EDL	00:03:11,488	00:03:12,768	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	Is even more limited
EDL	00:03:13,792	00:03:16,608	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	Most satellites end up in a few particular Orbitz
EDL	00:03:17,120	00:03:18,144	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	Almost like
EDL	00:03:18,144	00:03:21,216	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	Freeways on the traffic on most freeways is actually
EDL	00:03:21,216	00:03:23,776	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	Conscious and that's where the Problem Child 3 marriage
EDL	00:03:24,288	00:03:25,312	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	As the traffic increases
EDL	00:03:25,824	00:03:27,872	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	So does the chance of collision
EDL	00:03:27,872	00:03:30,944	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	One of the regions of space that got busy pretty quickly
EDL	00:03:31,456	00:03:33,760	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	Is the area called Low Earth orbit
EDL	00:03:33,760	00:03:37,856	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	Special region of space that extends up to an altitude of about 2000 km
EDL	00:03:38,368	00:03:39,904	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	Baby heavily congested
EDL	00:03:40,416	00:03:43,488	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	And my satellite stops working in low earth orbit
EDL	00:03:43,488	00:03:46,304	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	I can stay in that region for hundreds of years
EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:48,096	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	By the mid-1960s
EDL	00:03:48,608	00:03:51,936	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	They were already lots of old into Funk satellite
EDL	00:03:51,936	00:03:52,704	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	Floating around
EDL	00:03:53,984	00:03:56,032	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	And nothing began to look into this
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:04:00,896	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	Based on your reading think about the potential issues of space debris opal debris
EDL	00:04:00,896	00:04:02,688	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	Might pose in the future
EDL	00:04:02,688	00:04:07,552	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	That was an activity that was really loud by don't cash that it was that not sure of the time
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:12,928	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	My name is Don Kessler I started the orbital debris program at NASA
EDL	00:04:12,928	00:04:17,536	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	Kessler is retired now but when he got started at Nasa he was studying media
EDL	00:04:18,559	00:04:21,375	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	And specifically what happens when two meteoroids
EDL	00:04:21,375	00:04:22,911	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	Collide and break apart in
EDL	00:04:22,911	00:04:23,423	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	And a smaller piece
EDL	00:04:24,447	00:04:27,263	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	Eventually Doncaster started doing similar research
EDL	00:04:27,263	00:04:27,775	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	Unspaced
EDL	00:04:28,287	00:04:29,823	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	Orb

EDL	00:04:31,615	00:04:34,943	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	Cancer was studying what happens when one piece collides with another
EDL	00:04:35,711	00:04:36,223	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	This is what you
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:39,295	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	Every time you have a breakup you increase the
EDL	00:04:39,295	00:04:41,087	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	Probability of another Collision
EDL	00:04:41,087	00:04:46,719	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	And that eventually just causes the whole population to continue to increase exponentially with time
EDL	00:04:46,719	00:04:49,023	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	This idea that space junk multiply
EDL	00:04:49,023	00:04:52,095	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	Like as more and more objects Collide and break apart
EDL	00:04:52,095	00:04:54,143	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	Came to be known as The Kessler Center
EDL	00:04:54,911	00:04:57,215	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	Intestinal predicted that the growth in space junk
EDL	00:04:57,727	00:04:58,495	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	What eventually
EDL	00:04:58,495	00:04:59,263	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	Snowball
EDL	00:04:59,263	00:05:01,823	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	And that cascading phenomena after
EDL	00:05:01,823	00:05:02,847	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	100 years
EDL	00:05:03,359	00:05:04,383	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	Gets to be
EDL	00:05:04,383	00:05:05,663	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	Well out of control
EDL	00:05:05,663	00:05:07,455	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	There's not much you can do about it and give it

EDL	00:05:09,247	00:05:10,783	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	Very hazardous to space
EDL	00:05:11,551	00:05:12,575	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	It's a growth
EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:14,879	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	In space junk went totally unchecked
EDL	00:05:14,879	00:05:18,207	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	Tesla predicted that space could become so filled with the
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:18,975	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	Debris
EDL	00:05:18,975	00:05:20,255	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	It would be difficult to

EDL	00:05:23,327	00:05:25,119	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	Kessler's findings were discussed
EDL	00:05:25,119	00:05:25,631	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	Throughout the speech
EDL	00:05:26,399	00:05:30,239	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	And in 1979 NASA started its orbital debris program
EDL	00:05:30,751	00:05:31,775	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	The study and monitor space
EDL	00:05:32,799	00:05:34,335	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	And they appointed him delete it
EDL	00:05:34,335	00:05:38,175	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	Around that same time people began to use face more and more
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:41,503	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	Countries all around the world were launching weather satellite

EDL	00:05:54,047	00:05:56,607	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	Lots of different countries were leaving trash

EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:43,679	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	To make space safe
EDL	00:09:43,679	00:09:47,263	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	Because there's already so much stuff up there and is Donald Kessler discovered

EDL	00:12:57,471	00:13:00,543	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	And there are objects in orbit that look nothing like a

EDL	00:13:41,503	00:13:43,039	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	But it paid off in another one in
EDL	00:13:43,039	00:13:45,343	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	Instead the Gordmans all-time favorite piece
EDL	00:13:46,367	00:13:47,135	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	Might be the track
EDL	00:13:48,159	00:13:51,487	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	Which the US Navy launch from Cape Canaveral in 19 6
EDL	00:13:52,255	00:13:53,279	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	And it was
EDL	00:13:53,279	00:13:54,047	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	The first
EDL	00:13:54,559	00:13:56,351	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	Satellite to have a poem
EDL	00:13:56,351	00:14:00,959	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	Ennis written by professor of Italian literature at Yale named Thomas Bergen

EDL	00:14:06,847	00:14:08,383	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	So it's kind of already conceived
EDL	00:14:08,383	00:14:09,663	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	Give us a cultural object
EDL	00:14:10,687	00:14:12,223	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	And that cultural object
EDL	00:14:12,223	00:14:12,735	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	Is still up there
EDL	00:14:13,247	00:14:15,807	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	Orbiting the Earth about 1000 km
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:17,343	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	The poem reads
EDL	00:14:21,183	00:14:23,743	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	As we come to claim our promise place
EDL	00:14:30,655	00:14:33,471	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	All of these objects might seem far away
EDL	00:14:33,471	00:14:33,983	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	INXS
EDL	00:14:34,751	00:14:36,799	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	But the day will likely come
EDL	00:14:36,799	00:14:37,567	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	When we can go and visit
EDL	00:14:38,079	00:14:42,431	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	You can already get to the International Space Station for a cool 20 million dollars
EDL	00:14:42,431	00:14:44,735	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	Gorman says that one day we will be able to

EDL	00:14:46,271	00:14:47,295	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	It's quite likely that
EDL	00:14:47,295	00:14:48,319	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	You know what it's
EDL	00:14:48,319	00:14:52,927	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	Accessible and affordable things to do people will go into space and maybe set some fats

EDL	00:14:54,207	00:14:55,999	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	And the two things we know

EDL	00:14:57,023	00:14:59,071	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	What's happened already that they will want to do
EDL	00:14:59,583	00:15:00,863	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	Is take a lot of photographs
EDL	00:15:01,887	00:15:02,399	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	And have sex
EDL	00:15:03,167	00:15:06,239	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	But after a while that's what's going to become old hat to
EDL	00:15:06,239	00:15:10,847	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	And what happens when zero g sex gets boring stores
EDL	00:15:11,359	00:15:12,127	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	That's what
EDL	00:15:12,127	00:15:12,895	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	You might have
EDL	00:15:12,895	00:15:18,783	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	Different kinds of toads as a satellite to you might say let's do the Cold War satellite
EDL	00:15:19,551	00:15:21,343	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	Or you might say
EDL	00:15:21,343	00:15:25,439	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	I'm not going to see all of the satellites it come from you. My nation space agency
EDL	00:15:25,951	00:15:27,743	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	So yeah I totally think this stuff
EDL	00:15:28,255	00:15:29,023	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	Is going to happen
EDL	00:15:30,047	00:15:32,863	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	It's going to be one of the things people to want
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:34,143	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	We actually have a space
EDL	00:15:34,655	00:15:36,191	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	Tourism industry
EDL	00:15:36,191	00:15:37,471	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	That people can afford
EDL	00:15:38,495	00:15:41,823	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	But the irony is in order to have viable space tourism
EDL	00:15:41,823	00:15:44,127	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	We need a safe orbital environment
EDL	00:15:44,127	00:15:48,991	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	And so if we don't find an effective way to clean up some of the junk in space
EDL	00:15:49,503	00:15:51,039	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	We might never be able
EDL	00:15:51,039	00:15:51,807	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	To go and see the good
EDL	00:15:52,831	00:15:54,111	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	It's kind of frightening it
EDL	00:15:54,879	00:15:55,903	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	In that much
EDL	00:15:55,903	00:15:56,415	| 99pi-0233-spactrashspacetreasure-1 |	Extreme version
