EDL	00:06:42,687	00:06:44,735	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	She wrote a book about the history of photography

EDL	00:07:07,519	00:07:09,055	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	She stopped thinking about it
EDL	00:07:09,823	00:07:11,615	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	At least until after the war

EDL	00:07:24,671	00:07:28,767	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	Walter gropius had work with the Museum of Modern Art in New York MoMA
EDL	00:07:28,767	00:07:30,815	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	To put together an exhibition on the Bauhaus
EDL	00:07:31,583	00:07:33,631	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	And because the war was still going on at the time
EDL	00:07:33,631	00:07:36,959	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	Moma hadn't been able to get many of the Bauhaus as objects

EDL	00:07:38,495	00:07:41,567	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	And so the exhibition was comprised mostly of photographs
EDL	00:07:42,079	00:07:43,615	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	Images of the products they design
EDL	00:07:44,127	00:07:47,199	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	The people who made them and the buildings were they worked and lived

EDL	00:08:27,903	00:08:30,975	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	Following World War II there was a surge of interest in the Bauhaus
EDL	00:08:31,487	00:08:37,119	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	All of their ideas about rationalism and modernism had caught on among both were Architects and designers
EDL	00:08:37,119	00:08:38,399	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	More and more books

EDL	00:08:44,031	00:08:48,383	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	And the quality seem to be better than you'd expect from duplications of old prints
EDL	00:08:48,895	00:08:50,431	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	Lucia begins to think that
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:51,967	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	Just maybe

EDL	00:08:58,879	00:08:59,903	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	And she begins to think
EDL	00:09:01,183	00:09:02,975	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	What are negative might have
EDL	00:09:02,975	00:09:03,743	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	Somehow
EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:04,511	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	Survived
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:06,047	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	So she starts to try to get
EDL	00:09:06,047	00:09:06,815	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	Are negatives back
EDL	00:09:08,351	00:09:11,679	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	Lucy's first move is to write to her ex-husband Lazlo

EDL	00:09:15,263	00:09:16,287	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	Lucia asked
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:19,871	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	If he had any clues about where the negatives she had left behind
EDL	00:09:19,871	00:09:20,895	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	Might have ended up

EDL	00:09:33,695	00:09:35,999	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	We need emigrated more than a decade earlier
EDL	00:09:36,511	00:09:38,815	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	Likely because he had friends who were higher up

EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:41,631	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	And so when gropius left room
EDL	00:09:42,143	00:09:43,935	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	He didn't have to flee in a hurry
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:46,495	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	He was able to carefully pack up his belongings

EDL	00:09:49,567	00:09:50,335	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	Among them
EDL	00:09:50,335	00:09:51,359	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	And bring them with him

EDL	00:09:52,127	00:09:53,663	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	Where he recently got a job
EDL	00:09:54,175	00:09:55,455	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	Lucia right to gropius
EDL	00:09:55,967	00:09:57,247	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	These negatives
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:09:58,015	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	Irreplaceable
EDL	00:09:58,527	00:09:59,551	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	Commence
EDL	00:09:59,551	00:10:00,319	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	Be extreme
EDL	00:10:00,319	00:10:00,831	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	Only useful
EDL	00:10:01,343	00:10:01,855	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	Now or
EDL	00:10:02,623	00:10:04,415	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	Walter gropius right back

EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:10,815	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	These photographs are extreme
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:15,423	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	So I hope
EDL	00:10:16,191	00:10:16,703	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	Deprive me
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:20,287	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	Lucia response to gropius same basically
EDL	00:10:20,287	00:10:22,079	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	I never gave you my negative

EDL	00:10:22,847	00:10:24,127	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	You did not expect me
EDL	00:10:24,127	00:10:25,151	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	To delay my departure
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:26,431	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	Order to draw up
EDL	00:10:26,943	00:10:27,455	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	Formal con
EDL	00:10:27,967	00:10:28,735	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	Stipulating
EDL	00:10:31,039	00:10:32,575	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	No formal agreement
EDL	00:10:32,575	00:10:33,855	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	Could have carried more weight
EDL	00:10:34,879	00:10:35,647	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	Friendship
EDL	00:10:35,647	00:10:37,183	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	It is this friendship I have
EDL	00:10:37,183	00:10:37,695	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	Always relied
EDL	00:10:38,207	00:10:39,487	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	And which also is
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:39,999	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	I am now in Boca
EDL	00:10:41,023	00:10:43,071	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	But when invoking friendship didn't work
EDL	00:10:43,071	00:10:44,351	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	Lucia hired a lawyer
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:45,887	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	Orochi gropius
EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:48,191	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	Did his holding onto Lucy is negative
EDL	00:10:48,191	00:10:53,055	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	Was like a firefighter saving a house and then claiming ownership of all the stuff inside
EDL	00:10:53,567	00:10:56,383	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	But still gropius was not giving them back
EDL	00:10:56,383	00:10:58,687	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	You stood never anything for anybody
EDL	00:10:59,455	00:10:59,967	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	Except
EDL	00:11:00,735	00:11:05,343	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	He didn't have her you wrote some very kind letters set yes yes
EDL	00:11:05,343	00:11:09,439	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	We have to think about it we have to think about it we have to think about it and he did not
EDL	00:11:12,767	00:11:17,119	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	This whole argument raises the question of who owns the image of a building
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:20,447	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	Intellectual property law on photography has evolved the years
EDL	00:11:20,447	00:11:22,239	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	And it still varies by country
EDL	00:11:22,239	00:11:23,263	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	But generally
EDL	00:11:23,263	00:11:26,079	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	If you take a picture of a two-dimensional thing like a painting
EDL	00:11:26,591	00:11:28,895	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	Doesn't show any Artistry on your part
EDL	00:11:28,895	00:11:32,223	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	And therefore you have no claim to the ownership of that image
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:34,783	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	But if you take a picture of a three dimensional thing
EDL	00:11:34,783	00:11:35,551	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	Like a building
EDL	00:11:36,063	00:11:37,343	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	You're making decisions about
EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:39,391	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	Position angle lighting
EDL	00:11:39,391	00:11:40,159	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	Framing
EDL	00:11:40,159	00:11:43,487	| 99pi-0225-PHOTOCREDIT-1 |	You're not just reproducing with quote-unquote really there
