EDL	00:07:39,775	00:07:42,847	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	He believed a business could be thought of as an intelligence

EDL	00:07:43,871	00:07:47,199	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	If the goal was to sell more product or work more efficiently
EDL	00:07:47,199	00:07:52,319	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	You could using the principles of cybernetics design the system to work toward those goals
EDL	00:07:53,343	00:07:59,487	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	But Stafford beer had never imagined he get to apply his ideas to helping a whole government 6/8
EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:02,815	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	And then I said which way must change my life
EDL	00:08:03,327	00:08:05,375	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	It was from the technical general manager

EDL	00:08:49,663	00:08:53,503	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	I can help them manage the bureaucracy of the new Chilean economy
EDL	00:08:54,015	00:08:55,807	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	They would call this project

EDL	00:08:58,111	00:09:01,439	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	Stafford beer had long stringy hair in a long beard
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:03,999	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	He look like he should be leading yoga retreats not

EDL	00:09:06,559	00:09:12,447	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	Beer was particularly interested in using cybernetics to help companies redistribute power within the system
EDL	00:09:12,959	00:09:13,727	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	And chili
EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:15,007	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	Was interested in this to
EDL	00:09:15,519	00:09:16,543	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	How do we make
EDL	00:09:16,543	00:09:17,823	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	Institutions
EDL	00:09:17,823	00:09:20,895	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	I'm non-hierarchical how do we distribute decision
EDL	00:09:22,687	00:09:26,783	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	The first thing bearded was map and model chilles entire economy
EDL	00:09:27,551	00:09:29,855	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	This was a really complex process
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:35,999	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	Uninvolved understanding how each part of the economy was affected by other parts and by outside feedback
EDL	00:09:37,023	00:09:38,303	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	On paper it looks
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:42,143	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	Like a big block diagram connected with lines and arrows
EDL	00:09:43,423	00:09:44,703	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	Now we have the economy
EDL	00:09:44,703	00:09:45,727	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	These are
EDL	00:09:45,727	00:09:47,519	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	Big major branches of India
EDL	00:09:47,519	00:09:48,031	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	Evian

EDL	00:09:52,895	00:09:54,431	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	It wasn't enough however
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:09:55,199	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	Berta just
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:09:58,783	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	Understand how all the parts are two ways economy connected
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:10:02,367	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	It was also crucial that the different parts be able to communicate with each other
EDL	00:10:03,135	00:10:06,719	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	Beer wanted factories to be able to send and receive information
EDL	00:10:07,231	00:10:13,631	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	He wanted to create a vast computer network that connected all the factories in Chile
EDL	00:10:13,631	00:10:14,399	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	Idea
EDL	00:10:14,399	00:10:15,935	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	This was pre-internet
EDL	00:10:15,935	00:10:18,495	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	Computer networks weren't really a thing yet
EDL	00:10:19,263	00:10:20,543	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	But there was a problem with
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:21,311	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	This idea
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:24,639	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	There are only a handful of computers in all of Chile
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:26,175	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	And beer
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:28,223	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	He only had access to one
EDL	00:10:29,247	00:10:33,343	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	These guys they had to create a computer network using one computer
EDL	00:10:33,855	00:10:35,647	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	Which is pretty amazing
EDL	00:10:36,415	00:10:37,695	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	So they improvised
EDL	00:10:38,207	00:10:41,023	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	They realized okay we can't put computers throughout the
EDL	00:10:42,047	00:10:44,095	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	But we can do is we have these Telex machine
EDL	00:10:44,607	00:10:47,935	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	Telex machine looks like a typewriter but it's hooked up to a telephone line
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:51,007	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	So imagine you and your friend you both have Telex machine
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:53,823	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	You can type a message on the keyboard hit send
EDL	00:10:54,335	00:10:56,127	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	And your friends talks will receive it
EDL	00:10:56,127	00:10:58,175	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	And literally type it out to a piece of paper
EDL	00:10:58,943	00:11:00,991	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	It's like super steam punk Gchat
EDL	00:11:01,503	00:11:04,063	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	I think Gchat is a great way to think about it
EDL	00:11:05,087	00:11:06,623	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	Everyday someone for a fact
EDL	00:11:06,623	00:11:08,415	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	Would send data via Telex
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:09,439	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	To another tablet
EDL	00:11:09,439	00:11:11,487	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	Where it would be received by an operator
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:13,535	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	And then entered into the Central Computer
EDL	00:11:14,047	00:11:16,095	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	The kinds of data that people
EDL	00:11:16,607	00:11:17,375	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	Might send
EDL	00:11:17,887	00:11:19,167	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	Could include raw material
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:20,703	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	Right how much cotton
EDL	00:11:21,215	00:11:22,495	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	You have how much
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:23,263	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	Cold you
EDL	00:11:24,031	00:11:25,823	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	The central computer software program
EDL	00:11:25,823	00:11:26,591	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	Cyber strike
EDL	00:11:27,103	00:11:28,895	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	Was able to analyze the data

EDL	00:11:31,455	00:11:32,223	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	This is
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:36,575	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	What your worker absentee level was today this is what it was the day before
EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:40,159	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	This is what it was the day before that what is it going to be tomorrow
EDL	00:11:40,159	00:11:41,695	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	Are you going to have a problem
EDL	00:11:41,695	00:11:44,255	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	Decisions could then be made about what to do
EDL	00:11:45,279	00:11:48,351	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	And this brings us back to that bizarre hexagonal room
EDL	00:11:48,351	00:11:50,143	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	The one that look like something out of a Kubrick
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:51,167	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	Or Star Trek
EDL	00:11:53,727	00:11:55,775	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	The operations room
EDL	00:11:55,775	00:11:57,311	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	It is a
EDL	00:11:57,311	00:11:59,871	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	Futuristic decision-making space
EDL	00:11:59,871	00:12:01,407	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	Deptford beer wanted to build a

EDL	00:12:03,199	00:12:03,711	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	Cybersn
EDL	00:12:04,479	00:12:06,527	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	Actually he wanted to build several of them
EDL	00:12:06,527	00:12:09,599	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	Oliver chili but only one was ever finished
EDL	00:12:10,367	00:12:14,463	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	The room was inspired in part by Winston Churchill's war room
EDL	00:12:14,463	00:12:17,791	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	So you can imagine the general sitting around smoking their cigars
EDL	00:12:17,791	00:12:18,303	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	In this case
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:21,631	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	Petroleum sitting around smoking cigarettes and perhaps
EDL	00:12:21,631	00:12:22,143	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	Drinking pee
EDL	00:12:24,447	00:12:27,263	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	But unlike Churchill's war room and this is a key difference
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:29,567	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	This was a room for non hierarchy
EDL	00:12:30,079	00:12:30,591	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	Decision making
EDL	00:12:31,359	00:12:34,687	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	Stafford beer imagine Factory workers and higher level bureaucrat
EDL	00:12:34,687	00:12:35,455	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	That's a like
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:36,735	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	Making decisions together
EDL	00:12:42,367	00:12:44,159	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	The projector is there so what

EDL	00:12:46,975	00:12:48,767	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	Originally from Germany
EDL	00:12:48,767	00:12:55,167	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	I have been working in Chili's industrial Design Group and was busy designing cool products for the masses
EDL	00:12:55,167	00:12:59,519	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	When he was taught to help design the operations room for project cybersyn
EDL	00:13:00,031	00:13:05,919	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	Eventually he realized Stafford beer wanted the room to be so much more than a standard meeting room
EDL	00:13:06,431	00:13:10,271	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	During the project I became more and more aware of the

EDL	00:13:41,503	00:13:45,599	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	The room was designed to quickly convey information about factories
EDL	00:13:45,599	00:13:46,623	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	All over 2A
EDL	00:13:47,135	00:13:51,487	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	You have charts and graphs of factory production on the walls

EDL	00:14:00,447	00:14:05,567	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	7 people would sit in a circle discussing and deciding how to proceed with various

EDL	00:14:45,503	00:14:48,319	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	But to me there is a bit of fiction in all of it
EDL	00:14:48,831	00:14:52,671	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	It's an Immaculate piece of design but it conceals
EDL	00:14:52,671	00:14:53,951	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	Monkey technology
EDL	00:14:54,463	00:14:58,047	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	The buttons on the chairs for instance were connected to some wires
EDL	00:14:58,559	00:15:03,167	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	That ran under the floor and behind the wall and eventually connected to 3 slide
EDL	00:15:04,703	00:15:08,031	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	And depending on the combination of buttons that you pushed
EDL	00:15:08,543	00:15:10,335	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	It would advance
EDL	00:15:10,335	00:15:14,431	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	Once I Carousel or another or tell the slide Carousel to move backwards

EDL	00:15:18,015	00:15:24,159	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	These screens couldn't display information in real time you can only display and discuss slides that have been pre-made
EDL	00:15:25,183	00:15:29,279	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	So it says image of modernity but behind it there's just a lot

EDL	00:15:33,631	00:15:39,519	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	Well project cybersyn was coming together and the futuristic operations room was being designed and built
EDL	00:15:40,287	00:15:43,359	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	Things are not going so well for the agenda government
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:47,199	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	So all of this is taking place during the

EDL	00:15:49,247	00:15:52,575	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	And Latin America has emerged as

EDL	00:15:59,231	00:16:02,047	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	So the US was intervening in Chile
EDL	00:16:02,047	00:16:04,095	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	In many many many different ways
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:05,375	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	That the IND

EDL	00:16:12,287	00:16:16,383	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	It became increasingly difficult for Chileans to get ahold of

EDL	00:16:23,039	00:16:24,575	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	The economy was collapsing
EDL	00:16:25,343	00:16:27,135	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	Inflation had started

EDL	00:16:28,159	00:16:30,207	| 99pi-0230-projectcybersyn-1 |	So people are having trouble getting
