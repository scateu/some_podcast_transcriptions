EDL	00:08:41,983	00:08:43,775	| 99pi-0240-platofzion-1 |	After a journey spanning years
EDL	00:08:44,287	00:08:47,615	| 99pi-0240-platofzion-1 |	The Mormons entered the Salt Lake Valley in 1847
EDL	00:08:47,615	00:08:48,895	| 99pi-0240-platofzion-1 |	And established Salt Lake
EDL	00:08:49,407	00:08:52,991	| 99pi-0240-platofzion-1 |	It would be the first place that they could build exactly as they want it
EDL	00:08:52,991	00:08:56,319	| 99pi-0240-platofzion-1 |	And when Brigham Young began devising a plan for what they would build
EDL	00:08:56,319	00:08:57,855	| 99pi-0240-platofzion-1 |	He returned to Joseph Smith

EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:04,511	| 99pi-0240-platofzion-1 |	Brigham Young's plan does look a bit like Joseph Smith's plat of Zion
EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:06,303	| 99pi-0240-platofzion-1 |	But with more detail
EDL	00:09:06,303	00:09:07,327	| 99pi-0240-platofzion-1 |	And some changes
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:10,143	| 99pi-0240-platofzion-1 |	I see this utopian idea
EDL	00:09:10,143	00:09:13,471	| 99pi-0240-platofzion-1 |	Hitting some problems when you have to start dealing with actual landscape

EDL	00:09:15,007	00:09:15,775	| 99pi-0240-platofzion-1 |	With the LDS
EDL	00:09:15,775	00:09:18,079	| 99pi-0240-platofzion-1 |	Church Brigham Young realized quickly
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:21,663	| 99pi-0240-platofzion-1 |	Zion wouldn't work in the real world without some modification
EDL	00:09:22,175	00:09:23,455	| 99pi-0240-platofzion-1 |	Miss Plan called for

EDL	00:09:27,551	00:09:28,063	| 99pi-0240-platofzion-1 |	1
EDL	00:09:28,575	00:09:33,439	| 99pi-0240-platofzion-1 |	Brigham Young also realized that the city couldn't survive on cottage industries alone
EDL	00:09:33,951	00:09:36,511	| 99pi-0240-platofzion-1 |	They would also need some commercial and Industrial.
EDL	00:09:37,279	00:09:39,839	| 99pi-0240-platofzion-1 |	There were limits to the rural City idea
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:44,703	| 99pi-0240-platofzion-1 |	In the mountainous terrain of the Salt Lake Valley didn't lend itself to a regular rigid grid
EDL	00:09:44,703	00:09:49,055	| 99pi-0240-platofzion-1 |	What is anyways Brigham Young's plan for Salt Lake City is faithful to the plot of Scion
EDL	00:09:49,567	00:09:51,871	| 99pi-0240-platofzion-1 |	The city is still after all built around a temple
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:53,407	| 99pi-0240-platofzion-1 |	And with streets
EDL	00:09:53,407	00:09:55,967	| 99pi-0240-platofzion-1 |	Name a way to tell you exactly how far you are from

EDL	00:10:04,927	00:10:07,999	| 99pi-0240-platofzion-1 |	Brigham Young and his fellow Mormons did not stop with Salt Lake City

EDL	00:10:22,591	00:10:25,151	| 99pi-0240-platofzion-1 |	The joke is he could turn a wagon around
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:30,527	| 99pi-0240-platofzion-1 |	In the middle of the block actually one version of the joke I heard is that the streets are wide enough to be able to

EDL	00:10:31,807	00:10:35,903	| 99pi-0240-platofzion-1 |	Without the drivers resorting to cursing
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:42,303	| 99pi-0240-platofzion-1 |	In Salt Lake City the wide streets in huge blocks have the effect of making you feel kind of small
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:44,863	| 99pi-0240-platofzion-1 |	And they say that everything is bigger in Texas
EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:47,679	| 99pi-0240-platofzion-1 |	Just don't think those people have been to Utah
