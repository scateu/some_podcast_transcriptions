EDL	00:03:36,832	00:03:38,624	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	Applied with their surfboards
EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:42,208	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	So many different groups have adopted plaid
EDL	00:03:42,720	00:03:44,512	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	So it almost doesn't mean anything anymore
EDL	00:03:45,536	00:03:46,048	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	Really
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:47,840	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	Why are we all wearing this
EDL	00:03:48,608	00:03:49,888	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	This particular pattern
EDL	00:03:50,656	00:03:56,800	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	Which Once Upon a Time was mostly concentrated in the upper corner of this one Island

EDL	00:03:59,104	00:04:00,640	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	Set me for Coughlin distress
EDL	00:04:01,152	00:04:02,176	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	Precious thing

EDL	00:04:06,528	00:04:09,088	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	This is Peter McDonald historian at the

EDL	00:04:11,136	00:04:12,928	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	They call this pattern tartan
EDL	00:04:12,928	00:04:13,696	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	Not
EDL	00:04:13,696	00:04:14,464	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	Plaid
EDL	00:04:14,464	00:04:16,000	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	We don't use that word
EDL	00:04:16,000	00:04:17,280	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	For patents
EDL	00:04:17,280	00:04:18,303	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	In this country
EDL	00:04:18,303	00:04:19,327	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	Platies a goblin

EDL	00:04:22,655	00:04:24,959	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	The northern hilly part of the country
EDL	00:04:24,959	00:04:27,263	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	Used to wrap themselves in a cloth
EDL	00:04:28,287	00:04:29,567	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	Almost like a blanket
EDL	00:04:30,079	00:04:31,871	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	Kind of like an Indian sari
EDL	00:04:31,871	00:04:36,223	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	So if you like it's a top and sorry will be the nearest equivalent
EDL	00:04:36,223	00:04:37,503	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	Was called a plaid
EDL	00:04:38,271	00:04:40,063	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	It had a Tartan pattern
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:42,879	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	On it got into the US
EDL	00:04:42,879	00:04:45,183	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	And that way they become synonymous with the patent
EDL	00:04:45,695	00:04:46,463	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	It's not like
EDL	00:04:46,463	00:04:49,279	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	Back Then There Were Tartan shirts and Tartan scarves
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:51,327	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	No Tartan was on
EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:52,863	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	These traditional plaids
EDL	00:04:52,863	00:04:53,887	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	Overcoats
EDL	00:04:53,887	00:04:55,423	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	And on the traditional pants
EDL	00:04:55,423	00:04:58,751	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	Which were called Truth
EDL	00:04:58,751	00:05:01,567	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	Tripping out tries it cuz it's the types include the feet
EDL	00:05:02,079	00:05:03,103	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	So that more like
EDL	00:05:03,103	00:05:04,127	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	Ladies tights
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:10,527	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	She knows what kind of this parochial little pattern but Scotsman in the country used to where it was pretty
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:15,391	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	Pretty much only used on these obscure traditional Highlands garments that I had never heard of before
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:17,951	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	And then something happened
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:19,487	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	Something that would
EDL	00:05:19,487	00:05:21,535	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	End up turning Tartan loose on the world
EDL	00:05:22,303	00:05:24,863	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	These obscure traditional Highland close
EDL	00:05:25,631	00:05:26,655	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	Warband
EDL	00:05:27,423	00:05:28,191	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	The ACT
EDL	00:05:28,191	00:05:29,215	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	Band
EDL	00:05:29,215	00:05:29,983	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	Are kilts
EDL	00:05:29,983	00:05:36,383	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	Plants and other elements of Highland dress and outdoor coats in top nekot where is well
EDL	00:05:36,383	00:05:39,455	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	Donald is talking about is the dress Act of 1740
EDL	00:05:40,479	00:05:43,039	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	Scotland was being taken over by the head of Aryan Empire
EDL	00:05:44,063	00:05:45,087	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	How many of the Scots
EDL	00:05:45,087	00:05:46,111	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	Subaru Outback
EDL	00:05:46,111	00:05:47,135	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	We're from the Highlands
EDL	00:05:47,647	00:05:49,439	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	And so they wore Tartan coats
EDL	00:05:49,439	00:05:50,463	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	And Kilts and plaids
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:51,999	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	21 Pilots
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:53,791	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	They would be seen as terrorists
EDL	00:05:53,791	00:05:56,351	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	Open fights depending on which side you wrong
EDL	00:05:56,351	00:05:57,375	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	But that's the reason
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:05:58,143	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	Forbade
EDL	00:05:58,143	00:05:59,679	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	It was a way to suppress the resistance

EDL	00:09:17,823	00:09:18,591	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	Because

EDL	00:09:50,335	00:09:51,871	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	And it functions efficiently as a

EDL	00:14:43,455	00:14:46,015	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	And they put on this huge parade with bagpipes
EDL	00:14:46,015	00:14:49,343	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	Scottish Terriers and Scottish associations from all over the US
EDL	00:14:50,367	00:14:54,975	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	Harden is one way that white people can claim some sort of cultural heritage
EDL	00:14:54,975	00:15:01,375	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	Because you're young country you all want to play in your heritage and actually a lot of people play me that
EDL	00:15:01,375	00:15:03,167	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	Scots-irish ancestry
EDL	00:15:03,167	00:15:03,935	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	Because it has
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:06,495	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	The cultural icons by dent
EDL	00:15:06,495	00:15:08,287	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	Which help you belong
EDL	00:15:08,799	00:15:11,103	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	And everyone wants to belong
EDL	00:15:11,615	00:15:12,383	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	2 something
EDL	00:15:12,895	00:15:14,175	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	Somewhere somehow
EDL	00:15:14,175	00:15:16,991	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	There's about a 30% increase last year Thomas register
EDL	00:15:18,015	00:15:20,063	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	Is it definitely increase
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:21,087	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	In some ways
EDL	00:15:21,599	00:15:23,903	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	If you don't get your Tartan actually woven
EDL	00:15:24,415	00:15:29,279	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	The register of tartans might seem like a Cheesy thrill like one of those online services where you can
EDL	00:15:29,279	00:15:31,071	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	Pay to register a star
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:33,119	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	Or buy a plot of land on the Moon
EDL	00:15:34,399	00:15:37,215	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	But those authentic Clan tartan
EDL	00:15:37,215	00:15:38,751	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	The ones that represent last name
EDL	00:15:39,519	00:15:41,311	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	Those were also kind of made of
EDL	00:15:41,823	00:15:42,847	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	When you look
EDL	00:15:42,847	00:15:44,383	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	Actually I believe
EDL	00:15:44,383	00:15:45,151	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	Examples of
EDL	00:15:45,151	00:15:50,015	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	Surviving talton's it would not really have been associated with particular families
EDL	00:15:50,015	00:15:51,807	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	And there is no way that
EDL	00:15:51,807	00:15:55,135	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	612
EDL	00:15:55,903	00:16:00,767	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	This idea of official Clan tartans was part of a great Highland Revival
EDL	00:16:00,767	00:16:01,791	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	Gosh
EDL	00:16:02,303	00:16:04,607	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	Stop around speaking title
EDL	00:16:05,631	00:16:07,167	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	200 years is old
EDL	00:16:07,167	00:16:10,751	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	But that's nothing when you compare it to the ages of the Clans themselves
EDL	00:16:11,519	00:16:14,335	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	Raise the Macallan
EDL	00:16:14,847	00:16:17,151	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	Those are closer to 1000 years old
EDL	00:16:17,663	00:16:19,455	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	But basically in the 1800's
EDL	00:16:19,967	00:16:23,551	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	Many of the clan leaders just went and picked out tartans they liked
EDL	00:16:23,551	00:16:25,343	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	And we named them after themselves
EDL	00:16:25,855	00:16:28,927	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	Is it kind of like what's your favorite absolutely

EDL	00:16:57,855	00:16:59,391	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	Pattern seems simple
EDL	00:17:00,159	00:17:01,951	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	It's a series of overlapping threads
EDL	00:17:02,463	00:17:03,487	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	A warp and weft
EDL	00:17:04,511	00:17:05,279	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	Really
EDL	00:17:05,791	00:17:06,559	| Plaid_Articles_of_Interest_2_pt_01 |	If you look at it
