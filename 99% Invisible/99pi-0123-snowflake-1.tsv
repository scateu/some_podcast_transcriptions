EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:49,728	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	But this is an unusual reporting trip I'm about to go on
EDL	00:02:50,240	00:02:53,568	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	I'm headed to an isolated community in Eastern Arizona
EDL	00:02:53,568	00:02:56,128	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	On the outskirts of a small town called snowflake
EDL	00:02:56,640	00:03:01,504	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	And the people who live there have given me very special instructions for how to get ready
EDL	00:03:01,504	00:03:03,552	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Because for some people in Snowflake
EDL	00:03:03,552	00:03:06,368	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Utopia just means not being physically sick

EDL	00:03:36,832	00:03:43,232	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Studies have not shown a strong connection between chemical exposures and symptoms there's no real medical consensus
EDL	00:03:43,232	00:03:49,632	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	About what causes the illness and doctors disagree about whether symptoms are physiological psychological
EDL	00:03:49,632	00:03:56,032	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Or both that means that people with MCS are often dismissed as well hypochondriacs
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:04:02,432	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	How do you find themselves without sympathetic Medical Care access to services that people with recognized disabilities
EDL	00:04:02,432	00:04:08,832	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	There are a subset of doctors who believe in MCS and treat it but most mainstream sza
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:14,464	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Additions avoid the diagnosis and so a lot of people with the illness fall back on trial and error

EDL	00:07:37,471	00:07:39,263	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	And when Susan visited
EDL	00:07:39,263	00:07:41,567	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	For me the Improvement was so radical
EDL	00:07:42,335	00:07:44,383	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	You know what you get out of car you feel better
EDL	00:07:44,895	00:07:47,199	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	I can walk you don't need the oxygen tank
EDL	00:07:47,711	00:07:49,503	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Here's your speech is clear
EDL	00:07:49,503	00:07:55,903	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	I didn't exactly want to move here but my body said yeah we're moving here
EDL	00:07:55,903	00:07:56,415	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Felt like a pass
EDL	00:07:56,927	00:07:59,231	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Like a journey between two different worlds
EDL	00:07:59,743	00:08:04,095	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Like in the old days for someone to get on a ship and go to the United States from
EDL	00:08:04,095	00:08:04,607	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Ireland
EDL	00:08:05,375	00:08:08,191	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	They didn't really want to leave it if they weren't able to make it
EDL	00:08:08,959	00:08:10,495	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Anymore until they took
EDL	00:08:10,495	00:08:12,031	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Switch respingada on a ship
EDL	00:08:12,543	00:08:14,591	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Think it feels a little bit like that to me
EDL	00:08:16,639	00:08:21,759	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Gradually more people move to snowflake they came from all over and engineer from Denmark
EDL	00:08:21,759	00:08:25,087	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Marketing director from Toronto a chef from the Philippines
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:26,879	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Teacher from San Francisco
EDL	00:08:26,879	00:08:27,903	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Now
EDL	00:08:27,903	00:08:31,231	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	There are about three dozen household scattered across this area
EDL	00:08:31,231	00:08:33,023	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	All United by this illness
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:35,839	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	And they're not the first people in history to move
EDL	00:08:37,631	00:08:38,399	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Forever
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:40,959	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	15 people who had to relocate because
EDL	00:08:40,959	00:08:42,751	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Of particular Medical
EDL	00:08:42,751	00:08:43,775	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Problems or health reason
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:46,847	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	In fact the history of medical migration
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:48,895	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	This part of the country goes back a long ways
EDL	00:08:49,663	00:08:56,063	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	A hundred years ago doctors encouraged people with tuberculosis to Head West for the same clean dry air that
EDL	00:08:56,063	00:08:57,087	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	That brought Susan here
EDL	00:08:57,599	00:08:59,647	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Ended up in Arizona
EDL	00:08:59,647	00:09:02,207	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Attensity sprouted up across the state
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:03,743	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	And locals gave them a nickname
EDL	00:09:04,255	00:09:05,023	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Runners
EDL	00:09:05,535	00:09:08,095	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Because of the hacking cough that characterize the illness
EDL	00:09:08,863	00:09:10,655	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	So this is not an uncommon
EDL	00:09:11,167	00:09:12,703	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Experience for human beings
EDL	00:09:13,215	00:09:15,263	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Right now it's our turn for it
EDL	00:09:15,263	00:09:16,031	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	For the new guys
EDL	00:09:17,055	00:09:20,383	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	But the complicated thing about this illness is that it's so unknown
EDL	00:09:21,151	00:09:22,431	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Some doctors would argue that the
EDL	00:09:22,431	00:09:23,967	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	This place isolates people
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:25,759	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Pushes them deeper into their sickness
EDL	00:09:26,527	00:09:32,671	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	All the talk about diets and remedies and building techniques only reinforces what might be better treated in other
EDL	00:09:33,951	00:09:35,999	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	What Susan told me this place saved
EDL	00:09:35,999	00:09:36,511	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Your life
EDL	00:09:38,559	00:09:39,839	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Kitchens the same
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:40,607	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	The bedroom
EDL	00:09:40,607	00:09:41,887	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Things the living room
EDL	00:09:41,887	00:09:43,423	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	I mean I basically live in wenzhou
EDL	00:09:44,191	00:09:46,495	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Susan. This house herself with help from friend
EDL	00:09:47,263	00:09:53,663	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	The people here in Snowflake might be the closest thing there is to a NCS think-tank and they develop a building technique
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:56,223	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Snakes that help manage their sensitivities
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:09:59,039	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	That means using quote-unquote safe materials
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:10:04,159	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Like ceramic tile or concrete floors instead of carpeting which traps chemical odors
EDL	00:10:04,159	00:10:06,975	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Susan also used foil-lined sheetrock
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:07,999	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Which covers her walls
EDL	00:10:08,511	00:10:10,047	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Give me the whole inside of her
EDL	00:10:10,047	00:10:11,583	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Her house is silver sheen
EDL	00:10:12,095	00:10:13,887	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	I just couldn't afford to risk
EDL	00:10:13,887	00:10:14,399	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Paint
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:17,215	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	You know if you get the wrong kind of paint your whole house
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:22,079	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Unlivable maybe forever or maybe at least for several months
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:22,847	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	A couple years
EDL	00:10:22,847	00:10:24,895	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	But maybe the most striking thing about the
EDL	00:10:24,895	00:10:29,503	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	This house is the way that Susan has isolated most of her Electronics in a separate room
EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:32,575	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	What you can completely shut off from the rest of the
EDL	00:10:32,575	00:10:33,087	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	The house
EDL	00:10:33,599	00:10:38,207	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	That's because many people with MCS also experience sensitivity to electricity
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:43,583	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	You designed it pretty strategically with that room in mind of the room at the front of the house
EDL	00:10:44,095	00:10:45,887	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Is the one where you electricity
EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:47,423	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Comes into one corner of the house
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:49,727	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	It all comes in right
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:50,751	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Right over there
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:54,591	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	And the rest of the house doesn't have to be as effective
EDL	00:10:55,615	00:10:58,175	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	She keeps her television and a VCR in the
EDL	00:10:58,175	00:10:59,199	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	A separate room
EDL	00:10:59,199	00:11:02,783	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	And she's constructed a thick window to watch TV through
EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:04,063	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Well keeping the equipment ice
EDL	00:11:05,087	00:11:07,391	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	The television is
EDL	00:11:07,391	00:11:08,159	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	An ancient
EDL	00:11:08,927	00:11:11,231	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	One I mean by today's standards
EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:11,743	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	And it's
EDL	00:11:12,255	00:11:14,559	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Really nothing special other than it's the old
EDL	00:11:15,071	00:11:16,095	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	I don't want to have
EDL	00:11:16,607	00:11:18,399	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	New chemical emissions
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:19,167	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	In my house
EDL	00:11:19,679	00:11:22,495	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	You know from Plastics and so forth if there's any way around it
EDL	00:11:23,263	00:11:26,335	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	This one is old and aired out and
EDL	00:11:28,383	00:11:29,407	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	This glass
EDL	00:11:29,407	00:11:30,943	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	She in front of it is
EDL	00:11:31,455	00:11:32,735	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	To keep the fuse
EDL	00:11:33,759	00:11:35,039	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	In that room
EDL	00:11:35,039	00:11:36,575	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Like an open the front door
EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:38,623	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	And let the fumes
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:39,391	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Go out
EDL	00:11:39,903	00:11:43,487	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Without contaminating the inside of my house
EDL	00:11:44,767	00:11:48,351	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	The house is modest but you can tell how much it means to suzhou
EDL	00:11:48,863	00:11:51,679	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	She shows me every corner and every adaptation
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:52,703	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	It's her Safe Haven
EDL	00:11:53,471	00:11:57,823	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	And there are lots of people who are desperate to move out here to live in a little place just like this
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:02,175	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	When Susan's phone rings it's usually not a good sign
EDL	00:12:02,687	00:12:06,015	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	I don't get calls from people for whom everything is going great
EDL	00:12:06,783	00:12:07,295	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	You know
EDL	00:12:08,063	00:12:08,575	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Hello
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:13,183	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Hi
EDL	00:12:13,183	00:12:14,463	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Charles Place
EDL	00:12:14,463	00:12:17,535	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Is I'm available cuz I am could not be doing worse
EDL	00:12:18,303	00:12:19,583	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	I've got to get out of here
EDL	00:12:21,375	00:12:24,703	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Skin is literally burning and bleeding from the portion
EDL	00:12:25,215	00:12:27,519	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Susan gets a few calls like this a week
EDL	00:12:27,519	00:12:28,799	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	From runners
EDL	00:12:28,799	00:12:33,151	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	People who are moving from place to place trying to find somewhere that feels safe
EDL	00:12:33,919	00:12:35,967	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Snowflake isn't the only community of it
EDL	00:12:35,967	00:12:38,783	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	It's kind but it's one of the largest and most established
EDL	00:12:39,807	00:12:42,111	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Don't that doesn't mean there's room for everyone
EDL	00:12:42,879	00:12:44,927	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	I'm sorry but there is someone living there
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:48,767	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Susan Trax a limited housing in Snowflake
EDL	00:12:49,279	00:12:50,559	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	And she breaks the bad news when she can
EDL	00:12:51,071	00:12:54,911	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	How about you never know I'm waiting for a miracle to happen
EDL	00:12:58,751	00:13:00,031	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	I don't have any miracles
EDL	00:13:01,311	00:13:02,591	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	I wish I did
EDL	00:13:03,103	00:13:08,735	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	I know you're not asking me to get off but I need to go get some commotion on right now
EDL	00:13:12,831	00:13:14,623	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	I'm afraid that's what a typical College
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:15,135	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Looks like
EDL	00:13:15,903	00:13:18,719	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	You know people who are real sick where they are and need to be in it
EDL	00:13:20,255	00:13:22,047	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Another kind of Housing and there isn't any
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:30,751	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Over the years enough people with MCS have come to snowflake that the wider Community has adapted to them
EDL	00:13:30,751	00:13:31,775	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	At least a little bit
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:35,871	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	There's a real estate agent who helps people find MCS friendly property
EDL	00:13:36,639	00:13:38,431	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	There's an organic food store which
EDL	00:13:38,431	00:13:40,991	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Just kind of unusual for a rural town of 5000
EDL	00:13:41,759	00:13:46,111	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	The owner there will sometimes shop for people with MCS and leave the groceries outside for them
EDL	00:13:46,111	00:13:47,391	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	I got so they don't have to
EDL	00:13:47,391	00:13:48,159	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Coming to the store
EDL	00:13:48,671	00:13:49,439	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Which smells like incense
EDL	00:13:50,463	00:13:51,743	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	And then there's the dentist
EDL	00:13:53,535	00:13:58,399	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	And my EI patients usually come in through the backdoor they wait in their cars
EDL	00:13:59,423	00:14:01,471	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	We have a separate and she's right here
EDL	00:14:02,239	00:14:07,359	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	VI is short for environmental illness another term for multiple chemical sensitivity
EDL	00:14:07,359	00:14:08,895	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	Melissa is a hygienist
EDL	00:14:08,895	00:14:09,919	| 99pi-0123-snowflake-1 |	. Sierra Dental
