EDL	00:01:35,744	00:01:42,144	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	We went to the Portland airport recently when I got off the plane

EDL	00:01:45,216	00:01:45,984	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	A foot selfie

EDL	00:01:53,152	00:01:54,432	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	She lives in Portland
EDL	00:01:54,432	00:01:57,760	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	And I almost always take a foot selfie when I'm at PDX
EDL	00:01:57,760	00:01:58,528	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Portland Airport
EDL	00:01:59,040	00:02:01,856	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	I think I do it most often when I come home like
EDL	00:02:01,856	00:02:03,648	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Here I am I'm back in Portland
EDL	00:02:04,160	00:02:08,768	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	The feet are actually not the most important thing about a portland-airport foot selfie
EDL	00:02:11,072	00:02:13,120	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	It's actually what's under your feet
EDL	00:02:13,120	00:02:15,680	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	The famous PDX airport carpet
EDL	00:02:15,680	00:02:20,288	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	It's allowed decidedly 80s teal color with a repeating geometric pattern
EDL	00:02:20,800	00:02:25,920	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Like any carpet you might see in an airport or hotel lobby or an office building it
EDL	00:02:25,920	00:02:28,480	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Probably not what you choose for your living room
EDL	00:02:29,248	00:02:35,648	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	The design I'm told is based on the way the runways and lights look from the air traffic control tower and also on
EDL	00:02:35,648	00:02:42,048	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	On the radar screen that the air traffic controller sees with that sweeping line going around and around and the dots
EDL	00:02:42,048	00:02:45,376	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Are the little blips representing airplane
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:51,776	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	It's hard to say if it's the pattern people are responding to what the bright teal background color but one thing
EDL	00:02:51,776	00:02:58,176	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Is for sure the carpet is very very beloved there even sign the airport
EDL	00:02:58,176	00:03:00,992	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Right now it's saying your feet with the hashtag
EDL	00:03:00,992	00:03:02,272	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	PDX carpet
EDL	00:03:02,272	00:03:03,552	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	And it goes deeper than that
EDL	00:03:04,064	00:03:04,832	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Meet Emma
EDL	00:03:05,344	00:03:06,624	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	She actually has
EDL	00:03:06,624	00:03:08,928	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	A PDX carpet inspired tattoo
EDL	00:03:08,928	00:03:11,232	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	It hurt a lot
EDL	00:03:11,232	00:03:17,632	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	21 year old Portland native which means a lot of the carpet in the airport is actually old
EDL	00:03:17,632	00:03:18,656	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Older than she is
EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:21,472	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	She got a tattoo of the carpet pattern on her back
EDL	00:03:21,472	00:03:23,520	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	The side so yes my last
EDL	00:03:23,520	00:03:25,312	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Emma travelled a lot as a kid
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:28,128	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Her parents are divorced and her dad lives in LA
EDL	00:03:28,128	00:03:29,408	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	I think the first
EDL	00:03:29,408	00:03:30,944	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Time I ever took
EDL	00:03:32,224	00:03:34,528	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Flight as an unaccompanied minor
EDL	00:03:35,040	00:03:36,832	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Mama's probably 11
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:39,136	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	And freaking out
EDL	00:03:39,136	00:03:41,952	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	But the carpet had this kind of calming effect on her
EDL	00:03:41,952	00:03:47,072	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	On my way that was kind of like my send off the carpet was there and that you knew that
EDL	00:03:47,072	00:03:49,888	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	That would probably be there when I got home
EDL	00:03:49,888	00:03:54,752	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Several years later when Emma decided to take the plunge and get a tattoo of the Portland carpet design
EDL	00:03:55,264	00:03:56,288	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	She realized
EDL	00:03:56,288	00:03:58,336	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	She was not the carpets only admirer
EDL	00:03:58,848	00:03:59,616	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Not by a long shot
EDL	00:04:00,128	00:04:02,176	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	When I got the tattoo
EDL	00:04:02,176	00:04:02,944	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	I
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:05,504	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Posted a picture of it on Insta
EDL	00:04:06,272	00:04:08,064	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	And one of my followers
EDL	00:04:08,064	00:04:10,112	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Tagged at PDX carpet
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:12,416	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Upon further inspection I was like
EDL	00:04:12,928	00:04:13,696	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Oh my goodness
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:16,000	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	The carpet has an Instagram
EDL	00:04:16,000	00:04:18,047	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	The carpet has a Twitter and a
EDL	00:04:18,047	00:04:19,071	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Facebook page
EDL	00:04:19,071	00:04:20,863	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	And that's kind of when I knew it
EDL	00:04:20,863	00:04:21,887	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	That it was
EDL	00:04:22,655	00:04:25,215	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	This kind of notorious Portland
EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:25,727	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Entity
EDL	00:04:26,495	00:04:32,895	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	It's important to note that the airport Communications Department says they are not running any of the social media accounts.
EDL	00:04:32,895	00:04:33,919	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Devoted the PDX carpet
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:39,039	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Emma says that occasionally people on social media make fun of her tattoo
EDL	00:04:41,087	00:04:42,367	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Sitting back and
EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:46,207	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Letting people say what they want about it
EDL	00:04:47,999	00:04:48,767	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	I'm in love
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:51,071	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	I used to live in Boston
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:55,167	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	I cannot imagine telling boss tonight's like
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:04:57,215	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	I'm obsessed with the airport carpet
EDL	00:04:58,495	00:04:59,775	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Logan
EDL	00:04:59,775	00:05:02,079	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	And having someone go yeah me too
EDL	00:05:02,079	00:05:04,127	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Jeremy Dunn is a designer in Portland
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:05,407	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	And he's another fan of the carpet
EDL	00:05:06,175	00:05:09,759	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	A couple of years ago he decided to have some socks made with the carpet pattern on them
EDL	00:05:10,271	00:05:12,831	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	He said about $500 on the minimum order
EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:13,855	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Which would 72 pair
EDL	00:05:14,367	00:05:16,671	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	So he was hoping some people would want to buy them
EDL	00:05:17,183	00:05:19,743	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Posted them on our Instagram account
EDL	00:05:19,743	00:05:20,511	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Think it was
EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:25,375	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	An hour maybe two hours and they were all sold out
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:31,263	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	The carpet socks were so popular that Jeremy quit his day job and opened up a retail space
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:33,823	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Jeremy socks are actually told in the airport now
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:37,407	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Alongside many other items emblazoned with the carpet pattern
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:43,807	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	T-shirts coffee mugs throw pillows tote bag stickers keychains bike helmets water bottles
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:46,879	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	PDX carpet IPA from a local Brewery called Rogue
EDL	00:05:47,391	00:05:50,719	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	That's what's so interesting to me about this whole carpet phenomenon
EDL	00:05:50,719	00:05:54,047	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	It's great for Pediatrics it's basically free marketing for them
EDL	00:05:54,559	00:05:58,399	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	But if the airport had tried to create this kind of fervor for the carpet
EDL	00:05:58,399	00:06:00,447	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	There's no way it would have caught on
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:01,471	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	At least not like this
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:03,775	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	I love this carpet
EDL	00:06:04,543	00:06:06,079	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Like a big thing ever by socks
EDL	00:06:07,103	00:06:13,503	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	It just kind of represents for tonight if we're kind of known for this at our airport this carpet makes traveling a little bit more enjoyable
EDL	00:06:13,503	00:06:15,807	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	I guess what I'm in the airport selfie
EDL	00:06:15,807	00:06:16,575	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	The foot
EDL	00:06:16,575	00:06:19,135	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	But maybe there's something they should secretly magical about it
EDL	00:06:19,903	00:06:23,231	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	People having
EDL	00:06:23,231	00:06:28,095	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Stream unprecedented inordinate amounts of affection for the carpet at PDX
EDL	00:06:28,607	00:06:31,167	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	When you ask people why they love the carpet so much
EDL	00:06:31,679	00:06:33,471	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	They pretty much all say the same thing
EDL	00:06:34,239	00:06:35,263	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	When they see it
EDL	00:06:35,263	00:06:37,055	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	It reminds them that their home
EDL	00:06:37,055	00:06:38,335	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	And that's sweet
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:40,383	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	But like so many great love stories
EDL	00:06:40,383	00:06:41,663	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	I'm afraid this one
EDL	00:06:41,663	00:06:43,455	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Is coming to a tragic end
EDL	00:06:47,551	00:06:50,367	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	That is the sound of Portland heart being ripped

EDL	00:06:51,903	00:06:55,743	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Speaking of PDX workers are replacing the airports
EDL	00:06:55,743	00:06:57,279	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Famous carpet you know that
EDL	00:06:57,279	00:06:59,839	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Teal with the red
EDL	00:06:59,839	00:07:05,983	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	And purple and blue accents it's hard to say goodbye especially for travelers with an emotional attachment
EDL	00:07:07,775	00:07:11,103	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	A person came up to me and said oh I love your tattoo
EDL	00:07:11,615	00:07:14,175	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Did you know that they've already started
EDL	00:07:14,175	00:07:15,711	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Tearing it up and I just kind of
EDL	00:07:16,991	00:07:18,015	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Felt my heart sank
EDL	00:07:18,783	00:07:24,927	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Free carpet it's actually had a pretty long life the oldest sections of carpet have been in the airport since the late 1980s
EDL	00:07:25,695	00:07:26,719	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Are things that
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:27,487	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	You just can't reach
EDL	00:07:27,487	00:07:29,535	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Pair can't dispatch your way out of it
EDL	00:07:30,047	00:07:31,583	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	It really just looks
EDL	00:07:32,095	00:07:32,607	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Tired
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:36,447	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	That's Robin McCaffrey
EDL	00:07:36,959	00:07:39,775	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	She's an engineering project manager at the Port of Portland
EDL	00:07:39,775	00:07:41,311	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	The agency that controls the airport
EDL	00:07:42,079	00:07:44,383	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	She's in charge of the carpet removal project
EDL	00:07:44,895	00:07:45,919	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Starting late January
EDL	00:07:49,503	00:07:52,575	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Can you describe what you're doing
EDL	00:07:52,575	00:07:55,135	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	To the carpet so the machine can pull it up
EDL	00:07:55,903	00:07:57,695	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Mike mackley works for
EDL	00:07:57,695	00:07:58,719	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	4M Floor Covering
EDL	00:07:59,487	00:08:04,095	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Actually he helped install the carpet here at the end of the C Concourse in the mid-1990s
EDL	00:08:04,095	00:08:05,119	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	I laid all of this
EDL	00:08:06,399	00:08:08,959	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	1995 for rubenstein's contract carpet
EDL	00:08:10,495	00:08:13,567	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	So do you have any kind of attachment to it
EDL	00:08:14,591	00:08:16,127	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	You're not sorry to see it go
EDL	00:08:16,127	00:08:17,663	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Just carpet that's my opinion
EDL	00:08:18,431	00:08:24,319	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	The machine are using to remove the carpet looks like a cross between a motorized wheelchair and a Zamboni
EDL	00:08:24,831	00:08:26,111	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	It's called a panther
EDL	00:08:26,623	00:08:30,207	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	You attach the carpet to the machine and drive it forward to pull up the
EDL	00:08:30,207	00:08:32,255	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Huge sections of carpet all at once
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:39,935	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Most of this work will be done at night so it can have minimal impact on Travelers
EDL	00:08:40,703	00:08:42,751	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	It's going to take a long time
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:48,127	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	13 acres of Corvette does not get Panther. Away overnight
EDL	00:08:48,639	00:08:49,663	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	If all goes well
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:53,503	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Perfectly it will be earlier than November
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:54,271	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	But
EDL	00:08:54,271	00:08:55,295	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	We're giving it a healthy
EDL	00:08:55,295	00:08:55,807	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	A window on Word
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:08:57,343	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	For
EDL	00:08:59,903	00:09:04,767	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	When the carpet is all removed most of it will be sent back to the manufacturer and recycle
EDL	00:09:04,767	00:09:05,535	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	But not
EDL	00:09:05,535	00:09:06,047	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	All of it
EDL	00:09:06,815	00:09:10,143	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	They're giving away for 1000 square yard pieces
EDL	00:09:10,143	00:09:12,959	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Businesses will have to submit proposal to get one
EDL	00:09:12,959	00:09:15,007	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Outlining what they plan to do with the carpet
EDL	00:09:15,007	00:09:16,799	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	In the meantime
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:19,359	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	And how they will eventually make it available
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:20,127	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	To the General Public
EDL	00:09:20,895	00:09:22,943	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Whatever happens to the old PDX carpet
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:24,735	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	One thing is for sure
EDL	00:09:24,735	00:09:27,039	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Its replacement has some big shoes
EDL	00:09:27,039	00:09:30,111	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	FFL people are going to hate it
EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:31,647	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Well hopefully not
EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:35,743	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	It might be a perfectly great tonight but people will still hate it though
EDL	00:09:35,743	00:09:39,071	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Why didn't you replace all the carpet and use the same beloved design
EDL	00:09:39,071	00:09:40,863	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	If they had decided to
EDL	00:09:40,863	00:09:42,143	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Just recarpet
EDL	00:09:42,143	00:09:45,471	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	With the same design that would have been cool
EDL	00:09:45,471	00:09:48,287	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Yeah it does seem like the most obvious solution
EDL	00:09:48,799	00:09:52,127	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	But the decision to replace the carpet was made back in 2008
EDL	00:09:52,127	00:09:54,943	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Before all the foot selfies and hashtag PDX
EDL	00:09:54,943	00:09:55,967	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Carpet I don't
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:09:58,015	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	At that time
EDL	00:09:58,015	00:09:59,039	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	There was an awareness
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:09:59,551	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	So that Grace
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:02,623	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Ready for the carpet
EDL	00:10:03,391	00:10:04,159	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	That we became
EDL	00:10:04,159	00:10:04,927	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	I'm aware of Maurice
EDL	00:10:04,927	00:10:05,695	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Somali
EDL	00:10:05,695	00:10:06,975	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Did you ever consider
EDL	00:10:07,743	00:10:09,791	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Replacing carpet with the same design
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:12,095	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	I think that we
EDL	00:10:12,095	00:10:12,863	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Had
EDL	00:10:12,863	00:10:14,143	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Thoughts about
EDL	00:10:14,143	00:10:15,679	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	People asking that question
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:17,471	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Once we were well into it
EDL	00:10:17,471	00:10:18,239	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	I had already come
EDL	00:10:18,239	00:10:19,007	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Come up with
EDL	00:10:19,007	00:10:20,031	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	A conceptual design
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:25,663	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Now when you walk through the airport you can actually see a sizable Swatch at the new carpet
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:31,039	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	It's a darker green with a repeating geometric motifs it's reminiscent of the old carpet
EDL	00:10:31,039	00:10:37,439	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	But busier the busyness of the new design actually helps hide dirt and other wear-and-tear in fact there's a cup
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:38,975	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Different versions of a new design
EDL	00:10:38,975	00:10:42,303	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	One that's extra busy that they'll lay in higher traffic areas
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:43,839	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	It looks like a
EDL	00:10:43,839	00:10:46,655	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Tropical Jimmy Buffett version of the
EDL	00:10:47,167	00:10:50,751	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Of the airport carpet and not in a good way
EDL	00:10:50,751	00:10:52,543	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Jeremy Dunn the stock maker
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:53,311	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Is not a fan
EDL	00:10:53,823	00:10:56,127	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Seems very swoopy and like
EDL	00:10:56,127	00:10:58,431	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	You know what has more curves to it and
EDL	00:11:00,223	00:11:02,271	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	It's a little bit different green
EDL	00:11:02,271	00:11:06,879	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	And it's a little has some yellow in there and I think those are all
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:08,159	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	To me those are all things
EDL	00:11:09,183	00:11:10,207	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Are not as
EDL	00:11:10,975	00:11:11,743	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Appealing
EDL	00:11:11,743	00:11:13,535	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Are you going to make socks with a new design
EDL	00:11:14,559	00:11:17,119	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Yeah probably not
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:19,423	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Yeah I think it's tough
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:19,935	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	People don't have it
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:21,983	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Love everybody
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:23,007	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Wishes that there
EDL	00:11:23,007	00:11:23,519	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Design work was
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:26,847	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Michelle Bo is a partner at hennebery Eddy
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:31,455	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	The Firm that took on the unenviable challenge of Designing the

EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:36,063	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	There's a lot of thought and consideration that went into it
EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:38,367	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	The inspiration for this
EDL	00:11:38,367	00:11:40,927	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Had a lot to do with what you see from the air as your

EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:43,999	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Green color that
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:45,023	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	It's the main background
EDL	00:11:46,303	00:11:47,071	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Is much like

EDL	00:11:49,887	00:11:51,423	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	We have a unique situation here

EDL	00:12:00,127	00:12:00,895	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Also we're looking at

EDL	00:12:07,807	00:12:08,319	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	If you were to look at
EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:10,367	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Kind of the way that aircraft
EDL	00:12:11,135	00:12:11,647	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Curve around
EDL	00:12:13,951	00:12:16,255	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Did you ever think about how people's feet with
EDL	00:12:16,255	00:12:17,279	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	On the new carpet
EDL	00:12:20,607	00:12:21,119	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	I didn't
EDL	00:12:22,143	00:12:28,543	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Even with all this thought in care designer Michelle vo is fully aware that this new carpet is going to be a

EDL	00:12:29,567	00:12:33,151	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	But she hopes it will grow on people over time
EDL	00:12:33,151	00:12:35,199	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Can you carpet going down as something that will
EDL	00:12:35,199	00:12:36,735	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Become enduring night
EDL	00:12:36,735	00:12:40,063	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	I hope that it will and maybe it won't reach cult status until
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:41,599	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	20 years out when it's time to
EDL	00:12:41,599	00:12:42,367	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	Replace it by
EDL	00:12:42,879	00:12:43,647	| 99pi-0154-pdxcarpet-1 |	You know that's okay
