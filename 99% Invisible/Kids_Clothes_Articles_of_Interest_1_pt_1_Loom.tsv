EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:39,583	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	It's almost like a parody of adulthood
EDL	00:17:40,095	00:17:42,911	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	Stuff meant to look like adult clothes
EDL	00:17:42,911	00:17:45,471	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	That adults would never actually wear
EDL	00:17:45,471	00:17:47,775	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	Which is what we see now in the kids Department
EDL	00:17:49,055	00:17:53,151	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	It has everything to do with our evolving concepts of childhood
EDL	00:17:53,663	00:17:54,175	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	And how much
EDL	00:17:54,687	00:17:57,759	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	Freedom and protection we think children ought to have
EDL	00:17:58,527	00:18:00,831	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	Because although their corsets are long gone
EDL	00:18:01,343	00:18:02,879	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	Children are still bound

EDL	00:18:25,407	00:18:30,271	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	Her company has many many many rules about what can and cannot be until it's closed
EDL	00:18:30,271	00:18:32,319	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	But those rules are top secret
EDL	00:18:32,319	00:18:35,135	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	Don't Morgan brought me that Australian safety guy
EDL	00:18:35,135	00:18:37,695	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	Because it's kind of similar and it gives you a rough idea

EDL	00:19:15,583	00:19:21,983	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	But those are actually function there just decorative
EDL	00:19:21,983	00:19:26,079	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	It's basically so that kids can look like little adults

EDL	00:20:05,247	00:20:06,015	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	The fabric

EDL	00:20:10,111	00:20:11,903	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	They are concerned about

EDL	00:20:15,231	00:20:16,767	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	Whatever could happen if
EDL	00:20:16,767	00:20:20,351	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	Their kid is wearing loose-fitting clothing and it's hanging this from YouTube

EDL	00:20:31,615	00:20:32,639	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	And this
EDL	00:20:32,639	00:20:37,247	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	Starts to get at our question about why kids clothes look the way they do
EDL	00:20:38,015	00:20:41,599	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	Because note how Morgan said anything that could
EDL	00:20:41,599	00:20:43,391	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	Potentially be sleepwear
EDL	00:20:43,903	00:20:47,487	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	Probability rules don't just apply to clothes labeled as pajamas
EDL	00:20:48,255	00:20:50,815	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	They could apply to Any Garment apparel
EDL	00:20:50,815	00:20:54,143	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	Put the kids to sleep in for that a kid decides that they want to sleep in it
EDL	00:20:54,655	00:20:56,959	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	So anything that is comfortable or soft
EDL	00:20:57,727	00:21:01,055	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	Which means that kids clothing if it's not sleepwear
EDL	00:21:01,055	00:21:05,151	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	Have to go through great pains to prove that it's not sleepwear
EDL	00:21:05,151	00:21:08,735	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	So that they don't have to meet all those flammability in size requirements
EDL	00:21:09,503	00:21:13,599	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	So let's say you're trying to design kid clothes that are not for sleeping
EDL	00:21:14,111	00:21:18,208	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	They can't have pictures of anything that could be interpreted as
EDL	00:21:18,208	00:21:19,488	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	Weepy like what is
EDL	00:21:19,488	00:21:25,632	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	Pictured on it is it sleeping animals is it a sleepy scene that make you feel sleepy if it makes you feel sleepy
EDL	00:21:26,400	00:21:27,424	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	Knit sleepwear
EDL	00:21:27,424	00:21:31,008	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	Sono images of the moon no images of stars
EDL	00:21:31,008	00:21:34,080	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	And no clouds
EDL	00:21:34,080	00:21:38,688	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	Your legal department at your company like you can't do that cuz that makes me feel like sleep
EDL	00:21:38,688	00:21:39,456	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	And then
EDL	00:21:39,456	00:21:40,480	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	Certain animals
EDL	00:21:40,480	00:21:41,504	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	Like I will
EDL	00:21:41,504	00:21:43,552	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	Same with other nocturnal creatures like bat
EDL	00:21:44,320	00:21:49,696	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	Unless you're designing a Halloween line and you really really really want to have a shirt with a bat on it
EDL	00:21:49,696	00:21:55,072	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	But enough is on Halloween in that had enough like sequins on it or something maybe you can get away with it
EDL	00:21:55,584	00:22:01,728	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	Sequence of good way to show garment is not for sleeping same with glitter and Action Graphics and bright colors in order
EDL	00:22:02,752	00:22:05,312	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	You could bring it enough out of sleepwear.
EDL	00:22:05,312	00:22:06,592	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	The kid would never want to sleep on
EDL	00:22:08,896	00:22:10,432	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	A jacket or something like that
EDL	00:22:11,200	00:22:14,016	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	It's decoration as a form of protection
EDL	00:22:14,528	00:22:18,880	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	Sending kids from fire and also protecting the companies from liability
EDL	00:22:19,648	00:22:22,208	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	Sometimes behind the glitter and garishness
EDL	00:22:22,208	00:22:23,232	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	It illegal subjects
EDL	00:22:24,256	00:22:25,024	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	Sometimes
EDL	00:22:25,024	00:22:31,424	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	Not all the time I would say that that they believe that they're giving you something more special
EDL	00:22:31,424	00:22:32,960	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	Something more marketable
EDL	00:22:32,960	00:22:34,752	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	By putting tchotchkes

EDL	00:22:35,520	00:22:41,408	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	This is Lana Hogue the industry expert has been working in garment development and production for over 30 years
EDL	00:22:41,408	00:22:42,944	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	And the sequence
EDL	00:22:42,944	00:22:44,736	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	Are usually to appeal
EDL	00:22:44,736	00:22:46,528	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	To the child
EDL	00:22:46,528	00:22:47,808	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	Pets groups in focus
EDL	00:22:50,112	00:22:55,744	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	You know I think they should more I have not seen that anywhere really I worked
EDL	00:22:55,744	00:22:57,024	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	Manufacturers will ask
EDL	00:22:57,024	00:22:59,328	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	Parents what they're looking for in terms of styles
EDL	00:22:59,840	00:23:01,120	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	But not the kids themselves
EDL	00:23:01,632	00:23:06,752	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	Probably the closest they've come to focus groups and test groups
EDL	00:23:06,752	00:23:11,616	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	Where the photo shoots well and fit sessions we want to see how something fits but if they're kind of
EDL	00:23:12,640	00:23:14,432	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	And they want out of it
EDL	00:23:14,944	00:23:21,344	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	Then you know that that's probably just a special occasion
EDL	00:23:21,344	00:23:22,112	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	Cancel
EDL	00:23:22,112	00:23:23,136	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	A garment because
EDL	00:23:23,648	00:23:26,464	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	Kid didn't like it personally they don't
EDL	00:23:26,464	00:23:27,232	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	Estelle
EDL	00:23:27,232	00:23:30,560	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	The loudness of a kid's department has to do with safety rules
EDL	00:23:30,560	00:23:31,584	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	But not entirely
EDL	00:23:31,584	00:23:37,984	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	So it's not because of flammability it's because of what kids want but we don't ask kids what they want
EDL	00:23:37,984	00:23:40,288	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	Exactly now I think you're right
EDL	00:23:40,288	00:23:42,848	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	But if you took a child into the store
EDL	00:23:43,360	00:23:44,896	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	And you're walking around
EDL	00:23:44,896	00:23:46,688	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	A lot of them are drunk
EDL	00:23:46,688	00:23:48,992	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	To the the silly things hanging off a Garmin
EDL	00:23:49,504	00:23:55,904	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	But only up until a certain age and I think that kids go through a really awkward. Where they're trying to figure
EDL	00:23:55,904	00:23:56,672	| Kids_Clothes_Articles_of_Interest_1_pt_1_Loom |	Route
