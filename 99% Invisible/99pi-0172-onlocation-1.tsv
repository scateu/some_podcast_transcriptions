EDL	00:01:35,744	00:01:39,072	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Even if they didn't take place in downtown Los Angeles
EDL	00:01:39,584	00:01:43,168	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	It's always fun when you watching a movie that take place in New York and you spot a palm tree
EDL	00:01:44,704	00:01:49,056	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Palm trees are just one of the factors that a location scout has to worry about
EDL	00:01:49,056	00:01:55,456	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Most films they really have to avoid them
EDL	00:01:55,456	00:01:56,736	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	It's at a cost
EDL	00:01:56,736	00:01:59,296	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Lori Bolton is a location scout in LA
EDL	00:01:59,296	00:02:02,368	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	She's worked on Inception heat A River Runs Through It

EDL	00:02:18,752	00:02:25,152	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Lots of them are frequently will show someone over a hundred different options for one location you know before they get a sense of what they
EDL	00:02:25,152	00:02:30,272	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	But Scouts also have to make sure that the locations they find are actually usable
EDL	00:02:30,784	00:02:34,880	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	So big part of Lawry's job is convincing Property Owners to say yes

EDL	00:03:01,760	00:03:08,160	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Really proud of the city and the variety of locations and how much fun it is to dino drive around and discover
EDL	00:03:08,160	00:03:08,672	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Everything
EDL	00:03:09,440	00:03:10,976	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	From the top floor balcony
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:13,536	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	We could see the massive City unfurling around us
EDL	00:03:14,048	00:03:16,864	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Emily pointed out all of her favorite location
EDL	00:03:16,864	00:03:19,424	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	There's so much variety here it's amazing
EDL	00:03:19,936	00:03:23,520	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	But even with all the architectural variety of Los Angeles
EDL	00:03:23,520	00:03:26,336	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Some buildings just keep coming back on screen
EDL	00:03:26,336	00:03:27,616	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Again and again
EDL	00:03:27,616	00:03:30,176	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Those architectural gems are very
EDL	00:03:30,176	00:03:31,456	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Particular and very kind of
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:32,736	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Binding
EDL	00:03:32,736	00:03:39,136	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	It's someone's watching it for like pina 10 minutes going like this feels so familiar what is this location
EDL	00:03:39,136	00:03:40,672	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	I know I know it and then I'll just
EDL	00:03:40,672	00:03:42,976	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Oh my God that's the Bradbury Building
EDL	00:03:43,744	00:03:45,024	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	The Bradbury Building
EDL	00:03:45,024	00:03:48,608	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Arguably the biggest architectural movie star of Los Angeles
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:50,912	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	It's one of Lori's favorite locations
EDL	00:03:51,680	00:03:53,728	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	It can be modern that can be.
EDL	00:03:53,728	00:03:54,752	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	It's kind of
EDL	00:03:54,752	00:03:56,288	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Upscale steampunk
EDL	00:03:56,288	00:03:57,312	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	The iron work
EDL	00:03:57,312	00:03:58,592	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Open balconies
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:03:59,616	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Just beautiful building
EDL	00:04:01,152	00:04:04,736	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	The Bradbury made his first on-screen appearance in 1943
EDL	00:04:05,248	00:04:06,528	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	In the movie China Girl
EDL	00:04:06,528	00:04:08,064	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	When it played at Burmese Hotel
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:10,624	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	It played a London military hospital and white
EDL	00:04:11,136	00:04:11,904	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	The Dover
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:18,303	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	It was the background of the Fillmore style Thriller DOA in 1950
EDL	00:04:18,303	00:04:19,071	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Model
EDL	00:04:19,071	00:04:22,399	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	In the 1969 movie Marlowe
EDL	00:04:22,399	00:04:24,959	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Bruce Lee steps into an office of the Bradbury
EDL	00:04:24,959	00:04:26,239	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	And kicks all the furniture apart
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:31,359	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Who played in office again in the final scene of 500 Days of Summer
EDL	00:04:31,359	00:04:31,871	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Next to me
EDL	00:04:33,663	00:04:35,455	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	It was a movie studio in the artist
EDL	00:04:35,455	00:04:38,271	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	It was a chocolate factory in a recent commercial for Twix
EDL	00:04:38,783	00:04:43,391	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	But the Bradbury's most famous role of all was as the toymaker's house
EDL	00:04:43,391	00:04:45,439	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	In the 1982 movie
EDL	00:04:45,439	00:04:45,951	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Blade Runner
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:54,655	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	In Blade Runner the Bradbury is a dark Moody ruin
EDL	00:04:54,655	00:05:00,287	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Which seems like some real Hollywood magic when you see what the building actually looks like
EDL	00:05:00,287	00:05:03,103	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	From the outside the Bradbury just looks like a brick office
EDL	00:05:03,103	00:05:05,151	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	This building at the corner of 3rd and Broadway downtown
EDL	00:05:05,663	00:05:06,687	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Kind of unremarkable
EDL	00:05:07,455	00:05:09,247	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	But then you step inside and it's like
EDL	00:05:12,319	00:05:13,343	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Is this great
EDL	00:05:13,855	00:05:16,671	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Biblical shaft of light shining through it
EDL	00:05:17,183	00:05:23,583	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	It's basically a tall narrow Courtyard Walden with terracotta covered with a glass ceiling and flanked by two
EDL	00:05:23,583	00:05:26,911	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Do iron clanking hydraulic powered elevators
EDL	00:05:26,911	00:05:29,727	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	The kind that are still run by human operators
EDL	00:05:29,727	00:05:31,007	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Avery Road in one
EDL	00:05:31,007	00:05:32,031	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Cheap is it at the building
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:34,335	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Thank you
EDL	00:05:34,847	00:05:38,175	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	There's a reason the Bradbury is in so many films
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:38,687	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	For 1
EDL	00:05:39,199	00:05:40,735	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	It's really beautiful
EDL	00:05:41,247	00:05:42,271	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	For the tile
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:43,807	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Steps are marble
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:44,575	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Annies
EDL	00:05:44,575	00:05:47,391	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Floor in the atrium with a layer of ornate
EDL	00:05:47,391	00:05:48,415	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Wrought iron balcony
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:50,975	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	But it's not just Aesthetics
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:55,327	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	You have the balcony isn't all of the different levels and you can shoot across and down and
EDL	00:05:55,327	00:05:59,167	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Catty-corner the balconies allow the crew to shoot at many different angles
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:01,983	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	And create a whole range of different moods
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:02,751	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	For various genres
EDL	00:06:03,263	00:06:09,663	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	The romantic comedy would probably be straight on the horror movie would be more shooting up shooting damage in that sense
EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:13,503	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Vertigo and the Bradbury can accommodate all the film gear
EDL	00:06:13,503	00:06:18,367	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	I just have to get in so many toys you know the lights in the boom arm and this and that
EDL	00:06:18,367	00:06:20,415	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	But look at the ceiling height this is great
EDL	00:06:21,183	00:06:22,975	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Hosts of the Bradbury is near a parking lot
EDL	00:06:23,487	00:06:24,767	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Which is surprisingly crucial
EDL	00:06:25,279	00:06:29,887	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Because it don't shoot involves Vans and trailers and tons of people and tons of equipment
EDL	00:06:30,399	00:06:32,447	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	And the parking lot is the place to put it all
EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:37,055	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	It's also nice that the Bradbury is close to downtown and the crew can just go grab lunch
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:38,591	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	It is
EDL	00:06:38,591	00:06:40,895	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	There's like nothing like it in Los Angeles them
EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:45,247	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	So that's Kim Cooper architectural historian
EDL	00:06:45,247	00:06:48,575	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	She brought me back to the Bradbury along with her husband Richard shaver
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:51,391	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	We are founders of Essex

EDL	00:08:28,927	00:08:29,439	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	It's
EDL	00:08:29,951	00:08:31,231	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	An irresistible offer
EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:34,303	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	But George Wyman is an ethical man
EDL	00:08:34,303	00:08:38,655	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	And he's also scared to death and so he does what any good Angelina will do

EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:05,535	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Planchette's would typically be consulted when someone had an issue that they wanted some guidance on
EDL	00:09:06,559	00:09:12,703	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	So he and his wife were sitting together saying what on Earth should I do about mr. Bradbury's wonderful terrifying off
EDL	00:09:13,215	00:09:14,239	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	The planchette

EDL	00:09:50,079	00:09:53,663	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	The design of the Bradbury was directly inspired by a novel
EDL	00:09:54,175	00:09:55,967	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Looking backwards by Edward Bellamy
EDL	00:09:55,967	00:09:57,759	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Which was written in 1887
EDL	00:09:58,271	00:09:59,039	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	But in it
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:10:02,623	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	There's a description of a building in the year 2000
EDL	00:10:02,623	00:10:04,159	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	The future
EDL	00:10:04,159	00:10:05,183	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Women with
EDL	00:10:05,183	00:10:09,535	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Trying to do with this balloon I think I think we can answer just simply by reading the passage
EDL	00:10:09,535	00:10:11,327	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	A vast Hall full of light
EDL	00:10:11,327	00:10:15,423	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Received not alone from the windows on all sides but from the Dome
EDL	00:10:16,191	00:10:17,215	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	So that's
EDL	00:10:17,215	00:10:19,007	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	What this building does
EDL	00:10:19,007	00:10:24,639	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	And that's why even though the Bradbury is quite old by California Sanders it field current
EDL	00:10:24,639	00:10:26,943	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	It was designed for the year 2000
EDL	00:10:26,943	00:10:30,271	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	It's this blend of styles that makes it an architectural gem
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:35,135	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	But aside from the occasional film shoot the building spent a lot of its life totally ignored
EDL	00:10:37,183	00:10:39,999	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Late 40s early 50s is once described as a chicken
EDL	00:10:41,023	00:10:45,119	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	And in that just refers to the dustiness and the sword of untidiness
EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:46,399	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	By 74
EDL	00:10:46,911	00:10:49,471	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	This this place is really falling apart
EDL	00:10:49,471	00:10:55,871	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	So when Ridley Scott shot Blade Runner and it's Central Atrium it wasn't actually that hard to make it look so shabby
EDL	00:10:55,871	00:10:56,639	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Blade Runner
EDL	00:10:56,639	00:10:57,663	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	That was just
EDL	00:10:57,663	00:10:59,711	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Amazing that was before we'd actually
EDL	00:10:59,711	00:11:00,991	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Fix it up and you can tell that
EDL	00:11:01,503	00:11:02,015	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	From the movie
EDL	00:11:02,527	00:11:05,343	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	This is Adele yellin
EDL	00:11:05,855	00:11:07,903	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	But my husband bought the building
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:09,951	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	In the late 80s
EDL	00:11:09,951	00:11:11,231	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	And he retrofit
EDL	00:11:11,999	00:11:13,279	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Adele's late husband

EDL	00:11:14,303	00:11:16,607	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Spearheaded LA's downtown Revival
EDL	00:11:16,607	00:11:18,911	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	If I restore an old historic building
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:20,447	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	And turning them into housing
EDL	00:11:20,447	00:11:20,959	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Businesses
EDL	00:11:21,471	00:11:23,007	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	But the Bradbury was just
EDL	00:11:23,007	00:11:27,359	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Virtual and he wanted to work on it then he felt if you build it they will come
EDL	00:11:27,871	00:11:28,895	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	So
EDL	00:11:28,895	00:11:30,431	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	I don't know
EDL	00:11:30,431	00:11:34,015	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	They ultimately came but he he did have to use
EDL	00:11:34,527	00:11:36,575	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	I have the city to help him
EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:37,855	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Arielle and asked
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:40,159	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	If the city of Los Angeles could find a steady

EDL	00:11:41,695	00:11:43,487	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	He ended up getting the
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:44,767	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Police Department
EDL	00:11:45,279	00:11:51,167	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Most of the office space in the Bradbury Building belongs to the internal affairs division of the LAPD
EDL	00:11:51,167	00:11:53,983	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Yeah they're they're there all the time and
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:57,311	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	They don't mind the filming generally Bender
EDL	00:11:57,823	00:12:00,127	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Hino handled all the filming requests
EDL	00:12:00,127	00:12:00,639	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	For the Bradbury
EDL	00:12:01,407	00:12:02,175	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	What we do a

EDL	00:12:02,943	00:12:04,479	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Drama will you take extra
EDL	00:12:04,479	00:12:06,271	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Precaution to make sure they know that
EDL	00:12:06,271	00:12:10,111	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	We're filming and the person running around with a gun type of thing is not
EDL	00:12:10,623	00:12:11,647	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Very
EDL	00:12:13,183	00:12:15,999	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	But filming isn't the priority for the property anymore
EDL	00:12:15,999	00:12:18,559	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Send it to Innovation the tenants needs come first
EDL	00:12:19,327	00:12:22,655	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Try not to bother the tenants too much so we try to
EDL	00:12:22,655	00:12:25,983	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Do the filming or not do more than one or two filming project
EDL	00:12:25,983	00:12:26,751	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	4 month
EDL	00:12:26,751	00:12:30,335	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	And generally this is the case throughout buildings downtown
EDL	00:12:30,335	00:12:35,199	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Now that people live and work there they don't want production Crews periodically taking over
EDL	00:12:35,711	00:12:42,111	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	These days film Crews can't blow up cars in the street or have 300 zombies Stampy down Broadway in the middle

EDL	00:12:49,791	00:12:52,863	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	I mean there's no feature films shooting here I've
EDL	00:12:52,863	00:12:54,399	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	It's scary
EDL	00:12:54,399	00:12:59,519	| 99pi-0172-onlocation-1 |	Because I said I love living here and I would like to continue sleeping in my bed if possible
