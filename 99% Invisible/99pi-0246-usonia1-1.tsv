EDL	00:06:39,103	00:06:39,871	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	So he

EDL	00:06:47,807	00:06:48,575	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	And this

EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:50,111	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	With the outdoors
EDL	00:06:50,623	00:06:52,415	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Was really formative for right
EDL	00:06:53,183	00:06:57,535	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	He thought that architecture should help people live harmoniously with their environment
EDL	00:06:58,047	00:06:58,815	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Rather than
EDL	00:06:58,815	00:06:59,839	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Shield them from it
EDL	00:07:00,351	00:07:01,119	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	The house
EDL	00:07:01,119	00:07:02,911	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	To become part of nature
EDL	00:07:02,911	00:07:04,959	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	If it was made with local materials and had
EDL	00:07:04,959	00:07:07,263	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Big windows and was oriented for
EDL	00:07:07,263	00:07:08,287	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Just the right amount

EDL	00:07:17,759	00:07:18,783	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	The fight against it
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:21,343	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	You know living on the brow of the Hill
EDL	00:07:21,343	00:07:22,111	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Knot on top of that
EDL	00:07:22,623	00:07:24,415	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	It's all folded into a concept
EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:25,695	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Frank Lloyd Wright called
EDL	00:07:25,695	00:07:26,975	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Organic architecture
EDL	00:07:27,487	00:07:30,047	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	You wanted to spread this gospel to the Next Generation
EDL	00:07:30,559	00:07:33,119	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Which is why he returned to the valley he knew as a boy
EDL	00:07:33,631	00:07:34,143	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Established
EDL	00:07:34,655	00:07:35,679	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	The Taliesin Fellowship
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:40,799	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Fellowship with the thing that the Milwaukee Journal wanted Herbert Jacobs to cover a news article
EDL	00:07:40,799	00:07:45,151	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	When Jacobs drove into Taliesin that morning in 1934
EDL	00:07:45,151	00:07:47,455	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	The fellowship had been going on for two years
EDL	00:07:47,455	00:07:49,759	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	It was hard for the public to wrap their minds around
EDL	00:07:50,271	00:07:52,063	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Including this NBC announcer
EDL	00:08:01,279	00:08:03,071	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	King is Frank Lloyd Wright
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:08,959	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	They are such a right as the fingers of my hand
EDL	00:08:09,471	00:08:13,823	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	The apprentices had to pay $1,100 a year to attend the Taliesin Fellowship
EDL	00:08:13,823	00:08:15,615	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Nearly 20 grand today
EDL	00:08:15,615	00:08:18,175	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	And it wasn't like an accredited institution or anything
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:20,223	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Students had to do a lot of grunt work
EDL	00:08:20,735	00:08:21,759	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Baling hay
EDL	00:08:21,759	00:08:23,295	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Diamond fields in making meals
EDL	00:08:23,807	00:08:26,367	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	But they got to learn Frank Lloyd Wright's philosophy of architect
EDL	00:08:26,879	00:08:27,647	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	And live with them
EDL	00:08:27,647	00:08:28,415	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	And work with them
EDL	00:08:28,415	00:08:32,511	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Even though often times has meant serving as an unpaid labor force
EDL	00:08:32,511	00:08:35,071	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	When Jacobs was getting his tour of Taliesin
EDL	00:08:35,071	00:08:36,863	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	He described the apprentices as
EDL	00:08:36,863	00:08:40,191	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Rather long-haired smiling and polite young men
EDL	00:08:40,191	00:08:43,519	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Who tried their best to explain to him what organic architecture
EDL	00:08:43,519	00:08:44,031	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Sure means
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:45,823	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Organic architecture is
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:49,919	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Architecture of its time and of its place
EDL	00:08:50,431	00:08:51,455	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	You're not trying to make it
EDL	00:08:51,455	00:08:52,479	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Look like something
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:53,503	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	But it's not
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:56,575	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Write thought that there should be no wallpaper to cover things up
EDL	00:08:56,575	00:08:57,855	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	No paint no plaster
EDL	00:08:58,367	00:08:59,903	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Would should look like what
EDL	00:08:59,903	00:09:01,695	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Stone should look like Stone
EDL	00:09:01,695	00:09:03,487	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Concrete should look like concrete
EDL	00:09:03,999	00:09:05,279	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	When Frank Lloyd Wright
EDL	00:09:05,279	00:09:06,303	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Worked with
EDL	00:09:06,303	00:09:07,839	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Why would he like
EDL	00:09:07,839	00:09:12,191	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	To leave the edge of the plywood exposed so that you saw those layers

EDL	00:09:17,055	00:09:18,591	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Which was different from

EDL	00:09:33,695	00:09:37,279	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	This idea of organic architecture wasn't just a break from these tradition
EDL	00:09:37,791	00:09:41,119	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	It was a break from new trends in modern architecture 2

EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:44,671	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	What the country needs is a decent $5,000 house can you build one
EDL	00:12:45,183	00:12:47,999	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	In today's money $5,000 is about $85,000

EDL	00:13:00,031	00:13:03,871	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Millwright had long wanted to make a more democratic form of housing

EDL	00:13:07,967	00:13:08,991	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	The building and other stuff
EDL	00:13:09,759	00:13:13,087	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	I need a lot of Concepts that had been scheming around urban planning
EDL	00:13:13,599	00:13:14,367	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	But now
EDL	00:13:14,879	00:13:17,183	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Write have a chance to make some of his Concepts
EDL	00:13:17,183	00:13:17,951	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	A reality
EDL	00:13:18,463	00:13:19,999	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	She had the Willing science
EDL	00:13:19,999	00:13:20,767	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	And
EDL	00:13:20,767	00:13:21,535	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	He had time on his head
EDL	00:13:22,559	00:13:25,375	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	In 1936 he was in a bit of a slump in his career
EDL	00:13:26,143	00:13:28,447	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	People can afford fancy big new homes
EDL	00:13:29,215	00:13:30,751	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Again it was The Depression
EDL	00:13:30,751	00:13:32,543	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	A number of big projects have been
EDL	00:13:32,543	00:13:36,127	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Cancelled and also write had already been practicing for decades
EDL	00:13:36,639	00:13:39,199	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	He was slowly getting written off as a has-been
EDL	00:13:39,711	00:13:42,527	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	And then in comes this young open-minded couples
EDL	00:13:42,527	00:13:44,575	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Wright could tell them his philosophy
EDL	00:13:44,575	00:13:47,391	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	And teach them how to live well for good architecture
EDL	00:13:48,671	00:13:51,231	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Do you really want a $5,000 house
EDL	00:13:51,999	00:13:55,071	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	She said most people want a $10,000 house for 5,000
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:13:58,655	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Are you willing to give up the things that you have to give up
EDL	00:13:58,655	00:14:01,983	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Mr. Wright made a list of the things that the Jacobs would have to do without
EDL	00:14:02,751	00:14:05,055	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Really wanted a $5,000 house
EDL	00:14:05,567	00:14:06,847	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Tile bathrooms
EDL	00:14:07,359	00:14:10,943	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Extra trim finishing things like that are you willing to give those up
EDL	00:14:11,711	00:14:14,271	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	We didn't know anything about it we said sure that's okay with us
EDL	00:14:15,551	00:14:18,367	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Herbert and Katherine Jacob's didn't know it at the time
EDL	00:14:18,879	00:14:21,951	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	But that modest little house that Frank Lloyd Wright was
EDL	00:14:21,951	00:14:22,463	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	To build for them
EDL	00:14:22,975	00:14:24,255	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Would be the most
EDL	00:14:24,255	00:14:25,535	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Classical expression
EDL	00:14:26,047	00:14:27,583	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Of his ideology
EDL	00:14:27,583	00:14:31,423	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	The Jacobs would own the first house in a movement that right called
EDL	00:14:31,423	00:14:31,935	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Usonia
EDL	00:14:32,447	00:14:36,031	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	The house that Herbert Jacobs built was the first of the usonian houses
EDL	00:14:42,431	00:14:47,295	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Usonia was Frank Lloyd Wright's name for the United States of North America
EDL	00:14:47,807	00:14:51,903	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	In Wright's vision usonia would be a country full of modest
EDL	00:14:51,903	00:14:52,671	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Well made
EDL	00:14:52,671	00:14:54,975	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Beautiful comfortable little house

EDL	00:15:05,727	00:15:10,591	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	I believe now people are going to know what constitutes good architecture
EDL	00:15:10,591	00:15:12,895	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	And of course good living has to go with it

EDL	00:16:09,983	00:16:12,287	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	There was a time during the Middle Ages
EDL	00:16:13,567	00:16:14,079	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	When
EDL	00:16:14,591	00:16:16,383	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Said it was the only source of culture
EDL	00:16:17,919	00:16:19,711	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	There's no way of acquiring

EDL	00:16:25,343	00:16:27,135	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	That wasn't true anymore
EDL	00:16:27,135	00:16:31,231	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	People were connected to culture through radio and telephones and Automobiles
EDL	00:16:31,231	00:16:31,999	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	They have

EDL	00:16:41,983	00:16:43,775	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	For people to crowd together anyway
EDL	00:16:44,543	00:16:47,615	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	These were all parts of Frank Lloyd Wright
EDL	00:16:47,615	00:16:48,639	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Vision for America
EDL	00:16:49,151	00:16:52,735	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	And this would start to become reality in 1936
EDL	00:16:52,735	00:16:53,503	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	With the Jacobs
EDL	00:16:54,271	00:16:56,831	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Which would come to be known as Jacobs one
EDL	00:16:57,599	00:16:58,111	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Or
EDL	00:16:58,623	00:17:00,159	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Usonia 1
EDL	00:17:00,159	00:17:01,183	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Jacob's house was

EDL	00:17:10,399	00:17:14,751	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	It's in a Suburban Street at side of Madison now lined with little suburban houses
EDL	00:17:14,751	00:17:17,055	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	But usonia one really stands out
EDL	00:17:17,055	00:17:19,615	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Even if you don't know what it is and you're just driving by
EDL	00:17:19,615	00:17:21,407	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Because I'm a street
EDL	00:17:21,407	00:17:24,223	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	It almost looks like a beautiful wooden wall
EDL	00:17:25,247	00:17:27,295	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	The house turned its back on the road
EDL	00:17:27,295	00:17:32,415	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Well when you get inside her if we go around back you'll see that whole back of the house so I'll glass it's all open
EDL	00:17:32,415	00:17:37,023	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Come to the back and he only did that intentionally the kind of close it off to the street and then
EDL	00:17:37,535	00:17:38,815	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Open it up to the back

EDL	00:17:59,551	00:18:01,855	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Just a little flat roof with no sidewalk

EDL	00:18:17,471	00:18:20,287	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	And also the carport was an education in lifestyle

EDL	00:20:11,135	00:20:13,183	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	The open-plan was pretty novel
EDL	00:20:13,183	00:20:15,487	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	And it was cost-saving to not have many walls

EDL	00:20:31,615	00:20:32,127	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Another first

EDL	00:20:39,551	00:20:41,343	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	That's a usonian invention
EDL	00:20:41,343	00:20:44,927	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Other Innovations usonia popularized include the use of flat roof

EDL	00:21:02,335	00:21:04,127	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	They saved money while they lived in the house
EDL	00:21:04,639	00:21:06,175	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	And they also save costs

EDL	00:21:07,967	00:21:11,039	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	But right you some other cost-saving measures that were kind of
EDL	00:21:11,551	00:21:12,319	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Cheating
EDL	00:21:12,319	00:21:15,391	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Like he stole some bricks from another building of his
EDL	00:21:15,391	00:21:16,928	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	But he was constructing nearby
EDL	00:21:16,928	00:21:18,976	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Well right didn't steal the bricks himself
EDL	00:21:18,976	00:21:25,376	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	He sent a bunch of his apprentices over to Racine Wisconsin where his design for the Johnson wax building was under

EDL	00:21:26,144	00:21:29,472	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	He told the apprentices to grab as many bricks if they could
EDL	00:21:29,472	00:21:30,752	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	And bring them back to Madison
EDL	00:21:30,752	00:21:32,544	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	If you're familiar with the

EDL	00:21:36,384	00:21:37,664	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	So you can see
EDL	00:21:37,664	00:21:38,688	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Some of these bricks are
EDL	00:21:39,968	00:21:43,040	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Convex or concave while those were
EDL	00:21:44,320	00:21:45,600	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Like Corner brick
EDL	00:21:45,600	00:21:48,160	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Another way right cap cost down was by taken

EDL	00:22:03,520	00:22:04,288	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	I mean
EDL	00:22:04,288	00:22:05,056	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	It wasn't
EDL	00:22:05,056	00:22:05,824	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Perfect

EDL	00:22:15,040	00:22:17,600	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Which one of the kinds of complaints right got a lot
EDL	00:22:17,600	00:22:20,672	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	He mostly focused on Aesthetics and principles of building
EDL	00:22:20,672	00:22:21,952	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Rather than practicalities
EDL	00:22:22,720	00:22:24,000	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	And ultimately
EDL	00:22:24,000	00:22:25,536	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	The Jacob's house was
EDL	00:22:25,536	00:22:26,304	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Small
EDL	00:22:26,304	00:22:28,608	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	After Herbert and Katherine had two more children

EDL	00:22:47,040	00:22:48,064	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Fantastic
EDL	00:22:52,672	00:22:56,256	| 99pi-0246-usonia1-1 |	Mister Wright thought so too. Everybody should live in a house
