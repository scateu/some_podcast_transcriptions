EDL	00:01:34,720	00:01:37,024	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	There's a brand-new team in the NBA at the time

EDL	00:01:41,376	00:01:44,192	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	The Bulls were the best team in the league
EDL	00:01:44,192	00:01:45,472	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	And the Raptors
EDL	00:01:45,472	00:01:46,496	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	We're pretty terrible
EDL	00:01:47,008	00:01:49,056	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	36000 fan showed up that day
EDL	00:01:49,568	00:01:51,104	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	And the Raptors actually beat the Bulls
EDL	00:01:51,616	00:01:53,920	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	But it was a mostly meaningless game at the end of the

EDL	00:02:00,320	00:02:01,344	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	But the way they look
EDL	00:02:02,368	00:02:04,416	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	There's the Bulls were just classic NBA
EDL	00:02:05,184	00:02:06,976	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	I've had the same logo since 19
EDL	00:02:06,976	00:02:07,744	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	66
EDL	00:02:07,744	00:02:09,280	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	They're wearing their red away jersey
EDL	00:02:09,280	00:02:11,840	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Basically like every Chicago Bulls jersey
EDL	00:02:12,608	00:02:14,912	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	It's red with the word bull was written across

EDL	00:02:16,704	00:02:17,216	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	It's simple
EDL	00:02:17,728	00:02:18,240	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Classic
EDL	00:02:18,752	00:02:23,616	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	But then there's the Toronto Raptors
EDL	00:02:23,616	00:02:28,992	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	The team is wearing their white home uniforms which have Jagged silver and black pinstripe
EDL	00:02:28,992	00:02:30,016	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	As if they were

EDL	00:02:43,840	00:02:45,376	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	And that was just their home uniform
EDL	00:02:46,144	00:02:47,936	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	The road jerseys that you're even more fun
EDL	00:02:48,704	00:02:49,728	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	They were bright purple
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:56,896	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	All this including the Raptors name had been inspired by the Velociraptors in the wildly successful movie duress

EDL	00:02:57,664	00:02:59,712	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	But these jerseys got compared to a different
EDL	00:03:00,224	00:03:02,272	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Much friendlier 90s dinosaur
EDL	00:03:02,272	00:03:08,416	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Dinosaur
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:15,584	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	That's now known as the Barney design because

EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:17,120	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Purple
EDL	00:03:17,632	00:03:18,400	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	This is

EDL	00:03:26,592	00:03:27,616	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	You look at it in
EDL	00:03:27,616	00:03:28,896	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Like really that's a professional

EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:34,272	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	The Raptors jersey may have been particularly garish
EDL	00:03:34,272	00:03:36,320	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	But it wasn't the only Jersey of its kind
EDL	00:03:36,832	00:03:39,904	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	The 90s were this insane decade of NBA uniform design
EDL	00:03:40,416	00:03:43,744	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Reduce some of the wildest jerseys that have ever graced a basketball court

EDL	00:03:48,096	00:03:49,376	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	And haven't been seen since
EDL	00:03:49,888	00:03:55,520	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Like the Atlanta Hawks red and black Jersey with a fierce-looking hawk swooping in across the entire front of it
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:03:57,824	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Holding a basketball and its little Talent

EDL	00:04:14,976	00:04:15,488	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Definitely
EDL	00:04:16,256	00:04:18,303	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	They pushed and extended
EDL	00:04:18,815	00:04:22,143	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	The idea of what a basketball uniform could be or should be
EDL	00:04:22,911	00:04:25,983	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	And many of these designs can be traced back to one man

EDL	00:04:28,287	00:04:31,615	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	I joined the NBA 1990s League's first creative director

EDL	00:04:44,415	00:04:44,927	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Dream job
EDL	00:04:45,439	00:04:46,975	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	My first day at the NBA was just
EDL	00:04:46,975	00:04:47,999	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Filled with excitement
EDL	00:04:47,999	00:04:50,303	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	I'd always been a big sports fan
EDL	00:04:50,303	00:04:51,327	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	And I loved
EDL	00:04:52,095	00:04:52,607	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Design
EDL	00:04:53,375	00:04:54,911	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	I studied graphic design
EDL	00:04:54,911	00:04:56,959	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Cheer Columbia College back in Chicago
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:05:00,287	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	So when I walked in the door in June of 1990 I kind of had a pinched my
EDL	00:05:00,799	00:05:01,567	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Cuz I really didn't
EDL	00:05:02,079	00:05:03,103	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Believe it was happening
EDL	00:05:03,871	00:05:09,247	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Before Tom O'Grady join the League most NBA jerseys look something like that classic Bulls jersey
EDL	00:05:09,759	00:05:13,599	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	It's simple two or three color schemes with the team names across the front
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:17,951	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	There might have been strike here or there may be a cool font but that was about it
EDL	00:05:18,463	00:05:21,279	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	And they weren't designed by designer
EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:25,375	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	The process of Designing team uniforms is mostly left up to
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:26,399	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	The team equipment managers
EDL	00:05:26,911	00:05:29,215	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Because they were responsible for getting
EDL	00:05:29,215	00:05:30,495	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	The players outfitted
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:31,007	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	To play the game
EDL	00:05:31,519	00:05:33,823	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Mostly this consisted of the equipment manager
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:34,847	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Flipping through a catalog
EDL	00:05:35,359	00:05:36,639	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Choosing a designer like
EDL	00:05:36,639	00:05:37,407	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	The right colors
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:39,455	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	It was not a sophisticated business
EDL	00:05:39,455	00:05:39,967	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Let's say that
EDL	00:05:40,479	00:05:42,527	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	They were happy just to get Uniforms on the players back
EDL	00:05:43,295	00:05:45,087	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	But that was all about to change
EDL	00:05:45,087	00:05:46,623	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Because in 1988
EDL	00:05:46,623	00:05:49,439	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Charlotte Hornets introduce a radical new idea
EDL	00:05:50,207	00:05:51,231	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	The color teal

EDL	00:06:08,895	00:06:11,455	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Teal was not a traditional NBA jersey
EDL	00:06:11,967	00:06:12,991	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Not NBA red
EDL	00:06:13,503	00:06:15,807	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	It's not NBA blue it's not self
EDL	00:06:15,807	00:06:17,855	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Fix screen if not Lakers yellow
EDL	00:06:17,855	00:06:19,903	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Tom O'Grady had nothing to do with a teal Hornets
EDL	00:06:20,671	00:06:23,743	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	But he took it as a sign that the league was ready for Boulder design
EDL	00:06:23,743	00:06:26,303	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	It was I was at the kind of a leap of faith
EDL	00:06:26,303	00:06:32,703	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Fridley to say you know this is not really something we've seen before it but as an expansion team will probably let you have this one because
EDL	00:06:32,703	00:06:34,239	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Maybe there's something we can learn
EDL	00:06:35,519	00:06:37,567	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	It turned out fans love
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:39,103	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	The teal Hornets Jersey
EDL	00:06:39,103	00:06:40,127	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	It looks fresh
EDL	00:06:40,127	00:06:40,639	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Indifferent
EDL	00:06:41,151	00:06:43,967	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	It was really very popular they soon became
EDL	00:06:44,479	00:06:45,759	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Known as the Man of Steel
EDL	00:06:45,759	00:06:46,527	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	In all sudden
EDL	00:06:47,039	00:06:49,599	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	The Charlotte Hornets have gained great recognition
EDL	00:06:49,599	00:06:50,623	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Before they never played the bass
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:56,511	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	When Tom O'Grady was hired as the NBA's first creative director two years later in 1990
EDL	00:06:57,023	00:06:59,839	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	He wanted to push Jersey design even further
EDL	00:06:59,839	00:07:00,607	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Not just the colors
EDL	00:07:01,119	00:07:02,655	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	But the designs on the uniform
EDL	00:07:03,423	00:07:07,519	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Until the early nineties there has been real limits to how Wild you could get with these designs
EDL	00:07:08,031	00:07:09,055	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Because all the details
EDL	00:07:09,567	00:07:12,383	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	The numbers the names and the logos had to be sewn on
EDL	00:07:13,151	00:07:15,199	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	To do any kind of complicated graphics
EDL	00:07:15,199	00:07:17,247	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Would have taken a massive amount of embroidery
EDL	00:07:17,759	00:07:21,599	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	And all that thread would have added additional weight made the Jersey hotter to wear
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:26,463	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	But soon after Tom O'Grady join the NBA he would get some new tools to work with
EDL	00:07:26,975	00:07:29,023	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Computer programs like Photoshop and illustrator
EDL	00:07:29,535	00:07:31,327	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Helped him dream up new logo designs
EDL	00:07:31,839	00:07:34,911	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	And was a new technique to get those drawings onto a Jersey
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:36,959	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	It was called dye sublimation
EDL	00:07:37,471	00:07:38,751	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Sublimation changed everything
EDL	00:07:39,263	00:07:42,591	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Sublimation is a process of printing dye directly into the fabric
EDL	00:07:43,103	00:07:45,919	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	No for the first time you could design something in Photoshop
EDL	00:07:45,919	00:07:48,479	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	You can make it big and you could add a bunch of different colors
EDL	00:07:48,991	00:07:52,831	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Then with sublimation you can basically print that design straight onto the material
EDL	00:07:53,343	00:07:55,135	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Without any embroidery or extra weight
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:07:56,415	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	So
EDL	00:07:56,415	00:07:59,743	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	It allowed us to start to take things we would never normally even
EDL	00:07:59,743	00:08:00,511	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Consider doing
EDL	00:08:00,511	00:08:01,535	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	On a Jersey
EDL	00:08:02,303	00:08:05,119	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	And we started doing more outrageous uniforms
EDL	00:08:05,119	00:08:05,887	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	The stuff because we could
EDL	00:08:06,399	00:08:07,167	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	We can
EDL	00:08:07,167	00:08:07,679	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	So we will
EDL	00:08:08,447	00:08:10,751	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Comes first big design was for the Phoenix Suns
EDL	00:08:10,751	00:08:12,799	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	We're celebrating our 25th year in the league
EDL	00:08:13,311	00:08:14,847	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	They were moving into a new Arena
EDL	00:08:14,847	00:08:15,871	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	They wanted a new look
EDL	00:08:16,383	00:08:18,687	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Soto met with their team owner Jerry Colangelo
EDL	00:08:19,455	00:08:23,295	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Gary is great he was a fellow chicagoan so as soon as he heard my accent he's like
EDL	00:08:23,295	00:08:27,903	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	I think we're going to get along you know I think of Chicago guys kind of get this here's what I want to do
EDL	00:08:28,415	00:08:32,511	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	I want to have a logo that's going to last for the next 25 years I don't want to have to change
EDL	00:08:32,511	00:08:34,303	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	I want something futuristic
EDL	00:08:34,303	00:08:35,071	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	The classic
EDL	00:08:35,071	00:08:37,631	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	So Tom and his team started on the Suns redesign
EDL	00:08:38,911	00:08:41,727	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	They come up with this big basketball that's also a son
EDL	00:08:42,239	00:08:45,567	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Aziz long red to orange gradient sun rays coming off
EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:47,615	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	And then they print this
EDL	00:08:47,615	00:08:50,175	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	And a bright purple background under their New Jersey
EDL	00:08:50,687	00:08:53,247	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	It's not exactly what I would call Classic but it is bold
EDL	00:08:53,759	00:08:54,783	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Definitely both
EDL	00:08:56,063	00:08:59,135	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	As luck would have it the Phoenix Suns made it to the NBA finals last year
EDL	00:08:59,647	00:09:02,463	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	And the whole country got to see that bright purple jersey
EDL	00:09:02,975	00:09:05,279	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	With its blazing basketball Sun
EDL	00:09:05,279	00:09:06,559	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	All over national TV
EDL	00:09:07,071	00:09:08,863	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	We got exposure that uniform that
EDL	00:09:09,375	00:09:09,887	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Was
EDL	00:09:10,399	00:09:10,911	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Priceless
EDL	00:09:11,423	00:09:12,959	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	That changed
EDL	00:09:12,959	00:09:13,727	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Everything
EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:15,519	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	For us we were able to do
EDL	00:09:16,031	00:09:19,615	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Things with uniforms that we could not imagine even two years before that
EDL	00:09:20,383	00:09:24,223	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Like a teal Detroit Pistons jersey with a flaming horse head logo
EDL	00:09:24,223	00:09:27,807	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Wear a pinstripe Houston Rockets Jersey featuring a cartoon rocket
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:28,831	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	With an angry face on it
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:33,695	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Over the course of the decade 2/3 of NBA teams got new uniforms
EDL	00:09:33,695	00:09:35,231	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	With new logos and new colors
EDL	00:09:36,255	00:09:38,047	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	There was a lot of teal and purple
EDL	00:09:38,559	00:09:41,631	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	3D lettering and oversized Graphics were everywhere
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:43,935	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	We look back on and see Wild

EDL	00:09:46,495	00:09:48,543	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	That's okay cuz that's what was happening at a time
EDL	00:09:48,543	00:09:50,335	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	The technology let us go wild
EDL	00:09:51,871	00:09:54,687	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Atoms boss NBA Commissioner David Stern
EDL	00:09:54,687	00:09:57,503	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Gave him the freedom to keep pushing the designs further
EDL	00:09:57,503	00:10:00,575	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	He said you know if this is what selling any of you telling me this is what's going to

EDL	00:10:05,183	00:10:07,999	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Before the 90s the NBA wasn't doing much with merchandising
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:13,119	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	If a fan wanted to buy a jersey they had to pay the full cost of a genuine stitched
EDL	00:10:13,119	00:10:14,143	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	NBA game Jersey
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:16,447	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Sometimes over $200
EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:18,495	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	With all these popular new designs
EDL	00:10:19,007	00:10:21,311	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Tom and others at the NBA got thinking
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:22,591	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Why don't we
EDL	00:10:22,591	00:10:23,359	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	You know have a
EDL	00:10:23,871	00:10:25,663	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	A jersey that we can sell for about 2
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:26,943	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	45 to $50
EDL	00:10:27,455	00:10:29,247	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	That looks similar to the game Jersey
EDL	00:10:30,271	00:10:32,063	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	And we saw this business explode
EDL	00:10:32,575	00:10:33,855	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Me know in 5 years
EDL	00:10:33,855	00:10:34,623	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	It went from a
EDL	00:10:34,623	00:10:35,391	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Almost like
EDL	00:10:35,391	00:10:36,415	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Baseline of nothing
EDL	00:10:37,183	00:10:38,719	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	A multi-millionaire

EDL	00:10:40,767	00:10:42,047	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	We were designing
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:47,167	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	The Arab outlandish NBA uniforms reached its apex in 1995

EDL	00:10:49,215	00:10:50,239	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	The one from Toronto
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:52,543	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	One that some people call the Barney design
EDL	00:10:53,311	00:10:56,383	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	We were told directly by the team owner at the time John bateau

EDL	00:11:15,839	00:11:17,119	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Making it 1 right now
EDL	00:11:17,887	00:11:20,191	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	The goal was to convince hockey loving kids in Toronto
EDL	00:11:20,703	00:11:21,983	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	That they should care about this new basketball
EDL	00:11:22,751	00:11:23,775	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	And so we crazy

EDL	00:11:25,055	00:11:29,919	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	What these Jagged Edge cloth Pinstripes that look like a raptor come and ripped it
EDL	00:11:30,687	00:11:33,247	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	And then I slapped a big dinosaur right in the middle of it
EDL	00:11:33,759	00:11:34,783	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	And they made it red
EDL	00:11:35,295	00:11:35,807	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Because

EDL	00:11:53,471	00:11:55,007	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Before they ever played a game
EDL	00:11:55,519	00:11:58,335	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Before the team had even signed a single player
EDL	00:11:58,335	00:12:00,895	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	The Raptors were seventh in the league in merchandise
EDL	00:12:01,919	00:12:03,711	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	What is the nineties came to an end
EDL	00:12:03,711	00:12:04,991	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Change was afoot

EDL	00:12:13,951	00:12:16,767	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	And Wealthy business people were suddenly interested in team ownership
EDL	00:12:17,279	00:12:20,607	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	People like Howard Schultz who turns Starbucks into a multibillion-dollar business

EDL	00:21:42,272	00:21:43,040	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Was an instant
EDL	00:21:43,808	00:21:47,904	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	The name Telstar is a portmanteau of the words television and star
EDL	00:21:47,904	00:21:50,720	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Because it was meant to be the perfect soccer ball for televised games
EDL	00:21:51,232	00:21:53,792	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	The name was borrowed from the Telstar communication satellite

EDL	00:21:58,400	00:21:59,936	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	A lot of substance
EDL	00:21:59,936	00:22:03,264	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Have continued to use the same basic approach of alternating darks and lights
EDL	00:22:04,032	00:22:05,568	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	But the designs
EDL	00:22:05,568	00:22:07,872	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Have really evolved to over the years
EDL	00:22:07,872	00:22:12,224	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Official balls went from having 32 to 14 to just eight panels or fewer and son
EDL	00:22:12,992	00:22:14,528	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	And this isn't just cosmetic
EDL	00:22:14,528	00:22:15,808	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Those different number of panels
EDL	00:22:16,320	00:22:17,088	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Change the function of
EDL	00:22:17,600	00:22:23,232	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Yeah they affect the shape and how the ball performs on the field and make a really big sort of structural difference
EDL	00:22:24,000	00:22:25,280	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	So can you tell me about this year's ball
EDL	00:22:26,048	00:22:28,096	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Yeah so this year Adidas

EDL	00:22:39,616	00:22:41,920	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	How similar is the Telstar 18
EDL	00:22:41,920	00:22:42,432	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	To the original
EDL	00:22:43,968	00:22:46,528	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	So it does have black and white but this news
EDL	00:22:46,528	00:22:47,808	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	6 panel design
EDL	00:22:47,808	00:22:50,880	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Actually also features a digital grid pattern of the grave
EDL	00:22:50,880	00:22:52,160	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Pixels that fade between League
EDL	00:22:53,440	00:22:55,744	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Well the original Telstar could be
EDL	00:22:55,744	00:22:59,072	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Easily distracted into a logo now or shrunk down to an emoji
EDL	00:22:59,584	00:23:00,864	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	This one has too much detail for that
EDL	00:23:01,632	00:23:05,728	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	It seems more designed to sell the latest cool looking bald and actually work
EDL	00:23:05,728	00:23:09,824	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Is an icon
EDL	00:23:10,336	00:23:15,200	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	What is crazing mean if they keep changing the design and forcing professional players to deal with
EDL	00:23:15,200	00:23:18,272	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Different shapes and weights and aerodynamics
EDL	00:23:18,272	00:23:20,064	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Over and over year after year that's
EDL	00:23:20,064	00:23:20,832	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	That's crazy to me
EDL	00:23:20,832	00:23:22,880	| 311_The_Barney_Design_pt01 |	Yeah it's been a big source of controversy
