EDL	00:02:44,608	00:02:45,376	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	So what do you think
EDL	00:02:48,192	00:02:48,960	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	You know what he said
EDL	00:02:49,472	00:02:50,752	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	This is the story of a toothbrush
EDL	00:02:51,520	00:02:54,080	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	Pressing is getting a design out there in the world and a prototype
EDL	00:02:54,848	00:02:56,128	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	For the other people can look at it
EDL	00:02:56,128	00:02:57,152	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	You can test it
EDL	00:02:57,152	00:02:59,968	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	You can evaluate it and then you can decide what you're going to do next
EDL	00:03:00,736	00:03:01,760	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	And it really is good
EDL	00:03:01,760	00:03:02,784	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	This kind of forced
EDL	00:03:02,784	00:03:03,552	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	Evolutionary
EDL	00:03:03,552	00:03:04,320	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	Reprocess
EDL	00:03:04,320	00:03:08,160	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	So the toothbrush company came to lunar with what John Edson cause a make
EDL	00:03:08,160	00:03:09,184	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	Pretty extra make
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:10,208	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	Pretty exercise
EDL	00:03:10,208	00:03:14,560	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	That's not really Innovation how do people hold toothbrush
EDL	00:03:14,560	00:03:16,864	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	But the toothbrush company didn't actually know this
EDL	00:03:16,864	00:03:19,168	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	So we engaged a hand
EDL	00:03:19,168	00:03:19,680	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	Kinesiology
EDL	00:03:20,192	00:03:24,032	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	But somebody who knows how people hold stuff it turns out there are five common to
EDL	00:03:24,800	00:03:28,128	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	And the meantime our designers went out and bought every toothbrush under the sun
EDL	00:03:28,128	00:03:31,456	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	We started to take the conventional flat toothbrush with bristles sticking up
EDL	00:03:32,224	00:03:35,808	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	And we use the heat gun and made a bunch of different prototype
EDL	00:03:35,808	00:03:36,320	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	We just
EDL	00:03:36,832	00:03:39,904	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	Those standard brushes into different shapes
EDL	00:03:39,904	00:03:41,952	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	Sissy fundamentally what was working and what was not
EDL	00:03:42,464	00:03:45,536	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	Hundreds of sketches and dozens of prototypes
EDL	00:03:45,536	00:03:47,840	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	One of the first things we found when we were
EDL	00:03:47,840	00:03:49,888	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	Molding our prototypes was that
EDL	00:03:49,888	00:03:51,424	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	At the time the reach toothbrush
EDL	00:03:51,424	00:03:53,216	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	Probably best known as
EDL	00:03:53,216	00:03:54,752	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	The most ergonomic toothbrush
EDL	00:03:54,752	00:03:55,776	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	This was all
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:03:58,592	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	Perception is only ergonomic in that it looked like a dental
EDL	00:03:59,104	00:04:02,176	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	And it was a dental tool that somebody else would use on you
EDL	00:04:02,176	00:04:03,456	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	Crook in the dental mirror
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:07,040	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	It's so that somebody can stick it in your mouth and manipulate it so they can see around
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:08,320	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	The reach toothbrush
EDL	00:04:08,320	00:04:10,624	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	Infuse yourself you end up with your hand back at you
EDL	00:04:10,624	00:04:12,160	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	Describe the bed
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:13,184	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	Straight handle is bad
EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:14,720	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	One of the things we found was a
EDL	00:04:14,720	00:04:17,024	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	Batter toothbrush handle is more comfort
EDL	00:04:17,024	00:04:20,095	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	The fat is better than thin but it's some point in the process
EDL	00:04:20,095	00:04:20,863	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	Someone
EDL	00:04:20,863	00:04:21,631	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	Peppa toothbrush
EDL	00:04:21,631	00:04:22,143	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	Company said
EDL	00:04:23,167	00:04:23,679	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	Wait a minute
EDL	00:04:24,191	00:04:25,215	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	You can't ship a toothbrush
EDL	00:04:25,727	00:04:27,263	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	That's got a fat handle on it
EDL	00:04:27,775	00:04:30,079	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	Because it's not going to fit into those
EDL	00:04:30,079	00:04:34,687	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	1950s Style ceramic toothbrush holders that people have stuck to their walls
EDL	00:04:35,455	00:04:36,479	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	Part of their houses
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:38,783	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	But this turned out to be a good thing
EDL	00:04:38,783	00:04:39,807	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	For the toothbrush manga
EDL	00:04:39,807	00:04:46,207	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	They got a ton of press about it though here's the toothbrush it doesn't fit and Luna came up with a strategy anybody called to complain
EDL	00:04:46,207	00:04:47,999	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	We created the little nickel plated
EDL	00:04:48,511	00:04:49,535	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	Stand that
EDL	00:04:49,535	00:04:51,583	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	Send out this $5 component
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:55,423	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	Just like biological evolution Shore the organism adapt to the environment
EDL	00:04:55,423	00:04:56,191	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	But also
EDL	00:04:56,191	00:04:57,215	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	Environment
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:05:00,287	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	Add apps to the organism and now if you buy a toothbrush holder
EDL	00:05:00,287	00:05:01,311	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	It's going to have these
EDL	00:05:01,311	00:05:04,383	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	Gigantic holes in the top right so you can fit
EDL	00:05:04,383	00:05:05,663	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	These newfangled Cooper
EDL	00:05:07,199	00:05:12,063	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	In addition to the straight and fat handles the new toothbrush also had crisscross bristles angle
EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:17,183	| 04-99-Percent-Details |	That was brand-new the handle was strategically flattened in parts to help you oriented
