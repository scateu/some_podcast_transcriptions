EDL	00:01:11,168	00:01:15,008	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	For most of his life Sam Anderson didn't think about Oklahoma City much at all
EDL	00:01:15,520	00:01:18,336	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Sam is a journalist he lived in New York City for a long time
EDL	00:01:18,848	00:01:20,896	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	In Oklahoma City just wasn't on his radar
EDL	00:01:21,408	00:01:22,944	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	But then in 2012
EDL	00:01:22,944	00:01:24,480	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	He was assigned to do a story
EDL	00:01:24,480	00:01:26,016	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	About the Oklahoma City Thunder
EDL	00:01:26,528	00:01:29,856	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	The city's new basketball team had just gone to the NBA finals
EDL	00:01:30,368	00:01:33,952	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	And they had this amazing Trio of young Stars Kevin Durant

EDL	00:01:34,976	00:01:35,744	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	And James Harden
EDL	00:01:36,256	00:01:38,304	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	They were all really different players
EDL	00:01:38,304	00:01:40,864	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	We could really different temperaments and styles
EDL	00:01:40,864	00:01:42,400	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	There was something kind of
EDL	00:01:42,400	00:01:45,472	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Magical and Unstoppable about the way they played together
EDL	00:01:52,896	00:01:57,760	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Suzanne got on a plane and as you was flying to Oklahoma City to meet the guys and to write about their team
EDL	00:01:57,760	00:02:01,088	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	He was reading a book about the history of Oklahoma to get more familiar with
EDL	00:02:01,856	00:02:04,416	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	And it was talking about the origin of tornadoes
EDL	00:02:04,928	00:02:07,744	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	And it was saying that tornadoes are caused
EDL	00:02:07,744	00:02:09,536	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	By this Collision
EDL	00:02:10,048	00:02:11,840	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Three separate
EDL	00:02:11,840	00:02:13,888	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Very different weather forces
EDL	00:02:13,888	00:02:16,448	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	You got kind of dry air coming from the desert you got this
EDL	00:02:16,448	00:02:19,776	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Cold Arctic air coming down from Canada and you got this warm
EDL	00:02:19,776	00:02:21,056	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Heavy Hot golf
EDL	00:02:21,056	00:02:22,848	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Air coming from the south
EDL	00:02:22,848	00:02:28,992	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	And they all Collide over Oklahoma in a way that those forces don't Collide really anywhere else in the world
EDL	00:02:30,016	00:02:33,600	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	At that moment Sam had a realization and he wrote it down in the margin of the book
EDL	00:02:34,112	00:02:35,648	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Harden Durant
EDL	00:02:35,648	00:02:36,160	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Westbrook
EDL	00:02:36,928	00:02:41,280	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Which was the three big basketball stars in the Thunder who were a similar
EDL	00:02:41,280	00:02:42,048	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Trio of
EDL	00:02:42,560	00:02:44,352	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Strangely clashing forces
EDL	00:02:45,120	00:02:47,168	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	That basketball I've never really seen before so
EDL	00:02:47,680	00:02:50,240	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	In that little leap like I was noticing
EDL	00:02:50,752	00:02:53,568	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	This dematic Echoes between
EDL	00:02:53,568	00:02:59,712	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Things about the history of Oklahoma and things about the basketball team and the kind of civics of the modern
EDL	00:03:00,480	00:03:02,784	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	These kinds of connections everywhere
EDL	00:03:02,784	00:03:07,392	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	The history of Oklahoma City started to seem so into woven with the Contemporary life of
EDL	00:03:07,392	00:03:10,208	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	The place and he's fascinating and unexpected ways
EDL	00:03:10,208	00:03:11,744	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	He decided he wanted to write
EDL	00:03:11,744	00:03:12,256	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Hoboken
EDL	00:03:12,768	00:03:14,560	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Not just about the basketball team but
EDL	00:03:14,560	00:03:17,376	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	About the city itself from its founding which was
EDL	00:03:17,376	00:03:19,424	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Really very weird event
EDL	00:03:19,424	00:03:20,192	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	To the present day
EDL	00:03:20,704	00:03:22,240	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	The book is called Boomtown
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:27,872	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Is one of my favorite things I've read in the past year I think it'll go down in history as one of the great pieces of narrative nonfiction
EDL	00:03:28,640	00:03:30,688	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	So today we're dedicating entire episode
EDL	00:03:30,688	00:03:32,224	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	To my conversation with Sam
EDL	00:03:32,736	00:03:37,344	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	There's so many interesting chapters in antidotes in this book but I wanted to focus primarily
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:38,112	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Aliens
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:40,416	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Scene founding of Oklahoma City
EDL	00:03:40,416	00:03:41,184	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	In the bed
EDL	00:03:41,184	00:03:41,952	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	That's known
EDL	00:03:41,952	00:03:44,256	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	As the land run of 1889
EDL	00:03:44,768	00:03:46,048	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Understand that story
EDL	00:03:46,048	00:03:46,816	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	If you go back to
EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:49,632	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Just a little bit further to earlier in the 1800's
EDL	00:03:49,632	00:03:51,680	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	When Oklahoma wasn't even a state yet
EDL	00:03:52,192	00:03:53,472	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Is a place known
EDL	00:03:53,472	00:03:54,496	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	As Indian Territory
EDL	00:03:55,008	00:03:59,104	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	The US government was kind of using it as the spot on the Great Plains
EDL	00:03:59,616	00:04:00,384	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Medical
EDL	00:04:00,384	00:04:01,152	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Force
EDL	00:04:01,152	00:04:02,688	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Indigenous peoples into
EDL	00:04:03,200	00:04:04,224	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	To make room for
EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:07,552	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	American settlers as they took over the country so
EDL	00:04:08,064	00:04:12,672	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Got dozens of tribes that were forced into their all the Trails of Tears lead to Oklahoma
EDL	00:04:13,696	00:04:15,232	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	So that's what it was in the 1800's
EDL	00:04:15,744	00:04:17,536	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Then during the Civil War
EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:21,375	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Couple of tribes in Indian Territory made alliances with the South
EDL	00:04:21,375	00:04:22,143	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Rather than the North
EDL	00:04:22,655	00:04:24,703	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	And as punishment after the war
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:27,007	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	The federal government strip them of their land
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:30,335	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	This left an enormous patch of unoccupied space
EDL	00:04:30,847	00:04:32,639	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Right in the middle of the territory
EDL	00:04:32,639	00:04:34,431	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Roughly half the size of Connecticut
EDL	00:04:34,943	00:04:37,247	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	It's a fairly big space
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:38,783	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:04:38,783	00:04:45,183	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Suddenly just had nobody in it and everybody referred to this patch of Indian Territory
EDL	00:04:45,183	00:04:51,583	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Has the unassigned lands in 18 60s and 70s white settlers from the surrounding areas like Kansas
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:57,471	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Texas started making illegal raids into the unassigned lands
EDL	00:04:57,471	00:04:59,263	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	The leader of this group
EDL	00:04:59,263	00:05:00,799	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Known as the Boomers
EDL	00:05:00,799	00:05:04,895	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Was a guy named David Payne
EDL	00:05:05,407	00:05:07,967	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Apparently it's incredibly charismatic
EDL	00:05:09,247	00:05:12,575	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	I mean the pictures of him he's quite striking Yeezys
EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:14,623	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Really intense eyes in this kind of
EDL	00:05:14,623	00:05:16,671	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Beautiful hair he looks like he could be
EDL	00:05:21,279	00:05:24,351	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	So you ride around Kansas
EDL	00:05:24,351	00:05:26,911	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	And get up on a wagon and
EDL	00:05:26,911	00:05:31,007	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Shout out these speeches to the struggling Farmers about how
EDL	00:05:31,007	00:05:32,799	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	There was this patch of America that
EDL	00:05:32,799	00:05:38,175	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Belongs to the American people that the government wouldn't let him have it and he managed to convince
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:44,063	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Many many many people to buy into his vision of Oklahoma's is kind of sacred Holy Land
EDL	00:05:44,575	00:05:46,879	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	For white settlers in the middle of Indian Territory
EDL	00:05:47,647	00:05:49,183	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	And this is the beginning of
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:51,487	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	The scheme that was the land run which
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:57,631	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	You talk about is being the craziest way that a city could possibly have been born so can you describe
EDL	00:05:57,631	00:05:59,167	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	What are the ground rules
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:02,495	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Of the land run and then how did it start Oklahoma City
EDL	00:06:03,775	00:06:06,335	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Yasso modern historians looking back
EDL	00:06:06,335	00:06:10,175	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Basically all agree that this was the worst way you could ever start a city
EDL	00:06:10,687	00:06:14,783	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Even within those confines it went very poorly
EDL	00:06:16,063	00:06:19,135	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	So there really were not
EDL	00:06:19,903	00:06:23,487	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Many rules I mean so the government finally says yes all right
EDL	00:06:23,487	00:06:25,023	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	You can have the unassigned lands
EDL	00:06:25,023	00:06:26,559	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Anybody who wants a piece of it

EDL	00:06:29,375	00:06:33,471	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	At the border the unassigned lands this is a 300 mile long
EDL	00:06:33,471	00:06:34,239	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Circumference
EDL	00:06:34,751	00:06:37,567	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	In most places it's not marked
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:39,359	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Where does Marcus like a
EDL	00:06:39,359	00:06:41,407	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	A stack of rocks or creek or something
EDL	00:06:42,687	00:06:44,735	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	So come line up around this border

EDL	00:06:49,599	00:06:50,623	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	And at noon
EDL	00:06:50,623	00:06:51,647	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	We will give a signal
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:54,207	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	And anybody who want some of this land
EDL	00:06:54,207	00:06:55,487	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Can Rush In
EDL	00:06:56,511	00:06:58,559	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Wooden Stakes
EDL	00:06:59,071	00:07:03,423	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Claim some of this territory if you're out in the country you can have a hundred and sixty Acres
EDL	00:07:03,935	00:07:05,471	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	If you're in what's
EDL	00:07:05,983	00:07:08,799	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Designated a town site you can have a smaller
EDL	00:07:08,799	00:07:09,823	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Patch of that town site
EDL	00:07:10,335	00:07:11,615	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	And that's pretty much it
EDL	00:07:11,615	00:07:12,895	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Even the basics of this
EDL	00:07:13,407	00:07:14,175	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Is amazing because
EDL	00:07:14,687	00:07:17,759	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Who decides what Nunez in 1889
EDL	00:07:17,759	00:07:19,039	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	You know I'm saying
EDL	00:07:19,039	00:07:21,855	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Yeah right right there's not like a standardized atomic
EDL	00:07:21,855	00:07:22,623	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Clock somewhere
EDL	00:07:23,391	00:07:27,231	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	I can set off a digital precise signal
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:29,535	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	So people had to kind of figure out for themselves
EDL	00:07:30,047	00:07:30,815	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	What noon was
EDL	00:07:31,583	00:07:36,191	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	And people came from all over the world to set off like a real movement
EDL	00:07:36,191	00:07:36,959	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Around the globe

EDL	00:07:55,135	00:07:59,999	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	For the day itself you had something like a hundred thousand people
EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:01,535	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Show up to line up
EDL	00:08:01,535	00:08:03,071	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	At the border and make a run
EDL	00:08:04,095	00:08:05,887	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	So noon strikes
EDL	00:08:05,887	00:08:09,983	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Maybe at different times for different people on the 300 mile border
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:11,263	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	What what happens next
EDL	00:08:12,543	00:08:13,823	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	So noon strikes
EDL	00:08:14,591	00:08:15,615	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Quote-unquote noon
EDL	00:08:16,127	00:08:18,431	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	In some places there are
EDL	00:08:18,431	00:08:20,991	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Soldiers giving the signal so everyone has to wait
EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:22,527	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Up north the soldiers are
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:27,391	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Have this long rope that they pulled across part of the border that people are held behind
EDL	00:08:27,903	00:08:34,303	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Down south there's a river that people are sitting on their horses like in the middle of the river sort of sinking in quicksand waiting for
EDL	00:08:34,303	00:08:34,815	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	The signal
EDL	00:08:35,327	00:08:36,095	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	And then
EDL	00:08:36,607	00:08:39,167	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	In some cases they fired guns in some cases they blue

EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:55,551	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Your people on racehorses that they just bought like the day before you add people riding broken down mules there were people in fights
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:56,319	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Physical therapy
EDL	00:08:56,319	00:08:56,831	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	But
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:09:01,951	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	And they just burst across the border and start racing in this land is rough it's like

EDL	00:09:17,055	00:09:23,455	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	We know rough Riding High Speed so these vehicles are busting apart and people are flying out of them at rolling across the Prairie
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:24,479	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Getting up and running forward
EDL	00:09:25,247	00:09:30,367	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	It's just wild I mean people shooting guns to speed up their horses and accidentally shooting each other
EDL	00:09:30,879	00:09:32,927	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Horses are dying of exhaustion
EDL	00:09:33,695	00:09:36,255	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	I think it's just about the wildest seeing you can imagine
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:43,679	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	And this is
EDL	00:09:43,679	00:09:44,959	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Complicated even more
EDL	00:09:45,471	00:09:49,311	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	By the people who really cheated who started way before noon
EDL	00:09:49,311	00:09:50,847	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	And they became known
EDL	00:09:50,847	00:09:52,383	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	A progressively at first
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:53,919	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	As the Sooners

EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:03,391	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	A lot

EDL	00:10:17,215	00:10:22,847	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	I know you'll hear that like on ringtones in people's phones and stuff so
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:26,943	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Yeah there is a real through-line in the identity of Oklahoma
EDL	00:10:27,455	00:10:31,295	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	So the Boomers were the ones who agitated for the opening of the unassigned lands
EDL	00:10:31,807	00:10:34,111	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Sooners were people who
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:34,879	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	When
EDL	00:10:34,879	00:10:37,439	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	The date of the land run was finally set
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:38,719	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Managed to
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:39,231	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Cheat
EDL	00:10:40,255	00:10:45,375	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	A lot of them happen to be Boomers as well because the Boomers felt particularly entitled
EDL	00:10:45,375	00:10:46,655	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	To this land
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:48,447	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Because they're the ones who did the work
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:53,567	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	To get the government to allow them in so they kind of resented all these other people who were just showing up the last minute
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:55,615	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	All kinds of ways to
EDL	00:10:55,615	00:10:56,383	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	The cheat I mean there were
EDL	00:10:56,895	00:10:58,431	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	There were stories of like

EDL	00:11:02,015	00:11:06,879	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Just before noon so that you could just touch down on his favorite spot when the bugle was blown
EDL	00:11:07,391	00:11:10,975	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	I mean there were many many many camps of people who were hiding out in this kind of
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:12,511	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Goalies in
EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:13,791	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	And along creeks
EDL	00:11:14,559	00:11:15,583	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	He's kind of sooner
EDL	00:11:16,351	00:11:17,119	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Champs
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:21,727	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	But the federal troops would come through and disperse in the weeks leading up to the land run in and they reassemble
EDL	00:11:23,519	00:11:27,871	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	William couch who had taken over the Boomer movement

EDL	00:11:35,039	00:11:40,415	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Actually went in many times is incredible picture of him and one of his associates standing
EDL	00:11:40,415	00:11:42,719	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	In what is now downtown Oklahoma City
EDL	00:11:42,719	00:11:46,303	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	I was just then this absolute empty scrubby grass
EDL	00:11:46,303	00:11:47,071	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Prairie
EDL	00:11:47,071	00:11:48,351	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	A month before the land run
EDL	00:11:48,863	00:11:51,167	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Mapping out how they wanted the city to look
EDL	00:11:53,471	00:11:54,239	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	And so
EDL	00:11:54,751	00:11:56,287	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	When the signal is given
EDL	00:11:56,799	00:11:58,847	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Theoretically should have taken people
EDL	00:11:58,847	00:12:03,199	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Maybe an hour plus to get there because it was 15 miles from the closest border
EDL	00:12:03,711	00:12:06,271	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	And yet the moment the bugle blue
EDL	00:12:06,271	00:12:09,343	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	You had people including William couches cronies
EDL	00:12:09,343	00:12:11,903	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Leaping out of the bushes jumping out of train cars
EDL	00:12:12,671	00:12:13,695	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Falling out of trees
EDL	00:12:14,207	00:12:19,071	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	This mythological origin story where people just suddenly appear out of the landscape
EDL	00:12:19,071	00:12:25,215	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	And the soldiers don't know what to do cuz there's so many of them in there just planting tents all over in hammering stakes and William couch and his crew
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:31,871	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Have a whole team of surveyors who have all their equipment their chains and poles and everything in there laying outside
EDL	00:12:33,151	00:12:35,455	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	As they have mapped it in the months
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:36,479	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Proceeding the land run
EDL	00:12:38,015	00:12:39,039	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Part
EDL	00:12:39,039	00:12:45,439	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	The labor of making Oklahoma into a real place after this was adjudicated all of that cheating
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:46,719	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Who cheated and who didn't
EDL	00:12:46,719	00:12:48,255	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Who deserve to keep their land
EDL	00:12:48,767	00:12:49,279	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	2 didn't
EDL	00:12:50,047	00:12:51,071	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Because they
EDL	00:12:51,583	00:12:55,167	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	They settled the land as settlers not as city builders exact
EDL	00:12:55,679	00:12:56,703	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	But you didn't
EDL	00:12:56,703	00:13:00,031	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Account for the things that make a city function they really just
EDL	00:13:00,031	00:13:02,335	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Flooded out their own land for their own private use
EDL	00:13:02,847	00:13:06,175	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Such a little is such a nice little metaphor in a way for
EDL	00:13:06,943	00:13:09,759	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	I don't know the American experiment the American temperament
EDL	00:13:11,295	00:13:13,087	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Exactly you had
EDL	00:13:13,087	00:13:15,391	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Huge wave of people rushing in
EDL	00:13:15,391	00:13:17,183	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	I mean waves from all sides
EDL	00:13:18,207	00:13:20,255	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	And what everyone was thinking about was
EDL	00:13:21,023	00:13:22,303	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	I need to get mine
EDL	00:13:22,815	00:13:23,583	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Got a
EDL	00:13:23,583	00:13:27,935	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Anchor down in this place so that whatever comes of it I'll have my peace
EDL	00:13:28,703	00:13:32,799	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	So there was no Central planning there was no foresight whatsoever
EDL	00:13:32,799	00:13:33,567	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	And so
EDL	00:13:34,079	00:13:37,919	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	By the end of the day on the site that would become Oklahoma City
EDL	00:13:38,687	00:13:39,199	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	You had
EDL	00:13:39,967	00:13:42,015	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Something like ten thousand settlers
EDL	00:13:43,039	00:13:44,575	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	And they had claimed
EDL	00:13:45,343	00:13:47,647	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Pretty much every single patch
EDL	00:13:47,647	00:13:48,415	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Of land
EDL	00:13:48,415	00:13:50,207	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	I mean they were like it was just like
EDL	00:13:50,207	00:13:50,975	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Tent flaps
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:51,999	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Tent flap almost
EDL	00:13:52,511	00:13:53,791	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	You didn't have
EDL	00:13:54,303	00:13:56,095	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Any of the negative space
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:13:58,655	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	But you really need for a city to work he didn't have
EDL	00:13:58,655	00:13:59,679	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Streets you didn't have a lease
EDL	00:14:00,191	00:14:06,591	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Other than the part of the city that had been mapped out by these cheaters and they managed to sell certificates to own
EDL	00:14:06,591	00:14:07,359	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Phone Lots
EDL	00:14:07,359	00:14:09,151	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	On the land they had plot it out
EDL	00:14:09,151	00:14:11,711	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	But otherwise it was just a giant
EDL	00:14:11,711	00:14:14,015	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Absolute mess they could never
EDL	00:14:14,015	00:14:15,807	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Going forward function as
EDL	00:14:16,319	00:14:17,599	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	A place where humans live
EDL	00:14:18,111	00:14:19,903	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Huge influx of people
EDL	00:14:21,183	00:14:26,559	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Clean different parts of the land and this is done day one of the founding of Oklahoma City
EDL	00:14:26,559	00:14:27,583	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	What happens
EDL	00:14:27,583	00:14:28,351	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	That first night
EDL	00:14:29,119	00:14:31,423	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	See you this incredible chaotic recipe
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:33,983	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	They all managed to
EDL	00:14:34,495	00:14:35,263	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Claim a spot
EDL	00:14:35,775	00:14:37,311	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Found some spots you know there's
EDL	00:14:37,311	00:14:39,103	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	There's five separate settlers
EDL	00:14:39,103	00:14:42,175	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Claiming that they were there first so you have all these disputes
EDL	00:14:42,175	00:14:43,199	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	All kinds of activity
EDL	00:14:43,967	00:14:45,503	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	When the sun sets at night
EDL	00:14:46,015	00:14:49,855	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	You get this kind of General relaxation everybody stops
EDL	00:14:49,855	00:14:50,623	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Jogging
EDL	00:14:50,623	00:14:51,391	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	4 plots
EDL	00:14:51,391	00:14:52,415	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Everyone stops their work
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:54,207	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	People kind of relax
EDL	00:14:54,207	00:14:54,975	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	And look around
EDL	00:14:55,743	00:14:56,255	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Andres
EDL	00:14:57,535	00:14:58,303	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:14:58,303	00:15:03,935	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Again because this was so recent we have all these eyewitness accounts we have news accounts that were reporters on the ground
EDL	00:15:05,983	00:15:07,263	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	So we know things like
EDL	00:15:07,263	00:15:13,151	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Centipede crawling around everywhere because of course the whole ecosystem has just been shocked
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:16,991	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Intuit agitation by this injection of humans into it for no reason
EDL	00:15:17,759	00:15:18,271	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:15:19,551	00:15:23,391	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	So you have this incredible scene of just tents as far as you can see
EDL	00:15:23,391	00:15:24,671	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Masses of
EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:27,487	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Brand new people have never been to this place before most of them
EDL	00:15:27,999	00:15:30,559	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Most of whom have no connection to one another at all
EDL	00:15:31,583	00:15:32,351	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:15:32,351	00:15:35,679	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	The one story that really stand out from that first night
EDL	00:15:36,191	00:15:39,263	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Sometime around 10 p.m. or midnight
EDL	00:15:39,263	00:15:40,799	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Accounts vary a little bit
EDL	00:15:41,311	00:15:42,591	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	It's quiet it down
EDL	00:15:44,127	00:15:45,919	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	And then a voice suddenly calls out
EDL	00:15:45,919	00:15:46,687	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Silence
EDL	00:15:46,687	00:15:47,967	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	It's a man's voice
EDL	00:15:48,479	00:15:49,503	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Is a realist
EDL	00:15:49,503	00:15:51,039	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Really strong loud
EDL	00:15:51,039	00:15:52,063	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Low voice
EDL	00:15:53,087	00:15:54,367	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	And what he calls out
EDL	00:15:55,903	00:15:59,231	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Very clear in the night air but also totally inscrutable
EDL	00:16:01,023	00:16:02,047	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Ojo
EDL	00:16:02,559	00:16:03,583	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Here's your mule
EDL	00:16:05,375	00:16:06,911	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Everybody kind of looks around
EDL	00:16:07,423	00:16:09,215	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Every story about what that means
EDL	00:16:09,727	00:16:14,079	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	It might have been a reference to an old Confederate song or maybe the people in the camper
EDL	00:16:14,079	00:16:16,383	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Talking about thing that actually happened that night
EDL	00:16:16,383	00:16:18,943	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	There was a guy named Joe with a neighboring lot
EDL	00:16:18,943	00:16:20,223	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Smule had wandered off
EDL	00:16:20,223	00:16:20,991	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	This guy found it
EDL	00:16:22,271	00:16:25,599	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	But what happens is more interesting than whatever started because
EDL	00:16:26,111	00:16:28,927	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Within a few seconds another voice Echoes that one
EDL	00:16:30,207	00:16:31,999	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	The dojo here's your mule
EDL	00:16:32,767	00:16:34,303	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	And then somebody else that goes it
EDL	00:16:34,303	00:16:35,839	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Somebody else
EDL	00:16:37,119	00:16:39,167	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	And soon it turns into this life
EDL	00:16:39,167	00:16:40,191	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Absolute
EDL	00:16:40,703	00:16:42,751	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Bizarre party
EDL	00:16:43,775	00:16:46,335	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Of everybody in Oklahoma City
EDL	00:16:46,335	00:16:51,199	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Shouting so here's your mule over and over and over again
EDL	00:16:52,479	00:16:55,295	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	It's just resonating over the whole town site
EDL	00:16:55,807	00:16:58,879	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	And they say actually it was so loud that the federal troops
EDL	00:16:59,647	00:17:02,207	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Who were stationed about a mile away for the night
EDL	00:17:02,207	00:17:04,255	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Heard it and they started calling it back to
EDL	00:17:04,767	00:17:11,167	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	MN settlers on the outside of town heard in they started calling it out too and so you just have this cacophony of people shouting Ojo

EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:24,991	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Was the first night
EDL	00:17:26,783	00:17:29,087	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	This is kind of the moment that you cite is when
EDL	00:17:29,599	00:17:32,671	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	You that although settlers kind of become a town
EDL	00:17:33,951	00:17:35,487	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	I mean psychologically
EDL	00:17:36,255	00:17:37,791	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	It's hard to put yourself out there but
EDL	00:17:38,815	00:17:40,607	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	It's got to be the craziest day of everyone
EDL	00:17:40,607	00:17:41,119	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Life
EDL	00:17:42,911	00:17:45,215	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	You know they've been through it all kinds of hardship
EDL	00:17:45,215	00:17:46,239	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Hunger and thirst
EDL	00:17:47,263	00:17:49,055	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Everyone is armed
EDL	00:17:49,055	00:17:53,151	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	The teeth and everyone's arguing and you don't know if you're getting a good spot or a bad spot
EDL	00:17:53,663	00:17:58,015	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Your Wagon broke and you almost broke your arm and you know etcetera Etc
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:18:01,599	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	And then suddenly at night you get this bizarre
EDL	00:18:02,111	00:18:03,391	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Sort of communal
EDL	00:18:03,903	00:18:06,463	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	It's almost like a sing-along or something you know
EDL	00:18:07,743	00:18:11,327	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	And yeah so all these people who are completely unrelated to one another
EDL	00:18:13,375	00:18:16,703	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Arrived at this new and strange place in this kind of
EDL	00:18:17,215	00:18:18,239	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Tidal wave
EDL	00:18:19,519	00:18:20,543	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Selfishness
EDL	00:18:20,543	00:18:21,055	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	You know
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:24,895	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Or something participating in this

EDL	00:18:33,599	00:18:34,623	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	That started
EDL	00:18:34,623	00:18:37,439	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	To help this very strange collection of
EDL	00:18:37,439	00:18:38,463	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	People become
EDL	00:18:38,975	00:18:39,487	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	An actual
EDL	00:18:39,999	00:18:40,511	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Collective

EDL	00:18:47,167	00:18:48,959	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	A video Joe incident
EDL	00:18:48,959	00:18:51,519	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	On the second day of Oklahoma City's existence
EDL	00:18:51,519	00:18:53,311	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Two different leaders emerged
EDL	00:18:53,823	00:18:54,847	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	It was William couch

EDL	00:18:58,943	00:19:04,831	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	He had plotted and schemed in order to enrich himself by selling landscape gets in this one part of the city
EDL	00:19:05,599	00:19:07,135	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	And then there was Angelo Scott

EDL	00:19:12,255	00:19:13,279	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Who was this
EDL	00:19:13,279	00:19:18,911	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Very high-minded and decent guy who did not approve of the cheater faction and their lands games
EDL	00:19:19,423	00:19:21,471	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	So he said about trying to create some order
EDL	00:19:21,471	00:19:22,239	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Chaos
EDL	00:19:22,239	00:19:23,263	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Loss of this new city
EDL	00:19:25,055	00:19:28,383	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	After oh Joe here's your mule after the chaos of that first day

EDL	00:19:30,431	00:19:31,711	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Everyone has been able to sleep
EDL	00:19:32,735	00:19:34,271	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	And they look around
EDL	00:19:34,271	00:19:35,295	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	And they realize
EDL	00:19:36,319	00:19:37,599	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Oh my gosh this place
EDL	00:19:37,599	00:19:38,111	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Is a mess
EDL	00:19:40,927	00:19:42,207	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	There's no room
EDL	00:19:42,719	00:19:44,511	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	To fit in an alley between these
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:46,303	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Private properties
EDL	00:19:46,815	00:19:51,167	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Angela Scott is one of the people who steps up and says well
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:52,191	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Let's figure this out
EDL	00:19:52,703	00:19:57,311	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	And he gives actually in the second bells to
EDL	00:19:57,311	00:20:02,943	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Three kids and puts them on little horses and sends them riding all around Oklahoma City ringing their bells and saying
EDL	00:20:03,455	00:20:04,991	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Come to a big town meeting
EDL	00:20:04,991	00:20:05,503	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:20:06,271	00:20:07,551	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Thousands of people come
EDL	00:20:08,319	00:20:11,135	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Angela Scott steps up onto the wooden crate
EDL	00:20:12,415	00:20:14,463	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	He kind of lays it out for everybody says listen
EDL	00:20:15,487	00:20:16,511	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Here's Where We Are
EDL	00:20:17,023	00:20:18,303	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Our town is chaos
EDL	00:20:18,815	00:20:20,863	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	We have one faction of people
EDL	00:20:20,863	00:20:22,143	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	QR
EDL	00:20:22,143	00:20:23,935	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Trying to impose order on it
EDL	00:20:24,447	00:20:25,215	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	By cheating
EDL	00:20:27,519	00:20:30,847	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	He says one of the ironies of the places that they could have had
EDL	00:20:30,847	00:20:32,383	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Absolute peace
EDL	00:20:32,383	00:20:34,175	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	If they had adopted this
EDL	00:20:34,175	00:20:38,783	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	The cheaters plan for the city but it would have been on the basis of absolute fraud
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:39,807	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	How to figure out
EDL	00:20:39,807	00:20:40,831	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Some other way to do it
EDL	00:20:41,343	00:20:45,695	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Lewis God helps organize an election in which a Citizens committee comes together
EDL	00:20:46,207	00:20:48,767	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	The job of that committee is to go around the whole town
EDL	00:20:49,279	00:20:55,167	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Educating every lot figuring out who can stay and who can go and what land needs to be seized and turned the streets
EDL	00:20:55,167	00:20:56,447	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Alleys in public spaces
EDL	00:20:56,959	00:20:58,239	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	It's like this ad hoc
EDL	00:20:58,239	00:21:00,031	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	On-the-fly town planning
EDL	00:21:00,031	00:21:02,335	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	And so they went lot by lot by law
EDL	00:21:02,335	00:21:04,127	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	And work their way their Way North
EDL	00:21:05,151	00:21:07,967	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Until they reached the
EDL	00:21:07,967	00:21:09,759	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Southern edge of the cheaters
EDL	00:21:10,271	00:21:10,783	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Part of town
EDL	00:21:11,807	00:21:14,111	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	And waiting for them there were
EDL	00:21:14,111	00:21:14,879	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Men
EDL	00:21:14,879	00:21:16,416	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Holding Winchester rifles
EDL	00:21:17,184	00:21:17,696	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Who said
EDL	00:21:18,976	00:21:20,256	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	That's fine that you've done that
EDL	00:21:20,256	00:21:21,280	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Down there
EDL	00:21:21,280	00:21:23,072	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	But I think you better leave this part of town alone
EDL	00:21:24,096	00:21:27,680	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	This could have been the moment but the city teetered into Civil War
EDL	00:21:27,680	00:21:28,704	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Instead
EDL	00:21:28,704	00:21:31,520	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Angela Scott organized another Mass meeting
EDL	00:21:31,520	00:21:32,544	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	And it came up
EDL	00:21:32,544	00:21:33,568	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	The compromise plan
EDL	00:21:34,080	00:21:37,408	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	So in the end they had to do something that was really abhorrent
EDL	00:21:37,408	00:21:40,224	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	To someone like Angelo Scott into a lot of people
EDL	00:21:40,992	00:21:42,784	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	But it was the only way
EDL	00:21:42,784	00:21:45,344	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Two kind of Stitch the city together without
EDL	00:21:45,856	00:21:47,648	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Actually breaking into violence
EDL	00:21:47,648	00:21:48,928	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	So what they did was
EDL	00:21:49,696	00:21:54,048	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	These two different plans the the citizens committee plan down south
EDL	00:21:54,048	00:21:56,352	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	And the Boomers plan of North
EDL	00:21:56,864	00:22:00,960	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Part of the problem reconciling them was that they been laid out at slightly different angle
EDL	00:22:01,728	00:22:04,800	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	This meant that even if they try to stitch these two parts
EDL	00:22:04,800	00:22:05,312	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	So tell him together
EDL	00:22:05,824	00:22:08,384	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	It would be very difficult because the streets
EDL	00:22:08,384	00:22:09,408	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Wouldn't match up
EDL	00:22:09,920	00:22:10,944	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	And so
EDL	00:22:10,944	00:22:13,504	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	The compromise they settled on was to build
EDL	00:22:13,504	00:22:14,528	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	What they called jog
EDL	00:22:15,040	00:22:17,088	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Which are these kind of diagonal Street
EDL	00:22:17,600	00:22:18,112	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	The connect
EDL	00:22:18,624	00:22:19,648	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	The two different
EDL	00:22:20,160	00:22:20,672	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Secrets
EDL	00:22:21,440	00:22:23,488	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	And Angela Scott called them

EDL	00:25:37,792	00:25:38,560	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	It was
EDL	00:25:38,560	00:25:39,840	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Nike basketball team
EDL	00:25:39,840	00:25:41,120	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	The Oklahoma City Thunder
EDL	00:25:41,632	00:25:42,400	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	For many decades
EDL	00:25:42,912	00:25:43,936	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Oklahoma City
EDL	00:25:43,936	00:25:47,264	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Had not been considered the kind of city that could support
EDL	00:25:47,264	00:25:49,312	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	A major pro sports team
EDL	00:25:49,312	00:25:50,336	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	And yet suddenly
EDL	00:25:51,104	00:25:52,384	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	In 2008
EDL	00:25:52,896	00:25:53,920	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	It had this
EDL	00:25:53,920	00:25:57,248	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	NBA basketball team and got it was
EDL	00:25:57,248	00:25:58,272	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	By taking it
EDL	00:25:58,272	00:25:58,784	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	From Seattle
EDL	00:25:59,552	00:26:01,600	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Oklahoma City Thunder used to be
EDL	00:26:02,112	00:26:05,952	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	This great classic NBA franchise called the Seattle SuperSonics
EDL	00:26:06,720	00:26:12,352	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	These lovely green and yellow uniforms and some great Superstar players over the years
EDL	00:26:13,120	00:26:18,752	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	And so I had to write this history of the taking of a professional team from one city to another
EDL	00:26:19,264	00:26:20,800	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	And in the course of writing that
EDL	00:26:20,800	00:26:23,872	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	The question occurred to me why are the Seattle SuperSonics
EDL	00:26:24,384	00:26:25,152	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Call Dad
EDL	00:26:25,152	00:26:27,712	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	I grew up at this time but I never thought to
EDL	00:26:27,712	00:26:28,736	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	To question the name
EDL	00:26:29,760	00:26:32,320	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	So I started researching well where did this name come from
EDL	00:26:33,856	00:26:36,160	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	This let me down the rabbit hole
EDL	00:26:37,184	00:26:40,768	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	It turned out that Seattle have gotten its basketball team back in the 1960
EDL	00:26:40,768	00:26:46,912	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Exactly the same moment when the United States was trying to launch its new futuristic world-changing program
EDL	00:26:46,912	00:26:48,960	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Commercial supersonic flight
EDL	00:26:49,728	00:26:51,264	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	This is the idea that airplanes wood
EDL	00:26:51,264	00:26:54,080	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Zoom around the world traveling faster than the speed of sound
EDL	00:26:54,592	00:26:56,640	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Boeing which is based in Seattle
EDL	00:26:56,640	00:26:58,688	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	What's at the center of a lot of that development
EDL	00:26:59,200	00:27:00,736	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	So you got this program
EDL	00:27:01,248	00:27:04,832	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	SuperSonics program and you got this brand new basketball team
EDL	00:27:04,832	00:27:06,368	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	And in this great moment of
EDL	00:27:06,880	00:27:07,648	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Civic
EDL	00:27:07,648	00:27:08,416	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Sports
EDL	00:27:08,416	00:27:09,184	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Synergy
EDL	00:27:09,952	00:27:12,512	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	They name the basketball team the Seattle SuperSonics
EDL	00:27:13,536	00:27:15,328	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	So that was a nice story and I thought cool
EDL	00:27:18,144	00:27:20,192	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	What happened to the American Supersonics
EDL	00:27:20,192	00:27:21,472	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Program like I never

EDL	00:27:25,056	00:27:27,360	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Dummy anyone I know has either so
EDL	00:27:28,128	00:27:29,408	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Why did this not happen
EDL	00:27:30,432	00:27:32,224	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	Rabbit hole
EDL	00:27:33,504	00:27:36,064	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	And this is what led me to operation Bongo
EDL	00:27:38,368	00:27:41,440	| 325_The_Worst_Way_to_Start_a_City_pt_01 |	If you are trying to launch a nationwide program
