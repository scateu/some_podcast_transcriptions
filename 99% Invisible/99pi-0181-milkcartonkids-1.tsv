EDL	00:01:39,328	00:01:41,376	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	We were awakened by the phone ringing
EDL	00:01:41,376	00:01:42,656	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	That's Noreen Gosch
EDL	00:01:42,656	00:01:45,728	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	It was early on a Sunday morning in 1982
EDL	00:01:45,728	00:01:46,496	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	In Des Moines Iowa
EDL	00:01:47,008	00:01:49,824	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Marine son Johnny had left for his regular paper route
EDL	00:01:50,336	00:01:53,152	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	It was a neighbor saying they did not receive their newspapers
EDL	00:01:53,664	00:01:54,944	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	This wasn't like Johnny
EDL	00:01:55,456	00:01:57,248	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Even a paper boy for years
EDL	00:01:57,248	00:01:58,784	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	He never missed a delivery
EDL	00:01:59,296	00:02:03,648	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	His dad got up and said I'll go help him finish the route he's probably just running late
EDL	00:02:04,160	00:02:04,928	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	He went
EDL	00:02:04,928	00:02:08,000	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	The street and that's where he saw Johnny's wagon sitting
EDL	00:02:08,512	00:02:11,072	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Johnny's Red Wagon was sitting at the corner
EDL	00:02:11,072	00:02:14,400	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	It was still full of newspapers he rushed back and told me
EDL	00:02:15,168	00:02:15,936	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Johnny was gone
EDL	00:02:16,448	00:02:16,960	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Call the police
EDL	00:02:18,496	00:02:20,544	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Johnny Gosch was 13 when he disappeared
EDL	00:02:21,056	00:02:23,104	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	He had blue eyes and dirty blonde hair
EDL	00:02:23,616	00:02:25,664	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	The small gap between his front teeth
EDL	00:02:26,176	00:02:31,296	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	And his would be the first face of a missing child ever printed on a milk carton
EDL	00:02:32,576	00:02:35,392	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	It's been 30 years since these milk cartons came and went
EDL	00:02:36,160	00:02:40,256	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	I wasn't alive to see them but I still know about the faces on the milk carton
EDL	00:02:40,256	00:02:41,536	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	That's reporter Annie Brown
EDL	00:02:42,048	00:02:45,632	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	The image of a missing child on a milk carton became iconic
EDL	00:02:46,400	00:02:48,704	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	A kind of cultural shorthand for missing children
EDL	00:02:49,472	00:02:52,800	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	And even though this image has stuck around for three decades
EDL	00:02:52,800	00:02:55,872	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	The actual milk carton campaign only lasted 2 years
EDL	00:02:56,384	00:02:59,712	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	It was largely unsuccessful at locating the kids on the carton
EDL	00:03:01,760	00:03:07,136	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Good morning that Johnny disappeared Doreen said it took 45 minutes for the police to arrive
EDL	00:03:07,136	00:03:10,208	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	So he called around the other boys who deliver papers that morning
EDL	00:03:10,720	00:03:14,816	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	She found five witnesses that saw her son talking to a man in a Blue Van
EDL	00:03:15,584	00:03:17,120	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	She relate this to the police
EDL	00:03:17,120	00:03:19,936	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	The cop looked at me and said will has your son ever run away before
EDL	00:03:20,960	00:03:23,776	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	And I said well now he's never run away ever
EDL	00:03:23,776	00:03:25,312	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Nor did he run away today
EDL	00:03:26,080	00:03:27,616	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	But the police were skeptical
EDL	00:03:28,128	00:03:28,896	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	This was Iowa
EDL	00:03:29,664	00:03:32,736	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	This kind of thing wasn't supposed to happen to kids like Johnny
EDL	00:03:32,736	00:03:34,272	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	In places like Iowa
EDL	00:03:34,272	00:03:35,808	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Would never had a crime like this
EDL	00:03:37,088	00:03:39,136	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	This was before Amber Alert
EDL	00:03:39,136	00:03:41,952	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Before those text messages that you get when a kid goes missing
EDL	00:03:41,952	00:03:44,768	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	It wasn't even a category for missing children
EDL	00:03:44,768	00:03:48,096	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Kids were put in the same group as missing adults
EDL	00:03:48,096	00:03:51,936	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	In an adult have to be gone for three days before they were considered missing
EDL	00:03:52,448	00:03:56,544	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Without the police's help Johnny's parents tried everything they could on their own
EDL	00:03:57,056	00:04:00,640	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	They hired private investigators in coordinated search parties
EDL	00:04:00,640	00:04:02,432	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Meanwhile as a search
EDL	00:04:02,432	00:04:07,552	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	They also wrote Iowa State legislation that would differentiate missing children from missing adult
EDL	00:04:08,064	00:04:09,856	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	I wrote the Johnny Gosch law
EDL	00:04:09,856	00:04:11,392	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Camping kitchen table
EDL	00:04:11,392	00:04:12,928	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	But after all of this
EDL	00:04:12,928	00:04:15,232	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Noreen Gosch is sun was still gone
EDL	00:04:16,000	00:04:21,375	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	And then two years later in 1984 another little boy disappeared while delivering newspapers
EDL	00:04:21,887	00:04:24,191	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	He lived in a neighborhood not far from Johnny's
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:30,079	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Morning
EDL	00:04:38,015	00:04:42,879	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	The second Paperboy had a relative who works at a local Dairy the Anderson and Erickson Dairy
EDL	00:04:43,391	00:04:47,487	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	The relative in the dairies owner has an idea to help by Newsboys
EDL	00:04:47,999	00:04:51,071	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Anderson Erickson Dairy contacted each family
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:53,375	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	And they wanted to do something
EDL	00:04:53,375	00:04:55,167	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Helpful in the investigation
EDL	00:04:55,679	00:04:57,983	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	The families of the missing boy the greed
EDL	00:04:57,983	00:05:02,335	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	And within a few short weeks thousands of milk cartons were rolls out of truck
EDL	00:05:02,335	00:05:03,871	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	An inter grocery stores
EDL	00:05:05,407	00:05:07,199	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	As clerk stock their shelves
EDL	00:05:07,199	00:05:10,783	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	The faces of Johnny Gosch and Eugene Martin smiled back
EDL	00:05:11,551	00:05:14,367	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	The campaign started out at 1 local Dairy
EDL	00:05:14,367	00:05:17,439	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	But over the next few weeks it spread to other Midwestern towns
EDL	00:05:17,951	00:05:20,255	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	In Illinois there I saw it and said hey
EDL	00:05:20,255	00:05:21,279	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Why don't we try that
EDL	00:05:21,279	00:05:22,303	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	And from there
EDL	00:05:22,303	00:05:23,071	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	It went National
EDL	00:05:23,839	00:05:30,239	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Nearly everybody drinks milk Mill turns over quickly so we could put a lot of different kids photos on
EDL	00:05:30,239	00:05:34,591	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Run and pull children's off that needed to come off at a moment's notice
EDL	00:05:34,591	00:05:35,615	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	That's Barbara huggett
EDL	00:05:36,127	00:05:37,407	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	She was working as an artist
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:40,223	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	At the national Child Safety Council in Michigan
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:42,527	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	When the national milk carton campaign took off
EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:45,087	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Our founder apparently he'd seen
EDL	00:05:45,087	00:05:49,439	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Johnny Gosch and Eugene Martin on the Anderson Erickson dairy milk cartons
EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:52,511	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	But he felt that the program should be Nationwide
EDL	00:05:53,023	00:05:58,911	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	A nationwide milk carton campaign Willard families in California to look for a child who went missing in Iowa
EDL	00:05:59,423	00:06:05,823	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	The national campaign brought together local groups looking for missing children and together they came up with a list of
EDL	00:06:05,823	00:06:07,103	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	77kids
EDL	00:06:07,103	00:06:07,871	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	From all over the country
EDL	00:06:08,895	00:06:12,479	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	We used cases that were believed to be
EDL	00:06:12,479	00:06:15,807	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	What they termed in those days dangerous stranger abductions
EDL	00:06:16,319	00:06:19,391	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	In other words kids that weren't taken by someone they knew
EDL	00:06:20,415	00:06:22,463	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Farbstein didn't have computers
EDL	00:06:22,463	00:06:25,535	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	So they cut and arranged all 77 layout
EDL	00:06:25,535	00:06:31,935	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	By hand design to lay out there was just doing a rather simple
EDL	00:06:31,935	00:06:34,239	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Did across the top of each waxy paper panel
EDL	00:06:35,007	00:06:40,895	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Photos of two children were laid side-by-side in black and white
EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:41,919	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Height weight
EDL	00:06:43,455	00:06:47,807	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	They also printed the pictures on school milk cartons but only one child could fit on those
EDL	00:06:48,319	00:06:53,183	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Barbri started Ares all over the country asking if they'd be a part of the campaign
EDL	00:06:53,183	00:06:59,583	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Within months 700 independent dairies had signed on boys I wish I knew how many cartons
EDL	00:06:59,583	00:07:00,863	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Had circulated
EDL	00:07:01,375	00:07:07,519	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Imagine its way into the billions 700-750 Dairies
EDL	00:07:07,519	00:07:13,919	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Printing in and day out for years some sources of estimated that as many as five

EDL	00:07:32,863	00:07:34,655	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	After we gotten the word

EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:08,703	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	And when the police came looking for the owner of the car

EDL	00:08:35,071	00:08:36,863	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	The campaign had a positive impact
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:40,191	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	What it did was promote more awareness
EDL	00:08:41,215	00:08:42,239	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	So the people were looking
EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:45,055	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	They saw a child that look like they were into
EDL	00:08:45,055	00:08:45,567	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Stress
EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:47,103	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Maybe you could
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:48,383	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Whether or not
EDL	00:08:48,895	00:08:49,663	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Those were the parents
EDL	00:08:50,431	00:08:51,967	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	During the milk carton campaign
EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:54,271	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	The missing children assistance Act was passed
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:57,343	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	It established a Federal program to find missing kids
EDL	00:08:57,855	00:08:59,903	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Changing the rules for
EDL	00:08:59,903	00:09:02,975	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Children when they're missing not having to wait
EDL	00:09:02,975	00:09:05,023	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	The hours and in days
EDL	00:09:05,535	00:09:09,887	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	And mostly the milk cartons just got people thinking about kidnapping
EDL	00:09:10,655	00:09:12,703	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	That this could happen to your kid
EDL	00:09:13,215	00:09:13,983	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	I have talked
EDL	00:09:13,983	00:09:16,031	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	To quite a number of adult
EDL	00:09:16,031	00:09:18,591	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	And they could remember their mom putting the milk

EDL	00:09:19,615	00:09:20,383	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Table
EDL	00:09:20,383	00:09:21,151	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	I'm saying
EDL	00:09:21,151	00:09:21,919	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Now
EDL	00:09:21,919	00:09:22,943	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	We're going to go over the rules in
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:26,015	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	And they would use the example of the boys on the milk
EDL	00:09:26,527	00:09:31,647	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	And make the correlation between that child and their child's life
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:37,023	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	In other words the faces on the milk cartons scared the hell out of everyone
EDL	00:09:38,047	00:09:41,375	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Which ultimately led to the campaign's downfall
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:47,519	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Almost as quickly as it began the milk carton campaign started by the national Child Safety Council ended
EDL	00:09:47,519	00:09:49,823	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Just two years after the first milk cartons were printed
EDL	00:09:50,335	00:09:53,663	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Dairies began to pull the missing kids pictures from their side panels
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:09:59,807	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	One reason of course with the carton says that the industry shifted to plastic
EDL	00:09:59,807	00:10:03,647	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	But there is also started to get tired of the depressing message
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:06,463	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Took it away because there were people that were
EDL	00:10:06,463	00:10:09,279	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Complaining that they thought it might scare children at the breakfast

EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:25,151	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	They see these missing kids kind of staring at them
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:27,967	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	That milk carton almost demands them
EDL	00:10:28,479	00:10:29,503	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	To have that conversation
EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:31,807	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	What to do if you see a stranger

EDL	00:10:43,327	00:10:48,959	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	He believes the milk carton campaign reflected a larger fear that was gripping Society at the time
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:50,751	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Stranger danger

EDL	00:10:57,919	00:11:00,223	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	He says that the sphere
EDL	00:11:00,223	00:11:02,783	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Stranger danger was exploding
EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:06,111	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Folks are taking around these numbers that are just astronomical
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:10,207	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Picture saying there 1.8 million missing children in the United States
EDL	00:11:10,975	00:11:15,839	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Missing becomes very closely attached to abducted by strangers
EDL	00:11:16,351	00:11:17,887	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	But that just wasn't true
EDL	00:11:17,887	00:11:18,655	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Every year
EDL	00:11:19,167	00:11:23,519	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	800000 kids are reported missing to the authorities
EDL	00:11:24,287	00:11:26,591	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	That's around 2000 every day
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:29,919	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	But a report from the Department of Justice

EDL	00:11:33,759	00:11:36,063	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Is only about a hundred and fifteen
EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:42,975	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	The milk carton campaign led by the national Child Safety Council focused on kids who were kidnapped by
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:43,743	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Strangers
EDL	00:11:43,743	00:11:45,279	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	And they were criticized for this
EDL	00:11:46,047	00:11:51,167	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	But they were also smaller more localized campaigns going on that were Bound by this rule
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:58,079	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	It was one of these smaller campaigns that ended up featuring the face of a missing girl named Bonnie Lohman

EDL	00:12:05,503	00:12:07,039	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	After her parents got divorced
EDL	00:12:07,039	00:12:12,159	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Even though she wasn't kidnapped by a stranger Bonnie that had managed to get her on a milk carton
EDL	00:12:12,927	00:12:15,487	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Funny had no idea that she had been kidnapped
EDL	00:12:15,999	00:12:17,791	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	But her childhood was pretty strange
EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:19,839	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	After taking Bonnie
EDL	00:12:19,839	00:12:22,143	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Her mom and stepdad went to Saipan
EDL	00:12:22,143	00:12:27,519	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	A tiny Island near Guam

EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:32,383	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	But they were still lying very well
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:33,663	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	We stayed inside all the time and
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:35,711	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	I recall Maybe
EDL	00:12:35,711	00:12:39,039	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	One or two times being outside
EDL	00:12:39,039	00:12:40,831	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Finally they ended up in Colorado
EDL	00:12:41,343	00:12:44,159	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Her mom and stepdad started to relax a bit
EDL	00:12:44,671	00:12:46,719	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	The next-door neighbors had a bunch of kids and
EDL	00:12:46,719	00:12:49,279	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Bonnie played at their house all the time
EDL	00:12:49,279	00:12:51,583	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Will you play Barbies and I had my little

EDL	00:12:54,399	00:12:59,263	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Aside from going to her neighbors Bonnie was hardly ever allowed to leave the house
EDL	00:12:59,263	00:13:03,103	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	But on an unusual occasion her stepdad took her to the supermarket
EDL	00:13:03,615	00:13:04,383	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	They needed milk
EDL	00:13:05,407	00:13:06,943	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Just remember like looking and
EDL	00:13:06,943	00:13:07,967	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Seeing how many

EDL	00:13:15,135	00:13:15,647	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Pictures were
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:18,207	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	He grabbed the milk
EDL	00:13:18,207	00:13:19,743	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Irritating after that is
EDL	00:13:20,255	00:13:21,791	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Hey arthena
EDL	00:13:21,791	00:13:23,071	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	And I saw myself and I was like

EDL	00:13:31,263	00:13:33,567	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Though she had no idea what it meant at the time
EDL	00:13:33,567	00:13:35,615	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	Funny step dad bought the milk carton
EDL	00:13:35,615	00:13:37,151	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	And when they finished it
EDL	00:13:37,151	00:13:39,199	| 99pi-0181-milkcartonkids-1 |	He asked her do you want it
