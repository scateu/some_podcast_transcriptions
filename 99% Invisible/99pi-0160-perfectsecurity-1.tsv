EDL	00:02:47,168	00:02:48,448	| 99pi-0160-perfectsecurity-1 |	I met Lee at her office in Sanford
EDL	00:02:49,472	00:02:53,312	| 99pi-0160-perfectsecurity-1 |	We sat in the conference room among piles of tension wrenches and lock pick

EDL	00:02:55,104	00:02:56,128	| 99pi-0160-perfectsecurity-1 |	Built for the picking
EDL	00:02:56,128	00:02:58,176	| 99pi-0160-perfectsecurity-1 |	You have to push each pin up far enough
EDL	00:02:58,944	00:02:59,456	| 99pi-0160-perfectsecurity-1 |	That
EDL	00:02:59,968	00:03:01,504	| 99pi-0160-perfectsecurity-1 |	You can't see that bottom part 2
EDL	00:03:03,040	00:03:03,552	| 99pi-0160-perfectsecurity-1 |	There's two piece
EDL	00:03:04,832	00:03:08,672	| 99pi-0160-perfectsecurity-1 |	So when you pick a lock you're using the pick and tension wrench
EDL	00:03:08,672	00:03:10,720	| 99pi-0160-perfectsecurity-1 |	To do the work of the key you need them both

EDL	00:03:14,048	00:03:14,560	| 99pi-0160-perfectsecurity-1 |	The keyhole
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:21,984	| 99pi-0160-perfectsecurity-1 |	The pursuit of lockpicking is as old as the law
EDL	00:03:22,496	00:03:24,544	| 99pi-0160-perfectsecurity-1 |	Which is itself as old as civilization
EDL	00:03:25,824	00:03:28,896	| 99pi-0160-perfectsecurity-1 |	Fire history of the world there was only one brief moments

EDL	00:04:01,920	00:04:03,968	| 99pi-0160-perfectsecurity-1 |	But in March I'm dropping a big paper

EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:27,775	| 99pi-0160-perfectsecurity-1 |	For the Middle Ages on for hundreds of years
EDL	00:04:27,775	00:04:29,567	| 99pi-0160-perfectsecurity-1 |	Locks were not very good
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:31,871	| 99pi-0160-perfectsecurity-1 |	If you were poor you can have a terrible lock
EDL	00:04:32,383	00:04:37,503	| 99pi-0160-perfectsecurity-1 |	And if you had some money you could have a terrible lock with some added features that night at best
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:39,039	| 99pi-0160-perfectsecurity-1 |	Confuse a trespasser
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:42,879	| 99pi-0160-perfectsecurity-1 |	They're just one false keyholes there padlocks even with false keyholes
EDL	00:04:42,879	00:04:46,719	| 99pi-0160-perfectsecurity-1 |	False keyholes which they hoped would draw the FIFA way from the true Keyhole
EDL	00:04:47,487	00:04:51,839	| 99pi-0160-perfectsecurity-1 |	Some locks had Falls Keyhole that even had a lock like components of fix to them
EDL	00:04:51,839	00:04:54,399	| 99pi-0160-perfectsecurity-1 |	So it felt like they were attached to the latch mechanism
EDL	00:04:54,911	00:04:56,191	| 99pi-0160-perfectsecurity-1 |	But actually weren't
EDL	00:04:56,191	00:05:02,591	| 99pi-0160-perfectsecurity-1 |	Seriously the best you could do is try to confuse an intruder into picking a fake lock but as soon as the wheel key hole
EDL	00:05:02,591	00:05:03,359	| 99pi-0160-perfectsecurity-1 |	Was known
EDL	00:05:03,359	00:05:06,431	| 99pi-0160-perfectsecurity-1 |	The security was pretty much nil
EDL	00:05:06,431	00:05:09,503	| 99pi-0160-perfectsecurity-1 |	There was no law that could keep
EDL	00:05:09,503	00:05:10,527	| 99pi-0160-perfectsecurity-1 |	Everyone out
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:12,319	| 99pi-0160-perfectsecurity-1 |	And then in the 1770s
EDL	00:05:12,319	00:05:15,135	| 99pi-0160-perfectsecurity-1 |	An English guy named Joseph bramah entered the locks
EDL	00:05:18,463	00:05:23,583	| 99pi-0160-perfectsecurity-1 |	Like a wizard from the future I had to come back in time and invented the most amazing lock in the world
EDL	00:05:23,583	00:05:27,935	| 99pi-0160-perfectsecurity-1 |	If the name Joseph sounds familiar to you Bello engineering history
EDL	00:05:28,447	00:05:34,591	| 99pi-0160-perfectsecurity-1 |	Is the same Joseph bramah who invented the flush toilet and the first water pumping fire engine and pneumatic

EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:41,503	| 99pi-0160-perfectsecurity-1 |	That one wasn't as popular but
EDL	00:05:42,015	00:05:42,527	| 99pi-0160-perfectsecurity-1 |	Pretty cool
EDL	00:05:43,295	00:05:45,599	| 99pi-0160-perfectsecurity-1 |	And so Joseph bramah inventor
EDL	00:05:45,599	00:05:46,367	| 99pi-0160-perfectsecurity-1 |	Time wizard
EDL	00:05:46,367	00:05:47,135	| 99pi-0160-perfectsecurity-1 |	Tree murderer
EDL	00:05:47,647	00:05:49,439	| 99pi-0160-perfectsecurity-1 |	He was really interested in locks
EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:51,231	| 99pi-0160-perfectsecurity-1 |	You need something called

EDL	00:06:00,191	00:06:02,751	| 99pi-0160-perfectsecurity-1 |	An inner chamber of this lock
EDL	00:06:03,519	00:06:04,543	| 99pi-0160-perfectsecurity-1 |	Take my word for it
EDL	00:06:04,543	00:06:06,847	| 99pi-0160-perfectsecurity-1 |	Explaining how this thing works does not make
