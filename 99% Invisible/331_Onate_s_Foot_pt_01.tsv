EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:02,303	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	The inferiority left
EDL	00:08:03,583	00:08:07,935	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And so it was that Conchita was on the cuarto centenario committee

EDL	00:10:56,639	00:10:58,943	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	That we came from the underworld

EDL	00:11:06,623	00:11:09,695	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And when we got to where I, was
EDL	00:11:10,207	00:11:11,743	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	We were told this is
EDL	00:11:11,743	00:11:13,023	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	But we're supposed to be
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:15,839	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	That's what I knew you know that
EDL	00:11:17,375	00:11:18,399	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	We've been there forever
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:25,311	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Tweety also knew that when the Spanish arrived they did terrible

EDL	00:11:27,103	00:11:29,151	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	But she didn't know the details
EDL	00:11:29,663	00:11:36,063	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Historians know many of those details today because they were written down by the Spanish in letters and legal.
EDL	00:11:36,063	00:11:42,463	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Documents documents to quote ographer skim the surface of events
EDL	00:11:42,463	00:11:48,095	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And sometimes present onate quote as he wished to be seen not as things actually were
EDL	00:11:48,607	00:11:52,959	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Which makes their description of what happened at Acoma all the more shocking
EDL	00:11:53,727	00:12:00,127	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	After 13 of onion taste men came looking for food and were killed when a state declared a

EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:15,487	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Stopped prisoners and threw them off the Mesa and set fires that suffocated women and children
EDL	00:12:15,487	00:12:18,815	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Who taken shelter in sacred rooms known as kiva's
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:22,399	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	They then rounded up 500 prisoners and put them on trial
EDL	00:12:22,911	00:12:26,751	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Onate sentence those over 12 years old to 20 years of slavery
EDL	00:12:27,263	00:12:29,823	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	It was under 12 he separated from their families
EDL	00:12:29,823	00:12:31,615	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Giving the girls to the church
EDL	00:12:31,615	00:12:34,175	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And the boys to the captain who just destroy their Village
EDL	00:12:34,943	00:12:37,759	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And then there's the most infamous detail
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:40,575	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	In a document signed by onate himself
EDL	00:12:40,575	00:12:41,087	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	It says
EDL	00:12:41,599	00:12:44,671	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	The males who are over 25 years of age
EDL	00:12:44,671	00:12:46,463	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	I sentence to have one foot
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:46,975	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Cut off

EDL	00:12:54,399	00:12:55,935	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Convicted by the Spanish crown
EDL	00:12:56,447	00:12:57,471	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	As punishment
EDL	00:12:57,471	00:12:58,495	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	You'll be banished
EDL	00:12:58,495	00:12:59,519	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Permanently
EDL	00:12:59,519	00:13:01,311	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	On the territories of New Mexico
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:07,199	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	This is the history that Tweety and I and many other New Mexicans
EDL	00:13:07,199	00:13:09,247	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	We're learning for the first time
EDL	00:13:09,247	00:13:12,319	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	As news of the stolen foot ricocheted around the state
EDL	00:13:12,319	00:13:13,599	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	That was the beginning of it
EDL	00:13:14,111	00:13:16,159	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	That was everybody's first awareness
EDL	00:13:16,671	00:13:18,207	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And at the same time
EDL	00:13:18,207	00:13:24,351	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	We were also learning that the City of Albuquerque was planning to build this new much more prominent statue
EDL	00:13:25,631	00:13:26,911	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	She has been
EDL	00:13:26,911	00:13:27,935	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Passed out of
EDL	00:13:28,447	00:13:29,727	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	New Mexico
EDL	00:13:29,727	00:13:30,751	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Forever
EDL	00:13:32,031	00:13:34,591	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And now you want to bring him back and put him on a statue
EDL	00:13:36,383	00:13:37,407	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Still mine bazzi
EDL	00:13:38,431	00:13:41,759	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Kanye went from a banished conquistador
EDL	00:13:41,759	00:13:45,087	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	To a father of New Mexico that people wanted to put on a statue
EDL	00:13:45,599	00:13:47,391	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	It's a story for another podcast
EDL	00:13:47,903	00:13:49,695	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	But the simple answer is
EDL	00:13:49,695	00:13:50,975	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	He was first
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:55,327	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	The first to build a European colony in the region even if that colony was soon abandoned
EDL	00:13:55,839	00:13:59,167	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	He was among the first to bring wheat and sheep and Catholicism
EDL	00:13:59,679	00:14:02,751	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And because every people needs a founding figure
EDL	00:14:02,751	00:14:06,335	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Spanish New Mexico made Juan de onate it's George Washington
EDL	00:14:06,847	00:14:08,639	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Even if he had been cast out forever
EDL	00:14:09,151	00:14:15,551	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	But it did not take long for the Albuquerque Arts board to realize that one de onate was not everyone's ID
EDL	00:14:15,551	00:14:17,087	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Idea of a founding father
EDL	00:14:17,087	00:14:20,927	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	They could see you at another triumphant statue of him on a horse
EDL	00:14:20,927	00:14:22,463	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Would be a bad look for the city
EDL	00:14:22,975	00:14:27,327	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Some of the time the foot was cut off of the old statue on the side of the highway
EDL	00:14:27,327	00:14:29,375	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	They made a few changes to the plan
EDL	00:14:29,887	00:14:31,679	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	The memorial would need to depict
EDL	00:14:31,679	00:14:33,215	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Not just onate
EDL	00:14:33,215	00:14:36,031	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	But also the peaceful settlers who came with him
EDL	00:14:36,031	00:14:39,103	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And the Native Americans who preceded and survived them
EDL	00:14:39,615	00:14:41,919	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And the exact form the memorial would take
EDL	00:14:42,431	00:14:44,479	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Will be up to a team of artists
EDL	00:14:44,479	00:14:49,343	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	They had a team of two but right before the newspapers got wind of the missing foot
EDL	00:14:49,343	00:14:51,135	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	They decided to add a third
EDL	00:14:51,647	00:14:53,951	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	When Nora naranjo Morse got the call
EDL	00:14:54,463	00:14:56,511	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	She was in the place where she's most comfortable
EDL	00:14:57,535	00:14:58,303	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Her Studio
EDL	00:14:58,815	00:15:01,631	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	I mean who would want to be here right in this
EDL	00:15:01,631	00:15:04,191	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Studio with a fireplace in the rain
EDL	00:15:04,191	00:15:08,287	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	On the phone was the director of public art for the City of Albuquerque
EDL	00:15:08,287	00:15:12,127	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Asking if she wanted to be part of a tri cultural collaboration
EDL	00:15:12,639	00:15:17,247	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	It would be the Hispanic artist who built the Statue that had its foot stolen
EDL	00:15:17,247	00:15:18,527	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	An Anglo artist
EDL	00:15:18,527	00:15:19,551	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And her
EDL	00:15:19,551	00:15:22,623	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	At a white Indian artist from the Santa Clara Pueblo
EDL	00:15:22,623	00:15:23,903	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	The call was
EDL	00:15:23,903	00:15:25,439	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	So out of the blue
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:30,815	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	This was a public art project I've never done public art really
EDL	00:15:30,815	00:15:34,143	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	This was with other people I had been working solo
EDL	00:15:35,167	00:15:37,727	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	So I didn't really know I was listening
EDL	00:15:39,007	00:15:42,591	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And did you say yes right then or do you remember how the phone call
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:45,407	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	I said yes right away because
EDL	00:15:47,455	00:15:49,759	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	I open my mouth and I said yes and then
EDL	00:15:50,527	00:15:52,319	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Afterwards I thought oh
EDL	00:15:52,831	00:15:54,111	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	I wonder what this is going to be like
EDL	00:15:55,391	00:15:58,463	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	She find out when she showed up for that first meeting
EDL	00:15:58,463	00:16:02,047	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	An Institutional room with fluorescent lighting and a chalkboard
EDL	00:16:02,047	00:16:06,655	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	The other artists wield in a model of a statute they'd already put together
EDL	00:16:07,167	00:16:07,935	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	It was
EDL	00:16:08,703	00:16:10,751	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Another triumphant statue
EDL	00:16:10,751	00:16:12,287	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Onate
EDL	00:16:12,799	00:16:13,823	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	On a horse
EDL	00:16:14,591	00:16:17,663	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And that's when they begin to talk about the granite pedestal
EDL	00:16:18,687	00:16:19,455	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:16:19,967	00:16:21,503	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	How I could use
EDL	00:16:22,527	00:16:23,039	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	It
EDL	00:16:23,807	00:16:26,879	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Set the pedestal beneath on yachty's horses feet
EDL	00:16:26,879	00:16:27,391	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Right
EDL	00:16:30,719	00:16:32,255	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	I felt insulted
EDL	00:16:33,535	00:16:34,559	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	I felt hurt
EDL	00:16:35,071	00:16:36,095	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	I felt marginalized
EDL	00:16:36,607	00:16:37,119	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Hi
EDL	00:16:38,143	00:16:38,911	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Didn't
EDL	00:16:38,911	00:16:39,423	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Thanks
EDL	00:16:39,935	00:16:40,959	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	I could do
EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:41,471	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	That
EDL	00:16:42,495	00:16:44,031	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Although in
EDL	00:16:44,031	00:16:44,799	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Myself
EDL	00:16:45,311	00:16:46,847	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	I was thinking
EDL	00:16:46,847	00:16:48,383	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	That there was a solution
EDL	00:16:49,407	00:16:51,455	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	That art could tell a story
EDL	00:16:51,455	00:16:52,223	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	That was true
EDL	00:16:53,503	00:16:57,087	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Dora quite literally refused to put on yacht they on a pedestal
EDL	00:16:57,087	00:16:59,135	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	The artist went back to the drawing board
EDL	00:16:59,647	00:17:01,951	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	But now Nora was in the public eye
EDL	00:17:02,463	00:17:06,047	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And soon she started getting calls from other Pueblo people
EDL	00:17:06,047	00:17:08,607	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Who wanted her to leave the project entirely
EDL	00:17:09,119	00:17:09,887	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	In protest
EDL	00:17:10,655	00:17:11,935	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	I didn't do that
EDL	00:17:12,959	00:17:15,775	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And when I refused I got some
EDL	00:17:17,823	00:17:19,615	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	I think people were disappointed
EDL	00:17:20,383	00:17:22,175	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	But I realize that
EDL	00:17:23,199	00:17:26,015	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Buy me staying in the game
EDL	00:17:26,783	00:17:28,319	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	I would at least
EDL	00:17:28,319	00:17:29,855	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Be able to
EDL	00:17:30,879	00:17:32,415	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Fight for that voice that I
EDL	00:17:32,415	00:17:33,183	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	I think was so
EDL	00:17:33,951	00:17:34,463	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Important
EDL	00:17:35,487	00:17:36,255	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Not just my art
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:37,279	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Voice
EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:40,863	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	But the voice of these people that have gone to this
EDL	00:17:40,863	00:17:41,631	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Incredible
EDL	00:17:42,143	00:17:44,959	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Experience that changed their culture completely
EDL	00:17:45,727	00:17:46,495	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:17:47,007	00:17:48,799	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	All I kept going back to those things
EDL	00:17:53,663	00:17:57,503	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	The year of the 400th anniversary 1998 came and went
EDL	00:17:57,503	00:17:59,807	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And there was still no plan for the memorial
EDL	00:18:00,319	00:18:02,111	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	But the city would not give up
EDL	00:18:02,879	00:18:09,279	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	All the attention and made the memorial a very public test of whether the state was the land of try cultural
EDL	00:18:09,279	00:18:11,071	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Tell Harmony that claim to be
EDL	00:18:11,071	00:18:14,399	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	So every time the process hit an impasse
EDL	00:18:14,399	00:18:17,215	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	The city just threw more time and money at it
EDL	00:18:17,215	00:18:20,543	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Hiring mediators in forming committees
EDL	00:18:20,543	00:18:26,943	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	At one point one of those committees came up with a plan that would have restarted the whole artistic process a plan Conchita
EDL	00:18:26,943	00:18:28,223	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Suicide couldn't tolerate
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:30,527	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	It called for a memorial
EDL	00:18:31,039	00:18:32,063	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Without
EDL	00:18:32,063	00:18:32,575	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Onate
EDL	00:18:33,599	00:18:35,391	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Focus on coexistence of
EDL	00:18:35,391	00:18:35,903	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Hispanic
EDL	00:18:36,415	00:18:38,719	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Then we said it wasn't our celebration
EDL	00:18:40,511	00:18:42,815	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	You know it's your celebration now it's not ours
EDL	00:18:43,327	00:18:45,887	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	You know you don't get invited to a wedding
EDL	00:18:46,399	00:18:51,007	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	You don't start telling the bride and the groom you should have had it this way or that way or
EDL	00:18:51,519	00:18:52,287	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And that's
EDL	00:18:52,287	00:18:55,871	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	What what it was it was our celebration but it was your celebration
EDL	00:18:55,871	00:18:56,895	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	With public money and
EDL	00:18:56,895	00:18:57,407	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Public space
EDL	00:18:57,919	00:18:59,967	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	That's in a in a city that has people up
EDL	00:19:01,503	00:19:02,271	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	All different backgrounds
EDL	00:19:03,551	00:19:05,855	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	The grant was for our celebration
EDL	00:19:06,367	00:19:09,183	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Not for The Alchemist celebration for for anybody else's
EDL	00:19:09,951	00:19:14,815	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	As far as computers group was concerned the present of onate was non-negotiable
EDL	00:19:15,327	00:19:16,607	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Which made it hard to negotiate
EDL	00:19:17,119	00:19:17,887	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	In the end
EDL	00:19:17,887	00:19:20,959	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	There simply was no single design that everyone could agree on
EDL	00:19:20,959	00:19:23,775	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Eventually the artist stop talking to each other
EDL	00:19:24,287	00:19:25,055	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Instead
EDL	00:19:25,055	00:19:29,151	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	They proposed memorial made up of two separate artworks
EDL	00:19:29,151	00:19:34,527	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	A series of Bronze Statues of Spanish settlers including onate in full armor
EDL	00:19:35,039	00:19:36,575	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Enormous response
EDL	00:19:36,575	00:19:40,415	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	An abstract Land Art installation made out of the desert itself
EDL	00:19:40,927	00:19:46,303	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Did gone from a small bronze statue to a memorial that would take up most of a city block
EDL	00:19:46,303	00:19:48,607	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And cost over half-a-million dollars
EDL	00:19:48,607	00:19:50,911	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Requiring the city to issue special bonds
EDL	00:19:51,679	00:19:52,703	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Now the question was
EDL	00:19:53,215	00:19:54,495	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	With the city approve it
EDL	00:19:55,007	00:19:58,591	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Conchita and the pronoun take forces Lobby the city council
EDL	00:19:59,103	00:20:01,919	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Wow unyazi opponents like Tweety
EDL	00:20:01,919	00:20:03,455	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Took their case to the people

EDL	00:20:12,671	00:20:13,695	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Councilman in
EDL	00:20:14,463	00:20:15,999	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	That's the first time I'd ever
EDL	00:20:15,999	00:20:16,511	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Done.
EDL	00:20:17,023	00:20:17,535	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	You know

EDL	00:20:23,423	00:20:24,703	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	I've never done that
EDL	00:20:25,215	00:20:26,239	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	The statue
EDL	00:20:26,239	00:20:31,103	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And also a highway the city was trying to build through at National Monument of ancient petroglyphs
EDL	00:20:31,615	00:20:37,247	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Was making first-time activist out of a lot of Pueblo people
EDL	00:20:37,247	00:20:38,783	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Rallied around something
EDL	00:20:39,295	00:20:41,087	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Activists artists
EDL	00:20:41,087	00:20:42,879	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Citizens and City councilors
EDL	00:20:43,391	00:20:45,439	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	We're headed for a final showdown

EDL	00:21:02,847	00:21:06,431	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	In a series of meetings but city council Auditorium was divided
EDL	00:21:06,431	00:21:07,455	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Like a pep rally
EDL	00:21:07,455	00:21:08,735	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Congress
EDL	00:21:08,735	00:21:13,855	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	On one side was the pro on yacht A Crowd mostly Hispanic people around canchitas age
EDL	00:21:14,367	00:21:16,928	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	On the other side was the anti on the outside group
EDL	00:21:16,928	00:21:21,024	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	They tended to be younger and more diverse Native Americans but also
EDL	00:21:21,024	00:21:22,816	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Anglos and African Americans
EDL	00:21:22,816	00:21:26,656	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And a lot of people or mestizo
EDL	00:21:26,656	00:21:31,008	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Explicitly embracing their indigenous as well as European ancestry
EDL	00:21:31,776	00:21:38,176	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	The city council tried to give the two sides equal time to speak and an hour after
EDL	00:21:38,176	00:21:41,248	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Hour of public comment they went back and forth
EDL	00:21:41,760	00:21:47,136	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Bernard over the design of the memorial really they're fighting over something much bigger
EDL	00:21:47,136	00:21:50,720	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And much more personal their place in American history
EDL	00:21:51,232	00:21:53,536	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Our colony was the first
EDL	00:21:54,048	00:21:57,376	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	In what is today the United States of America
EDL	00:21:57,376	00:22:02,752	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	You can't pretend that we didn't come here 400 years ago
EDL	00:22:02,752	00:22:06,080	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	This is really a matter of denigrating
EDL	00:22:06,080	00:22:08,896	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	The Hispanic people of New Mexico
EDL	00:22:10,944	00:22:12,480	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Do I have to stop
EDL	00:22:17,088	00:22:18,368	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	First of all sorts
EDL	00:22:18,368	00:22:18,880	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Chicano
EDL	00:22:20,416	00:22:21,184	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Hand
EDL	00:22:21,184	00:22:23,744	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Unlike some Hispanics that are here in the audience
EDL	00:22:24,256	00:22:26,560	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	I didn't just get off the plane from Spain
EDL	00:22:26,560	00:22:28,608	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Does not represent the best of my culture
EDL	00:22:29,120	00:22:30,656	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	You are not representing me
EDL	00:22:30,656	00:22:32,960	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And I just want to say that I'm sorry
EDL	00:22:32,960	00:22:38,336	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	That you and a small group of Hispanics in this room feel like they have to slam another people's culture
EDL	00:22:38,336	00:22:39,360	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	In order to feel Pride
EDL	00:22:44,480	00:22:48,320	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	There were dozens of speakers but the leaders were women from Acoma
EDL	00:22:48,320	00:22:49,088	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Like Tweety
EDL	00:22:50,112	00:22:53,184	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	I didn't know that the awful things that happened to my people
EDL	00:22:53,184	00:22:54,464	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Happened to my people
EDL	00:22:55,744	00:22:58,048	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	I told the statue became an issue
EDL	00:22:58,560	00:23:01,376	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	I'm really tired of being used
EDL	00:23:01,376	00:23:01,888	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Taurus
EDL	00:23:02,656	00:23:06,496	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	The only things that matter in this community
EDL	00:23:10,080	00:23:11,616	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Unbreaking you
EDL	00:23:12,640	00:23:15,712	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Don't do this to my people
EDL	00:23:19,040	00:23:20,064	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	People
EDL	00:23:20,064	00:23:22,112	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Don't hurt him this way
EDL	00:23:22,112	00:23:23,392	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	It's not right
EDL	00:23:24,928	00:23:25,440	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Thank you very much
EDL	00:23:25,952	00:23:28,512	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Bass speaker IL Sanchez Davis
EDL	00:23:33,376	00:23:36,704	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	It seemed like most people were on Tweety side
EDL	00:23:37,216	00:23:39,776	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	But the city voted against the memorial
EDL	00:23:39,776	00:23:43,872	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	It wouldn't just be saying no to this statue of onate and the settler send
EDL	00:23:43,872	00:23:45,152	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Sonora's landscape art
EDL	00:23:45,920	00:23:49,248	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	You'll be admitting that this whole very public process that
EDL	00:23:49,248	00:23:51,552	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	It dragged on for more than 2 years
EDL	00:23:52,064	00:23:52,832	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	I've been a failure
EDL	00:23:53,600	00:23:57,184	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	The Committees that Define iterations the debate all for nothing
EDL	00:23:58,208	00:24:00,256	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	So when it finally came time to vote
EDL	00:24:00,256	00:24:04,352	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	All those in favor please signify by saying aye those opposed
EDL	00:24:04,352	00:24:09,728	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	No they go to 722 to build the memorial
EDL	00:24:11,776	00:24:14,848	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	After the vote Conchita Lucero told a reporter
EDL	00:24:14,848	00:24:17,920	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	I think our kids will finally learn about their ancestors
EDL	00:24:18,688	00:24:19,968	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Tweety suazo and
EDL	00:24:19,968	00:24:21,760	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Other anti onate activists
EDL	00:24:22,272	00:24:25,600	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Formed a prayer circle in the city council chambers and wept
EDL	00:24:27,136	00:24:28,160	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	We work so hard
EDL	00:24:29,184	00:24:30,976	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And it just it just is
EDL	00:24:30,976	00:24:31,744	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Didn't matter
EDL	00:24:33,280	00:24:34,816	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	It didn't matter what we said
EDL	00:24:35,584	00:24:36,864	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	It didn't matter what we
EDL	00:24:36,864	00:24:37,376	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Do
EDL	00:24:39,424	00:24:40,704	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Politically astute
EDL	00:24:41,216	00:24:41,728	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Now
EDL	00:24:42,496	00:24:44,544	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Tweety thinks what they learned was
EDL	00:24:44,544	00:24:46,336	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	But the right arguments Aren't Enough
EDL	00:24:46,848	00:24:48,384	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	You made the right decision makers
EDL	00:24:48,896	00:24:54,272	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	She's one of several anti onate activists who went on to get involved in electoral politics
EDL	00:24:54,784	00:24:58,624	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	She's now the chair of the Native American Democratic caucus of New Mexico
EDL	00:24:59,136	00:25:02,464	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And this last cycle she helped raise money and get out the vote
EDL	00:25:02,464	00:25:03,488	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	For Deb haaland
EDL	00:25:03,488	00:25:08,608	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	One of the two Native American women who just became the first ever to be elected to congress
EDL	00:25:13,984	00:25:16,544	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Today if you go visit the Finish Memorial
EDL	00:25:17,056	00:25:20,128	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	What you'll see isn't onate on a horse
EDL	00:25:20,128	00:25:21,408	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	It's a compromise
EDL	00:25:21,408	00:25:23,200	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	It's really two memorials
EDL	00:25:23,200	00:25:24,224	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Crammed into one
EDL	00:25:24,736	00:25:25,504	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	The first
EDL	00:25:25,504	00:25:28,064	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	You can grasp without even getting out of your car
EDL	00:25:28,576	00:25:31,904	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	It's more than two dozen life-sized bronze figures
EDL	00:25:31,904	00:25:34,464	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Men and women oxen and sheep
EDL	00:25:34,464	00:25:35,744	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Trudging up a hill
EDL	00:25:36,512	00:25:38,304	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Juan de onate is in France
EDL	00:25:38,816	00:25:43,936	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	On foot no plaque with his name and under the watchful eye of a security camera
EDL	00:25:43,936	00:25:45,728	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	May or may not be pointed at his feet
EDL	00:25:46,240	00:25:51,104	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	II Memorial right next to it looks from above like a huge dirt spiral
EDL	00:25:51,104	00:25:52,640	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	But from ground level
EDL	00:25:52,640	00:25:54,688	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	You really just have to experience it
EDL	00:25:55,200	00:25:57,504	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	It's a striking contrast to the kind of art
EDL	00:25:57,504	00:26:00,576	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	It's really in your face and didactic insist this is what I mean
EDL	00:26:01,344	00:26:02,624	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	I think that
EDL	00:26:02,624	00:26:05,184	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Flex Pueblo thinking it's much more subtle
EDL	00:26:05,696	00:26:09,536	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	It doesn't articulate in the way we've become used to as
EDL	00:26:09,536	00:26:10,048	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	You know
EDL	00:26:11,072	00:26:12,352	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Civilized people
EDL	00:26:12,352	00:26:13,376	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Colonize people
EDL	00:26:13,888	00:26:16,704	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	When I'm at Nora naranjo Morse to get a tour
EDL	00:26:16,704	00:26:20,288	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	She just been picking up trash left inside her part of the memorial
EDL	00:26:20,800	00:26:24,640	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	She's holding a donut wrapper as we walked down a dirt path that
EDL	00:26:24,640	00:26:26,688	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Spiral slowly downhill
EDL	00:26:26,688	00:26:27,456	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Into the ground
EDL	00:26:28,480	00:26:33,344	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	The street disappears behind the berms of camisas and Juniper is on our right and left
EDL	00:26:33,856	00:26:35,136	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Bennett Buildings
EDL	00:26:35,136	00:26:36,672	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	10 Oneonta himself
EDL	00:26:37,696	00:26:40,256	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Until finally at the center of the Spiral
EDL	00:26:40,256	00:26:42,048	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	All you can see is the land
EDL	00:26:42,816	00:26:44,864	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And water trickling across Iraq
EDL	00:26:46,144	00:26:48,960	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And I'd like that very much
EDL	00:26:48,960	00:26:49,984	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Because I think
EDL	00:26:51,520	00:26:54,848	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	That's what it was like a long time ago that's how I interpret the
EDL	00:26:56,640	00:26:58,432	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	If you sit low to the ground
EDL	00:26:58,432	00:27:02,784	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	You can almost get a glimpse of a world before Oneonta arrives
EDL	00:27:03,552	00:27:04,576	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	It's an Escape
EDL	00:27:05,600	00:27:08,416	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	But it's also intended as a confrontation
EDL	00:27:08,416	00:27:09,696	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Between two
EDL	00:27:09,696	00:27:11,232	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Totally different worldviews
EDL	00:27:12,000	00:27:14,304	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Because it's you walk back out of the Spiral
EDL	00:27:14,304	00:27:15,840	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	This is what you see
EDL	00:27:15,840	00:27:18,144	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	The telephone lines the
EDL	00:27:18,144	00:27:20,960	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Sculpture of Oneonta coming here looking North
EDL	00:27:21,472	00:27:24,032	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	The stoplight it's all there
EDL	00:27:25,312	00:27:26,848	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And so you see that
EDL	00:27:27,360	00:27:29,408	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	In some ways when they came
EDL	00:27:31,200	00:27:33,248	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	They brought us great opportunity
EDL	00:27:33,248	00:27:34,528	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	But at such a high cost
EDL	00:27:35,552	00:27:38,368	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	The brutal colonization was
EDL	00:27:38,368	00:27:39,392	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Forever
EDL	00:27:39,904	00:27:40,928	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Affecting to us
EDL	00:27:41,952	00:27:42,976	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And I
EDL	00:27:42,976	00:27:43,488	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Sync
EDL	00:27:44,256	00:27:45,536	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	We should never forget that
EDL	00:27:48,864	00:27:52,192	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	She hopes her piece of the memorial will remind people of fat
EDL	00:27:53,216	00:27:55,520	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	But honestly not that many people come here
EDL	00:27:56,032	00:28:01,152	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	The memorial doesn't attract nearly as much attention as the conflict over the memorial did
EDL	00:28:01,664	00:28:03,968	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	I think that's why it's important stewardship
EDL	00:28:04,480	00:28:06,528	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Not only to pick up the trash
EDL	00:28:06,528	00:28:08,576	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	But also to keep that
EDL	00:28:08,576	00:28:09,344	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Story of life
EDL	00:28:10,368	00:28:13,184	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Cuz they're going to be a lot more generations of people coming
EDL	00:28:13,696	00:28:15,232	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Wondering what what is this
EDL	00:28:18,816	00:28:22,144	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And that's where our story was going to end until last year
EDL	00:28:22,144	00:28:23,936	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	An old mystery re-emerged
EDL	00:28:24,448	00:28:28,032	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Remember that first statue we told you about the one that got its foot stolen
EDL	00:28:28,032	00:28:31,360	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Will promise to decades the foot thieves had remained in the shadows
EDL	00:28:31,872	00:28:33,152	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Their identities unknown
EDL	00:28:33,920	00:28:40,320	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And then one day Chris are the director of smoke signals and skins possibly be best known Native American filmmaker
EDL	00:28:40,320	00:28:41,600	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Was at La choza
EDL	00:28:41,600	00:28:44,160	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	This great little new Mexican restaurant in Santa Fe
EDL	00:28:44,160	00:28:45,440	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	I was sitting there
EDL	00:28:46,720	00:28:47,744	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Eating
EDL	00:28:47,744	00:28:49,024	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	A taco with
EDL	00:28:49,792	00:28:51,840	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	My business partner and
EDL	00:28:53,120	00:28:54,656	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Someone came up to me and said
EDL	00:28:55,424	00:28:59,264	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	I have a story to tell you is I'm eating my taco and I said

EDL	00:29:04,896	00:29:09,760	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	You know I heard a few keywords but I wasn't listening that intently
EDL	00:29:09,760	00:29:12,064	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And all the sudden it dawned on me I said wait a minute
EDL	00:29:13,344	00:29:16,160	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	You talking about what I think you're talking about
EDL	00:29:16,928	00:29:20,768	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	It was the guy who cut the foot of the first onate statue
EDL	00:29:20,768	00:29:24,096	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Or at least he claimed to be a spokesman for the group who did the deed
EDL	00:29:24,608	00:29:25,120	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:29:25,632	00:29:27,424	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	The truth of the matter is that I
EDL	00:29:27,424	00:29:28,704	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Could never verify it
EDL	00:29:29,216	00:29:31,264	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Other than I believed it in the end
EDL	00:29:31,776	00:29:33,568	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Chris believe the guy
EDL	00:29:33,568	00:29:37,664	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	In part because he was presented with a very solid piece of evidence
EDL	00:29:37,664	00:29:40,224	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	When Chris met him for a second time in a

EDL	00:29:44,320	00:29:47,904	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	To reveal something no one had seen for 20 years
EDL	00:29:47,904	00:29:49,696	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Lo and behold there

EDL	00:29:51,232	00:29:52,000	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Probably
EDL	00:29:52,000	00:29:52,768	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	28
EDL	00:29:53,280	00:29:54,560	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Inch-long

EDL	00:30:00,192	00:30:01,728	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Of a Spanish conquistador
EDL	00:30:03,264	00:30:04,544	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And I said to myself
EDL	00:30:05,056	00:30:05,568	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Wow
EDL	00:30:06,848	00:30:11,200	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Then I looked around and I said to myself where the hell am I and what the hell am I doing here
EDL	00:30:12,224	00:30:14,528	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	A few chunks of the foot have been shaved off
EDL	00:30:14,528	00:30:17,856	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	But they'd made a half-hearted attempt to follow through on those
EDL	00:30:17,856	00:30:19,904	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Medallions for the historically ignorant
EDL	00:30:20,416	00:30:22,464	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	But otherwise it was still intact
EDL	00:30:23,232	00:30:25,792	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And still have the power to grab people's attention
EDL	00:30:26,304	00:30:29,632	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	The Chris knows the identity of the foot thieves he is not revealing it
EDL	00:30:30,144	00:30:32,448	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	But he did talk about their motivations
EDL	00:30:32,448	00:30:35,520	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	You know the party involved is not
EDL	00:30:36,288	00:30:39,360	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Speaking from an activist position
EDL	00:30:40,384	00:30:41,664	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And doesn't
EDL	00:30:43,200	00:30:46,016	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Feel like an activist this person feels like
EDL	00:30:46,784	00:30:47,552	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Astoria
EDL	00:30:49,856	00:30:53,952	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	He wasn't trying to start a movement or affect policy
EDL	00:30:53,952	00:30:58,304	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Just to write what onate did to Acoma men in 1599
EDL	00:30:58,304	00:31:01,632	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Into the history of the colonization of New Mexico
EDL	00:31:02,400	00:31:05,216	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	That story still doesn't have a statue
EDL	00:31:05,216	00:31:07,008	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And maybe it never will
EDL	00:31:07,008	00:31:09,568	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	But in the meantime the friends of Acoma

EDL	00:33:25,760	00:33:31,136	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Preterite monuments it was reported by Seth freed wessler and Brian Palmer of the investigative fund
EDL	00:33:32,416	00:33:38,816	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Brian is interest in Confederate monuments all started in historic Cemetery he was visiting the place where is great
EDL	00:33:38,816	00:33:43,424	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Grandparents were buried they're both enslaved and then self emancipated to the north
EDL	00:33:43,936	00:33:48,288	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Brian's great-grandfather served in the United States Army during the Civil War
EDL	00:33:48,288	00:33:52,896	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	In the cemetery where they're buried is located in Virginia on a military base
EDL	00:33:52,896	00:33:54,176	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	There's a white section
EDL	00:33:54,176	00:33:55,200	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And a black section
EDL	00:33:56,480	00:33:58,016	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And what I saw was
EDL	00:33:58,528	00:34:01,088	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	On the one hand tragic and on the other hand
EDL	00:34:01,600	00:34:03,904	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Enlightening the traffic part was that
EDL	00:34:03,904	00:34:05,696	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	This African American cemetery
EDL	00:34:06,208	00:34:07,232	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Was not
EDL	00:34:07,232	00:34:09,024	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	As well tended as
EDL	00:34:09,024	00:34:10,048	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	The White Cemetery
EDL	00:34:10,560	00:34:11,840	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Across the base
EDL	00:34:11,840	00:34:13,888	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	So that to me was a little bit striking
EDL	00:34:14,400	00:34:16,192	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	At the White Cemetery there's one
EDL	00:34:16,704	00:34:18,240	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Graven particular.
EDL	00:34:18,240	00:34:20,032	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	That caught my eye I've had
EDL	00:34:20,800	00:34:22,592	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	A couple of Confederate flags
EDL	00:34:23,104	00:34:23,616	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Around it
EDL	00:34:25,408	00:34:31,296	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	The inscription on this wooden cross a little plaque said to the unknown confederate soldier
EDL	00:34:31,808	00:34:33,344	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	So I thought wow that's really interesting
EDL	00:34:34,880	00:34:35,648	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	This
EDL	00:34:35,648	00:34:37,696	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	White Cemetery is being maintained
EDL	00:34:38,464	00:34:40,512	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	The black Cemetery they at least rate
EDL	00:34:40,512	00:34:43,072	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	But it was tumbledown and
EDL	00:34:43,584	00:34:46,144	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	It just did not look like it had any stewardship
EDL	00:34:47,936	00:34:51,776	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	I started wondering while why are such cemeteries
EDL	00:34:52,288	00:34:53,312	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Black cemeteries
EDL	00:34:54,592	00:34:56,384	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Historic black cemeteries
EDL	00:34:57,408	00:35:00,224	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Why are cemeteries such as this in such terrible shape
EDL	00:35:00,992	00:35:03,552	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And why are Confederate cemeteries
EDL	00:35:03,552	00:35:05,344	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And monuments and sites
EDL	00:35:05,344	00:35:06,624	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	In such a wonderful shape
EDL	00:35:07,904	00:35:10,720	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	The obvious journalist thing to do then is to follow the money
EDL	00:35:11,232	00:35:14,304	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	So you noticed that there's a disparity in the care
EDL	00:35:14,304	00:35:15,840	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Makes you realize that
EDL	00:35:15,840	00:35:18,656	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	A disparity in Keras reflected in disparity dollars
EDL	00:35:19,168	00:35:20,704	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And that money is being spent
EDL	00:35:21,216	00:35:21,984	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	On
EDL	00:35:21,984	00:35:24,800	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Confederate monuments and not being spent on
EDL	00:35:24,800	00:35:28,640	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	The Monuments devoted to the after American Experience in the African American history
EDL	00:35:29,408	00:35:30,176	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And then you start

EDL	00:35:34,272	00:35:37,856	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	For the preservation and the maintenance of Confederate monuments
EDL	00:35:38,368	00:35:39,648	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	They are being

EDL	00:35:41,184	00:35:42,720	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	What Confederate monuments
EDL	00:35:42,720	00:35:44,512	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Devoted to this lost

EDL	00:35:45,792	00:35:50,400	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	So can you describe with the Lost Cause narrative is to people who don't know it
EDL	00:35:50,400	00:35:52,448	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	So you make that important distinction
EDL	00:35:52,960	00:35:53,472	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	We
EDL	00:35:54,496	00:35:56,544	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Looked at a range of sites
EDL	00:35:57,568	00:35:59,104	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	That tell Civil War history
EDL	00:35:59,616	00:36:01,152	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	You have battlefields
EDL	00:36:01,664	00:36:02,432	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	You have
EDL	00:36:02,432	00:36:03,968	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Homes in all sorts of different places
EDL	00:36:04,992	00:36:08,064	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And what they put on the walls and what their guide say
EDL	00:36:08,064	00:36:09,088	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Is factual
EDL	00:36:09,088	00:36:11,136	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	This happened here this unit fought
EDL	00:36:11,904	00:36:12,928	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	That to us is
EDL	00:36:13,440	00:36:16,768	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	History that's acceptable that is educational that's perfect
EDL	00:36:16,768	00:36:18,048	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	What we did
EDL	00:36:18,048	00:36:18,816	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Was we
EDL	00:36:18,816	00:36:21,632	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	We focused on sites where the historic
EDL	00:36:22,144	00:36:24,192	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Historical interpretation
EDL	00:36:24,960	00:36:28,288	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And what the people there say and what is omitted
EDL	00:36:29,312	00:36:31,360	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Represents an ideology
EDL	00:36:31,872	00:36:32,640	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Not
EDL	00:36:32,640	00:36:34,432	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	An evidence-based
EDL	00:36:34,432	00:36:36,992	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Comprehensive approach to the Civil War
EDL	00:36:37,504	00:36:39,040	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	But what represents
EDL	00:36:39,040	00:36:40,320	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Ideology that what
EDL	00:36:40,320	00:36:42,624	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	What perpetuates ideology so for example
EDL	00:36:43,136	00:36:43,904	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Ones that
EDL	00:36:44,928	00:36:46,720	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Either minimize or
EDL	00:36:46,720	00:36:49,536	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Deny the centrality the importance of slavery
EDL	00:36:50,304	00:36:51,840	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	In the Civil War
EDL	00:36:51,840	00:36:55,680	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	The ones that pump out these loyal slave happy slave myth
EDL	00:36:56,960	00:36:59,264	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And ones that deny any
EDL	00:36:59,264	00:37:01,312	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Any Southern responsibility
EDL	00:37:01,312	00:37:04,640	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	For the war that that that you know they paint this did this picture of
EDL	00:37:05,152	00:37:06,432	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	A blamelessness
EDL	00:37:06,432	00:37:07,712	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Vist us
EDL	00:37:07,712	00:37:08,736	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Is corrosive
EDL	00:37:09,248	00:37:13,344	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	To democracy into our society and I think it's led us to
EDL	00:37:13,856	00:37:15,392	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Where we are now politically info
EDL	00:37:16,416	00:37:19,232	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	So these these monuments that you are investigating
EDL	00:37:19,232	00:37:20,000	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	They didn't
EDL	00:37:20,000	00:37:22,816	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Appear right after the Civil War took you talk about
EDL	00:37:22,816	00:37:27,168	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	When they showed up and what political purpose they were serving when they were erected
EDL	00:37:27,680	00:37:31,264	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	They didn't just spring up after the Civil War largely because the South
EDL	00:37:31,264	00:37:32,800	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Didn't have the money to erect them
EDL	00:37:32,800	00:37:36,128	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Our first major Monument here in Virginia
EDL	00:37:36,128	00:37:37,152	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Was donated
EDL	00:37:37,152	00:37:40,224	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	By Brits Thomas Stonewall Jackson was put on the
EDL	00:37:40,736	00:37:41,760	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Lawn of
EDL	00:37:41,760	00:37:44,064	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Capital and that was funded by British folks
EDL	00:37:44,576	00:37:45,088	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	But
EDL	00:37:46,368	00:37:49,440	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Monument building really had three main phases
EDL	00:37:49,440	00:37:52,256	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	At the the tail end of the 19th century
EDL	00:37:52,256	00:37:53,024	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Beginning
EDL	00:37:53,024	00:37:54,816	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Of the 20th century and then
EDL	00:37:54,816	00:37:57,120	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Right around the time of civil rights
EDL	00:37:57,120	00:37:57,632	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	So
EDL	00:37:58,144	00:38:00,960	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Interesting it's not coincidental
EDL	00:38:01,728	00:38:08,128	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Into each of these things they take they came about overtime in these these moments of white people in power
EDL	00:38:08,128	00:38:08,640	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Power
EDL	00:38:09,664	00:38:13,248	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Really literally exhibiting their dominance through these
EDL	00:38:14,016	00:38:15,040	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Statues in Monument
EDL	00:38:15,808	00:38:20,416	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And which I think is really interesting to make this really good point in the piece is that
EDL	00:38:21,184	00:38:25,792	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	The current discussion or controversy over historic monuments
EDL	00:38:26,304	00:38:27,840	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	This isn't cringe
EDL	00:38:27,840	00:38:31,680	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	PC culture kind of thing all the way along
EDL	00:38:31,680	00:38:33,216	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Just people didn't listen
EDL	00:38:33,216	00:38:34,496	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Cuz they were mainly
EDL	00:38:34,496	00:38:35,008	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Objections
EDL	00:38:35,520	00:38:36,800	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	By African-Americans
EDL	00:38:37,312	00:38:39,360	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	There is a history of
EDL	00:38:39,360	00:38:41,664	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	African American resistance
EDL	00:38:41,664	00:38:42,432	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	2
EDL	00:38:42,432	00:38:43,456	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	This sort of
EDL	00:38:43,968	00:38:46,272	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Self glorification of white Elites
EDL	00:38:47,040	00:38:52,160	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Frederick Douglass wrote about monuments w b Dubois wrote about The Monuments and they were saying No this is just
EDL	00:38:52,672	00:38:53,184	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Ridiculous
EDL	00:38:54,208	00:38:57,280	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And yet because blacks didn't have the political power to do anything
EDL	00:38:57,792	00:38:58,816	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And because
EDL	00:38:59,840	00:39:02,400	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	The so-called mainstream media controlled by
EDL	00:39:02,912	00:39:03,424	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	White men
EDL	00:39:03,936	00:39:04,704	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Did not
EDL	00:39:05,728	00:39:07,264	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Write about these objections
EDL	00:39:08,288	00:39:11,104	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	It could find no traction in larger culture
EDL	00:39:12,384	00:39:14,432	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	People now in the 20th
EDL	00:39:14,432	00:39:19,040	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	21st century can with ignorance tell us well you never objected before
EDL	00:39:19,040	00:39:21,344	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	No it's that you never paid attention before
EDL	00:39:21,344	00:39:25,952	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And we never had the tools to make you pay attention in the same way that you forced us
EDL	00:39:26,464	00:39:31,584	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	To pay attention to your myths and your stories by embedding them in public space
EDL	00:39:33,120	00:39:33,888	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	So you begin
EDL	00:39:35,424	00:39:37,984	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Investigating these Lost Cause Memorial
EDL	00:39:37,984	00:39:42,848	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	How did you go about investigating how public funds were used to maintain and promote
EDL	00:39:42,848	00:39:44,384	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	A survey historic
EDL	00:39:44,384	00:39:44,896	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Sites
EDL	00:39:45,664	00:39:46,688	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Sodomy
EDL	00:39:46,688	00:39:47,456	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Go about this first
EDL	00:39:47,968	00:39:50,016	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	We had to differentiate between the sites
EDL	00:39:50,016	00:39:51,040	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	It's that were
EDL	00:39:51,040	00:39:51,808	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Doing
EDL	00:39:52,832	00:39:53,600	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Real
EDL	00:39:53,600	00:39:55,648	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Honest genuine historic work
EDL	00:39:55,648	00:39:56,672	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And those that were
EDL	00:39:57,440	00:39:58,464	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Promoting ideology
EDL	00:39:58,464	00:40:00,768	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	So we did a lot of our searching
EDL	00:40:00,768	00:40:02,560	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	On the web first
EDL	00:40:03,072	00:40:05,120	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And we talked to people
EDL	00:40:06,144	00:40:06,656	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	In
EDL	00:40:07,168	00:40:07,936	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	The places
EDL	00:40:08,704	00:40:10,240	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Where these monuments and sites were
EDL	00:40:11,008	00:40:12,032	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And then we went
EDL	00:40:12,032	00:40:16,640	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	So we could go to the museum so we can go to the gift shop so we could talk to the dose
EDL	00:40:17,408	00:40:18,176	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	So we visited
EDL	00:40:19,200	00:40:22,528	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	5060 different places and we lost account
EDL	00:40:22,528	00:40:23,296	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And then
EDL	00:40:23,808	00:40:24,832	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Once we
EDL	00:40:24,832	00:40:25,600	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Figure it out
EDL	00:40:26,112	00:40:28,160	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Which sites we wanted to focus on
EDL	00:40:28,160	00:40:33,024	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	We filed dozens of open records and Freedom of Information Act
EDL	00:40:33,024	00:40:33,536	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Requests
EDL	00:40:34,048	00:40:38,144	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	How to local and state governments and the federal government to find out
EDL	00:40:38,912	00:40:42,496	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Where this money was coming from we looked at IRS documents
EDL	00:40:43,008	00:40:46,848	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	We looked at State budgets line by line by line
EDL	00:40:47,360	00:40:48,128	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	So
EDL	00:40:48,128	00:40:50,432	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	That was our our methodology
EDL	00:40:51,712	00:40:52,736	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Insulted
EDL	00:40:52,736	00:40:56,576	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	So we just like at you going around to these sites with your collaborators set
EDL	00:40:56,576	00:40:57,600	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Freed wessler

EDL	00:41:02,976	00:41:05,536	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Will you ever separated in such a way that
EDL	00:41:05,536	00:41:08,864	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	You were given a different experience of these sites
EDL	00:41:08,864	00:41:10,912	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	That's a very interesting question because
EDL	00:41:12,448	00:41:14,752	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	We tended to report separately
EDL	00:41:15,520	00:41:18,080	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	I knew based on my reporting

EDL	00:41:24,736	00:41:25,248	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Differently
EDL	00:41:25,760	00:41:26,784	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	So
EDL	00:41:26,784	00:41:28,576	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	The stuff that Seth heard
EDL	00:41:28,576	00:41:30,368	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And the stuff that I heard
EDL	00:41:30,368	00:41:36,512	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Very different and I think that's that's that's part of the story but it's also the frame of the store
EDL	00:41:38,048	00:41:44,448	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	We went to some of the same places like the Confederate section of Oakwood Cemetery here I spend a lot of time there
EDL	00:41:44,448	00:41:45,216	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Seth visited
EDL	00:41:45,728	00:41:47,008	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	What people told him

EDL	00:41:50,080	00:41:52,640	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	What people told me you was supposed to be reassuring
EDL	00:41:53,919	00:41:56,479	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	They needed to get the pr
EDL	00:41:56,991	00:41:58,015	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Engine going
EDL	00:41:58,527	00:42:00,063	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	For the visiting black person
EDL	00:42:00,831	00:42:02,623	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	But for a white person they could
EDL	00:42:03,391	00:42:04,159	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Be themselves
EDL	00:42:04,671	00:42:07,743	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	As it were they could let their Prejudice hair hang down
EDL	00:42:08,255	00:42:09,023	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:42:09,535	00:42:11,327	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	That to me was
EDL	00:42:11,327	00:42:11,839	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Towing
EDL	00:42:13,375	00:42:15,679	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	There are people who just don't know
EDL	00:42:15,679	00:42:20,031	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	The other part of this history the African-American strands that have been
EDL	00:42:20,799	00:42:21,567	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Purposely erase
EDL	00:42:22,591	00:42:24,127	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	But then there are people who do know
EDL	00:42:25,151	00:42:27,711	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And still they tried out these myths
EDL	00:42:28,735	00:42:31,807	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Either to preserve their power to make themselves feel better
EDL	00:42:32,319	00:42:33,343	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Whatever it is
EDL	00:42:34,367	00:42:36,159	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	That's a kind of intellectual dishonesty
EDL	00:42:36,671	00:42:37,951	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	That I think is really really Danger
EDL	00:42:38,463	00:42:39,743	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	And I think that's
EDL	00:42:40,767	00:42:42,303	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	We're trying to drain that swamp
EDL	00:42:42,303	00:42:44,095	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	We are trying to to
EDL	00:42:45,375	00:42:46,143	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Eliminate

EDL	00:42:58,943	00:43:00,223	| 331_Onate_s_Foot_pt_01 |	Then they should go build them
