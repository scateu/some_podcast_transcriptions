EDL	00:01:07,840	00:01:09,376	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Roman Mars
EDL	00:01:09,376	00:01:15,776	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Producer Liza Jager recently did something that will become pretty common with the Next Generation
EDL	00:01:15,776	00:01:18,080	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	No kids she has to Grandma
EDL	00:01:18,080	00:01:19,616	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	The shower or tattoo
EDL	00:01:19,616	00:01:24,224	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Can you just describe what the tattoo looks like
EDL	00:01:24,224	00:01:25,504	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	What was the tattoo
EDL	00:01:25,504	00:01:29,856	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	My grandma is very tiny
EDL	00:01:30,368	00:01:32,928	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	I think it's maybe 5/8 of an inch
EDL	00:01:33,440	00:01:36,256	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And it looks like a little hand mirror
EDL	00:01:36,256	00:01:38,816	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Definitely
EDL	00:01:38,816	00:01:40,096	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	It's a little circle
EDL	00:01:40,608	00:01:43,936	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And then a line going off to the side of it
EDL	00:01:43,936	00:01:46,752	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And then there's our cross over that line because
EDL	00:01:46,752	00:01:48,544	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	My blood type is O+
EDL	00:01:49,056	00:01:51,360	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	It's a tiny tattoo of her blood type
EDL	00:01:51,872	00:01:54,432	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And just under her left arm
EDL	00:01:54,944	00:02:00,064	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Okay so do you think that you can just walk me through step-by-step the whole process of getting the
EDL	00:02:00,064	00:02:00,576	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Tattoo
EDL	00:02:01,600	00:02:02,112	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Well
EDL	00:02:05,184	00:02:11,584	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	It was pretty it was pretty straightforward all of the kids whose parents have to sign the slip
EDL	00:02:11,584	00:02:14,144	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Weren't taken marched out of our classroom
EDL	00:02:14,656	00:02:15,680	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And down the hall
EDL	00:02:16,448	00:02:18,496	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And yeah this was in school
EDL	00:02:19,008	00:02:20,288	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	This happened in Lake County Indiana
EDL	00:02:20,800	00:02:23,360	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	It was 1952 and my grandma was 16
EDL	00:02:23,872	00:02:27,200	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And at the first station that you came to the
EDL	00:02:27,200	00:02:27,968	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Your finger
EDL	00:02:28,480	00:02:32,832	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And squeeze a little drop of blood onto a little card
EDL	00:02:32,832	00:02:33,600	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And
EDL	00:02:33,600	00:02:35,392	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Determine what your blood type was
EDL	00:02:36,416	00:02:38,208	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And then you proceeded
EDL	00:02:38,208	00:02:39,744	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Inside the Library
EDL	00:02:40,256	00:02:46,400	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Inside the Library Carol discovered a few makeshift privacy Booth setup and inside each booth and in Ministry
EDL	00:02:46,912	00:02:49,728	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Waiting with a tattoo gun ready to draw
EDL	00:02:49,728	00:02:51,264	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Tiny old Plus
EDL	00:02:51,264	00:02:53,312	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Or a b or a minus
EDL	00:02:53,312	00:02:56,384	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	On row upon row of waiting students
EDL	00:02:56,384	00:02:59,456	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And always in the same place on the Torso
EDL	00:02:59,968	00:03:01,504	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Just under the left arm
EDL	00:03:02,016	00:03:05,088	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	It was sort of like it an inkjet printer they took
EDL	00:03:05,088	00:03:05,600	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Seconds
EDL	00:03:09,696	00:03:10,464	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	That was it
EDL	00:03:11,232	00:03:16,096	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	My grandmother and the other students said they were part of an experimental program called operation tat
EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:18,144	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	It was administered by the county
EDL	00:03:18,144	00:03:19,424	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And symbol
EDL	00:03:19,424	00:03:21,216	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	But also kind of terrifying
EDL	00:03:21,728	00:03:23,520	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	The goal of this
EDL	00:03:23,520	00:03:24,288	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Was
EDL	00:03:24,288	00:03:25,312	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	How to make it
EDL	00:03:25,824	00:03:31,456	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Easy to transfuse people who had been injured and who needed a blood transfusion
EDL	00:03:32,224	00:03:33,760	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	In case of an atom bomb
EDL	00:03:35,296	00:03:41,440	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	At the age of 16 Liza's grandmother's body was permanently marked in anticipation
EDL	00:03:41,440	00:03:44,256	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Of a nuclear catastrophe
EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:49,120	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	In 1952 the cold war was in.
EDL	00:03:49,888	00:03:52,192	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And the government was busy developing civil defense strategy
EDL	00:03:52,960	00:03:55,776	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Things ordinary citizens can do to help protect the home front
EDL	00:03:56,544	00:04:00,640	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And in this case the thinking was that in the event of a Russian attack
EDL	00:04:00,640	00:04:05,504	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	The tattoos would make for quicker transfusions if children were incapacitated or did another blood type
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:10,368	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	They would also have what they were calling a walking blood bank
EDL	00:04:11,392	00:04:17,791	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	So instead of having to extract blood from people store it and keep it cool you just have a cohort
EDL	00:04:17,791	00:04:19,327	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Potential donors
EDL	00:04:19,327	00:04:21,375	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Walking around with their blood types
EDL	00:04:21,375	00:04:22,911	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Written on their side
EDL	00:04:22,911	00:04:24,191	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And if you needed
EDL	00:04:24,191	00:04:24,959	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Some
EDL	00:04:24,959	00:04:26,495	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	A Plus store
EDL	00:04:26,495	00:04:28,799	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	A B minus or something you would just
EDL	00:04:28,799	00:04:35,199	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Check all these people and they will see you found what you needed to the person that needs
EDL	00:04:35,199	00:04:37,503	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Did the blood into an immediate transfusion
EDL	00:04:38,015	00:04:41,087	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	That you were just sort of like lift up somebody's Iris
EDL	00:04:42,623	00:04:45,439	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Yeah yeah I've got one here this is what we need
EDL	00:04:49,279	00:04:51,839	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	For my grandma getting this tattoo was not a big deal
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:53,887	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	But I'm not now
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:04:56,447	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	It was a totally normal day
EDL	00:04:58,239	00:05:02,079	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	This was Indiana nobody gets all excited
EDL	00:05:02,591	00:05:08,479	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Student loan you took your turn you went back to class and finished your mathematics or whatever else you were doing that
EDL	00:05:08,479	00:05:08,991	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	The time
EDL	00:05:10,271	00:05:12,831	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	What is Trivial is it may have seemed at the time
EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:16,159	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Carol's tattoo was more than a weird little cold war Oddity
EDL	00:05:16,671	00:05:20,255	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	It was one of the smallest and most personal manifestations
EDL	00:05:20,255	00:05:22,303	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	But much larger idea
EDL	00:05:22,303	00:05:24,863	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	That deeply influenced how the United States
EDL	00:05:24,863	00:05:25,887	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Fought the Cold War
EDL	00:05:26,399	00:05:27,167	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	The concept
EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:28,703	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Survivability
EDL	00:05:29,471	00:05:31,263	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Enough canned food
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:32,287	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Shelters
EDL	00:05:32,287	00:05:33,055	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Fearlessness
EDL	00:05:33,567	00:05:34,847	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And sometimes
EDL	00:05:34,847	00:05:35,359	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Tattoos
EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:38,687	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	The American people would be able to survive an atomic attack
EDL	00:05:39,455	00:05:42,015	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And that it was only logical to prepare for it
EDL	00:05:46,111	00:05:52,255	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Today if we remember anything about the idea of survivability
EDL	00:05:53,023	00:05:54,303	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	It's probably this
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:06:01,983	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	It's the angle
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:07,103	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Song that goes along with this grainy black-and-white film that was distributed by the federal civil defense Administration
EDL	00:06:07,615	00:06:10,175	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	It shows a little hand drawn Turtle decking under his shell
EDL	00:06:10,943	00:06:12,991	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	He's teaching kids to hide under their desk
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:13,503	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	During the bomb
EDL	00:06:14,527	00:06:16,575	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	People make fun of Duck and Cover a lot
EDL	00:06:17,087	00:06:22,207	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	It's considered the number one example of the kind of cold war-era propaganda
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:22,975	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	It seems
EDL	00:06:22,975	00:06:24,511	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Totally ridiculous now
EDL	00:06:25,023	00:06:26,559	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Kitschy and absurd
EDL	00:06:27,071	00:06:27,583	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And sort of
EDL	00:06:28,095	00:06:34,239	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Unimaginably naive
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:43,967	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	There a lot of jokes made and I think ridicule of Duck and Cover and even today people joke about it and
EDL	00:06:43,967	00:06:47,295	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	So you wouldn't be protected at all it wouldn't make any difference
EDL	00:06:47,295	00:06:51,647	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Susan Linde is a historian of science at the University of Pennsylvania who studies the Cold War
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:57,535	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And she says it when we make fun of the usefulness of a tactic like Duck and Cover
EDL	00:06:57,535	00:06:59,071	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Thinking it couldn't ever work
EDL	00:06:59,839	00:07:01,887	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	We're actually just wrong
EDL	00:07:01,887	00:07:02,655	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Those films
EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:05,727	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	We're in fact based on the individual
EDL	00:07:05,727	00:07:09,311	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Experiences of persons who had been exposed at Hiroshima and Nagasaki
EDL	00:07:09,823	00:07:11,871	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	In September of 1945
EDL	00:07:11,871	00:07:15,199	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Just one month after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki
EDL	00:07:15,711	00:07:16,991	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	US military Center
EDL	00:07:16,991	00:07:21,343	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	A team of American doctors and geneticist to Japan to interview people who survived the attack
EDL	00:07:22,367	00:07:25,439	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	They were looking to understand both the short and long-term effects of radiation
EDL	00:07:26,207	00:07:30,047	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	That program would eventually be named the atomic bomb casualty Commission
EDL	00:07:30,559	00:07:32,095	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Or the ABC
EDL	00:07:32,607	00:07:34,655	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	It would also prove to be highly controversial
EDL	00:07:34,655	00:07:38,239	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Because the researchers weren't there to treat the survivors
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:39,775	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	They were there to study by
EDL	00:07:40,799	00:07:42,335	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And only to study them
EDL	00:07:42,335	00:07:43,103	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And
EDL	00:07:43,103	00:07:45,407	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	The reason to study the survivors
EDL	00:07:45,407	00:07:46,431	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Was because they
EDL	00:07:46,431	00:07:52,831	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	They were surrogates for future American populations that would be subjected to exactly this kind of her
EDL	00:07:52,831	00:07:53,343	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Urban attack
EDL	00:07:54,111	00:07:57,183	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	In a future nuclear war
EDL	00:07:57,695	00:08:01,023	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	It was American lives not Japanese they were hoping to say
EDL	00:08:01,535	00:08:06,911	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Understand who would survive and who would not want an American city was hit with an atomic bomb
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:14,079	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	So when the American scientists and Physicians arrived in Hiroshima and Nagasaki what they wanted to
EDL	00:08:14,079	00:08:15,103	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	To do first was to
EDL	00:08:15,103	00:08:15,615	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Track
EDL	00:08:16,127	00:08:18,687	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Down how many survivors there were
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:19,967	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	They were looking at lots of thing
EDL	00:08:20,479	00:08:22,783	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Cancer rates irregular pregnancies
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:23,551	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Heart disease
EDL	00:08:24,063	00:08:25,087	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Also
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:25,855	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Critically
EDL	00:08:25,855	00:08:27,903	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	They asked every Survivor the interview
EDL	00:08:28,415	00:08:29,439	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Where were you
EDL	00:08:29,951	00:08:31,487	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	At the moment of the detonation
EDL	00:08:31,999	00:08:33,279	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	How close have they been
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:37,119	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Because before the ABC researchers arrived
EDL	00:08:37,119	00:08:43,007	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	The physicist who developed the bomb had assumed that they wouldn't be finding survivors anywhere close to Ground Zero
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:45,055	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	What they called the hypocenter
EDL	00:08:45,823	00:08:47,103	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	But what became
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:47,871	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Clear
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:54,015	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Is it some people could be very close but weren't exposed to significant levels of radiation because they work she'll
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:56,063	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And
EDL	00:08:56,063	00:09:01,695	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Within about three blocks of the hypocenter at Hiroshima there were people in a basement
EDL	00:09:01,695	00:09:02,719	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	In a fairly large
EDL	00:09:03,231	00:09:04,511	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Concrete building
EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:05,791	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Who survived
EDL	00:09:07,071	00:09:12,447	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And further out from the hypocenter researchers discovered that people who had taken cover even momentarily
EDL	00:09:12,959	00:09:15,007	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Didn't just survive the immediate blast
EDL	00:09:15,775	00:09:17,055	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	They seem to be healthy
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:20,383	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	So there's a very famous story about Nagasaki
EDL	00:09:20,383	00:09:21,407	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Which involved
EDL	00:09:21,407	00:09:22,943	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Young boys who were
EDL	00:09:23,711	00:09:24,479	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Swimming
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:27,039	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And they were diving off a
EDL	00:09:27,551	00:09:28,063	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Cliff
EDL	00:09:28,575	00:09:30,111	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Into a lake
EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:30,879	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And
EDL	00:09:30,879	00:09:32,671	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	At the moment of detonation
EDL	00:09:33,183	00:09:34,719	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Five of them were up
EDL	00:09:34,719	00:09:38,815	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Standing up on the cliff and one of them had just hit the water and went under water
EDL	00:09:39,583	00:09:43,935	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And all five who were on that Cliff where dead of leukemia by 1950
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:44,703	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	2
EDL	00:09:44,703	00:09:47,263	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And the one who'd been underwater did not get
EDL	00:09:48,287	00:09:51,103	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Anyone who had been behind even a tree
EDL	00:09:51,871	00:09:53,663	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Was more likely to be alive
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:09:57,247	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Five years later than someone who had been out in the open
EDL	00:09:58,015	00:10:00,319	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And the logic of this is that
EDL	00:10:00,319	00:10:02,879	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	The key exposure to radiation
EDL	00:10:03,647	00:10:05,183	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	The most important moment
EDL	00:10:05,951	00:10:07,487	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Last less than a second
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:12,351	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	It's not that there weren't other sources of radiation to be avoided
EDL	00:10:12,863	00:10:14,399	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	But What mattered most
EDL	00:10:14,399	00:10:16,703	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Wisdom shielded at the moment
EDL	00:10:16,703	00:10:17,215	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	At the blast
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:23,359	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And during the Blaster that followed it was the people who were standing up who were most likely to be
EDL	00:10:23,359	00:10:25,919	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Be killed by shattering windows or falling debris
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:29,503	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	People who have been lying down when the blast wave hit
EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:31,551	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Much more often
EDL	00:10:31,551	00:10:32,063	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Survive
EDL	00:10:32,831	00:10:34,623	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	The lesson seemed clear
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:37,183	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	In the event of an atomic bomb
EDL	00:10:37,183	00:10:38,207	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	If you can stay low
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:39,487	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Stay shielded
EDL	00:10:39,999	00:10:40,511	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	In other words
EDL	00:10:41,023	00:10:41,791	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	If you duct
EDL	00:10:41,791	00:10:42,559	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Uncovered
EDL	00:10:43,071	00:10:44,607	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	You might just be okay
EDL	00:10:46,399	00:10:49,983	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	American Civil Defense planners had already begun to wonder
EDL	00:10:50,495	00:10:55,359	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Is Duck and Cover could help the population of a city survive a nuclear attack
EDL	00:10:55,871	00:10:56,639	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	What else might work
EDL	00:10:57,663	00:11:01,247	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	They were studying things like psychology and group dynamics and infrastructure
EDL	00:11:01,759	00:11:06,111	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	To see how society as a whole might hold up under a nuclear attack
EDL	00:11:06,623	00:11:09,951	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And the civil defense policies that emerge from this research
EDL	00:11:09,951	00:11:11,743	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	All stressed in America
EDL	00:11:11,743	00:11:13,023	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Could survive
EDL	00:11:13,023	00:11:14,559	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	But only if everyone
EDL	00:11:14,559	00:11:17,887	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	What does the authorities but everyday citizens did their part
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:21,471	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	What's the knowledge of the first atomic explosion to die.
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:26,847	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Are chances for survival will be far better than those of the people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:29,151	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	If we act on our knowledge
EDL	00:11:29,151	00:11:29,919	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Underprepared
EDL	00:11:30,431	00:11:32,479	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Like practicing proper Home Maintenance

EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:08,831	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	They opted into a little pilot program to indicate their blood type
EDL	00:12:08,831	00:12:09,599	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	With a tattoo
EDL	00:12:10,111	00:12:11,903	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	All predicated on the belief that
EDL	00:12:11,903	00:12:13,951	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	In the face of an atomic attack
EDL	00:12:14,463	00:12:15,231	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Person
EDL	00:12:15,231	00:12:15,999	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And a society
EDL	00:12:16,511	00:12:17,791	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Might just survive
EDL	00:12:18,303	00:12:19,583	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And my grandma
EDL	00:12:19,583	00:12:20,351	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	She says
EDL	00:12:20,351	00:12:21,631	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	She was pretty much on board
EDL	00:12:22,143	00:12:25,471	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	You don't have any particular memories of your first impressions of
EDL	00:12:25,471	00:12:25,983	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	The program
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:31,359	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Yeah they were all positive I thought this was a good idea
EDL	00:12:32,127	00:12:36,223	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Cheetahs for one thing it was a time when more people still trust the government
EDL	00:12:36,223	00:12:38,527	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Well you're just coming off this big war
EDL	00:12:39,039	00:12:39,551	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Which
EDL	00:12:40,575	00:12:43,391	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	An impossibly complicated in all
EDL	00:12:43,391	00:12:44,671	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Parts of the world
EDL	00:12:44,671	00:12:47,743	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And yet somehow it had all come out all right
EDL	00:12:47,743	00:12:51,583	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And so you felt as somebody was in charge that knew what he was doing
EDL	00:12:51,583	00:12:54,655	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Plus the place you lived in Northern Indiana was a huge Railroad
EDL	00:12:55,167	00:12:56,447	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And it was a possible Target
EDL	00:12:56,959	00:13:00,031	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	She didn't know for sure whether the tattoos would help her survive an attack
EDL	00:13:00,543	00:13:03,103	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	But she also genuinely believe that
EDL	00:13:03,103	00:13:03,871	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	They might
EDL	00:13:03,871	00:13:04,639	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	They're worth getting
EDL	00:13:05,151	00:13:11,039	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Because if people were injured in would not be able to be assisted because you didn't know their blood type is
EDL	00:13:12,319	00:13:14,623	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	That's a no-brainer just go ahead and write it
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:15,647	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Write it on them
EDL	00:13:15,647	00:13:17,183	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Remember this was a voluntary
EDL	00:13:17,951	00:13:18,975	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	My grandmother signed up for
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:21,023	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And so did most of her grade
EDL	00:13:21,535	00:13:22,815	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	She wanted to do her part
EDL	00:13:23,327	00:13:24,351	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	To be prepared
EDL	00:13:24,351	00:13:24,863	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Because
EDL	00:13:25,375	00:13:31,775	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Who knows who knows you know in all of the in the Japanese cities that were bombed there had to be a next day what do you do
EDL	00:13:31,775	00:13:35,103	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	The next day what do you do to save as many people as possible
EDL	00:13:35,615	00:13:37,151	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	The unthinkable thing
EDL	00:13:37,663	00:13:38,431	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	When it happens
EDL	00:13:38,943	00:13:40,479	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	You have to somehow react
EDL	00:13:40,479	00:13:40,991	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Do it
EDL	00:13:41,759	00:13:44,319	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	When I really listen to my grandmother this made sense to me
EDL	00:13:44,831	00:13:47,903	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	It made sense that people believe that the risk of an attack was real
EDL	00:13:48,415	00:13:51,743	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And believe there was a way to be at least somewhat prepared
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:56,351	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	The problem is that not long after she got that tattoo

EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:30,047	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	In part because the gospel of survivability

EDL	00:15:34,655	00:15:38,239	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Sure imaginary things matter a lot especially in propaganda
EDL	00:15:38,239	00:15:39,007	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Because
EDL	00:15:39,007	00:15:41,567	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	A lot of military and civil defense planners

EDL	00:15:56,159	00:15:58,207	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Was absolutely crucial

EDL	00:16:01,023	00:16:02,047	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Of the United States
EDL	00:16:02,815	00:16:05,119	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Which is why by 1960
EDL	00:16:05,631	00:16:08,959	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	The same year the Soviet nuclear Arsenal top 1600 Warheads
EDL	00:16:09,727	00:16:10,751	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	The United States
EDL	00:16:10,751	00:16:12,543	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Had more than 18000
EDL	00:16:13,567	00:16:15,103	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Those weapons were controversial
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:16,639	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Almost from the beginning
EDL	00:16:17,407	00:16:23,807	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	In one week in June demonstrations took place in more than a dozen countries and 250 locations around
EDL	00:16:23,807	00:16:24,575	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	United States
EDL	00:16:25,343	00:16:31,743	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	There were always protest within 24 hours of the dropping of the bomb there were critics all over the world saying
EDL	00:16:31,743	00:16:33,535	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Find that the United States should not have used
EDL	00:16:33,535	00:16:35,071	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	If this keeps up
EDL	00:16:35,071	00:16:36,351	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Then where does it stop
EDL	00:16:36,351	00:16:38,399	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Do we live under the Sword of Damocles forever
EDL	00:16:38,911	00:16:45,311	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And there were theologians who said this is an immoral form of warfare What's Happening Here
EDL	00:16:45,311	00:16:47,871	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Play some moral and that we are in faith must resist
EDL	00:16:48,383	00:16:50,687	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And that made the logic of survivability
EDL	00:16:50,687	00:16:51,711	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Doubly useful
EDL	00:16:52,223	00:16:55,295	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Things like lessons in school and evacuation drills
EDL	00:16:55,295	00:16:56,063	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And tattoos
EDL	00:16:57,343	00:17:01,439	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Is increasing the acceptability of nuclear weapons
EDL	00:17:01,439	00:17:05,791	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And increasing public belief in the idea that even if a nuclear war came
EDL	00:17:06,559	00:17:08,863	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	There would be strategies that would permit
EDL	00:17:09,375	00:17:11,679	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Those who were properly prepared
EDL	00:17:11,679	00:17:12,191	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	To survive
EDL	00:17:13,215	00:17:14,751	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And did it work
EDL	00:17:14,751	00:17:16,287	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Like do people feel less
EDL	00:17:16,287	00:17:16,799	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Scared
EDL	00:17:17,823	00:17:18,847	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	I think that
EDL	00:17:18,847	00:17:20,639	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Some people did maybe most people
EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:26,015	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Because when you look at surveys of people in the 50s about nuclear weapons
EDL	00:17:26,783	00:17:27,295	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	People
EDL	00:17:27,807	00:17:29,087	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Believe that they're necessary
EDL	00:17:30,367	00:17:32,159	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And if your
EDL	00:17:32,159	00:17:35,743	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	If you believe it's necessary then you have to believe that it's also
EDL	00:17:36,255	00:17:38,559	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Practical but it's not insane
EDL	00:17:39,839	00:17:41,375	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	You have to believe it's not insane
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:45,471	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Fear that my grandma got her tattoo
EDL	00:17:45,471	00:17:49,311	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	15 thousand other Lake County residents also got their blood type check
EDL	00:17:49,311	00:17:50,335	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Do the typing program
EDL	00:17:51,103	00:17:51,871	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Finger prick
EDL	00:17:51,871	00:17:52,895	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Kappa Blood on the card
EDL	00:17:53,663	00:17:55,455	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Two-thirds of those people opted for a tattoo
EDL	00:17:55,967	00:17:59,807	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	But operation tat type didn't go far outside Lake County
EDL	00:17:59,807	00:18:02,111	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Despite all the survivability fervor
EDL	00:18:02,111	00:18:04,159	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	It never made it beyond the pilot program
EDL	00:18:04,671	00:18:07,487	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	When I talked to my grandma though I can kind of hear it
EDL	00:18:07,999	00:18:09,279	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	The thing when he talks about
EDL	00:18:09,279	00:18:11,839	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	About the psychological impact of programs like
EDL	00:18:13,119	00:18:14,399	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Did getting a tattoo
EDL	00:18:15,423	00:18:17,215	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Make you feel safer
EDL	00:18:18,239	00:18:19,775	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Yes I guess so
EDL	00:18:19,775	00:18:21,567	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	I thought that I had done
EDL	00:18:21,567	00:18:25,151	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	The thing that was available to do to help in case of a
EDL	00:18:25,663	00:18:26,943	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	A total disaster
EDL	00:18:27,455	00:18:29,503	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	I thought I had done the right thing
EDL	00:18:29,503	00:18:35,903	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	But maybe more importantly it was just doing something that made her feel better it was hard to
EDL	00:18:35,903	00:18:42,303	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	To imagine the bigger picture I didn't envision myself

EDL	00:18:51,519	00:18:54,079	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	I never played that all out
EDL	00:18:54,847	00:18:56,127	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	She said she was way too busy
EDL	00:18:56,639	00:19:00,479	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	She was talking with her friends about boys or what they were going to do over the weekend

EDL	00:19:03,295	00:19:04,831	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Was much more attractive
EDL	00:19:05,343	00:19:07,903	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Otherwise would go crazy if we had to deal

EDL	00:19:12,255	00:19:14,047	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	What's a certain amount of stuff
EDL	00:19:14,047	00:19:17,375	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	I can't think about that you just got to keep going and do other things
EDL	00:19:18,399	00:19:21,727	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	I think that's that's one of the great capacities we have

EDL	00:23:53,600	00:24:00,000	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Why can't I play a game called global thermonuclear war
EDL	00:24:00,000	00:24:00,512	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Sounded
EDL	00:24:02,304	00:24:03,584	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Well here's the thing
EDL	00:24:04,352	00:24:06,912	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	In doing some of the research for this story

EDL	00:24:09,216	00:24:12,032	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Kinda sorta founded
EDL	00:24:12,032	00:24:12,800	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	If this
EDL	00:24:12,800	00:24:14,848	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Online simulator it's called
EDL	00:24:15,616	00:24:19,968	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	In which you can sing like the detonation of the nuclear weapon of your choice

EDL	00:24:55,552	00:25:00,416	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	I actually did the exact same thing as far as I can tell everyone that show this to like
EDL	00:25:00,416	00:25:02,464	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	They always immediately either nuke themselves

EDL	00:25:50,336	00:25:52,640	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Battery dropped pretty much right on Market Street
EDL	00:25:53,152	00:25:55,200	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	It's on 21st between Guerrero and
EDL	00:25:55,968	00:26:00,832	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Not that any of this is going to matter cuz it's a
EDL	00:26:00,832	00:26:02,624	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Beautiful red button it says detonate
EDL	00:26:06,464	00:26:07,232	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Pronounce
EDL	00:26:07,232	00:26:09,280	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Totaling up the estimated fatalities
EDL	00:26:09,792	00:26:12,352	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	At 1.5 million people
EDL	00:26:13,376	00:26:16,192	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	It has this inner blast radius that's all red
EDL	00:26:16,192	00:26:19,776	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Right in the matter but radius that reaches all the way to Antioch
EDL	00:26:19,776	00:26:20,544	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And then a
EDL	00:26:21,056	00:26:22,080	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	I guess this is like
EDL	00:26:22,080	00:26:22,848	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Radio app
EDL	00:26:22,848	00:26:25,152	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	A cloud that reaches wellpath Sacramento
EDL	00:26:25,152	00:26:26,176	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Yeah and
EDL	00:26:26,176	00:26:27,712	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And actually with these big
EDL	00:26:28,480	00:26:30,016	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	You can see
EDL	00:26:30,528	00:26:33,344	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	That outer red ring is I believe like
EDL	00:26:34,368	00:26:34,880	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Third degree
EDL	00:26:35,648	00:26:37,440	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Yeah chocolate is pretty much
EDL	00:26:37,440	00:26:39,232	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Going to take out the entire Bay Area
EDL	00:26:39,232	00:26:41,024	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Sounds like what you expected
EDL	00:26:42,048	00:26:44,096	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	This is what we think of nuclear war
EDL	00:26:44,096	00:26:45,376	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Look like
EDL	00:26:45,376	00:26:46,400	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Total devastation
EDL	00:26:46,400	00:26:47,424	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	You don't even need to be
EDL	00:26:47,424	00:26:48,192	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Close
EDL	00:26:48,192	00:26:52,288	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	People in the Central Valley might be okay but we here in Oakland right across the bay from SF
EDL	00:26:53,056	00:26:53,824	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	We're definitely
EDL	00:26:55,360	00:26:57,920	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	But we're actually valuable
EDL	00:26:58,432	00:27:00,736	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Is if you ship things up just a bit
EDL	00:27:00,736	00:27:02,528	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	So I might run the exact same simulator
EDL	00:27:03,040	00:27:06,368	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	But this time I want you to choose the bomb called
EDL	00:27:06,368	00:27:08,160	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Batman this was the bomb the United States drop
EDL	00:27:11,232	00:27:12,000	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	This is 20kg
EDL	00:27:13,024	00:27:13,536	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	There we go
EDL	00:27:16,864	00:27:17,632	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	All right
EDL	00:27:17,632	00:27:18,400	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Okay
EDL	00:27:19,680	00:27:21,728	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	San Francisco is in trouble still
EDL	00:27:22,240	00:27:23,264	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Are you talking about
EDL	00:27:23,264	00:27:24,544	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	70000 estimated
EDL	00:27:24,544	00:27:25,056	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Fatalities
EDL	00:27:25,824	00:27:26,592	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And
EDL	00:27:26,592	00:27:27,104	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	The
EDL	00:27:27,616	00:27:28,896	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	The air blast radius
EDL	00:27:29,408	00:27:30,432	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	It really reaches
EDL	00:27:31,200	00:27:33,760	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	You know only the 19th Avenue to the sunset
EDL	00:27:33,760	00:27:38,368	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	That's what I force you to that that's what kind of shocked me either original bombs that we think of Izzy's
EDL	00:27:39,392	00:27:40,928	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Destiny Wednesday are devastating
EDL	00:27:40,928	00:27:41,696	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Compared
EDL	00:27:41,696	00:27:42,208	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Hydrogen weapon
EDL	00:27:42,976	00:27:44,000	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Kind of shocking me
EDL	00:27:44,512	00:27:49,120	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And he even like if you calculate like the Shockwave that would like break windows
EDL	00:27:49,120	00:27:50,400	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	That Shockwave
EDL	00:27:51,424	00:27:52,704	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Doesn't even reach out
EDL	00:27:52,704	00:27:53,472	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	It doesn't even reach
EDL	00:27:54,496	00:27:57,056	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Egyptian cuz what you what you start to realize if he's smaller

EDL	00:28:00,128	00:28:03,456	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	They take out this big chunk from the center of a
EDL	00:28:03,968	00:28:06,784	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	It's just the shock everything outside the chunk
EDL	00:28:06,784	00:28:08,064	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Is convent
EDL	00:28:08,064	00:28:09,344	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	We need to
EDL	00:28:10,112	00:28:12,160	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	What is an contacts in point out that in terms of
EDL	00:28:12,160	00:28:18,560	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	This is still an incredible catastrophe minimize
EDL	00:28:18,560	00:28:21,120	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Those bombs were horrible and they killed a lot of people
EDL	00:28:21,120	00:28:22,144	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	But when you see
EDL	00:28:22,656	00:28:26,240	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	What some of the largest nuclear weapons the potential of them and
EDL	00:28:26,752	00:28:29,312	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	These smaller ones you realize that
EDL	00:28:29,312	00:28:31,360	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	This logic of survivability
EDL	00:28:31,360	00:28:32,640	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	It really isn't.
EDL	00:28:32,640	00:28:34,944	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Right right so yeah and it's really
EDL	00:28:35,712	00:28:36,736	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Helps demonstrate
EDL	00:28:36,736	00:28:39,040	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	This thing I always her just like we say in the story
EDL	00:28:39,808	00:28:41,088	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Hydrogen nuclear weapons
EDL	00:28:41,088	00:28:43,136	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Exponentially more powerful than conventional
EDL	00:28:44,672	00:28:50,048	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	But that doesn't really mean anything to me I was like hydrogen conventional whatever they're all bad
EDL	00:28:50,560	00:28:52,096	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	But in reality no
EDL	00:28:52,096	00:28:53,888	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	There is almost existential differ
EDL	00:28:54,656	00:28:55,680	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Any amount of Destruction

EDL	00:29:00,800	00:29:01,312	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Right
EDL	00:29:02,592	00:29:05,408	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Consequences for how we think about
EDL	00:29:05,920	00:29:06,688	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Nuclear threats
EDL	00:29:07,968	00:29:14,368	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Because people get real fatalistic about the bomb they say things like what could you do there's nothing to do it's not
EDL	00:29:14,368	00:29:15,648	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Not something I can deal with
EDL	00:29:15,648	00:29:16,928	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	It's not something I can do
EDL	00:29:16,928	00:29:18,464	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	So this is life Creator Alex

EDL	00:29:19,232	00:29:21,536	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	The professor nuclear history

EDL	00:29:23,328	00:29:25,632	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And also part of a project called Reinventing sibbald
EDL	00:29:26,912	00:29:27,680	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	He says
EDL	00:29:27,680	00:29:29,216	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	One reason he built the nuke map
EDL	00:29:30,240	00:29:32,800	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Is that we're still basically holding on to this late
EDL	00:29:32,800	00:29:35,360	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Cold War model assume you clear War at this
EDL	00:29:35,360	00:29:35,872	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Mobile app
EDL	00:29:37,152	00:29:39,968	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Why bother thinking about it cuz if it happens
EDL	00:29:39,968	00:29:42,016	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	We're all Dad it's like getting a rare disease
EDL	00:29:42,784	00:29:43,296	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Why worry
EDL	00:29:43,808	00:29:45,088	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And that becomes the
EDL	00:29:45,088	00:29:46,368	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	The excuse to
EDL	00:29:46,368	00:29:47,136	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Totally check
EDL	00:29:48,160	00:29:50,208	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And it's not just checking out of
EDL	00:29:50,720	00:29:55,072	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	If something happened to them but it's checking out for it being like a national policy
EDL	00:29:55,072	00:29:56,608	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Checking out on treaties
EDL	00:29:57,120	00:29:57,888	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Checking out on
EDL	00:29:58,400	00:30:00,448	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	You know what the president allowed to do that kind of thing
EDL	00:30:00,960	00:30:05,056	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And I really like people not to check out and I think the best
EDL	00:30:05,824	00:30:06,848	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Way to do it
EDL	00:30:06,848	00:30:09,664	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Is to get them to think about this more realistically
EDL	00:30:10,176	00:30:11,968	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Until what is realistic in the sky
EDL	00:30:12,736	00:30:15,040	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	What's not particularly like was not real
EDL	00:30:15,552	00:30:17,600	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	In the current geopolitical climate
EDL	00:30:17,600	00:30:21,696	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Is Russia bigger than China obliterating United States and half the world
EDL	00:30:21,696	00:30:22,208	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Thousands of
EDL	00:30:23,744	00:30:26,560	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Even though that's you know the scenario that most people
EDL	00:30:27,072	00:30:27,840	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Like to grab it
EDL	00:30:29,120	00:30:32,704	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	They have a hard time shifting into none of them were talking about
EDL	00:30:33,216	00:30:35,264	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Two or three detonations from North Korea
EDL	00:30:35,264	00:30:40,896	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Nation is not going to be dead and then if you do that it is a little stressful then maybe it should be right
EDL	00:30:41,408	00:30:43,968	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Because you you suddenly see it like oh
EDL	00:30:44,992	00:30:46,016	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	We should have a plan
EDL	00:30:46,528	00:30:48,320	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And this is where nukemap comes in
EDL	00:30:48,320	00:30:50,112	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Does it really helps convey the
EDL	00:30:50,112	00:30:50,624	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Proper size
EDL	00:30:51,648	00:30:53,952	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Cuz if you select for you know a North Korean side
EDL	00:30:54,464	00:30:55,744	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	That is one of the APA
EDL	00:30:56,512	00:30:58,304	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	You'll see it is larger than the Hiroshima bomb
EDL	00:30:59,840	00:31:01,632	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Marco's Rothman terms
EDL	00:31:01,632	00:31:02,400	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Kind of damage it does
EDL	00:31:02,912	00:31:03,936	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Compared to these large
EDL	00:31:04,704	00:31:05,472	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Okay
EDL	00:31:05,472	00:31:06,240	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	So weird
EDL	00:31:06,240	00:31:08,032	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Feeling that there will be a neck
EDL	00:31:09,312	00:31:11,104	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Hence the need for a plan
EDL	00:31:11,104	00:31:13,408	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	That totally makes sense so given this
EDL	00:31:14,176	00:31:14,688	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	What is
EDL	00:31:16,992	00:31:19,040	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Well the big thing in Alex's mind
EDL	00:31:19,808	00:31:23,392	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Now that we are once again presented with the possibility of these Limited
EDL	00:31:23,392	00:31:24,416	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Nuclear scenarios
EDL	00:31:25,184	00:31:28,000	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	We as a culture need to relearn civil defense
EDL	00:31:28,768	00:31:32,352	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Is that there are civil defense tactics you can find on the FEMA website like right now
EDL	00:31:32,352	00:31:33,888	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	In case of a nuclear attack
EDL	00:31:33,888	00:31:34,656	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Alex's work
EDL	00:31:35,168	00:31:38,496	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	With the Reinventing civil defense project is in part about how
EDL	00:31:39,008	00:31:41,312	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	We could maybe actively disseminate this information
EDL	00:31:41,824	00:31:44,384	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	In a way that everyday people won't look askance at it either
EDL	00:31:46,944	00:31:47,456	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Is Big Brother
EDL	00:31:48,736	00:31:49,504	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Normalizing you
EDL	00:31:51,040	00:31:51,808	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	If he thinks
EDL	00:31:51,808	00:31:52,832	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	The feasible fantastic
EDL	00:31:54,368	00:31:55,904	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And so what are the big things he'd like to
EDL	00:31:58,976	00:31:59,488	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Is
EDL	00:32:01,280	00:32:07,424	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Either hang of it in a very crude way this way if you're really too close to the weapon the nothing you do is going to matter and it's going to be over very fast
EDL	00:32:07,936	00:32:14,336	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	If you're really far away from the weapon you're going to say what was that no matter what you do because you're outside
EDL	00:32:14,336	00:32:15,616	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Picture of an in-between range
EDL	00:32:16,128	00:32:17,408	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Hours at work
EDL	00:32:17,408	00:32:19,968	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Ducking and covering in some situations
EDL	00:32:19,968	00:32:20,736	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Is
EDL	00:32:20,736	00:32:22,272	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Exactly the right thing to do
EDL	00:32:22,272	00:32:24,576	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And this is for all the reasons that were laid out in the main
EDL	00:32:25,088	00:32:28,160	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Which is avoiding direct exposure to radiation and heat protecting yourself
EDL	00:32:28,928	00:32:34,816	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Structural damage and shattering Windows which you can see on these new maps North Korean size weapon
EDL	00:32:35,328	00:32:39,424	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Even if you're relatively close to the epicenter you're much more likely to be in the zone of the Shockwave
EDL	00:32:39,936	00:32:42,496	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Most likely not going to be in the all-consuming
EDL	00:32:44,544	00:32:47,104	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Maybe the biggest takeaway from the nukemap simulator is what
EDL	00:32:48,384	00:32:48,896	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Fallout
EDL	00:32:49,408	00:32:51,712	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Because in this scenario where we survive from
EDL	00:32:52,480	00:32:53,504	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Over here in our
EDL	00:32:53,504	00:32:56,064	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Cushy confines vocalist
EDL	00:32:56,064	00:32:57,344	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Actually we're not out of the
EDL	00:32:57,344	00:33:00,416	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Prevailing winds come this way so we definitely have to deal with
EDL	00:33:01,440	00:33:02,464	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	In fact that's what
EDL	00:33:02,464	00:33:05,024	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Presents the most danger to the most people in Houston area
EDL	00:33:06,048	00:33:06,560	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	The smaller one
EDL	00:33:07,584	00:33:09,632	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	I'll just a few weeks I'll be out of this feature
EDL	00:33:09,632	00:33:13,216	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Which is kind of like Google Street View you can drop this little marker
EDL	00:33:13,216	00:33:16,800	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Anywhere on the map and tell it whether you're indoors or Outdoors or
EDL	00:33:16,800	00:33:17,568	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Basement
EDL	00:33:17,568	00:33:18,592	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Basically tell you
EDL	00:33:19,104	00:33:20,128	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	How okay
EDL	00:33:20,896	00:33:23,456	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Because you can see very starkly
EDL	00:33:23,968	00:33:26,016	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Oh I'm stuck on the freeway
EDL	00:33:26,016	00:33:29,088	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	I mean absorbance of this much radiation in this case
EDL	00:33:29,088	00:33:31,136	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	However if I had just stayed at home
EDL	00:33:31,648	00:33:38,048	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Then I cut it down to this much and if I go into a basement or someplace bigger while it's like basically nothing at all
EDL	00:33:38,048	00:33:41,120	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	You should run or shelter in place which is
EDL	00:33:41,632	00:33:42,400	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Important
EDL	00:33:42,400	00:33:43,680	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Right and you should almost
EDL	00:33:43,680	00:33:48,288	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Always shelter-in-place tagline is get inside stains
EDL	00:33:48,288	00:33:50,336	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Cuz even just being inside house
EDL	00:33:50,336	00:33:51,104	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	House will likely
EDL	00:33:51,104	00:33:51,616	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Please save your life
EDL	00:33:53,920	00:33:56,224	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	But in this case it turns out there are limits
EDL	00:33:56,224	00:33:57,248	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	What kind of advice
EDL	00:33:57,248	00:33:59,552	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	However well backed up by data and
EDL	00:33:59,552	00:34:00,064	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Nukemap
EDL	00:34:00,832	00:34:02,624	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Human beings are willing to except
EDL	00:34:02,624	00:34:04,160	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	That's pretty when it comes to advice
EDL	00:34:05,696	00:34:08,768	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Communication
EDL	00:34:09,280	00:34:10,048	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And in fact
EDL	00:34:10,560	00:34:12,096	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	My colleagues asked people
EDL	00:34:12,864	00:34:18,240	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	They actually told them what the right thing to do is and then ask them what they would do in a lot of them are like I go get my kids
EDL	00:34:18,240	00:34:24,640	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	If there was a bomb went off or a fire happens when it's like so much better for kids just stay in school where they are
EDL	00:34:24,640	00:34:25,664	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Am I impulsive
EDL	00:34:27,200	00:34:27,968	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Totally true
EDL	00:34:27,968	00:34:32,576	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Sadie you just ignore this and
EDL	00:34:33,088	00:34:35,904	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Well I mean I'd rather them let them than me
EDL	00:34:35,904	00:34:36,672	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	That's for sure
EDL	00:34:36,672	00:34:42,560	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	But it would be really hard to fight the impulse to not run to them no matter what I knew in terms of Common Sense
EDL	00:34:46,144	00:34:47,168	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	I'd like to believe that I
EDL	00:34:47,680	00:34:48,960	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Overcome that
EDL	00:34:49,728	00:34:50,496	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Maternal instinct
EDL	00:34:51,008	00:34:51,776	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Maybe once
EDL	00:34:51,776	00:34:58,176	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	But anyway
EDL	00:34:58,176	00:35:02,016	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Latin for everyone the next time a computer program like math
EDL	00:35:02,528	00:35:07,136	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Asked you if you want to play global thermonuclear war you should say yes
EDL	00:35:07,136	00:35:08,672	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	Absolutely nuke yourself
EDL	00:35:09,952	00:35:13,536	| 337_Atomic_Tattoos_pt_1 |	And it's actually the reasonable thing to do play at the simulation
