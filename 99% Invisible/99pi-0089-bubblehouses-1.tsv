EDL	00:08:16,383	00:08:17,663	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	It was still quite dark
EDL	00:08:18,175	00:08:19,711	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Because they were so many trees
EDL	00:08:19,711	00:08:22,271	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Kathy Miles grew up in one of the Falls Church bubble houses

EDL	00:08:35,839	00:08:36,863	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	It was dark and damp
EDL	00:08:37,375	00:08:37,887	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	And isolate
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:41,471	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	And I can remember coming up the street and there was
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:46,335	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	A a cleared area with still many trees and very little
EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:47,103	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Grass
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:47,871	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Tiffany
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:49,151	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	And there were Flagstone
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:49,663	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Sounds and there was this
EDL	00:08:52,735	00:08:53,247	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	House
EDL	00:08:53,759	00:08:55,295	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	It didn't look like a house to me at that time
EDL	00:08:55,807	00:08:56,575	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	But there was something
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:08:58,879	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Rising up from the ground
EDL	00:08:59,391	00:09:00,415	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	And it was white
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:00,927	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Enlarge
EDL	00:09:01,695	00:09:02,719	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Had two large lumps
EDL	00:09:03,487	00:09:05,279	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	And they were held together
EDL	00:09:05,279	00:09:05,791	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	In the middle
EDL	00:09:06,815	00:09:07,839	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	With a smokestack
EDL	00:09:08,607	00:09:14,751	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	And of course I was with my parents and I don't remember what they were telling me but I'm sure it was something
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:18,079	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	That we were going to live in this
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:19,871	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	New kind of house
EDL	00:09:19,871	00:09:22,687	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Do you remember what your mother's reaction wasn't
EDL	00:09:22,687	00:09:23,199	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Croissant
EDL	00:09:23,711	00:09:28,063	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Her over reaction was to stay calm and carry on
EDL	00:09:29,087	00:09:32,671	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	I think she was trying to make the best of it
EDL	00:09:33,183	00:09:35,231	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	And hoping that we wouldn't live there long
EDL	00:09:35,999	00:09:38,303	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Soda come to something that look like this
EDL	00:09:39,071	00:09:45,471	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	I think she was truly horrified The Falls Church community consisted of two single bubble houses
EDL	00:09:45,471	00:09:47,007	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	And 10 double bubble how
EDL	00:09:47,519	00:09:49,311	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Kathy lived in one of the Double Bubble
EDL	00:09:50,335	00:09:55,711	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	The double bubbles were made by connecting two smaller bubbles with a rectangular cinder block structure
EDL	00:09:55,711	00:09:57,247	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	That house the kitchen in the bathroom
EDL	00:09:57,759	00:09:59,807	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Kathy says that growing up an Igloo Village
EDL	00:09:59,807	00:10:00,831	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	But incredibly isolating
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:02,879	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Animator standout
EDL	00:10:03,391	00:10:04,159	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	One time
EDL	00:10:04,159	00:10:08,255	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	When she was in first grade I set out to draw a picture of my house
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:12,095	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	And of course we colored it and I couldn't color it because
EDL	00:10:12,095	00:10:14,911	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	I kept insisting there were no white crayons
EDL	00:10:15,423	00:10:16,191	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	And
EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:23,359	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	So when the teacher looked at it she kept saying it's trying to explain to me that I was supposed to draw the house
EDL	00:10:23,359	00:10:24,127	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	I lived it
EDL	00:10:24,895	00:10:27,455	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	And I kept saying I do live in this house
EDL	00:10:28,735	00:10:29,503	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	So
EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:35,391	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Finally I felt that I wasn't doing what I was supposed to and she clearly
EDL	00:10:35,903	00:10:36,671	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Had no idea what I was
EDL	00:10:37,695	00:10:39,743	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	And of course when we passed all the
EDL	00:10:39,743	00:10:40,511	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Houses
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:42,559	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Around to our friends to look at
EDL	00:10:42,559	00:10:43,327	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Pictures
EDL	00:10:43,327	00:10:44,351	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	The other children

EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:46,655	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	And
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:47,167	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Mets
EDL	00:10:49,983	00:10:51,007	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	So it was
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:54,847	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Pretty daunting as a and is in introduction to first grade
EDL	00:10:54,847	00:10:55,359	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	For me
EDL	00:10:55,871	00:10:59,967	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	And sometimes Cathy would be made to feel like an outsider in her own neighborhood
EDL	00:11:00,479	00:11:03,039	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	People were constantly driving into Igloo Village

EDL	00:11:10,207	00:11:11,999	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	All of us children
EDL	00:11:11,999	00:11:16,863	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	In the early days were uncomfortable with I think was that when we were outside playing
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:17,631	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	In the yards
EDL	00:11:18,143	00:11:20,191	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	People would drive up the street
EDL	00:11:21,471	00:11:24,031	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	And they again it was a dark
EDL	00:11:24,031	00:11:25,055	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Street with the cousin
EDL	00:11:25,055	00:11:25,567	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	To the trees
EDL	00:11:26,335	00:11:28,895	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	And they would drive up very slowly
EDL	00:11:28,895	00:11:31,967	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	And as even in the summer as they would come up the street
EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:34,015	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	They would roll
EDL	00:11:34,015	00:11:35,551	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	The windows of the car up
EDL	00:11:36,063	00:11:38,623	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	And they would all be pressed against the glass
EDL	00:11:39,135	00:11:40,415	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	And you would see them pointing
EDL	00:11:41,695	00:11:43,743	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	It was very much a
EDL	00:11:43,743	00:11:45,023	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Zoo like feeling
EDL	00:11:45,535	00:11:49,375	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	And I can even remember when I went to the zoo one time as a child
EDL	00:11:50,911	00:11:55,263	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	I remember thinking about how I felt when people were watching me
EDL	00:11:55,775	00:11:58,847	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	And I thought about how the animals were feeling
EDL	00:11:58,847	00:12:00,383	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	With us watching them
EDL	00:12:00,895	00:12:04,223	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	So it had that much of an effect that I was able to make that trance
EDL	00:12:04,223	00:12:04,991	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Esperance
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:06,271	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Life in the bubble house
EDL	00:12:06,271	00:12:08,063	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Was especially hard on Kathy's mom
EDL	00:12:08,575	00:12:10,367	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Because there were no straight walls
EDL	00:12:10,367	00:12:11,647	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Couldn't hang pictures
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:12,671	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Your family photos
EDL	00:12:12,671	00:12:14,719	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	And the circular rooms were difficult to furnish

EDL	00:14:01,471	00:14:03,007	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Standing there looking at it
EDL	00:14:03,007	00:14:06,079	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	I immediately thought of a passage I dread and Jeffrey heads book
EDL	00:14:06,847	00:14:07,615	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	The passage
EDL	00:14:07,615	00:14:09,151	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	What about this very house
EDL	00:14:09,151	00:14:11,711	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	One turns on to a small residential street
EDL	00:14:12,479	00:14:14,783	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Is confronted with a house that looks nothing like a
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:19,647	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	The fact that it has a front door and a few visible windows
EDL	00:14:20,415	00:14:22,719	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Only adds to its incongruous
EDL	00:14:22,719	00:14:23,231	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Presence
EDL	00:14:24,255	00:14:27,327	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Looking at the house which resembles a smooth mound of
EDL	00:14:27,327	00:14:27,839	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Hurst
EDL	00:14:28,607	00:14:32,703	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Feels as if some ancient space station has suddenly falling from the sky
EDL	00:14:33,471	00:14:34,751	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	And upon Landing
EDL	00:14:35,263	00:14:37,311	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	It has mysteriously embedded itself
EDL	00:14:37,311	00:14:38,335	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Into the wrong context
EDL	00:14:39,359	00:14:40,895	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	It's present so strange
EDL	00:14:41,407	00:14:43,967	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Seems to have traveled through both space and time
EDL	00:14:44,735	00:14:47,551	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	That passage was written by the artist Steve Roden
EDL	00:14:47,551	00:14:50,367	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Steve knows a lot about the Pasadena bubble house
EDL	00:14:50,367	00:14:51,903	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	The last 15 years
EDL	00:14:51,903	00:14:52,671	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	He's lived in it
EDL	00:14:55,231	00:14:58,303	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	The only reason why I drove out here to look
EDL	00:14:58,303	00:14:59,583	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	At the house with my wife
EDL	00:14:59,583	00:15:00,095	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Just because

EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:05,215	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	And that the image was so strange
EDL	00:15:05,983	00:15:08,799	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	And so when we turn the corner and
EDL	00:15:08,799	00:15:09,311	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Saw this
EDL	00:15:09,823	00:15:11,359	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Strange Brown Dome
EDL	00:15:11,359	00:15:12,639	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	In the middle oven
EDL	00:15:12,639	00:15:13,663	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Unbelievably
EDL	00:15:13,663	00:15:14,687	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Conservative neighborhood
EDL	00:15:15,199	00:15:16,479	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	It was sort of
EDL	00:15:16,479	00:15:16,991	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Looks like
EDL	00:15:18,015	00:15:19,807	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	What the hell is this
EDL	00:15:20,319	00:15:25,439	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Steve was fascinated by its history and all the surprises that come with living in a bubble
EDL	00:15:25,439	00:15:26,463	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Like the way the light moves
EDL	00:15:27,231	00:15:27,999	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	The curved surface
EDL	00:15:28,767	00:15:30,815	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	That's really cool in the living room at night
EDL	00:15:31,583	00:15:33,887	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Is when cars drive by the lights coming through
EDL	00:15:33,887	00:15:34,399	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Through the window
EDL	00:15:34,911	00:15:36,959	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Projects on the Dome form
EDL	00:15:37,471	00:15:40,287	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	It's like crazy cycle azarian or something Keynote
EDL	00:15:40,799	00:15:42,079	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	It's really amazing
EDL	00:15:42,079	00:15:45,919	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	None of the walls that separate a room in the house go all the way to the ceiling

EDL	00:15:53,599	00:15:54,623	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	But perhaps
EDL	00:15:54,623	00:15:57,439	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	The very most badass thing about living in a bubble
EDL	00:15:58,463	00:15:59,743	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Is the way sound travels through
EDL	00:16:00,255	00:16:01,791	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	It becomes a whispering eye
EDL	00:16:02,303	00:16:05,375	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	When Kathy Miles and her sister were growing up an Igloo Village
EDL	00:16:05,375	00:16:06,911	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	They also discovered this

EDL	00:16:08,447	00:16:09,215	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	In the wall
EDL	00:16:09,215	00:16:09,983	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	And they use them
EDL	00:16:10,495	00:16:11,775	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	SM secret messages to
EDL	00:16:12,799	00:16:18,431	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	I think early on my sister and I learned that if you stood in certain places you could hear people whispering
EDL	00:16:18,943	00:16:21,247	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	And if you stood in other places you couldn't
EDL	00:16:21,759	00:16:24,831	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	And I remember conducting experiments to see where we
EDL	00:16:24,831	00:16:26,367	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Best here and best not here
EDL	00:16:26,879	00:16:29,695	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Just depending on whether we wanted our parents to hear us
EDL	00:16:30,207	00:16:31,487	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Or we didn't want to be her
EDL	00:16:31,999	00:16:33,535	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Steve loves his bubble house
EDL	00:16:33,535	00:16:36,095	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	It doesn't have the same problems that plagued The Falls Church houses

EDL	00:16:41,983	00:16:47,615	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Given how much Steve loves his bubble when can argue that perhaps the bubble houses might have endured a different fate
EDL	00:16:47,615	00:16:51,199	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	If there are piloted here in California rather than Northern Virginia
EDL	00:16:51,711	00:16:53,759	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	But there are plenty of people who aren't sad

EDL	00:18:52,543	00:18:56,127	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Was based on the combination of Mediterranean and Spanish style
EDL	00:18:56,127	00:18:58,687	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Because Southern California has a Mediterranean climate with

EDL	00:18:59,967	00:19:01,759	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	These are the things the bubble house

EDL	00:19:03,039	00:19:05,599	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Be culturally relevant and adapt to the environment around it
EDL	00:19:06,367	00:19:12,767	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	This office was designed by an architect who spent his entire life designing buildings that did adapt to their environment and work

EDL	00:19:14,815	00:19:16,351	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	This building was designed

EDL	00:19:26,847	00:19:31,711	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Is Stefano why he thinks meth did this complete 180 when he created the bubble house
EDL	00:19:32,223	00:19:35,295	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Why he made something that was so antithetical to the rest of his work
EDL	00:19:36,063	00:19:38,623	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Stefanos thinks it had something to do with the birth of modernism
EDL	00:19:39,391	00:19:41,951	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	UCF was known for Spanish Colonial houses

EDL	00:19:49,631	00:19:52,959	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	But there was this new movement happening all around Neff
EDL	00:19:52,959	00:19:54,239	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Architects like Noah trailer
EDL	00:19:54,239	00:19:55,519	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Schindler and Frank Lloyd Wright
EDL	00:19:55,519	00:19:57,055	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	We're making simple boxes

EDL	00:19:58,847	00:19:59,615	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Lots of glass
EDL	00:20:00,127	00:20:02,687	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	They look nothing like next elaborate mansion
EDL	00:20:02,687	00:20:05,247	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	People were beginning to look at younger Architects Maybe
EDL	00:20:05,759	00:20:07,039	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	With what we know
EDL	00:20:07,039	00:20:11,135	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Wilder ideas and more relevance maybe the daily life and so on
EDL	00:20:11,647	00:20:14,463	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	You think it was sort of like a like a midlife crisis kind of thing
EDL	00:20:14,463	00:20:20,095	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	ProSource I mean I I think grade argue they continue to sync their entire life and
EDL	00:20:20,095	00:20:21,631	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	There comes a moment in which you look
EDL	00:20:21,631	00:20:24,703	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Look at the movement taking the world over it's like a wildfire
EDL	00:20:24,703	00:20:25,983	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	So you have to ask yourself
EDL	00:20:25,983	00:20:30,591	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Am I the wood doesn't burn or shall I become part of the Wind
EDL	00:20:30,591	00:20:33,151	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	But the modernists were not impressed with Nest bubble house
EDL	00:20:33,663	00:20:36,223	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Steve rodent the guy who lives in the Pasadena bubble house
EDL	00:20:36,735	00:20:38,783	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Tell me almost the same thing
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:40,319	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Young architects who are trying to like
EDL	00:20:40,831	00:20:42,879	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Bring modernism forward
EDL	00:20:42,879	00:20:43,903	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	No they thought he was
EDL	00:20:44,415	00:20:44,927	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Dilettante
EDL	00:20:45,951	00:20:50,559	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	You know and I think he was an outsider probably because he was hobnobbing with movie star
EDL	00:20:51,583	00:20:52,863	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	I mean imagine if like
EDL	00:20:53,887	00:20:58,239	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Barry Manilow started a metal bands not like anyone would take that seriously
EDL	00:20:58,751	00:21:00,287	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Right no matter how great it was
EDL	00:21:00,799	00:21:04,895	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Ironically great but you know like what if it was great
EDL	00:21:04,895	00:21:06,431	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	We none of us would buy into it
EDL	00:21:06,943	00:21:10,527	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	And I think that was part of his situation you know he wasn't
EDL	00:21:10,527	00:21:11,551	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Like a hipster
EDL	00:21:12,063	00:21:14,367	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Cute he wasn't an unknown crazy dude
EDL	00:21:14,367	00:21:15,647	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	He was a guy with a very
EDL	00:21:16,159	00:21:17,696	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Strong practice who
EDL	00:21:17,696	00:21:19,488	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Made giant houses for rich people
EDL	00:21:20,512	00:21:23,072	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	And yet that's never stopped believing in the bubble house
EDL	00:21:23,584	00:21:25,376	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	He continued to make variations on it
EDL	00:21:25,376	00:21:28,192	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Designing bubbles with straighter sides and flatter roofs
EDL	00:21:28,704	00:21:30,240	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Ones with big holes cut out of the side
EDL	00:21:31,008	00:21:33,824	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Even at the end of his life long after it was clear
EDL	00:21:33,824	00:21:35,872	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	The bubble house had no future
EDL	00:21:35,872	00:21:36,896	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	He saw it as when I was
EDL	00:21:36,896	00:21:38,176	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Greatest architectural
EDL	00:21:38,944	00:21:40,736	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	He believed in it so strongly
EDL	00:21:40,736	00:21:44,064	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Did he spent the end of his life living in a bubble house
EDL	00:21:44,064	00:21:44,832	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	In fact
EDL	00:21:44,832	00:21:46,880	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	He lived in the same house Steve Roden now live
EDL	00:21:49,696	00:21:53,280	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	I don't want to play the bubble house off as just some failed idea
EDL	00:21:53,280	00:21:56,864	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Navigate to be a symbol of a design inspired by the highest ideal

EDL	00:22:08,128	00:22:09,920	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Maybe the structure itself
EDL	00:22:09,920	00:22:12,480	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	The concrete show that house the idea was fly
EDL	00:22:12,992	00:22:15,040	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Maybe people don't want to live in bubbles
EDL	00:22:15,040	00:22:17,088	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	But their legacy deserves reflection
EDL	00:22:17,856	00:22:18,624	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	And so does meth
EDL	00:22:19,136	00:22:22,464	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	The guy invented a way to build houses out of air
EDL	00:22:22,976	00:22:25,024	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	That's being awesome
EDL	00:22:25,024	00:22:26,560	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	And hardly anyone knows about him
EDL	00:22:27,072	00:22:28,864	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	All the remains of his idea
EDL	00:22:28,864	00:22:30,656	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Is this one last bubble house

EDL	00:23:24,416	00:23:28,000	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Yeah they're hot and uncomfortable
EDL	00:23:28,000	00:23:29,024	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	But it's part of our heritage
EDL	00:23:29,536	00:23:30,048	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	So I'll never know
EDL	00:23:36,192	00:23:37,216	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	So it turns out
EDL	00:23:37,216	00:23:38,752	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	That it's just Americans

EDL	00:23:40,544	00:23:43,872	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Or at least Americans are the ones who can afford to have the choice
EDL	00:23:45,152	00:23:46,432	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Because bubble houses were
EDL	00:23:46,432	00:23:48,736	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	Cheap and required so little material
EDL	00:23:48,736	00:23:51,040	| 99pi-0089-bubblehouses-1 |	They were way more practical in the developing world
