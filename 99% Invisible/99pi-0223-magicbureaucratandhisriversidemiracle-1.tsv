EDL	00:05:48,159	00:05:51,743	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	Since the Great Depression when the program was first signed into law
EDL	00:05:51,743	00:05:53,791	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	Welfare had worked pretty simply
EDL	00:05:53,791	00:05:54,559	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	At least in theory

EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:34,751	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	But you really in the 1970s
EDL	00:06:34,751	00:06:35,775	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	In early 80s
EDL	00:06:35,775	00:06:39,871	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	Part of it had to do with the fact that more middle-class mothers were entering the workforce
EDL	00:06:40,383	00:06:43,455	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	So somewhere asking the question what about mothers on welfare

EDL	00:06:51,135	00:06:52,415	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	At least on and off
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:53,951	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	There was this persistent group of
EDL	00:06:54,463	00:06:55,743	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	Largely single mothers
EDL	00:06:56,255	00:06:59,583	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	Who stayed on welfare for long periods of time and it didn't work

EDL	00:07:04,447	00:07:05,215	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	And that
EDL	00:07:05,215	00:07:09,311	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	Small but persistent group of completely dependent welfare recipients
EDL	00:07:09,823	00:07:11,615	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	Started to get all this Focus
EDL	00:07:11,615	00:07:12,639	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	Lot of
EDL	00:07:12,639	00:07:17,247	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	Academic attention to this certainly a lot of attention in policy circles to
EDL	00:07:17,247	00:07:19,807	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	This problem of welfare dependency
EDL	00:07:19,807	00:07:24,671	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	The View was that you know what's key to changing this was to make
EDL	00:07:24,671	00:07:27,487	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	Changes in the welfare system which encourage people to work
EDL	00:07:27,487	00:07:29,279	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	But then the question was
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:30,047	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	How
EDL	00:07:30,047	00:07:32,863	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	Out in the suburbs of Riverside California
EDL	00:07:32,863	00:07:34,655	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	Larry Townsend had some ideas
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:38,495	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	And his County got a special waiver from state and federal authorities
EDL	00:07:39,007	00:07:40,543	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	To try some of those ideas
EDL	00:07:41,055	00:07:43,615	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	I was absolutely stunned that I was forgiven
EDL	00:07:43,615	00:07:45,407	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	Freedom to design a program
EDL	00:07:45,407	00:07:46,943	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	To implement a program
EDL	00:07:47,455	00:07:50,271	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	Higher the staff that are needed

EDL	00:07:56,159	00:07:56,671	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	Change
EDL	00:07:57,183	00:07:58,207	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	The concept of welfare
EDL	00:07:58,719	00:08:02,303	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	Larry's changes happened under a California pilot program

EDL	00:08:05,119	00:08:05,887	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	For Independence
EDL	00:08:05,887	00:08:09,727	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	See what the time in the 80s there was the standard welfare approach
EDL	00:08:09,727	00:08:11,775	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	Which is like you make less than x amount
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:13,055	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	And you get welfare check every month
EDL	00:08:13,567	00:08:19,967	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	And there were two basic Avenues counties could take to get more of their welfare families closer to Financial

EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:23,295	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	One was the Education and Training route
EDL	00:08:23,807	00:08:27,903	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	The idea here was to help for single moms who dolphin dropped out of high school
EDL	00:08:27,903	00:08:29,439	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	To get more skills
EDL	00:08:29,439	00:08:30,463	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	Maybe a GED
EDL	00:08:30,975	00:08:32,767	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	To fare better on the job market
EDL	00:08:32,767	00:08:34,303	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	But down in Riverside
EDL	00:08:34,303	00:08:37,119	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	Larry did not have much patience for that approach
EDL	00:08:37,119	00:08:38,143	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	His approach
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:39,167	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	Much simpler

EDL	00:23:58,976	00:24:01,280	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	But it's focused on Education and Training

EDL	00:24:09,472	00:24:11,264	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	Actually the effect reversed
EDL	00:24:11,264	00:24:13,568	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	Meaning the people who gotten more education

EDL	00:24:15,104	00:24:18,944	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	Rather than being told with buttons and songs and slogans

EDL	00:24:22,528	00:24:28,928	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	They were more likely to be still in work they were making slightly more money and less likely to return to welfare

EDL	00:24:39,168	00:24:41,216	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	The tactics and more to do with the fact that
EDL	00:24:41,728	00:24:43,008	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	In Riverside back then
EDL	00:24:43,008	00:24:45,568	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	It was a booming job market for low-skilled workers

EDL	00:24:55,552	00:24:56,320	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	Is it one
EDL	00:24:56,320	00:24:57,856	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	It's not going to change the fact
EDL	00:24:57,856	00:25:02,464	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	There are no job and by the late nineties there was a very very little of his kind of Labor
EDL	00:25:02,464	00:25:03,232	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	Even in Riverside
EDL	00:25:03,744	00:25:06,816	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	It turned out a better name for the Riverside Miracle might have been
EDL	00:25:06,816	00:25:08,864	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	It's not as catchy but maybe it's something like

EDL	00:25:10,912	00:25:12,448	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	Spike in the labor market
EDL	00:25:12,960	00:25:17,824	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	Was a fluke and
EDL	00:25:18,592	00:25:23,968	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	That's probably not going to get a sound bite the Riverside Miracle did not look like a miracle

EDL	00:25:34,208	00:25:37,280	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	Takes more than job clubs and songs that
EDL	00:25:37,280	00:25:39,840	| 99pi-0223-magicbureaucratandhisriversidemiracle-1 |	Did not get the same kind of media play
