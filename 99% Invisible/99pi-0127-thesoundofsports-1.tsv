EDL	00:17:57,247	00:17:58,527	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	I used to try to make it
EDL	00:17:58,527	00:18:01,599	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Fortune my mind that if you count for what to say say nothing

EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:47,583	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Is to have
EDL	00:19:47,583	00:19:48,607	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	And then
EDL	00:19:48,607	00:19:49,631	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	12 mics around the pitch
EDL	00:19:50,143	00:19:51,167	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Which you
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:53,215	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Trailer down at the ball moves up and down
EDL	00:19:53,983	00:19:55,519	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Another was chasing the ball around
EDL	00:19:56,031	00:19:57,823	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	So you can get the kicks from me
EDL	00:19:57,823	00:20:00,383	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Definition of a shopping list.
EDL	00:20:00,383	00:20:03,455	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	The difficult technique to get across to people who haven't done it before

EDL	00:20:17,535	00:20:19,839	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Personally I don't favor the system of fixed Michael
EDL	00:20:19,839	00:20:21,375	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	The bill describes
EDL	00:20:22,143	00:20:27,519	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	I prefer to use for roving operators who each point a directional microphone at the action
EDL	00:20:27,519	00:20:28,799	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	They follow the action
EDL	00:20:29,311	00:20:34,687	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	I believe this gives a better more defined kicks on and it's a method of use at the last four Olympics
EDL	00:20:34,687	00:20:37,247	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	And we use in London for the 2012 football dance
EDL	00:20:39,551	00:20:42,623	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	What you doing now is a game for the Athens Olympics in 2004
EDL	00:21:14,367	00:21:18,464	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Live Olympic Games I try to rush up the excitement and entertainment.
EDL	00:21:19,232	00:21:24,096	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	And certainly winter sports are fun because you're trying to convey a sense of speed and motion
EDL	00:21:26,400	00:21:28,192	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	I've always enjoyed the sound of bobsled
EDL	00:21:31,520	00:21:33,568	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Vancouver there were 44 cameras
EDL	00:21:34,080	00:21:40,224	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	At each camera position there was a distinctly different oral perspective and I was trying to put
EDL	00:21:40,224	00:21:43,040	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	The view or The Listener in the place of the athlete
EDL	00:21:45,344	00:21:47,904	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	And I made every camera position
EDL	00:21:47,904	00:21:48,928	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	A sound Zone
EDL	00:21:56,096	00:21:57,376	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Some people may say
EDL	00:21:57,376	00:21:59,424	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	284 microphones
EDL	00:21:59,424	00:22:00,704	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	What is a bit excessive
EDL	00:22:00,704	00:22:03,520	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	But you have to remember that every camera
EDL	00:22:03,520	00:22:06,080	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Perspective every visual perspective
EDL	00:22:06,080	00:22:09,920	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	For the viewing audience has a different sound texture and a different sound
EDL	00:22:37,312	00:22:43,712	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	It's like a piece of music that you just sit and listen to the crowd
EDL	00:22:43,712	00:22:46,784	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	You here like how it swells and Dives and
EDL	00:22:46,784	00:22:48,832	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Peaks and then suddenly burst
EDL	00:22:48,832	00:22:54,976	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Sounds to me like an orchestra
EDL	00:22:58,048	00:22:59,072	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	I'm Rob Nokes
EDL	00:22:59,072	00:22:59,840	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	I mean

EDL	00:23:19,040	00:23:20,064	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Capture the essence
EDL	00:23:21,088	00:23:21,856	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	The crowds
EDL	00:23:21,856	00:23:23,136	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	And the game itself
EDL	00:23:23,136	00:23:24,672	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	The sound of the basketballs
EDL	00:23:25,184	00:23:26,208	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	The sound of horses
EDL	00:23:26,208	00:23:29,280	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Does Hooves horses breeding players tackling each other
EDL	00:23:30,560	00:23:33,120	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	So they bring me in so that they can recreate
EDL	00:23:33,120	00:23:33,888	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	The feeling
EDL	00:23:33,888	00:23:36,704	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Have being really into that event when you see the movie
EDL	00:23:37,984	00:23:44,128	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	The game of their lives it was the greatest team in any sport I have ever seen
EDL	00:23:45,920	00:23:49,760	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	The game of their lives as a football movie about the 1950 US men's

EDL	00:23:54,368	00:23:55,136	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	In Brazil
EDL	00:23:55,136	00:23:57,440	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	And they went on to beat England
EDL	00:23:57,440	00:23:58,976	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Which was shocking at the time
EDL	00:23:58,976	00:24:01,536	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Because England was the best team in the planet and
EDL	00:24:01,536	00:24:03,328	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	America was probably
EDL	00:24:03,328	00:24:04,352	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	What are the worst teams
EDL	00:24:04,864	00:24:07,680	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	I was asked to go down the record football crowds
EDL	00:24:07,680	00:24:08,192	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	For the movie
EDL	00:24:08,704	00:24:12,544	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	In North America we don't have football cards that are that exciting
EDL	00:24:12,544	00:24:13,312	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	And
EDL	00:24:13,312	00:24:14,336	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Rambunctious
EDL	00:24:15,360	00:24:17,664	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	I went to Brazil and I recorded
EDL	00:24:17,664	00:24:19,968	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Football games I went to murambi
EDL	00:24:19,968	00:24:23,296	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Stadium to record a game between Brazil and Bolivia
EDL	00:24:23,296	00:24:24,320	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	And the crowd was
EDL	00:24:24,320	00:24:25,088	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Insane
EDL	00:24:32,000	00:24:36,608	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	I was just your move around stadium and listen for pockets of
EDL	00:24:36,608	00:24:38,912	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Chanting and cheering or loud fans
EDL	00:24:38,912	00:24:40,448	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	And listening for the energy
EDL	00:24:47,104	00:24:48,384	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	They are
EDL	00:24:48,384	00:24:50,176	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Out of their mind singing
EDL	00:24:50,176	00:24:51,712	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Huge 10-foot drums
EDL	00:24:58,880	00:25:04,512	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	When you can feel someone screaming in
EDL	00:25:05,024	00:25:06,816	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Their guts are coming out as they're yelling
EDL	00:25:07,328	00:25:09,888	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	That's going to translate when you hear it in the movie
EDL	00:25:09,888	00:25:13,216	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	I'm looking to record people that are really passionate and Intuit
EDL	00:25:13,728	00:25:15,520	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	And so I would set up near them
EDL	00:25:15,520	00:25:17,056	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	I had a handheld recorder
EDL	00:25:17,824	00:25:20,128	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	I try to not let them know I was recording
EDL	00:25:20,896	00:25:22,432	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	So I didn't want to change their

EDL	00:29:58,656	00:30:00,704	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	All the sudden impact of the target
EDL	00:30:03,264	00:30:05,056	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	That's a no-brainer in a little bit
EDL	00:30:05,056	00:30:08,640	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Show The Athlete is there getting ready but probably goes back to

EDL	00:30:10,176	00:30:10,944	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	I have
EDL	00:30:11,456	00:30:13,248	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	A memory of the sand
EDL	00:30:13,760	00:30:15,040	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	And I have an expectation
EDL	00:30:15,552	00:30:18,880	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	So I was going okay what would be really really cool and archery
EDL	00:30:18,880	00:30:20,416	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	To take it up a notch
EDL	00:30:20,416	00:30:21,440	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	And the obvious thing was
EDL	00:30:21,952	00:30:25,280	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	The sound of the arrow going through the air to the Target
EDL	00:30:27,840	00:30:28,608	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Lipozene
EDL	00:30:28,608	00:30:31,168	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	So we looked at a little thing the color boundary mic

EDL	00:30:38,848	00:30:41,920	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Hey it completely opened up the sound to something different
EDL	00:31:00,608	00:31:03,936	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	For some reason directors don't like to see the microphone
EDL	00:31:03,936	00:31:05,728	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	They do like hearing good sound
EDL	00:31:05,728	00:31:07,520	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	There is a resistance
EDL	00:31:07,520	00:31:09,312	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Can actually see microphones in the picture
EDL	00:31:09,824	00:31:13,152	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Which is one of the challenges that we have in the boundary microphone
EDL	00:31:13,152	00:31:14,688	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	I feel that challenge because youku

EDL	00:44:03,711	00:44:09,855	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Thought we go into a studio and sometimes will we create a boxing ring to do the defeat in the Falls

EDL	00:44:42,879	00:44:45,695	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	A body impact sounds get like a cracking rib type of sound
EDL	00:44:52,095	00:44:54,655	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	So all of those elements weed

EDL	00:44:57,727	00:45:02,335	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	And then
EDL	00:45:02,335	00:45:03,871	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Crossing the venues and
EDL	00:45:03,871	00:45:04,895	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Dress it all up
EDL	00:45:04,895	00:45:05,919	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	The whole
EDL	00:45:05,919	00:45:09,759	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Net effect of that is that it does feel fairly authentic
EDL	00:45:20,767	00:45:25,375	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Legendary
EDL	00:45:25,375	00:45:31,775	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	On the tennis game how Grand Slam Tennis

EDL	00:45:35,615	00:45:38,431	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Number of matches with different players
EDL	00:45:38,431	00:45:43,295	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	And different sizes of venues and just basically extract the crowd from there
EDL	00:45:43,295	00:45:49,439	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Anvil Mcenroe or the William sisters and shrieks and screams at tennis players do
EDL	00:46:00,703	00:46:05,567	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	I think it was Venus said wow you know it sounds just like me serving

EDL	00:46:25,791	00:46:29,375	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	This particular race was a half mile oval
EDL	00:46:29,375	00:46:30,655	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	And essentially
EDL	00:46:30,655	00:46:32,191	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	What would be considered a
EDL	00:46:32,703	00:46:34,239	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Football type Stadium
EDL	00:46:34,239	00:46:35,519	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	With very high banking
EDL	00:46:36,031	00:46:42,431	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	The cars put out a hundred forty decibels of sound maybe more than you put 40 of those cars on a half mile
EDL	00:46:42,431	00:46:43,199	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Call track
EDL	00:46:43,199	00:46:45,759	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	And it just sounds like a hornet nest
EDL	00:46:46,271	00:46:49,087	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	There's no real definition
EDL	00:46:49,087	00:46:55,231	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Then I was in the show is over and they're supposedly is the Roar of the crowd
EDL	00:46:55,743	00:46:59,327	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	But the producer screaming hot I can hear the cry. Near the crowd

EDL	00:47:11,871	00:47:12,639	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	I went back
EDL	00:47:12,639	00:47:19,039	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	To my home studio and I started pulling up some crowd samples and building different textures and things like that
EDL	00:47:19,039	00:47:23,903	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	So my next race yeah when they show the crowd that start sneaking some stuff in it
EDL	00:47:23,903	00:47:25,439	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	And when it came to the end of it
EDL	00:47:25,439	00:47:27,487	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	There's a very very nice crafts with

EDL	00:47:39,007	00:47:41,567	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	And then a week later he found out that I use this amp
EDL	00:47:41,567	00:47:43,359	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	And then I get a call if you're cheating

EDL	00:47:49,503	00:47:51,551	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Know the audience sees
EDL	00:47:51,551	00:47:52,063	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	The crowd
EDL	00:47:52,575	00:47:54,111	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	The audience has certain text

EDL	00:48:11,263	00:48:16,895	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	How because of the size of the course and this has been further complicated because it's the camera lenses have gone up
EDL	00:48:16,895	00:48:22,271	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Honor 10 Hunter 2000 3842 1 these cameras are able to see
EDL	00:48:22,783	00:48:25,599	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	A half a kilometer maybe McClung on the course
EDL	00:48:25,599	00:48:28,159	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	And how do you replicate that sound
EDL	00:48:28,671	00:48:31,487	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Essentially if you got cameras that are
EDL	00:48:31,487	00:48:35,071	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	That far apart from each other you're putting 20 or 30 microphones
EDL	00:48:35,071	00:48:36,351	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	To feel
EDL	00:48:36,351	00:48:38,143	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Is the athletes are coming to you
EDL	00:48:38,143	00:48:38,911	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Which is not
EDL	00:48:40,447	00:48:44,543	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	I am not a purist whatsoever in sound production
EDL	00:48:44,543	00:48:45,567	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	I truly believe
EDL	00:48:46,079	00:48:46,847	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Then what
EDL	00:48:46,847	00:48:48,639	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Ever the tool takes
EDL	00:48:48,639	00:48:52,479	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	To deliver a high-quality entertaining

EDL	00:48:53,759	00:48:54,783	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	It's all fair game
EDL	00:48:54,783	00:48:58,111	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	And that has caused some issues because I use samplers
EDL	00:48:58,623	00:49:00,159	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	What a sampler is
EDL	00:49:00,159	00:49:02,463	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	It's a keyboard is attached to
EDL	00:49:02,463	00:49:04,767	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Cecily a digital recorder
EDL	00:49:04,767	00:49:07,071	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	When you hit the key on the keyboard
EDL	00:49:07,583	00:49:08,607	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	It triggers
EDL	00:49:08,607	00:49:09,375	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	The sound
EDL	00:49:09,887	00:49:10,911	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Add to playback
EDL	00:49:11,423	00:49:15,263	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	And with the keyboard also triggers with sensitivity
EDL	00:49:15,263	00:49:17,311	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Means that if I hit the key
EDL	00:49:17,311	00:49:18,079	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Real hard
EDL	00:49:18,591	00:49:22,431	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Don't have a little bit more of a heart attack and you can vary the pitch
EDL	00:49:22,431	00:49:24,991	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	If I hit the Cenote that has a stamp
EDL	00:49:24,991	00:49:28,831	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	And then I hit a d note of the same sample it will be upstairs
EDL	00:49:29,343	00:49:30,367	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Sofas and get there

EDL	00:49:49,311	00:49:52,383	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	In Atlanta one of my biggest problems was rehling
EDL	00:49:53,663	00:49:55,711	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Rowing is a 2km course
EDL	00:49:56,223	00:49:56,991	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	They have
EDL	00:49:56,991	00:49:58,527	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	For Chase boats
EDL	00:49:58,527	00:50:00,831	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Following the rowers and they have a helicopter
EDL	00:50:01,343	00:50:03,647	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	That that's what they need
EDL	00:50:03,647	00:50:05,439	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	To deliver the visual
EDL	00:50:05,439	00:50:06,207	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Cover job
EDL	00:50:06,207	00:50:10,559	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Okay but the helicopter in the chase boat just completely wash out the Santa
EDL	00:50:10,559	00:50:12,607	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Don't no matter how bad the microphones are
EDL	00:50:12,607	00:50:15,167	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	You cannot capture you cannot reach
EDL	00:50:15,679	00:50:18,239	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	And isolate sound like you do
EDL	00:50:18,239	00:50:18,751	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Visual
EDL	00:50:19,263	00:50:20,543	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	But people have expectations
EDL	00:50:21,055	00:50:23,103	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Okay if you see the rollers
EDL	00:50:23,103	00:50:25,407	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	They have a sound that they're expecting
EDL	00:50:25,919	00:50:26,687	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	So what do we do
EDL	00:50:28,991	00:50:35,135	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	That afternoon we went out on a canoe with a couple of rowers and recorded stereo samples of the different
EDL	00:50:35,647	00:50:39,487	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Type of effects that would be somewhat typical of an event
EDL	00:50:43,327	00:50:47,423	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	And then we loaded those recordings into a sampler and play them back to cover the shots of the boats
EDL	00:50:48,703	00:50:54,847	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Australian something back from Great Britain

EDL	00:51:23,263	00:51:25,311	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Which is done off one of our driving cameras
EDL	00:51:25,311	00:51:26,079	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	What you have
EDL	00:51:26,591	00:51:27,871	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Engine noise in my case
EDL	00:51:27,871	00:51:33,247	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	So that's why you wouldn't want to microphone on that cuz I'll leave it here is it called reading out when they come around cussing
EDL	00:51:34,015	00:51:35,551	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Basically
EDL	00:51:35,551	00:51:37,343	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	The way you cover all that sort of stuff
EDL	00:51:37,343	00:51:39,135	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Is to run a tape
EDL	00:51:39,647	00:51:42,463	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Which has the sound of horses galloping
EDL	00:51:42,463	00:51:44,767	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Which is actually if I remember rightly
EDL	00:51:44,767	00:51:50,911	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	A slowed-down buffalo charge
EDL	00:51:51,935	00:51:54,239	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	If that doing hurdles she will have

EDL	00:51:55,263	00:51:56,287	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Which has
EDL	00:51:56,287	00:52:02,687	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	The sound of somebody falling through hatch
EDL	00:52:02,687	00:52:07,295	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Through or over hopefully the Huddle UIC fade this up

EDL	00:52:08,831	00:52:12,415	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Very level a little bit so it sounds like several of his going through together
EDL	00:52:12,927	00:52:19,327	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	That's pretty much
EDL	00:52:19,327	00:52:22,655	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Start playing the same recorded Live use for you
EDL	00:52:26,751	00:52:32,895	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Some horse racing events sound strange to me cuz they have this constant thundering sound and I can't tell if it's real or not
EDL	00:52:33,407	00:52:38,015	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	It's like in horse racing movies like
EDL	00:52:38,527	00:52:44,671	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Seabiscuit and all hat you can hear the jockeys yelling and screaming at each other when they get
EDL	00:52:45,183	00:52:51,327	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	On a turn you hear the whips gone
EDL	00:52:57,983	00:53:02,335	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	I recorded an Arabian horse
EDL	00:53:02,335	00:53:04,895	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Arabians have a different gate than thoroughbred

EDL	00:53:17,695	00:53:18,463	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	With a rope
EDL	00:53:18,463	00:53:24,863	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	We want to control the movement cuz we have $12,000 in gear on the horse

EDL	00:53:33,311	00:53:39,199	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Being charged for the sound of a real event
EDL	00:53:39,199	00:53:44,319	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	I would want to do like the Kentucky Derby and use microwaves around the track

EDL	00:53:49,951	00:53:56,351	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	And have Mike's on the gate
EDL	00:53:56,351	00:54:02,751	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Horse racing fans bigger

EDL	00:54:27,583	00:54:31,167	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	So what we do is we use the real sign of the Dawn
EDL	00:54:31,167	00:54:32,959	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Hitting the ball to trigger some samples
EDL	00:54:33,471	00:54:39,871	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	And we play around with Kick Drum the snare drums been spoiling everything else we can find an 8-8 just
EDL	00:54:39,871	00:54:42,687	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	A bit of fun ready to what kind can I get a bit repetitive

EDL	00:54:50,367	00:54:51,647	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	It's not real but it's not on
EDL	00:54:51,647	00:54:54,719	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	That's something that I think most of us involved in sport
EDL	00:54:54,719	00:54:56,767	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Trying to try and humps the experience
EDL	00:54:57,535	00:55:00,863	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	We tread the Middle Road between what's real and what's unreal
EDL	00:55:03,935	00:55:08,031	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	If you're sitting at the side of a basketball court from the TV point of view
EDL	00:55:08,031	00:55:12,383	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	The Producers want to hear the ball as it goes through the net the swishing of the net
EDL	00:55:13,407	00:55:19,807	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	And that's certainly something that you do not ever hear in the basketball arena do you only hear that on TV because
EDL	00:55:19,807	00:55:20,319	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	This exciting
EDL	00:55:20,831	00:55:27,231	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Samuel L Jackson became tfboys and you became men
EDL	00:55:27,231	00:55:30,303	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Coach Carter
EDL	00:55:30,303	00:55:34,143	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	For a Coach Carter the supervising sound editor wanted me to get the sound
EDL	00:55:34,655	00:55:36,191	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Of the basketball
EDL	00:55:36,191	00:55:36,959	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	But he wanted
EDL	00:55:37,471	00:55:40,031	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	There's a pain I don't know if you ever heard of basketball
EDL	00:55:40,031	00:55:41,311	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	When you bounce it goes
EDL	00:55:41,311	00:55:41,823	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Bounce
EDL	00:55:42,847	00:55:43,871	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	It kind of has this
EDL	00:55:43,871	00:55:44,895	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Hi Arie ring
EDL	00:55:45,407	00:55:48,991	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	We did this great room stuff like Rim slams Rim head
EDL	00:55:48,991	00:55:52,063	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Net wishes and then we're trying to capture the sound of the
EDL	00:55:52,063	00:55:54,111	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	This pain and we are right under the net
EDL	00:55:54,111	00:55:59,231	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	And I'm like no that's not it it just sounds like the big side of a basketball and the Reverb in the room
EDL	00:56:00,255	00:56:02,559	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	But then we went into the corner of the room
EDL	00:56:02,559	00:56:05,119	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	And I got elevated on the bleachers
EDL	00:56:05,631	00:56:12,031	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	And iPad my microphone above the ball and the guy slam the ball on the ground and then as the ball was coming up to
EDL	00:56:12,031	00:56:13,567	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	To my microphone you hear that
EDL	00:56:13,567	00:56:14,079	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	The Ping
EDL	00:56:19,711	00:56:23,295	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	I've always taken the approach to record the sound
EDL	00:56:23,295	00:56:25,599	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Documentary-style like accurate
EDL	00:56:25,599	00:56:28,415	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	And then I tried to then find the next level up
EDL	00:56:28,415	00:56:29,695	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	To go hiking reality
EDL	00:56:30,207	00:56:31,743	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Sometimes you actually have to
EDL	00:56:31,743	00:56:33,791	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Cheetah sound even bigger to make a cake
EDL	00:56:33,791	00:56:34,303	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Cut through
EDL	00:56:35,071	00:56:37,375	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	The thing that Hollywood does differently is
EDL	00:56:37,887	00:56:38,911	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	It sounds huge
EDL	00:56:39,679	00:56:41,983	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	The movie sound big they sound rich
EDL	00:56:42,495	00:56:44,287	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	It's definitely more the app

EDL	00:56:45,311	00:56:47,103	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Just think Fast and Furious order
EDL	00:56:47,103	00:56:47,871	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Die Hard
EDL	00:56:48,639	00:56:52,991	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	As we've been doing this over the years sort of emulating broadcast and enhancing a
EDL	00:56:53,503	00:56:56,575	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	The broadcasters have been listening to what we've been doing
EDL	00:56:57,087	00:56:57,855	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	And
EDL	00:56:57,855	00:57:00,415	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Then using our techniques back
EDL	00:57:00,415	00:57:01,695	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	In the actual broadcast
EDL	00:57:08,351	00:57:09,119	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Broadcast
EDL	00:57:14,751	00:57:20,639	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Push up the witches on the bats what they do now

EDL	00:57:22,431	00:57:23,967	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Now versus 10 years ago
EDL	00:57:28,831	00:57:31,135	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Because they have mic located very close
EDL	00:57:31,135	00:57:32,159	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Capital sound
EDL	00:57:33,695	00:57:36,511	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Many years ago the Olio that people would have been used to
EDL	00:57:36,511	00:57:39,071	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Expecting from the Philippines
EDL	00:57:39,583	00:57:41,887	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Where I can I expect to hear every kick

EDL	00:57:44,447	00:57:48,287	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	Cuz that's what they get used to hearing on video games on films of being posted
EDL	00:57:48,799	00:57:51,103	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	So we're always trying to match my Solace and

EDL	00:58:18,495	00:58:20,031	| 99pi-0127-thesoundofsports-1 |	And one thing that makes me very happy
