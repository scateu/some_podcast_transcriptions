EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:45,087	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	They really haven't been sufficient to feed so many soldiers in so many different locations
EDL	00:05:45,087	00:05:47,647	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	In so many different climates and conditions
EDL	00:05:47,647	00:05:51,743	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	The military had been unprepared to feed their soldiers during World War II
EDL	00:05:51,743	00:05:53,279	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	The government said
EDL	00:05:54,815	00:05:55,839	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	We don't ever want to
EDL	00:05:58,399	00:06:00,703	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	Just horrible to have to ramp up
EDL	00:06:00,703	00:06:01,471	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	So let's
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:02,495	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	Maintainer cell
EDL	00:06:03,007	00:06:05,055	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	In a state of preparedness
EDL	00:06:05,823	00:06:09,151	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	And so preparedness became policy after World War II
EDL	00:06:09,919	00:06:10,943	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	The support that
EDL	00:06:10,943	00:06:14,015	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	They created a system of 700 Federal Laboratories
EDL	00:06:14,527	00:06:17,087	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	All devoted to developing military Technologies
EDL	00:06:17,599	00:06:23,999	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	And one of them is the Natick Soldier systems center outside of Boston
EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:30,399	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	Pretty much like Suburbia with the exception of the
EDL	00:06:30,399	00:06:36,799	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	Intense electric fence except for that barbed wire fence
EDL	00:06:36,799	00:06:38,591	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	Shenzhen the guard posted at the gate
EDL	00:06:38,591	00:06:41,663	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	The Natick Soldier systems center looks like a normal office
EDL	00:06:42,175	00:06:46,271	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	But this Office Park is the epicenter of the modern military diet
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:48,575	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	Is the home of the combat feeding Direct
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:50,879	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	Which has been here since the 1950
EDL	00:06:51,391	00:06:56,511	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	First of all can I have you introduced yourself to me secretly I'm Steven Moody the director of combat feeding
EDL	00:06:57,023	00:06:58,047	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	I hear at the Natick Soldier
EDL	00:06:58,559	00:07:00,095	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	Development and engineering center
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:04,959	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	Steven showed me how military food technology has evolved over time
EDL	00:07:04,959	00:07:05,983	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	Ken's for instance
EDL	00:07:06,495	00:07:09,311	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	Since been replaced by flexible lined pouches
EDL	00:07:09,823	00:07:16,223	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	Because can they're bulky and heavy troops have been eating their meals out of those pouches
EDL	00:07:16,223	00:07:18,015	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	And what are called MREs
EDL	00:07:18,015	00:07:19,295	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	Meals ready to eat
EDL	00:07:20,063	00:07:24,159	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	The first MRE contain a lot of freeze-dried components
EDL	00:07:24,159	00:07:27,487	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	A freeze-dried meat Patty that you would have to add water to
EDL	00:07:27,487	00:07:29,279	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	And then heated and
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:31,839	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	Having having eaten a few of those in my time
EDL	00:07:31,839	00:07:38,239	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	As an active-duty soldier at you had to get it just right it was always either a little bit too soggy or a little bit crunchy at the end of
EDL	00:07:38,239	00:07:44,639	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	The combat feeding directorate has been tasked with overcoming certain challenges inherent in
EDL	00:07:44,639	00:07:45,407	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	In food
EDL	00:07:45,407	00:07:45,919	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	It's spoiled
EDL	00:07:46,431	00:07:47,199	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	It grows more
EDL	00:07:47,711	00:07:48,479	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	It loses flavor
EDL	00:07:48,991	00:07:55,391	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	And if you're trying to feed a vast number of people in climates ranging from the desert to the human jungle over long.
EDL	00:07:55,391	00:07:56,159	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	The time
EDL	00:07:56,159	00:08:00,767	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	You have to figure out ways of making food that will avoid its natural tendency to go bad
EDL	00:08:01,535	00:08:02,303	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	So
EDL	00:08:02,303	00:08:05,887	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	The combat feeding directorate has whole teams of microbiologist
EDL	00:08:05,887	00:08:06,911	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	Engineers
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:09,983	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	Leather scientists working to extend the lives of food
EDL	00:08:10,495	00:08:13,311	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	Food engineering preservation and stabilization for instance wood
EDL	00:08:13,823	00:08:19,199	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	Be the ones that would would try to figure out how to make that product shelf-stable for
EDL	00:08:19,711	00:08:20,735	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	Two three
EDL	00:08:20,735	00:08:23,807	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	5 years five years without Refrigeration exact
EDL	00:08:24,575	00:08:26,623	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	And then there's the little detail of
EDL	00:08:26,623	00:08:27,391	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	Taste
EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:29,695	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	Making the stuff actually palatable
EDL	00:08:30,207	00:08:35,071	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	The modern MRE has come a long way from that chewy freeze dried meat Patty
EDL	00:08:35,071	00:08:37,887	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	Today's high-tech pouches come with another pouch
EDL	00:08:37,887	00:08:42,495	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	Instead chemically heats the ration the US military now offers 24 different entrees
EDL	00:08:42,495	00:08:45,311	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	It's from cheese tortellini to lemon pepper tuna
EDL	00:08:45,823	00:08:46,335	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	2
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:47,615	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	Jambalaya
EDL	00:08:48,127	00:08:50,175	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	Jambalaya for instance
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:52,991	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	Trying to make sure that jambalaya Atwood would laugh
EDL	00:08:52,991	00:08:53,503	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	4
EDL	00:08:54,015	00:08:59,135	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	3 years at 80° in a pouch is a challenge so we we tweaked the spices
EDL	00:08:59,135	00:09:05,023	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	Tweak the ingredients so that we can make sure that the flavor is optimal at the end of the shelf life
EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:06,047	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	As well as the beginning
EDL	00:09:06,047	00:09:11,167	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	So that Soldier on a mountain in Afghanistan can enjoy a flexible pouch
EDL	00:09:11,167	00:09:12,447	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	3 year old jambalaya
EDL	00:09:13,215	00:09:14,751	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	I mean that's the goal
EDL	00:09:15,519	00:09:18,591	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	But it's not always the reality when you open an MRE
EDL	00:09:18,591	00:09:21,663	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	That it was I just like this gelatinous BBQ Beef
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:26,527	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	Does pungent smell to it Louisiana native Ben Armstrong spent five years in the Marine Corps
EDL	00:09:27,039	00:09:29,855	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	Don't even get him started on the jambalaya MRE
EDL	00:09:30,367	00:09:32,415	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	For a Louisianan
EDL	00:09:33,183	00:09:33,695	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	I'll never try
EDL	00:09:34,207	00:09:38,559	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	Into the military isn't just working on MREs they're also trying to blow up foods that
EDL	00:09:38,559	00:09:39,839	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	Look and taste more like
EDL	00:09:41,119	00:09:42,143	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	You know what you
EDL	00:09:42,143	00:09:43,935	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	Eat it 3 a.m.
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:48,031	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	You're like really really hungry and your judgment is somewhat
EDL	00:09:48,799	00:09:49,823	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	Impaired
EDL	00:09:50,335	00:09:51,615	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	We actually took
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:56,991	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	Something like a Hot Pocket that you find in the freezer at the grocery store and made one that was shelf-stable
EDL	00:09:57,759	00:10:00,831	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	And we did that by controlling the water activity and the
EDL	00:10:00,831	00:10:02,111	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	The pH of the
EDL	00:10:02,111	00:10:03,391	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	Components within the product
EDL	00:10:03,903	00:10:06,719	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	So that they wouldn't allow bacteria to grow
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:09,791	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	They packaged it up with something called an oxygen scavenger
EDL	00:10:10,303	00:10:13,887	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	A little packet of iron filings that absorbs oxygen
EDL	00:10:13,887	00:10:17,471	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	Keeping it away from the bread from old wouldn't grow on the bread
EDL	00:10:17,471	00:10:20,031	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	And we designed hurdles to each
EDL	00:10:20,031	00:10:21,567	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	Step within the process
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:23,103	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	That might allow spoilage
EDL	00:10:23,103	00:10:27,455	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	To the point where we now have a sandwich that will last for 3 years at room temp
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:31,551	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	And this leads us to the Holy Grail of military food diet
EDL	00:10:32,063	00:10:34,367	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	An item that soldiers have been requesting
EDL	00:10:34,879	00:10:36,415	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	Since time immemorial
EDL	00:10:37,183	00:10:37,695	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	Pizza
EDL	00:10:38,207	00:10:39,999	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	Pizza that is shelf stable
EDL	00:10:39,999	00:10:40,767	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	For three years
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:45,887	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	This is a pilot plant even took me inside a massive industrial kitchen
EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:48,447	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	Full of giant kettles mixers ovens
EDL	00:10:48,959	00:10:51,519	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	I see a worker and a lab coat and hairnet
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:53,567	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	Standing over an enormous pot
EDL	00:10:53,567	00:10:54,847	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	Stirring vigorously
EDL	00:10:57,663	00:10:59,967	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	In another corner of the pilot plan
EDL	00:10:59,967	00:11:02,527	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	A different worker is slicing up a pizza topping
EDL	00:11:02,527	00:11:03,295	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	Bad at first
EDL	00:11:03,807	00:11:05,087	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	I thought I misheard
EDL	00:11:05,599	00:11:08,159	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	Did you call this as Maroni
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:09,951	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	Asma Rani
EDL	00:11:09,951	00:11:10,719	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	Cosmo room
EDL	00:11:10,719	00:11:13,791	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	Is Moroni or osmotic pepperoni looks
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:16,095	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	Like a roll of toilet paper made of meat
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:19,167	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	Athena sheet of beef rolled up
EDL	00:11:19,167	00:11:21,983	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	The layer of plastic to prevent it from sticking to itself
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:25,311	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	It's preserved using osmotic dehydration
EDL	00:11:25,311	00:11:28,639	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	The technology basically involves running thin sheets of meat
EDL	00:11:28,639	00:11:29,663	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	Special water bath
EDL	00:11:30,431	00:11:32,479	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	It removes water from the meat itself
EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:32,991	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	Preserving it
EDL	00:11:35,039	00:11:40,671	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	Oh I probably somebody just serve me that I would not have even questioned what it was
EDL	00:11:40,671	00:11:46,815	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	It tastes like pepperoni I would probably increase the amount of pepperoni flavor but those are some of the things that were working on
EDL	00:11:46,815	00:11:52,191	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	The Army is a mean to have shelf-stable pizza in combat zone by 2017
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:53,215	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	And maybe
EDL	00:11:53,215	00:11:54,239	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	Soon after that
EDL	00:11:54,239	00:11:55,775	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	In your local grocery store
EDL	00:11:55,775	00:11:58,335	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	This is another part of the combat feeding directorate
EDL	00:11:58,847	00:12:01,151	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	Ever since its Origins after World War II
EDL	00:12:01,919	00:12:07,295	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	When the military decided it needed to create a back-up plan to feed troops in the event of a sudden War
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:12,415	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	And so the US government made it a requirement for these labs to share their findings with the commercials
EDL	00:12:12,927	00:12:14,463	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	What we trying to do
EDL	00:12:14,463	00:12:18,303	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	When we come up with a new technology is make sure that it's not military specific
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:23,167	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	So that there are commercial applications for a 10 and that can only help us
EDL	00:12:23,167	00:12:24,703	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	With economies of scale
EDL	00:12:24,703	00:12:28,799	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	If something is military unique and it's only produced for the US Military
EDL	00:12:28,799	00:12:30,847	| 99pi-0186-warandpizza-1 |	The cost of going to be a lot higher than ever
