EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:45,343	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	And if they were drawn on land they usually drag their fat tail behind them
EDL	00:05:45,343	00:05:45,855	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	As they walked
EDL	00:05:46,367	00:05:47,647	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	That's where we were
EDL	00:05:48,159	00:05:49,439	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	In the early 1960
EDL	00:05:50,463	00:05:52,255	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Dinosaurs were sad
EDL	00:05:52,255	00:05:55,071	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Cold blooded dead-ends in the history of life
EDL	00:05:56,607	00:06:01,727	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	But paleontology was about to go through a spectacular and
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:04,031	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Unanticipated u-turn
EDL	00:06:04,543	00:06:06,335	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	And a young Bob Barker
EDL	00:06:06,335	00:06:07,359	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Just off to college
EDL	00:06:07,359	00:06:09,407	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Would find himself right in the thick of the app
EDL	00:06:10,431	00:06:11,455	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Freshman year
EDL	00:06:11,967	00:06:14,783	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	The Yale geology Department took me
EDL	00:06:14,783	00:06:15,807	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Bunch of other freshmen
EDL	00:06:15,807	00:06:16,575	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Today
EDL	00:06:17,087	00:06:20,927	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	The trip out west was led by one of Bob's professors at Yale
EDL	00:06:20,927	00:06:22,719	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	A paleontologist named John AUST
EDL	00:06:23,231	00:06:25,023	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	And among other things we dug up
EDL	00:06:25,023	00:06:25,791	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	4 wraps
EDL	00:06:26,303	00:06:28,351	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	They were a new species of raptor
EDL	00:06:28,351	00:06:30,399	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	That Professor Austin named Deinonychus
EDL	00:06:30,911	00:06:32,703	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Terrible claw
EDL	00:06:32,703	00:06:35,263	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	And the bones were found really close together
EDL	00:06:35,263	00:06:36,287	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Assimilate
EDL	00:06:36,287	00:06:39,615	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	They live together that were pack maybe intelligent
EDL	00:06:39,615	00:06:43,711	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	But what really got Professor awesome excited was the anatomy of the skeleton
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:50,623	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	After studying the fossil remains back at Yale also concluded that
EDL	00:06:50,623	00:06:51,135	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Swamp creature
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:53,183	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Nippon fleet-footed
EDL	00:06:53,183	00:06:55,231	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Agile and extremely active
EDL	00:06:55,743	00:06:58,303	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Ocean began to argue that if you really looked
EDL	00:06:58,303	00:06:59,839	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Did the anatomy of many dinosaurs
EDL	00:07:00,351	00:07:02,399	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	They look less like Mom brain lizards
EDL	00:07:02,911	00:07:04,959	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	And more like super atleta
EDL	00:07:04,959	00:07:05,471	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Like birds
EDL	00:07:05,983	00:07:09,055	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	And his student Bob Bakker found this idea really compelling
EDL	00:07:09,567	00:07:13,407	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Members looking at a skeleton of a different dinosaur called
EDL	00:07:14,175	00:07:17,247	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Ready to look like a roadrunner with a long ponytail
EDL	00:07:17,247	00:07:18,783	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	But wow
EDL	00:07:18,783	00:07:19,551	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Just spoke
EDL	00:07:20,063	00:07:20,831	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Sylheti
EDL	00:07:21,599	00:07:23,903	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	But then you read the text books and I'm supposed to believe that
EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:27,487	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	As an undergraduate Bakker dissected modern animal
EDL	00:07:27,487	00:07:29,791	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	In an effort to better understand dinosaur musculature
EDL	00:07:30,303	00:07:33,375	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	He concluded that the old stereotypes about
EDL	00:07:33,375	00:07:35,423	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Stupid sluggish dinosaurs
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:36,959	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Didn't hold up
EDL	00:07:36,959	00:07:38,495	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	They weren't slowing
EDL	00:07:38,495	00:07:39,007	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Sloppy
EDL	00:07:40,799	00:07:43,103	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Now this idea wasn't totally new
EDL	00:07:43,615	00:07:47,967	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Packer says that for decades going back as early as the mid-nineteenth century
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:51,039	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	There have been people saying that dinosaurs were
EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:52,319	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Smart active
EDL	00:07:52,319	00:07:53,087	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	And bird like
EDL	00:07:53,599	00:07:54,367	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	But
EDL	00:07:54,367	00:07:55,135	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	These
EDL	00:07:55,135	00:07:55,647	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Facts
EDL	00:07:56,159	00:07:58,207	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	We're forgotten about really sweet
EDL	00:07:58,719	00:07:59,999	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Dropped out of textbooks
EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:03,071	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	So Bakker decided to publish a paper in a Yale Journal
EDL	00:08:03,071	00:08:04,351	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	And his editor says
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:05,631	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	I know what you should call
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:07,167	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	The study and I said what
EDL	00:08:07,167	00:08:08,703	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	She said you should call it
EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:09,983	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	The superiority
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:11,007	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Dinosaurs
EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:11,775	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Yeah
EDL	00:08:13,311	00:08:15,871	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	They weren't The evolutionary hasbeens
EDL	00:08:16,383	00:08:17,919	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	They weren't dead ends in the
EDL	00:08:17,919	00:08:18,687	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Flow
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:20,223	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Of darwinian process
EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:22,271	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Top-of-the-line big beat everybody
EDL	00:08:24,319	00:08:29,951	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	But convincing people that dinosaurs were actually totally different than they had been depicted the past 60 years
EDL	00:08:29,951	00:08:32,767	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	It's going to require more than a few good academic papers
EDL	00:08:33,279	00:08:35,071	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	The really change people's minds
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:37,119	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Sometimes you gotta show
EDL	00:08:37,119	00:08:37,887	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Instead of tell
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:41,983	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	And remember Bakker was a skilled illustrator as well as a scientist
EDL	00:08:42,495	00:08:44,543	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	And so when John Ostrom wrote his
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:46,591	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Definitive paper on Deinonychus
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:48,639	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Deus Bakr to do the illustration
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:51,711	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	And I positioned the bones as if
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:53,759	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Kids Raptor
EDL	00:08:53,759	00:08:54,271	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	What's running
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:57,855	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	In the picture of the Raptor is nearly parallel with the ground
EDL	00:08:57,855	00:09:00,671	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Is left leg springing forward it's right leg curl
EDL	00:09:00,671	00:09:02,207	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Highly against its torso
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:03,743	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Preparing for the next drawing
EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:05,791	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Potato is high in the air
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:06,559	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	It's beautiful
EDL	00:09:07,071	00:09:08,095	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	And kind of terrifying
EDL	00:09:08,607	00:09:11,423	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Ostrom put the picture right on the front of his paper
EDL	00:09:11,423	00:09:13,727	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	And it quickly became an iconic drawing
EDL	00:09:14,495	00:09:16,031	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	No one has ever seen anything quite like it
EDL	00:09:17,055	00:09:18,847	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	DACA is like a renegade
EDL	00:09:18,847	00:09:20,383	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	This is Darren Naish

EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:38,303	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Docker finish up at Yale and went off to graduate school
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:40,095	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Where he continued to speak truth
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:42,399	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	The Slowdown dinosaur establishment

EDL	00:09:50,079	00:09:52,383	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	He drew dinosaurs bounding across
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:53,919	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	The prehistoric landscape like
EDL	00:09:53,919	00:09:54,943	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Track and field stars
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:09:56,991	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	With live muscular bodies

EDL	00:10:11,583	00:10:15,679	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	And Packers athletic dinosaurs became a model for other paleo artist
EDL	00:10:16,447	00:10:17,727	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	So when my Deinonychus
EDL	00:10:18,239	00:10:19,007	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Drawing appeared
EDL	00:10:19,519	00:10:20,543	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Some

EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:23,615	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Okay
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:24,383	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	And we can do it
EDL	00:10:24,383	00:10:29,247	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Artists like Gregory Paul Embrace this new exciting vision of dinosaurs
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:31,807	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	They started giving their dinosaurs vibrant colors

EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:39,487	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Colorful dinosaurs were everywhere
EDL	00:10:39,999	00:10:44,095	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	And they helped fuel the revolution that was taking place in paleontology
EDL	00:10:48,191	00:10:53,823	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Throughout the 70s more and more paleontologists got on board with Ostrum and baugher's theories
EDL	00:10:53,823	00:10:59,199	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	They found new fossils and footprint evidence suggesting that dinosaurs have been warm-blooded intelligence
EDL	00:10:59,199	00:10:59,967	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	And birth like
EDL	00:11:00,479	00:11:03,039	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	This. Has become known as the dinosaur Renaissance

EDL	00:12:22,143	00:12:24,191	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	I'm a title artist which means that

EDL	00:12:29,055	00:12:32,383	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Conway got interested in paleoart after reading Bob Barker
EDL	00:12:34,175	00:12:38,271	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	And in the early part of his career
EDL	00:12:38,783	00:12:40,063	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Super lean muscle
EDL	00:12:40,831	00:12:43,903	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	But after a while he started to feel kind of funny about it
EDL	00:12:43,903	00:12:46,719	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	He says all the dinosaurs look like they had been

EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:51,839	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Pack your pack your clothes and you put the

EDL	00:12:54,655	00:12:55,935	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Shrinks it down
EDL	00:12:56,447	00:12:58,751	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	That's what about dinosaurs
EDL	00:12:58,751	00:13:01,311	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Putting skin on them and then vacuuming a
EDL	00:13:01,311	00:13:02,335	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Anything
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:03,359	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	There was in between that
EDL	00:13:03,359	00:13:03,871	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Skin on the muscle
EDL	00:13:04,639	00:13:08,991	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	No paleoartist weren't just doing that to make their dinosaurs look all cool and buff
EDL	00:13:08,991	00:13:10,527	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	They were trying to be accurate
EDL	00:13:10,527	00:13:11,807	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	I am Poppy

EDL	00:13:19,231	00:13:21,023	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	To think that it really mattered
EDL	00:13:21,535	00:13:22,047	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Set things right
EDL	00:13:22,559	00:13:26,655	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	And to get things right you want your art to be rooted in real scientific evidence
EDL	00:13:27,167	00:13:29,471	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	And the piece of evidence resolved in the skeleton
EDL	00:13:29,983	00:13:33,823	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Paleo artist wood base the shape of their dinosaurs on an accurate skeleton
EDL	00:13:34,847	00:13:38,687	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	The bones give you a pretty good idea where the muscle should go but soft tissues likes
EDL	00:13:40,223	00:13:41,503	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Fat are much harder
EDL	00:13:42,015	00:13:45,087	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	That usually doesn't survive for millions of years and fossils
EDL	00:13:45,599	00:13:47,903	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	So without any evidence of it
EDL	00:13:47,903	00:13:52,255	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Paleoartist tended to be pretty conservative about how much fat they gave their dinosaurs
EDL	00:13:52,255	00:13:53,023	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Which makes
EDL	00:13:53,023	00:13:55,839	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Total since you're not going to add something that you don't have evidence
EDL	00:13:56,607	00:14:00,959	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	But the result was that all these dinosaurs look like they went to the gym three times a day
EDL	00:14:00,959	00:14:02,751	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	And drink protein shakes for every meal
EDL	00:14:03,519	00:14:04,543	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Done, it says
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:08,895	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	It began to feel as though paleo artist had replaced one Orthodoxy with another
EDL	00:14:09,407	00:14:10,431	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	At some point
EDL	00:14:10,431	00:14:11,199	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	I thought
EDL	00:14:12,223	00:14:14,527	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	We can't just keep doing this
EDL	00:14:14,527	00:14:15,295	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	This is
EDL	00:14:15,295	00:14:15,807	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	No
EDL	00:14:16,319	00:14:17,855	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Interesting in many ways
EDL	00:14:18,367	00:14:18,879	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:14:19,391	00:14:20,415	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Is it even right
EDL	00:14:21,183	00:14:23,487	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Is this conservative approach really getting people
EDL	00:14:23,487	00:14:24,255	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	The right
EDL	00:14:24,255	00:14:25,791	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Notion about what dinosaurs looked like
EDL	00:14:26,559	00:14:28,863	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Just because fat didn't survive for Millions
EDL	00:14:28,863	00:14:31,167	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Beerus doesn't mean that a dinosaur didn't have it
EDL	00:14:31,935	00:14:33,727	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	They are animals After All
EDL	00:14:33,727	00:14:35,007	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	I don't have time
EDL	00:14:35,007	00:14:36,287	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	And I have it all over the place
EDL	00:14:36,799	00:14:39,103	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	And some places I have really big fat Reserve
EDL	00:14:39,615	00:14:41,919	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Which changes shape Valley dressed
EDL	00:14:42,687	00:14:46,527	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Thunder score this point Conway asked me to consider a thought experiment
EDL	00:14:47,039	00:14:48,575	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	If we reconstructed
EDL	00:14:48,575	00:14:49,343	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Magnanimous
EDL	00:14:49,343	00:14:50,623	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Slightly reconstruct dinosaurs
EDL	00:14:51,135	00:14:51,903	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	What would they look like

EDL	00:14:53,695	00:14:58,303	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	If some alien paleontologist from millions of years in the future
EDL	00:14:58,303	00:15:00,607	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	What's the try and draw a modern animal
EDL	00:15:00,607	00:15:02,143	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Isaiah well
EDL	00:15:02,143	00:15:02,911	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Or a camel
EDL	00:15:03,423	00:15:05,471	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Just from there fossilized skeleton
EDL	00:15:05,983	00:15:06,495	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	How would it look
EDL	00:15:07,007	00:15:08,287	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Well if you actually do it
EDL	00:15:08,287	00:15:09,823	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	The month animals look
EDL	00:15:10,591	00:15:11,615	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	If you drop a
EDL	00:15:11,615	00:15:14,431	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Bowhead whale for example just from the skeleton
EDL	00:15:14,431	00:15:16,223	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Without a lot of fat or blubber
EDL	00:15:16,735	00:15:18,783	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	It looks kind of like a giant
EDL	00:15:18,783	00:15:19,551	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Tadpole
EDL	00:15:20,319	00:15:21,599	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Bulbous head

EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:27,231	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	You take away all that stuff and you not left with much Leo
EDL	00:15:27,743	00:15:30,559	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Because why else that shape is defined by fat
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:33,119	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Dinosaurs also had fat
EDL	00:15:33,119	00:15:36,191	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	And John argues that it would have changed their shape pretty dramatically
EDL	00:15:36,703	00:15:38,751	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Who knows somebody even had humps
EDL	00:15:39,263	00:15:40,031	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Like animals
EDL	00:15:40,031	00:15:42,335	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	You could take one of my cement dinosaurs
EDL	00:15:42,335	00:15:43,871	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	That dinosaur could have camel humps

EDL	00:16:52,479	00:16:54,783	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Frills and thick coats of feathers
EDL	00:16:54,783	00:16:56,319	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Way more than anyone have predicted
EDL	00:16:56,319	00:16:58,623	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Every time we discover something likes
EDL	00:16:59,903	00:17:00,671	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	It's weird
EDL	00:17:01,439	00:17:02,463	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	And I caught me thinking
EDL	00:17:03,231	00:17:06,047	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	So if all the ones we've discovered so far
EDL	00:17:06,047	00:17:07,839	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	I've turned out to be pretty weird
EDL	00:17:07,839	00:17:09,375	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	What does that tell us about the rest of them
EDL	00:17:10,143	00:17:10,655	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	There are
EDL	00:17:11,167	00:17:11,679	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Bizarre
EDL	00:17:12,703	00:17:14,495	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Possibilities out there that no one's looking
EDL	00:17:15,263	00:17:16,031	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:17:16,031	00:17:17,311	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	I thought well I'm going to
EDL	00:17:17,823	00:17:18,847	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Stop drinking
EDL	00:17:19,359	00:17:21,407	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	So John began to try something new with hazard
EDL	00:17:22,175	00:17:23,199	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	He started
EDL	00:17:23,199	00:17:23,967	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	To speculate
EDL	00:17:24,991	00:17:29,087	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	He started drawing pudgy dinosaurs and dinosaurs with humps
EDL	00:17:29,599	00:17:30,367	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Quills
EDL	00:17:30,367	00:17:31,647	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Weird skin flaps
EDL	00:17:32,159	00:17:33,183	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	And that was my rule
EDL	00:17:33,183	00:17:33,695	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	It was
EDL	00:17:34,207	00:17:35,743	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	How far can we go what's the
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:39,327	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Most outrageous thing I can do
EDL	00:17:39,327	00:17:41,631	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	That we know we don't know isn't true right
EDL	00:17:41,631	00:17:43,167	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	It's still within the Realms of
EDL	00:17:43,167	00:17:44,191	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Possibility of snow.
EDL	00:17:44,959	00:17:47,775	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	John wasn't just making stuff up out of thin air
EDL	00:17:48,287	00:17:52,639	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	It was like there was a standard conservative dinosaur at the center of his drawings
EDL	00:17:53,151	00:17:54,175	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Linn County
EDL	00:17:54,175	00:17:55,967	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Cover it with more speculative Elliman
EDL	00:17:56,735	00:17:58,783	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Wasn't claiming that every drawing
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:18:00,319	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	He did was perfectly accurate
EDL	00:18:00,319	00:18:03,903	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	But you wanted to show people that dinosaurs as a group
EDL	00:18:03,903	00:18:07,487	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Probably had a lot more weird variety than we think
EDL	00:18:07,487	00:18:10,815	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	I'm sorry to get the overall picture dinosaurs ride
EDL	00:18:10,815	00:18:12,351	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	I think you need
EDL	00:18:12,351	00:18:14,911	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	A healthy dose of speculation in there
EDL	00:18:14,911	00:18:16,959	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Conway says that dinosaur art
EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:20,543	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Should always reflect the latest science what we know for sure
EDL	00:18:21,055	00:18:22,591	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Who will never know everything
EDL	00:18:23,103	00:18:25,407	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	And I think the speculation
EDL	00:18:25,407	00:18:25,919	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Isabel
EDL	00:18:26,431	00:18:27,455	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	What extra
EDL	00:18:28,479	00:18:29,247	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	All of
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:31,039	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	We is beautiful in the world
EDL	00:18:31,039	00:18:31,807	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Back then

EDL	00:18:34,879	00:18:36,415	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Took us to bring back some of that real
EDL	00:18:36,927	00:18:39,999	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Magic as a prehistoric whale that was suddenly there
EDL	00:18:41,279	00:18:45,631	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	John eventually decided to give the world some of that magic in the form of a book
EDL	00:18:45,631	00:18:49,727	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Teamed up with Darren Naish and another paleo artist named memo kozma
EDL	00:18:49,727	00:18:52,031	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	In Publix a slim little paperback

EDL	00:18:52,799	00:18:53,567	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	All yesterday
EDL	00:18:54,335	00:18:55,615	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	All yesterday's is
EDL	00:18:55,615	00:18:59,199	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Still with dinosaurs that look very different from what you're used to
EDL	00:18:59,199	00:19:00,735	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	There's a triceratops
EDL	00:19:00,735	00:19:02,015	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	What's covered in spines
EDL	00:19:02,015	00:19:03,551	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	How much is Soros with
EDL	00:19:03,551	00:19:05,343	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Skin that camouflage that against
EDL	00:19:05,343	00:19:06,623	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Forest floor
EDL	00:19:06,623	00:19:11,231	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	And if there is unisaurus that is so covered in feathers that looks like a haystack
EDL	00:19:11,743	00:19:15,327	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Next to each image the artist describes why they drew it that way
EDL	00:19:16,095	00:19:18,399	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	The camouflage dinosaur is drawn that way because
EDL	00:19:18,399	00:19:22,751	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	The artist reason that It's oddly proportioned body might have made it vulnerable

EDL	00:19:23,519	00:19:25,567	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	And in need of some kind of defense strategy
EDL	00:19:26,079	00:19:27,615	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	All yesterday's was a big hit
EDL	00:19:28,127	00:19:29,151	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	And it helped Spark
EDL	00:19:29,151	00:19:31,967	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	A little movement for more speculative paleoart
EDL	00:19:32,479	00:19:36,319	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	We talked about the old yesterday's movement as like it's the new frontier
EDL	00:19:36,319	00:19:37,599	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	All the way we should depict
EDL	00:19:38,111	00:19:39,135	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Prehistoric animals
EDL	00:19:39,135	00:19:44,255	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Darren Naish says it's more acceptable now to draw a dinosaur based on a hypothesis
EDL	00:19:44,767	00:19:47,839	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	For example horned dinosaurs like Triceratops have these

EDL	00:19:51,679	00:19:53,727	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	There been a few different hypotheses but
EDL	00:19:53,727	00:19:54,751	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Bored by scientist
EDL	00:19:54,751	00:19:57,055	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	And one of them is that the dinosaurs
EDL	00:19:57,055	00:19:58,847	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	May have had inflatable
EDL	00:19:58,847	00:19:59,615	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Nos balloons
EDL	00:20:00,127	00:20:02,943	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Cuddly elephant seal hooded seal inflatable

EDL	00:20:03,711	00:20:04,735	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	But just
EDL	00:20:04,735	00:20:07,295	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Would have looked weird and grotesque in Australia
EDL	00:20:07,807	00:20:09,087	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Expressive very real possibility
EDL	00:20:09,855	00:20:13,439	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	No 20 years ago if someone were to draw Triceratops with nose balloons
EDL	00:20:13,951	00:20:14,975	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	They would have been laughed at
EDL	00:20:15,487	00:20:16,767	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	But I would say that
EDL	00:20:16,767	00:20:18,815	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	What we called you yesterday smooth
EDL	00:20:18,815	00:20:20,607	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	That means that it is now quite
EDL	00:20:21,375	00:20:23,679	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Reasonable for an autistic
EDL	00:20:23,679	00:20:25,215	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	I've shown my Triceratops

EDL	00:20:27,519	00:20:28,543	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Does this reason
EDL	00:20:29,055	00:20:30,591	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	And you could say
EDL	00:20:30,591	00:20:32,127	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Nikon S2 specs
EDL	00:20:32,127	00:20:34,431	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Justifiable

EDL	00:20:37,759	00:20:39,551	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	That doesn't mean Triceratops
EDL	00:20:39,551	00:20:41,087	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Definitely had nose balloon
EDL	00:20:41,599	00:20:45,951	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	But by drawing it that way it's like the artist is asking us to keep an open mind
EDL	00:20:46,463	00:20:50,303	| 326_Welcome_to_Jurassic_Art_pt_01 |	Because even though we know a lot about the prehistoric world
