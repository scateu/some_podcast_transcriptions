EDL	00:02:28,992	00:02:35,392	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Don't feel bad if you never heard of Bucky he did go by Bucky by the way big deal back in the 60s

EDL	00:02:41,792	00:02:44,096	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	There's a Bucky Fuller postage stamp
EDL	00:02:44,608	00:02:47,424	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	He was even given the country's highest civilian honor
EDL	00:02:47,424	00:02:49,472	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Presidential medal of freedom
EDL	00:02:49,472	00:02:55,872	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Bucky Fuller is also responsible for the title of this radio show he said 99% of who you are is invisible

EDL	00:03:04,832	00:03:10,976	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	He is from the film Buckminster Fuller the Lost interviews
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:13,792	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	To do mall was last
EDL	00:03:14,304	00:03:18,656	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	So that you might sometimes do so much with so little they might be able to take care of everybody
EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:21,472	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	And make all the politics invalid
EDL	00:03:21,472	00:03:24,800	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Jay Baldwin was one of Bucky students
EDL	00:03:24,800	00:03:27,616	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	He just wanted people to use less stuff
EDL	00:03:28,384	00:03:29,664	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	He said it was all going to run out
EDL	00:03:30,176	00:03:31,200	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	We gotta think big
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:35,552	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	And take care of everybody said as long as there's one person starving
EDL	00:03:36,320	00:03:37,088	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	You're going to have wars
EDL	00:03:37,856	00:03:42,208	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Fuller called himself a comprehensive anticipatory design scientist
EDL	00:03:42,720	00:03:47,072	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	She wanted to invent things that would make human life sustainable on this planet
EDL	00:03:47,584	00:03:51,168	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Decades before anyone else was even thinking about Green Building
EDL	00:03:51,936	00:03:57,568	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	And for that people have called Bucky the Leonardo DaVinci of the 20th century
EDL	00:03:58,080	00:03:59,616	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Devore Institute crew
EDL	00:04:00,128	00:04:02,176	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Counters that Leonardo was the bucket
EDL	00:04:02,176	00:04:03,712	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Before medieval times
EDL	00:04:04,736	00:04:06,528	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	So here's the deal with the Woods Hole Dome
EDL	00:04:07,296	00:04:09,344	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Buggy wanted to change the world
EDL	00:04:09,344	00:04:10,368	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Starting with building
EDL	00:04:11,392	00:04:15,232	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	So he started making these weird structures which he called geodesic dome
EDL	00:04:15,744	00:04:18,815	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Geodesic refers to the geometry of Curves
EDL	00:04:18,815	00:04:19,583	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Surfaces
EDL	00:04:19,583	00:04:23,935	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	The golf ball building in Woods Hole is actually the oldest of Buc-ee's domes that are still standing
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:27,775	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	The structure of the geodesic dome is based on a lot
EDL	00:04:28,287	00:04:29,311	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Complicated math
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:32,639	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	But I'm sure it's dealt with a lot of triangles
EDL	00:04:33,407	00:04:35,455	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	A triangle is a very strong shape
EDL	00:04:36,223	00:04:38,271	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	And a dome made out of triangles
EDL	00:04:38,271	00:04:39,295	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Is extra strong
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:44,159	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	That meant that domes could be made of lighter and cheaper materials than normal building
EDL	00:04:44,927	00:04:46,719	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Like plastic and aluminum
EDL	00:04:46,719	00:04:48,255	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Instead of Steel and concrete
EDL	00:04:49,023	00:04:52,095	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Back in 1952 but he was just starting to build them
EDL	00:04:52,863	00:04:57,471	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	They caught the attention of an architect and aspiring restaurant or a man named Gunnar Peterson
EDL	00:04:57,983	00:05:04,383	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	And the early 50s 1953 he bought some property in Woods Hole in
EDL	00:05:04,383	00:05:06,687	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Decided to build a hotel in a restaurant
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:08,735	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Joe Peterson is Gunner son
EDL	00:05:08,735	00:05:10,527	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	He did make a deal with Bucky Fuller
EDL	00:05:11,039	00:05:12,831	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	I don't remember how dad Madame he
EDL	00:05:14,367	00:05:18,719	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Call the track him down anyway his wife
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:20,255	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Came and looked at our house
EDL	00:05:21,279	00:05:23,071	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	They decided they build the Dome restaurant
EDL	00:05:23,583	00:05:28,191	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	A geodesic dome has a way of standing out but in Cape Cod it really
EDL	00:05:28,191	00:05:28,703	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Stands out
EDL	00:05:29,215	00:05:30,495	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	And that upset some people
EDL	00:05:31,007	00:05:33,567	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Wow it isn't there shingled Cape Cod Cottage
EDL	00:05:33,567	00:05:34,847	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	That's for darn sure
EDL	00:05:35,359	00:05:37,151	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	I'm in the feeling is this is going to
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:42,527	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Change Life as we know it you know this again I will never be the same again you know this is just
EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:43,039	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Horrible
EDL	00:05:43,551	00:05:44,063	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	One building
EDL	00:05:45,087	00:05:45,855	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	There was
EDL	00:05:46,879	00:05:50,463	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Stuff that happened there was things stolen from you I mean it was
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:53,023	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Paint poured on things that what that was
EDL	00:05:53,023	00:05:53,791	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	There was just
EDL	00:05:53,791	00:05:55,071	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Lots of stuff
EDL	00:05:55,071	00:05:56,351	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Stuff here meaning
EDL	00:05:56,351	00:05:58,655	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	People didn't want to talk about this on tape
EDL	00:05:58,655	00:06:02,751	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	But I just have this mental image of a really ugly mob up in arms about this
EDL	00:06:02,751	00:06:03,263	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Dome
EDL	00:06:03,775	00:06:05,823	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	That's probably an exaggeration but
EDL	00:06:05,823	00:06:06,591	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	You get the idea
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:11,967	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Despite the unrest the Dome restaurant opened in June of 1954
EDL	00:06:12,479	00:06:14,527	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	And according to Joel it was the place
EDL	00:06:14,527	00:06:16,575	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	To go on was
EDL	00:06:16,575	00:06:19,903	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	The most elegant place around I mean at that time
EDL	00:06:20,927	00:06:23,999	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Shortly when you went out to eat in the 50s on Cape Cod
EDL	00:06:24,511	00:06:26,047	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	In a place like the dawn
EDL	00:06:26,559	00:06:30,655	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	You are tie in the women wear all spiffed-up it was a festive
EDL	00:06:30,655	00:06:31,167	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Occasion
EDL	00:06:31,679	00:06:33,471	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	And they had a live musician
EDL	00:06:34,239	00:06:35,263	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	She played the zither
EDL	00:06:35,775	00:06:38,079	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	And I don't know if you've ever had dinner with soothing music
EDL	00:06:38,847	00:06:39,871	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	It's rather Pleasant
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:48,319	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Restaurant is right on the ocean
EDL	00:06:48,831	00:06:54,975	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	And you're far away from City so he could just look up at the ceiling and you're looking at the star
EDL	00:07:02,143	00:07:05,983	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Sally Brady was 14 years old when the Dome restaurant open your house
EDL	00:07:06,495	00:07:09,567	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	This early fifties we're really quite an amazing
EDL	00:07:09,567	00:07:15,711	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Moment because everybody could buy cars people who survived the war all those men were home and they were job
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:18,015	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	10 people were
EDL	00:07:18,015	00:07:20,575	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Making the American dream come true and I think that
EDL	00:07:21,087	00:07:23,903	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	A symbol of the America
EDL	00:07:23,903	00:07:27,743	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Dream in a way it felt like a prosperous optimistic time
EDL	00:07:27,743	00:07:30,815	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	It makes sense that the Dome represented the future for some people
EDL	00:07:34,143	00:07:37,471	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	It turned out that there was some real structural problems with the Dome
EDL	00:07:37,471	00:07:40,543	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	First the structure acted like an acoustic amplifier
EDL	00:07:41,055	00:07:44,127	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	So all that zither music got blasted across the neighborhood
EDL	00:07:44,895	00:07:47,455	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	And a building was that much glass work like a greenhouse
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:49,503	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Got hot inside
EDL	00:07:50,527	00:07:55,135	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	After the first season they cover the Dome and white fiberglass the block out the Sun
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:07:58,207	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Diamond Diner couldn't see the Stars anymore
EDL	00:07:58,207	00:08:00,511	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Geodesic domes don't have any support beam
EDL	00:08:01,023	00:08:04,351	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Those triangular window frames do all the work
EDL	00:08:05,119	00:08:08,447	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Each frame rests on the one next to it
EDL	00:08:08,447	00:08:12,543	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	What can be a problem if the building materials are flexible and move in the Wind
EDL	00:08:13,055	00:08:15,871	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Here's Arnie grapes dad he worked at the restaurant
EDL	00:08:15,871	00:08:17,151	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Saturday night
EDL	00:08:17,151	00:08:18,943	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Horrible weather outside
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:20,479	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	And this particular night
EDL	00:08:20,479	00:08:22,271	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	There was a party of four
EDL	00:08:22,271	00:08:26,623	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Lascala's Matt were they having dinner and they were regular customers local people
EDL	00:08:26,623	00:08:28,159	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Around 7:30 with a
EDL	00:08:28,671	00:08:29,951	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Shuffle restaurant
EDL	00:08:30,463	00:08:31,999	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	All of a sudden this.
EDL	00:08:31,999	00:08:35,071	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Dropping a table 113 and I can remember it
EDL	00:08:35,071	00:08:36,607	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Seeing them sit there
EDL	00:08:36,607	00:08:38,399	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	And Jane took her umbrella
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:39,167	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Opened it
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:40,703	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	To a huge
EDL	00:08:40,703	00:08:41,215	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Floss
EDL	00:08:41,727	00:08:44,031	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	From everyone in the restaurant
EDL	00:08:44,031	00:08:45,311	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	It was just funny
EDL	00:08:45,311	00:08:46,591	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	But the fact is
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:49,151	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	The geodesic domes most of them looked like
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:52,735	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Say it again Jay Baldwin Bucky's former students
EDL	00:08:52,735	00:08:55,551	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	I have a photograph of Bucky inside is dumb
EDL	00:08:56,063	00:08:57,087	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	In Carbondale
EDL	00:08:57,599	00:08:59,135	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	With an umbrella in one hand
EDL	00:08:59,647	00:09:00,415	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	A book in the other
EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:02,719	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	And a flashlight in his mouth
EDL	00:09:02,719	00:09:03,487	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Reading the blur
EDL	00:09:04,767	00:09:06,303	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	And if the umbrella
EDL	00:09:06,303	00:09:07,071	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Is needed
EDL	00:09:07,839	00:09:10,399	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	I told Becky I'm going to find out why I don't sleep
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:11,935	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	And he said
EDL	00:09:11,935	00:09:14,495	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Don't sleep because they're made my amateurs
EDL	00:09:14,495	00:09:18,847	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	And they built it with holes in it you wouldn't build a boat with holes in it would u r r
EDL	00:09:19,615	00:09:21,407	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	I said I don't think they're leaking
EDL	00:09:21,407	00:09:22,431	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Because they made a move
EDL	00:09:23,711	00:09:24,479	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	I said I think
EDL	00:09:24,991	00:09:26,015	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Are leaking G
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:29,343	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	The owner Joel Peterson
EDL	00:09:29,343	00:09:30,111	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Does he pass
EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:31,135	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	A lot of week
EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:34,463	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Eventually Joe wanted to retire from the restaurant business
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:37,791	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	He sold the property in 2002
EDL	00:09:37,791	00:09:39,327	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	It's been sitting vacant ever since
EDL	00:09:40,607	00:09:42,911	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Ask Joel and Arnie to give me a tour
EDL	00:09:44,447	00:09:47,519	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	I can't bring myself to tell them I've actually been here before
EDL	00:09:49,055	00:09:51,615	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	We have to push aside branches to get to the front door
EDL	00:09:53,151	00:09:55,199	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	It's been a few years since I've been here
EDL	00:09:55,711	00:09:56,479	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	And
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:10:01,343	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	To tell you the truth I never really wanted to come because I mean
EDL	00:10:01,343	00:10:04,159	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Babe is incredibly overgrown I mean it's just
EDL	00:10:05,183	00:10:07,743	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Sad
EDL	00:10:07,743	00:10:13,119	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	My gosh isn't this amazing it actually is
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:18,239	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	I'll tell you what this is not a pretty sight
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:24,895	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	I told you about Ruth welcome in the zoo this is where she played
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:27,967	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Now if you want take a look at the kitchen
EDL	00:10:27,967	00:10:28,479	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	There's a walking
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:32,831	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	This really has been like
EDL	00:10:34,879	00:10:39,487	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	I certainly I wouldn't mind seeing it restored on the other hand
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:43,071	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Think it's going to be a tremendous expense to put this back
EDL	00:10:43,583	00:10:45,631	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	So it sits with two
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:48,447	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Opposite emotions that you look at it
EDL	00:10:49,471	00:10:51,263	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	But you have to be realistic and
EDL	00:10:51,263	00:10:53,055	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Understand that things change human life
EDL	00:10:56,895	00:11:01,247	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	In 2006 a real estate development company plan to build condos on the side
EDL	00:11:01,759	00:11:04,575	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	And for a while it looks like the Dome might be torn down
EDL	00:11:05,343	00:11:06,879	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	But then a funny thing happened
EDL	00:11:07,391	00:11:09,951	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	There was a public outcry to keep the Dome
EDL	00:11:09,951	00:11:12,255	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	This is the same building that residents fought against
EDL	00:11:12,255	00:11:15,583	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Tooth and nail back when it was being constructed in the 50
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:19,423	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Now in order to build on the site the developer have to
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:20,191	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Store the Dome
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:22,239	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	And that's going to be a
EDL	00:11:22,239	00:11:22,751	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Expensive
EDL	00:11:23,519	00:11:26,847	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	So the whole thing is in limbo until more condos are pre-sold
EDL	00:11:26,847	00:11:30,431	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	And real estate transactions are not moving quickly these days
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:33,759	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	If a developer Camp FreeCell enough condos
EDL	00:11:33,759	00:11:36,063	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	To justify the cost of restoring the Dome
EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:38,111	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	And the whole deal could fall apart
EDL	00:11:39,135	00:11:42,207	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	If that happened the Dome would stay as it is now
EDL	00:11:42,207	00:11:43,487	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Continuing to the k
EDL	00:11:44,255	00:11:47,583	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Waiting for the next out-of-towners to come poking around with a flashlight
EDL	00:11:48,863	00:11:51,423	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	The person who seems least sentimental about this
EDL	00:11:51,423	00:11:52,447	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Is Joel Peterson
EDL	00:11:52,959	00:11:55,007	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	If I were doing the project that they
EDL	00:11:55,007	00:11:56,031	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Talk about doing
EDL	00:11:56,799	00:11:57,567	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	I tear it down
EDL	00:11:58,591	00:11:59,103	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Beyonce
EDL	00:12:00,639	00:12:01,663	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	It's it's
EDL	00:12:01,663	00:12:04,735	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	It's a building it was yeah it was part of my life it's a building
EDL	00:12:05,503	00:12:09,087	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Sally Brady grew up next to the Dome feels differently
EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:10,111	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Maybe it will
EDL	00:12:10,623	00:12:13,439	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Be reborn the different way that will be better
EDL	00:12:15,231	00:12:15,999	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Why not
EDL	00:12:15,999	00:12:18,559	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Maybe you'll be a beautiful transparent place
EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:20,095	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	People will go there and do
EDL	00:12:21,375	00:12:23,679	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Fantastic energizing work
EDL	00:12:23,679	00:12:24,703	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	It will help Humana
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:28,287	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	What do you think we would lose if if it was torn down
EDL	00:12:30,079	00:12:31,103	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	What would you lose
EDL	00:12:32,127	00:12:35,199	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Well it's very good example of this
EDL	00:12:35,199	00:12:35,967	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	450
EDL	00:12:36,479	00:12:37,247	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Boo
EDL	00:12:37,247	00:12:38,783	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Anything was possible
EDL	00:12:39,295	00:12:43,391	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Yeah I sort of agree and then and then what does it mean that now
EDL	00:12:43,391	00:12:45,439	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	It's just in such disrepair
EDL	00:12:46,975	00:12:49,279	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Well I think it means that we
EDL	00:12:49,279	00:12:50,303	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Groudon
EDL	00:12:50,815	00:12:51,839	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	And that dream
EDL	00:12:53,375	00:12:54,655	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Sort of yeah I think it's
EDL	00:12:54,655	00:12:56,191	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Kind of broken dream right now
EDL	00:12:57,215	00:12:58,495	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Depressing isn't it
EDL	00:12:59,519	00:13:00,287	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Maybe it's finished
EDL	00:13:01,567	00:13:02,079	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Kinder
EDL	00:13:04,383	00:13:08,223	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Buckminster Fuller claimed that his ideas were 50 years ahead of his time
EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:12,575	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	Announcement over 50 years but domes have not replaced traditional building
EDL	00:13:13,087	00:13:13,855	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	But you know what
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:15,391	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	I'm rooting for the Dome
EDL	00:13:16,159	00:13:18,207	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	I think it represents Bucky's optimism
EDL	00:13:18,719	00:13:21,535	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	That we could solve The World's problems with good design
EDL	00:13:22,303	00:13:26,399	| 99pi-0064-derelictdome-1 |	And even if you couldn't you could still stargaze through triangular windows
