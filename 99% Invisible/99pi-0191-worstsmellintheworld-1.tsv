EDL	00:06:33,471	00:06:37,567	| 99pi-0191-worstsmellintheworld-1 |	Maybe cops who needed training could get some use out of those old sets
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:38,591	| 99pi-0191-worstsmellintheworld-1 |	We did quite a bit of training
EDL	00:06:40,127	00:06:42,943	| 99pi-0191-worstsmellintheworld-1 |	How best to respond to a school shooting

EDL	00:06:47,551	00:06:52,159	| 99pi-0191-worstsmellintheworld-1 |	This was good business and then in 2003 the US invaded Iraq

EDL	00:07:10,591	00:07:11,871	| 99pi-0191-worstsmellintheworld-1 |	So that's how it started
EDL	00:07:11,871	00:07:16,991	| 99pi-0191-worstsmellintheworld-1 |	Stew's big idea was that he could use not just the stats but the whole lineup of Hollywood effects
EDL	00:07:16,991	00:07:17,759	| 99pi-0191-worstsmellintheworld-1 |	To create effect

EDL	00:07:31,583	00:07:33,887	| 99pi-0191-worstsmellintheworld-1 |	Always training was pretty much sterile
EDL	00:07:33,887	00:07:35,679	| 99pi-0191-worstsmellintheworld-1 |	Are make believe this is a dork
EDL	00:07:35,679	00:07:39,007	| 99pi-0191-worstsmellintheworld-1 |	They would take the Marines and turn your shirts Inside Out say okay

EDL	00:07:40,799	00:07:43,103	| 99pi-0191-worstsmellintheworld-1 |	It's not raining it's not realistic training
EDL	00:07:43,615	00:07:45,919	| 99pi-0191-worstsmellintheworld-1 |	She says the military has gotten a lot better at training
EDL	00:07:46,687	00:07:47,711	| 99pi-0191-worstsmellintheworld-1 |	But in the beginning

EDL	00:07:53,343	00:07:59,743	| 99pi-0191-worstsmellintheworld-1 |	His SATs should look and feel as much as possible like the kind of place a group of Marines might go out and Patrol

EDL	00:08:34,303	00:08:34,815	| 99pi-0191-worstsmellintheworld-1 |	Realistic
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:40,959	| 99pi-0191-worstsmellintheworld-1 |	Android can do this because he did two tours in Iraq as a medic in 2007 and in 2008
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:45,311	| 99pi-0191-worstsmellintheworld-1 |	And he remembers exactly what it felt like to walk into a village like this
EDL	00:08:45,311	00:08:47,359	| 99pi-0191-worstsmellintheworld-1 |	How unwelcome he's out there
EDL	00:08:47,359	00:08:52,479	| 99pi-0191-worstsmellintheworld-1 |	And how much the Iraqis wanted him to go away they feel they're just trying to live their lives
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:55,039	| 99pi-0191-worstsmellintheworld-1 |	And now we set up the space right outside their Village
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:56,831	| 99pi-0191-worstsmellintheworld-1 |	7 a simulation the whole place
