EDL	00:08:02,559	00:08:03,327	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	From
EDL	00:08:03,327	00:08:05,887	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	Civic authorities that something needs to be done
EDL	00:08:05,887	00:08:06,655	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	Something nice
EDL	00:08:06,655	00:08:07,423	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	To be done quickly
EDL	00:08:07,423	00:08:10,495	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	So Boston set an agenda to make the city great

EDL	00:08:17,919	00:08:20,223	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	I know some of these buildings were celebrated
EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:22,271	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	Fathers were really not
EDL	00:08:22,271	00:08:23,551	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	What we call the third rail
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:25,599	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	Concrete modernism
EDL	00:08:26,111	00:08:28,927	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	City Hall in Boston City Hall was built in 1968
EDL	00:08:29,439	00:08:31,743	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	Critics were put off by this concrete Style
EDL	00:08:32,255	00:08:33,023	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	It was called
EDL	00:08:33,023	00:08:33,535	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	Alienated

EDL	00:08:35,327	00:08:40,703	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	And since it was a government building this criticism became impossible to remove from polyp
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:44,031	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	Boston City Hall became a political Pawn
EDL	00:08:44,031	00:08:49,663	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	Mayors and City Council Members kept trying to win public support with promises to get rid of the building
EDL	00:08:49,663	00:08:51,967	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	Like John Tobin did when he ran for City Council

EDL	00:09:03,487	00:09:04,767	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	And I think we can do a lot
EDL	00:09:06,303	00:09:11,423	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	Former mayor Thomas Menino actually started a study to really look into tearing it down
EDL	00:09:11,423	00:09:12,191	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	It turned out at the Ritz
EDL	00:09:12,703	00:09:16,287	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	The study that you would need something like a nuclear grade weapon basically.

EDL	00:09:17,055	00:09:21,151	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	I don't think it would say so heavily over built into concrete
EDL	00:09:21,151	00:09:23,967	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	And so when they couldn't tear down City Hall
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:25,503	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	Officials chose to ignore it
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:27,295	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	People that occupy
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:28,063	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	Building
EDL	00:09:28,063	00:09:30,111	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	For decades and decades didn't like it
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:33,439	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	Wanted to see
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:34,463	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	See the building go away
EDL	00:09:34,463	00:09:36,767	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	This is called active neglect
EDL	00:09:36,767	00:09:38,559	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	It happens with a lot of concrete building
EDL	00:09:39,071	00:09:40,351	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	They're intentionally
EDL	00:09:40,351	00:09:43,423	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	Unrepaired unrenovated and uncared-for
EDL	00:09:43,423	00:09:45,471	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	Which only makes the building more ugly
EDL	00:09:45,471	00:09:46,751	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	And then more hated
EDL	00:09:46,751	00:09:48,031	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	And then more than Ward
EDL	00:09:48,031	00:09:50,079	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	Increase this vicious cycle
EDL	00:09:50,079	00:09:52,639	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	When the public hate of Boston City Hall
EDL	00:09:52,639	00:09:53,407	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	Feeds itself
EDL	00:09:53,919	00:09:54,943	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	And then
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:09:57,247	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	Discussion years on really big
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:09:58,015	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	Came about
EDL	00:09:58,015	00:09:58,527	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	What the original
EDL	00:10:01,087	00:10:01,855	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	Not failure
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:02,367	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	Maintenance
EDL	00:10:04,159	00:10:06,719	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	When people don't these Mammoth concrete structures
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:08,511	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	No one really thought about maintenance
EDL	00:10:09,023	00:10:10,303	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	It seemed indestructible
EDL	00:10:10,303	00:10:13,119	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	In the early stages of concrete people
EDL	00:10:13,119	00:10:15,935	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	Assume that this was an everlasting material
EDL	00:10:16,447	00:10:19,007	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	But wouldn't need any attention at all
EDL	00:10:20,287	00:10:21,567	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	And that's wrong
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:23,103	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	We know that it does need
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:24,639	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	2B look soft
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:27,199	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	It does to Terry Wright
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:28,223	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	Does takai
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:31,039	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	But it can be hard to tell when concrete is to
EDL	00:10:31,039	00:10:33,599	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	They came to think of Breakin Timber
EDL	00:10:33,599	00:10:35,135	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	What's a guy takes place
EDL	00:10:35,647	00:10:36,159	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	Omnicef
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:39,487	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	But with concrete the
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:40,767	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	Deterioration
EDL	00:10:40,767	00:10:42,303	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	Is internal
EDL	00:10:42,303	00:10:45,631	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	Concrete deteriorates chemically from the inside out
EDL	00:10:45,631	00:10:50,239	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	Part of this has to do with a metal reinforcements that help hold up most concrete building
EDL	00:10:50,751	00:10:51,775	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	The rebar
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:52,799	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	Why can Ross
EDL	00:10:52,799	00:10:53,567	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	And the rest
EDL	00:10:53,567	00:10:55,359	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	Eats away at the overall structure
EDL	00:10:55,871	00:10:57,919	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	But Adrian 40 says
EDL	00:10:57,919	00:10:59,711	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	Tearing them down is not
EDL	00:10:59,711	00:11:02,783	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	Spencer your cruise as soon as you tell them down
EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:03,807	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	Then
EDL	00:11:03,807	00:11:07,647	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	You have a problem Festival what you do with the picture
EDL	00:11:09,183	00:11:09,951	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	Black
EDL	00:11:09,951	00:11:13,791	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	And secondly you cup to replace them with something else
EDL	00:11:14,303	00:11:15,071	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	Use up
EDL	00:11:15,071	00:11:18,655	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	A lot more energy and creates a lot more CO2
EDL	00:11:18,655	00:11:22,751	| 99pi-0176-hardtoloveabrute-1 |	In building something in that place already used up all that energy when they were made
