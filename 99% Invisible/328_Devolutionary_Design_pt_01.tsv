EDL	00:01:08,864	00:01:15,264	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	It's hard to overstate just how important record album art was to music before we
EDL	00:01:15,264	00:01:16,288	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	I downloaded everything
EDL	00:01:16,800	00:01:20,128	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Our experience with a record or CD used to be visual
EDL	00:01:20,128	00:01:24,224	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	The design of the record cover was your first impression of what was to come
EDL	00:01:24,224	00:01:30,624	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	I would stare at the font on the cover and pour over the liner notes the first time I put an album on it why
EDL	00:01:30,624	00:01:35,488	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Was a ritual I'm not saying that error music was better it wasn't it was just different
EDL	00:01:35,488	00:01:41,888	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	BR on the records try to encapsulate the essence of a band and then that Essence was transferred to you because you were a
EDL	00:01:41,888	00:01:44,704	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Fan and it became part of your identity to
EDL	00:01:44,704	00:01:47,008	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	At least that's what it felt like
EDL	00:01:47,008	00:01:50,848	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Albemarle would certainly important to my friend and reporter Shawn Cole
EDL	00:01:50,848	00:01:52,640	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	One certain album
EDL	00:01:52,640	00:01:54,944	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	In one certain band in particular
EDL	00:01:55,712	00:01:57,504	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	The Roman were you ever Devo fan
EDL	00:01:58,272	00:02:03,904	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	I was aboard evil appreciate it I don't think it was really a fan like I listen to unlike the songs I heard
EDL	00:02:03,904	00:02:05,952	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	I remember with it when I was a kid

EDL	00:02:11,840	00:02:12,608	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	NFL
EDL	00:02:12,608	00:02:14,144	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Particular memory of them
EDL	00:02:14,656	00:02:16,448	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Doing a cover of
EDL	00:02:16,448	00:02:21,312	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	I Can't Get No Satisfaction by The Rolling Stones on Saturday Night Live
EDL	00:02:21,824	00:02:23,360	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Really weird yes
EDL	00:02:25,408	00:02:27,200	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	This story is about that
EDL	00:02:27,200	00:02:31,552	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Devo album the one that they were promoting on that Saturday Night Live performance Yousaf
EDL	00:02:31,552	00:02:33,856	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	More specifically it's about
EDL	00:02:34,368	00:02:35,648	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	The album art
EDL	00:02:36,160	00:02:36,928	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	App that record
EDL	00:02:37,440	00:02:41,536	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Because the story of the image that ultimately ended up on the cover of that record
EDL	00:02:42,048	00:02:43,072	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Is this
EDL	00:02:43,072	00:02:45,888	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Crazy rabbit hole that I fell down
EDL	00:02:45,888	00:02:50,496	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Before we get there I just need to cover some some things about Diva that you might not know
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:52,288	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Do you know where the name comes from
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:53,568	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	I do not
EDL	00:02:54,336	00:02:58,944	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	So a lot of people think of DeVos this really silly you know not even jumping around
EDL	00:02:58,944	00:03:02,784	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	But they were actually very serious and had a very considered
EDL	00:03:02,784	00:03:03,296	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Philosophy
EDL	00:03:03,808	00:03:04,832	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	And that was at the
EDL	00:03:04,832	00:03:05,856	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Human race
EDL	00:03:05,856	00:03:08,416	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Is an estate of D evolution
EDL	00:03:08,416	00:03:09,440	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Devo
EDL	00:03:10,208	00:03:15,328	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	So their songs are all the songs are mostly about corporate control and
EDL	00:03:15,840	00:03:18,912	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Blind Conformity and they were actually visual artist
EDL	00:03:18,912	00:03:20,960	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Before they before they wrote any songs
EDL	00:03:20,960	00:03:24,032	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	It wasn't the early 70s in Akron Ohio
EDL	00:03:24,032	00:03:27,104	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	So I talked with one of the founders of Devo Jerry Casale
EDL	00:03:27,616	00:03:31,456	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	And who says like back then they weren't they were mostly trying to figure out what
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:33,504	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Devolutionary art
EDL	00:03:33,504	00:03:34,016	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Would look like
EDL	00:03:34,528	00:03:38,112	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	You know cuz we were very very enamored and put off at
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:38,880	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	At the same time
EDL	00:03:38,880	00:03:39,648	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Bye
EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:40,672	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Pop culture
EDL	00:03:40,672	00:03:43,232	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Like the lowest end of like add graphics
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:45,792	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Terrible TV commercials
EDL	00:03:46,304	00:03:48,608	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	We were kind of drawn to kitsch
EDL	00:03:48,608	00:03:49,888	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	And occasionally they
EDL	00:03:49,888	00:03:51,680	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Would go out shopping
EDL	00:03:51,680	00:03:52,192	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Fourchette
EDL	00:03:52,960	00:03:53,728	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	So

EDL	00:03:58,848	00:04:01,920	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	And this is Mark mothersbaugh is another member of the band
EDL	00:04:01,920	00:04:07,552	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	This is probably the point to mention that this was more than four decades ago and and not everybody's memory is is

EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:21,119	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:04:21,119	00:04:26,239	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Walking through the sports section and there's V6 practice golf balls in a

EDL	00:04:43,647	00:04:45,695	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Like a clear bag full of candy and it just says
EDL	00:04:45,695	00:04:47,231	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Gummy bears at the top

EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:21,791	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Kind of imitating
EDL	00:05:22,303	00:05:25,119	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Something that I'd already been printing which was
EDL	00:05:25,119	00:05:26,911	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Human heads in front of the Moon and
EDL	00:05:27,423	00:05:28,703	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	It made us laugh
EDL	00:05:28,703	00:05:29,471	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Wee chuckle

EDL	00:06:23,743	00:06:25,279	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	But other than that
EDL	00:06:25,279	00:06:27,327	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Nothing really happened with it
EDL	00:06:27,327	00:06:28,095	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Until
EDL	00:06:28,607	00:06:31,167	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	We were already putting out our self-produced single
EDL	00:06:31,679	00:06:32,447	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	You still
EDL	00:06:38,079	00:06:39,359	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Oh I like that song
EDL	00:06:39,359	00:06:45,247	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	It's it this is my favorite one is so it's it's like this kind of jokey Anthem celebrating
EDL	00:06:45,247	00:06:48,063	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Like literal stiffness like uptightness
EDL	00:06:48,063	00:06:51,391	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Talking about televangelist politicians and how if they are
EDL	00:06:51,903	00:06:54,975	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Somehow and I don't really remember the moment but
EDL	00:06:54,975	00:06:55,487	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	We had
EDL	00:06:55,999	00:06:56,767	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	The idea
EDL	00:06:57,279	00:06:59,071	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	I'm putting Chichi on that cover
EDL	00:06:59,583	00:07:02,143	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	And so they used that picture of chichi
EDL	00:07:02,655	00:07:04,191	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	On the cover of the 45
EDL	00:07:04,191	00:07:05,215	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	The Sing-Off
EDL	00:07:05,215	00:07:06,495	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	And it was like this
EDL	00:07:06,495	00:07:10,335	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Commentary on on on Commercial as a Min Pin or obsession with selling
EDL	00:07:10,335	00:07:12,383	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	And in this case selling plastic golf balls
EDL	00:07:13,151	00:07:15,199	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	And the Americana of the
EDL	00:07:15,199	00:07:15,711	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	The golfer
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:18,527	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Toby stuff comes out in 1978
EDL	00:07:19,039	00:07:19,807	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:07:19,807	00:07:21,343	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Yeah they're still not famous there
EDL	00:07:21,343	00:07:23,391	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	None of this obscure art rock band
EDL	00:07:23,903	00:07:26,463	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	But then about four months later
EDL	00:07:26,463	00:07:27,231	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Diva gets
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:28,511	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Their big break
EDL	00:07:28,511	00:07:30,815	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Warner Brothers sign the Bantu there
EDL	00:07:30,815	00:07:32,351	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	First full-length album
EDL	00:07:33,887	00:07:34,655	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Gordon Jerry
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:36,959	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Is where the real D Evolution begin
EDL	00:07:37,471	00:07:39,007	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	We've laid that whole thing out
EDL	00:07:39,007	00:07:39,775	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	And working up
EDL	00:07:40,287	00:07:41,311	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	This moment
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:43,871	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	And then comes the real Devo twist
EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:46,431	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Only a corporation could provide
EDL	00:07:46,943	00:07:50,015	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	In other words what we're talking about we become part of
EDL	00:07:52,319	00:07:53,599	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	They're about to be
EDL	00:07:53,599	00:07:57,439	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	On top 40 radio and broadcast on the TV screens at Middle America
EDL	00:07:57,951	00:07:58,719	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	What was that
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:08:00,511	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	First record call
EDL	00:08:00,511	00:08:01,791	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	The long title
EDL	00:08:01,791	00:08:03,071	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Called question
EDL	00:08:03,071	00:08:05,375	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Are we
EDL	00:08:05,887	00:08:07,935	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Question are we not men

EDL	00:08:11,263	00:08:16,127	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	And this is their first major label album
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:22,527	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	So Mark and Jerry than the other members of the band are there like that
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:29,183	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	That picture of chichi work so well on the single let's just stick with it you know it's kind of our brand now let's just put that on the on the cover of the full-length
EDL	00:08:29,695	00:08:34,815	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	And this is like a picture of Chi-Chi Rodriguez the original picture from that
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:36,095	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Thing they bought at Kmart
EDL	00:08:36,095	00:08:37,887	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	They just took that lifted it directly
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:43,007	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	And put it on
EDL	00:08:44,799	00:08:46,335	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	So they had to California
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:53,247	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	IMovie montage Beverly Hillbillies whatever and
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:54,015	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Warner Brothers
EDL	00:08:54,015	00:08:58,879	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Q and their this is like the process back then but then maybe now I don't know but like they're heading from
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:09:05,279	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Department to department at Warner Brothers you know dealing with all of the new album things that need to happen
EDL	00:09:05,279	00:09:11,423	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	We're told to go see I think Rick Serena was his name and he seemed to be an okay guy in the Arctic
EDL	00:09:12,447	00:09:13,727	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Ways ahead of the Arts
EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:20,127	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	I was creative director at Warner Brother records he seemed to like what we were up to that one band that I pray
EDL	00:09:20,127	00:09:22,431	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Appreciated the most was Devo
EDL	00:09:22,431	00:09:28,831	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	I love the fact that they just never took anything very seriously do you remember that first meeting with
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:31,903	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Maryland you are remembered have a Polaroid
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:33,951	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	We showing the image

EDL	00:09:34,975	00:09:36,511	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	I thought it was clipart
EDL	00:09:36,511	00:09:39,327	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Yeah she does look a lot like clipart
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:41,631	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	And I guess I never asked
EDL	00:09:41,631	00:09:43,679	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	I only found out that it was
EDL	00:09:44,191	00:09:45,471	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Kim sometime later
EDL	00:09:46,239	00:09:48,543	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Well I guess what it is I just wanted to do vote for you
EDL	00:09:49,567	00:09:50,335	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Absurdity
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:56,735	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	I mean you have to think about what was going on back
EDL	00:09:56,735	00:09:57,759	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	In the day
EDL	00:09:57,759	00:09:58,783	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Artwork

EDL	00:10:00,831	00:10:01,855	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Has had rules
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:02,623	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Attached to it
EDL	00:10:02,623	00:10:03,391	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Most of them
EDL	00:10:03,391	00:10:05,695	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Albums were delivered to little mama
EDL	00:10:05,695	00:10:06,719	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Pop music
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:07,999	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Stores all around the country
EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:09,791	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Let there be sound
EDL	00:10:09,791	00:10:15,679	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Kid would come in at 4 after school and his job was to open up the box of records from
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:16,959	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Warner Brothers Are
EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:18,495	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Columbia what not and then rack
EDL	00:10:19,007	00:10:20,031	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Right
EDL	00:10:20,031	00:10:21,823	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	So the one thing that they
EDL	00:10:21,823	00:10:23,871	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Told all of us in the art Department
EDL	00:10:23,871	00:10:25,151	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Just don't screw that up
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:31,039	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	A rock band has to look like a rock band country western has to look like country western
EDL	00:10:31,039	00:10:36,159	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	They better have cowboy hats on otherwise they get Miss racked and then if people can't
EDL	00:10:36,159	00:10:37,439	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Find them in the rack
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:39,743	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Of the genre they're interested in they don't buy it
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:46,143	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	DeVos case the music was so unusual that it could have something
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:48,447	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Completely absurd on the cover and make
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:48,959	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Make sense
EDL	00:10:49,471	00:10:51,519	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	So even though it makes no sense
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:53,055	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	That a picture
EDL	00:10:53,055	00:10:54,847	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Of a flamboyant golfer
EDL	00:10:55,615	00:10:57,919	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Stolen from package of golf balls
EDL	00:10:58,431	00:11:03,551	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	As is the mascot of Devo it does make perfect sense because that's who
EDL	00:11:03,551	00:11:04,575	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	It was just like
EDL	00:11:04,575	00:11:08,671	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Pick something impossible and and react is just psyched like he loves
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:10,719	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	He loves working on this
EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:15,327	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	There you know it's there doing all the little designing things and giving me like
EDL	00:11:16,351	00:11:17,119	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Font
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:20,703	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Getting getting everything ready
EDL	00:11:21,215	00:11:22,495	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	He laid it all out
EDL	00:11:23,007	00:11:24,543	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Spectre colors
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:27,359	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	You know did the whole series thing where they give you
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:29,151	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	A transparency that amaka
EDL	00:11:29,151	00:11:30,431	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Right
EDL	00:11:30,431	00:11:31,455	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	And we approved
EDL	00:11:32,991	00:11:34,783	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	And 10 about two days later
EDL	00:11:35,295	00:11:36,319	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Who get this call
EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:38,623	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	And it's a big crisis
EDL	00:11:39,135	00:11:41,951	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	The car was from the vice president of business Affairs for
EDL	00:11:41,951	00:11:42,719	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Warner Brothers
EDL	00:11:42,719	00:11:43,487	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	David Berman
EDL	00:11:44,511	00:11:47,583	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Who was the guy that you would cast in a movie about the music
EDL	00:11:48,607	00:11:50,399	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	As a villain or is the hero
EDL	00:11:51,935	00:11:53,471	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Depends on your point of view
EDL	00:11:53,471	00:11:55,519	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	He was very smart very good at what he did
EDL	00:11:56,543	00:11:57,311	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Played Hardball
EDL	00:11:58,335	00:12:00,127	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	The first communication is

EDL	00:12:01,663	00:12:02,687	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	And I'm a fan of golf

EDL	00:12:14,463	00:12:17,535	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	I told you not everybody's memory is Crystal Clear regarding the story
EDL	00:12:17,535	00:12:20,607	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Not only have I never I have never seen chi chi

EDL	00:12:23,935	00:12:27,263	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Friend of mine never met him I never spoken to him
EDL	00:12:27,263	00:12:28,543	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Get this company sued
EDL	00:12:28,543	00:12:29,823	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	That part is accurate
EDL	00:12:29,823	00:12:32,127	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Does David Berman about maybe being sued
EDL	00:12:32,127	00:12:33,663	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Yes he did play hardball
EDL	00:12:33,663	00:12:35,711	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	But he says his objection was purely illegal
EDL	00:12:36,223	00:12:36,991	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Shirley
EDL	00:12:36,991	00:12:38,783	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	In California laws crystal clear
EDL	00:12:39,295	00:12:43,391	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	You can't use somebody's name or likeness for commercial purposes without their permission
EDL	00:12:43,391	00:12:46,207	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Had nothing to do with my being a golfer other than
EDL	00:12:46,719	00:12:50,303	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Because I was I knew that it was clearly Chi Chi Rodriguez
EDL	00:12:50,815	00:12:52,351	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	It wasn't the fact that he was likable
EDL	00:12:52,863	00:12:55,167	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Equipment Rory sabbatini I would have done the same thing
EDL	00:12:55,679	00:12:57,471	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Wait who is Rory sabbatini
EDL	00:12:57,471	00:12:58,239	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	He's a golfer
EDL	00:12:59,263	00:13:01,311	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	But nobody likes Rory sabbatini
EDL	00:13:01,311	00:13:04,895	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Why does nobody like Aurora's cavatini
EDL	00:13:04,895	00:13:05,663	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	I don't know
EDL	00:13:05,663	00:13:11,551	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Also Rory sabbatini was born in 1976 and would have been 2 years old when this Diva record came out but anyway
EDL	00:13:12,063	00:13:14,367	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	This all came as a real
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:15,135	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Blow
EDL	00:13:15,135	00:13:15,903	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	To the band
EDL	00:13:16,415	00:13:17,951	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	We're dumb fight in Creswell
EDL	00:13:17,951	00:13:18,463	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	We don't know what
EDL	00:13:19,999	00:13:21,279	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Curse words
EDL	00:13:21,791	00:13:22,303	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Giving up
EDL	00:13:23,071	00:13:26,655	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Let's just right Chichi letter and ask his permission
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:28,191	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	But in the meantime you know
EDL	00:13:28,703	00:13:31,775	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Corporate gears are rolling in money has been paid and
EDL	00:13:31,775	00:13:33,823	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Warner Brothers is expecting a product
EDL	00:13:34,335	00:13:35,615	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Sol Divas like
EDL	00:13:35,615	00:13:37,151	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Let's come up with a plan B
EDL	00:13:37,663	00:13:43,039	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	And they had this idea that actually involves another piece of The evolutionary are
EDL	00:13:43,039	00:13:47,135	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	The artist rendering of what the last four presidents would have looked like
EDL	00:13:47,647	00:13:48,671	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Had you combine them
EDL	00:13:49,183	00:13:52,511	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	The Ford Nixon Johnson and Kennedy all of their faces
EDL	00:13:52,511	00:13:53,279	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Mashed
EDL	00:13:53,279	00:13:53,791	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Together
EDL	00:13:54,303	00:13:56,607	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Mark mothersbaugh I just had the pictures lying around
EDL	00:13:56,607	00:13:57,119	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Neurosis
EDL	00:13:57,887	00:14:01,471	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	It is bizarre face that had John Kennedy's hairline and it had
EDL	00:14:01,983	00:14:05,823	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Lyndon Johnson's ears and Richard Nixon's nose
EDL	00:14:05,823	00:14:09,151	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	So the band brings that image to the Warner Brothers Art Department
EDL	00:14:09,151	00:14:11,711	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Why couldn't we just
EDL	00:14:11,711	00:14:12,991	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Beauty chichi
EDL	00:14:16,063	00:14:18,111	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	So that it isn't Chichi anymore
EDL	00:14:23,999	00:14:28,095	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	So basically like it was like building a mr. Potato Head Toy like they grafted
EDL	00:14:28,607	00:14:32,703	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Johnson's ears and Nixon's dos Chi-Chi's head reverse the mouth
EDL	00:14:33,215	00:14:38,079	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	I should I should actually I should say that the David Berman from was in business.
EDL	00:14:38,079	00:14:40,895	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	The time he doesn't remember the image being altered
EDL	00:14:41,407	00:14:47,807	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	So I sent him the original Chichi image from the from the golf balls and the Potato Head collage
EDL	00:14:47,807	00:14:48,575	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	I was just so he could
EDL	00:14:48,575	00:14:49,599	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	He could compare them
EDL	00:14:50,111	00:14:51,391	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Looking at it today
EDL	00:14:52,415	00:14:55,487	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	I wonder why I proved it cuz to me it still looks like a chicken
EDL	00:14:57,023	00:14:59,071	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Obviously I must have
EDL	00:14:59,071	00:15:00,607	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Interior strike Salt Lake
EDL	00:15:00,607	00:15:02,143	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	About three weeks later
EDL	00:15:02,655	00:15:05,471	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	A letter comes back from Chi-Chi's Representatives
EDL	00:15:08,287	00:15:10,335	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Yes Chichi thinks it's fine
EDL	00:15:10,335	00:15:11,615	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	To use that image
EDL	00:15:12,127	00:15:13,151	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	He just wants
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:14,175	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	50
EDL	00:15:14,175	00:15:14,943	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Records
EDL	00:15:14,943	00:15:15,967	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Christmas time
EDL	00:15:15,967	00:15:18,015	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	To give out to his friends and family
EDL	00:15:18,527	00:15:21,599	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	He wanted to say his friends and family look like like I'm going to record
EDL	00:15:21,599	00:15:22,367	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Right
EDL	00:15:22,367	00:15:22,879	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	He like that
EDL	00:15:23,391	00:15:24,415	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	And this is Mark mother
EDL	00:15:24,927	00:15:27,999	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	So it was at that point it's like we couldn't go back
EDL	00:15:27,999	00:15:30,559	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	It would date already printed the cover so now we had this
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:32,095	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Mutilated
EDL	00:15:32,095	00:15:33,119	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Potato face
EDL	00:15:33,631	00:15:34,655	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	For an album cover
EDL	00:15:35,679	00:15:39,519	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	And it didn't really look like the handsome Chichi anymore so I'm sure he was quite so
EDL	00:15:39,519	00:15:44,383	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Surprised when he got a box of them in the mail all our efforts were in fact
EDL	00:15:44,383	00:15:45,919	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	What it looks like in the end
EDL	00:15:46,431	00:15:48,479	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Is it Devo hit meanly trick
EDL	00:15:49,503	00:15:50,527	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Chi-Chi Rodriguez
EDL	00:15:51,039	00:15:54,111	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	And put out something made him look hideous
EDL	00:15:55,135	00:15:56,415	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	It was you. Was a mess
EDL	00:15:56,927	00:16:00,511	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	They did send Chichi a couple thousand dollars
EDL	00:16:00,511	00:16:03,583	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Also as well as the records he wasn't
EDL	00:16:03,583	00:16:04,351	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	The total loss
EDL	00:16:04,351	00:16:05,119	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	For him
EDL	00:16:05,119	00:16:07,679	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	But then they just then I never heard from him
EDL	00:16:08,959	00:16:09,727	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Celine ever
EDL	00:16:10,239	00:16:12,543	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Got his take on the album art or even
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:15,103	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	The songs on the album or anything like that which is
EDL	00:16:15,103	00:16:16,895	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	My reigning question and all of the
EDL	00:16:17,407	00:16:20,991	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	I really want to know if Chichi ever listen to that record and what he thought of us
EDL	00:16:21,759	00:16:22,783	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Yeah that would be the big
EDL	00:16:26,879	00:16:27,647	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Hello

EDL	00:16:36,351	00:16:39,167	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	He's in his early eighties now still handsome still plays golf
EDL	00:16:39,167	00:16:40,447	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Professionally
EDL	00:16:40,447	00:16:42,495	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Does a lot of philanthropic work through his
EDL	00:16:42,495	00:16:45,055	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Foundation annual charity event
EDL	00:16:45,055	00:16:47,359	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	It's really an honor to talk to you

EDL	00:16:54,271	00:16:58,111	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	It sounds like the best Johnny I love him so sweet
EDL	00:16:58,623	00:16:59,391	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	I love him
EDL	00:17:00,159	00:17:02,463	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Chichi says he remembers getting this letter
EDL	00:17:03,231	00:17:08,351	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	And he says he did give out those records to his friends and family
EDL	00:17:08,351	00:17:13,215	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Did you notice when you got the record that it didn't quite look like you that much
EDL	00:17:14,239	00:17:18,591	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	What it look like me and I look at the plushies it look like me a little bit
EDL	00:17:18,591	00:17:19,615	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	At least 1/2 look like
EDL	00:17:20,127	00:17:22,431	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	But I don't know anything about them messing with his face
EDL	00:17:22,943	00:17:25,247	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	And he had no idea that they were worried he was going to sue them
EDL	00:17:25,759	00:17:26,271	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Show them
EDL	00:17:27,039	00:17:30,623	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Well anybody that worried about somebody showing them
EDL	00:17:31,135	00:17:34,463	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	That they show people that they think that people are going to sue them
EDL	00:17:34,975	00:17:40,863	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	I thought it was this young people trying to make a career out of it and I could help him and that's it because I
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:47,519	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	I like to do something good every day of my life and I want to leave the the Earth better than I found it
EDL	00:17:47,519	00:17:49,567	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	So even young sort of
EDL	00:17:49,567	00:17:51,615	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Avant-garde Punk musicians you want to hell
EDL	00:17:52,127	00:17:52,639	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Yeah
EDL	00:17:53,407	00:17:54,943	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Did you listen to that record
EDL	00:17:55,711	00:17:57,759	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Yeah I listen to it one time
EDL	00:17:57,759	00:17:58,527	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Just once
EDL	00:17:58,527	00:18:01,087	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	I put away that you didn't like it
EDL	00:18:01,855	00:18:04,671	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	No I
EDL	00:18:05,183	00:18:06,463	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Nat King Cole
EDL	00:18:06,975	00:18:08,511	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Dean Martin was my favor
EDL	00:18:09,791	00:18:12,351	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Cuz music is not supposed to Rally up
EDL	00:18:12,351	00:18:14,143	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Music is something to bring you down
EDL	00:18:15,167	00:18:16,703	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	So the most important question
EDL	00:18:17,215	00:18:17,983	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Answer
EDL	00:18:17,983	00:18:24,383	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	He did he did not like it right and like it but as I was talking to that there's like a
EDL	00:18:24,383	00:18:26,431	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	A kind of Greater question here
EDL	00:18:26,943	00:18:27,967	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Which is like
EDL	00:18:28,991	00:18:30,783	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	What did he think about
EDL	00:18:30,783	00:18:31,807	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	His face
EDL	00:18:31,807	00:18:35,391	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Mutated version thereof
EDL	00:18:35,391	00:18:37,951	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Being on the cover of this apocalyptic
EDL	00:18:37,951	00:18:38,975	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Weirdo
EDL	00:18:38,975	00:18:40,255	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Art rock bands

EDL	00:25:58,016	00:25:59,296	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Talking to Katie Mingle
EDL	00:25:59,296	00:26:00,064	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	In 2010
EDL	00:26:03,392	00:26:07,744	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Before I was teaching in Langley I played in the heavy metal band
EDL	00:26:09,024	00:26:12,352	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	It never occurred to me to be a teacher I wasn't really good student myself
EDL	00:26:13,632	00:26:17,216	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Kids were okay but I wasn't all that gushy about them to be honest with you
EDL	00:26:17,216	00:26:23,616	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	I knew nothing about kids music I knew nothing about teaching I knew nothing but everything you know I'd hair
EDL	00:26:23,616	00:26:30,016	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Jared attitude weight 98 comes off I went to Langley and
EDL	00:26:30,016	00:26:36,416	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	I started teaching
EDL	00:26:36,416	00:26:38,208	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	I was having to pee dippy
EDL	00:26:38,976	00:26:42,304	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Reading of philosophy at all about teaching the head.
EDL	00:26:44,096	00:26:46,144	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	I can't really say I thought about it a lot
EDL	00:26:46,144	00:26:48,704	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	I know I had a lot of ideas about music
EDL	00:26:49,216	00:26:50,752	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	But sitting out about teaching
EDL	00:26:53,312	00:26:57,408	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	You know for me I mean I've been playing in bands since I was like 11 or 12 years old and
EDL	00:26:57,920	00:26:59,712	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	It wasn't like anybody taught us
EDL	00:26:59,712	00:27:01,760	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	It wasn't even like anybody said oh oh
EDL	00:27:01,760	00:27:04,320	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	This is the way you do it or that's the way you do it we just
EDL	00:27:04,320	00:27:07,392	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Certificated and I've been doing music like that since I was a little kid
EDL	00:27:08,160	00:27:13,536	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	So when I went in to teach music it never occurred to me that I was going to teach anybody how to read notes
EDL	00:27:14,048	00:27:16,864	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Or that I was going to teach anybody how to pass a test
EDL	00:27:19,936	00:27:23,520	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	The only thing I ever tried to teach children is really
EDL	00:27:23,520	00:27:25,824	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	It's just to fall in love with making music
EDL	00:27:25,824	00:27:27,616	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	But that was always my goal
EDL	00:27:45,024	00:27:46,304	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	I just thought songs I knew
EDL	00:27:46,816	00:27:51,168	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	And and and I was very good to David Bowie in those days that was variant Iggy Pop
EDL	00:27:51,936	00:27:56,032	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	I was into a fill soul Phil Spector records Brian Wilson
EDL	00:27:56,544	00:27:57,824	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	And it wasn't until much
EDL	00:27:57,824	00:27:58,848	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Later
EDL	00:27:58,848	00:28:00,128	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Did I realize that
EDL	00:28:00,640	00:28:01,664	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Songs with thematic
EDL	00:28:04,224	00:28:10,368	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	You know I had gotten a teaching job originally because I was with my girlfriend and she was having a baby and I needed a job
EDL	00:28:11,136	00:28:13,696	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	And by the time I got this job we're breaking up
EDL	00:28:13,696	00:28:14,976	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	And I think that
EDL	00:28:14,976	00:28:16,000	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	In the back of my
EDL	00:28:16,000	00:28:16,512	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Mind
EDL	00:28:17,280	00:28:19,584	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	You know I was feeling like a little bit lost
EDL	00:28:29,824	00:28:33,152	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Contrary to what people think a lot of kids aren't that happy
EDL	00:28:33,152	00:28:35,712	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	They'll have troubles they got problems at home
EDL	00:28:36,224	00:28:37,760	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	They can feel lonely.
EDL	00:28:37,760	00:28:38,528	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Isolated
EDL	00:28:39,040	00:28:40,576	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	And the music
EDL	00:28:41,344	00:28:43,392	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Can contract that feeling into them
EDL	00:28:43,392	00:28:44,928	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	The weather in Northridge
EDL	00:28:44,928	00:28:46,976	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Completely literally understand the words
EDL	00:28:47,488	00:28:49,280	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	I'm not sure sure that's so important
EDL	00:28:57,216	00:28:59,776	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	But I don't think Sheila when she was singing Desperado
EDL	00:29:00,544	00:29:03,616	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Reading knew what a lot of those references were about
EDL	00:29:04,128	00:29:06,432	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	But you certainly captured the feeling of the song
EDL	00:29:12,576	00:29:15,648	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Why don't you
EDL	00:29:27,424	00:29:33,056	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	But I know that
EDL	00:29:35,616	00:29:40,224	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Disney
EDL	00:29:42,784	00:29:44,320	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	When I heard other school choirs in
EDL	00:29:44,832	00:29:46,368	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Vis-a-vis so different
EDL	00:29:47,136	00:29:48,672	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	So weird
EDL	00:29:48,672	00:29:54,816	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Any good to know how to sing
EDL	00:29:55,328	00:30:01,472	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	I never thought of it in terms of its special cuz it was good I was out of interns it was special cuz it was different
EDL	00:30:14,528	00:30:20,928	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Oftentimes habitat 69
EDL	00:30:20,928	00:30:21,696	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Kids in my class
EDL	00:30:22,208	00:30:25,792	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	And it'd be all over the place because there's no room and we have instruments
EDL	00:30:26,304	00:30:29,888	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	We had no equipment so I brought in all the equipment for my band
EDL	00:30:29,888	00:30:32,448	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Which were used Marshall amplifiers in
EDL	00:30:32,448	00:30:35,776	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Bass guitars and all kinds of things are kids supposed to really like that
EDL	00:30:36,288	00:30:38,080	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Said it wasn't much room in kids room
EDL	00:30:38,080	00:30:40,128	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Practically on top of one another and
EDL	00:30:41,152	00:30:41,920	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	I just saw
EDL	00:30:42,432	00:30:43,712	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Arrange them according to height
EDL	00:30:55,488	00:30:59,584	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	I always felt like with my music teaching that I always was an outsider music
EDL	00:30:59,584	00:31:00,608	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Teacher you know I mean
EDL	00:31:01,120	00:31:02,400	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	I never I never really put
EDL	00:31:02,912	00:31:03,936	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	2 pages in a lot of
EDL	00:31:03,936	00:31:04,960	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Music
EDL	00:31:04,960	00:31:06,496	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Teaching events and all that kind
EDL	00:31:06,496	00:31:08,544	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	The stuff I was always like those little Island.
EDL	00:31:08,544	00:31:11,104	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	To myself you know people always uses this term
EDL	00:31:11,104	00:31:13,408	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Like thinking outside the box and all that but it's
EDL	00:31:13,408	00:31:14,176	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	I think
EDL	00:31:14,176	00:31:15,712	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	For me I didn't even know there was a bomb
EDL	00:31:16,224	00:31:17,248	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	You know I mean
EDL	00:31:27,232	00:31:30,048	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	It does have the sort of the Children of the Corn

EDL	00:31:41,312	00:31:42,592	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	It became kind of a

EDL	00:31:54,880	00:32:00,512	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	I couldn't quite believe it was a bunch of little kids on some Farm country in Canada
EDL	00:32:26,112	00:32:27,136	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Yeah I have students

EDL	00:32:35,072	00:32:38,656	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	I felt that the whole success of this would you really vindicating kind of
EDL	00:32:39,168	00:32:40,704	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	Experience it made me feel really like

EDL	00:32:43,264	00:32:48,384	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	So it was great I mean when you know what I'd always taught by students in a really positive way and then
EDL	00:32:48,896	00:32:53,504	| 328_Devolutionary_Design_pt_01 |	When somebody suddenly is positive about what you doing like that and it gives you a great feeling
