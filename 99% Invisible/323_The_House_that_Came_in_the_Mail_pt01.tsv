EDL	00:26:58,688	00:26:59,712	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Ran past the building
EDL	00:27:00,224	00:27:01,248	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	A trench and
EDL	00:27:01,248	00:27:03,296	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	At the time that B complex
EDL	00:27:04,320	00:27:08,416	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Ominous presence that you just kind of slipped passed on your bike
EDL	00:27:08,416	00:27:10,208	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Can I get to close to you
EDL	00:27:10,208	00:27:11,488	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	So you basically don't
EDL	00:27:11,488	00:27:12,256	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Engaged
EDL	00:27:12,256	00:27:13,792	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	It's not really something nice
EDL	00:27:13,792	00:27:14,304	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	If you go up to you just
EDL	00:27:14,816	00:27:21,216	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Psychopathic Eckley city blocks so it was really kind of between the parking lot in the
EDL	00:27:21,216	00:27:22,752	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Building was just this big empty
EDL	00:27:22,752	00:27:24,288	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Depressing city
EDL	00:27:24,288	00:27:27,360	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	And then suddenly you know I move back to the Midwest years later
EDL	00:27:27,360	00:27:28,384	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	And this place is
EDL	00:27:28,384	00:27:29,152	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Totally transform
EDL	00:27:29,920	00:27:31,712	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	It been renamed the Midtown Exchange
EDL	00:27:32,224	00:27:36,832	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	And it was full of all these little shops and eateries on the main floor plus offices
EDL	00:27:36,832	00:27:38,368	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Apartments and condos above
EDL	00:27:38,880	00:27:42,720	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	And those old realtrack that I'd like the long have been cleared and paved
EDL	00:27:42,720	00:27:44,256	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Turn into this Five Mile Greenway
EDL	00:27:45,024	00:27:47,328	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Which was really needed service ready-made Rails to Trails
EDL	00:27:47,840	00:27:54,240	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	And I got really interested in this. Just as a building but also as an urban phenomenon right like how they turn the
EDL	00:27:54,240	00:27:55,264	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	It's nothing into something
EDL	00:27:56,032	00:27:57,824	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	So I naturally being architecture
EDL	00:27:58,336	00:28:00,896	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Started digging into the history of stairs
EDL	00:28:01,408	00:28:02,688	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	And what did you find in your
EDL	00:28:02,688	00:28:03,456	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	And your research
EDL	00:28:03,456	00:28:04,736	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Well for starters
EDL	00:28:04,736	00:28:06,528	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Richard Warren Sears himself
EDL	00:28:06,528	00:28:09,600	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Was born in Minnesota where he actually started selling watches
EDL	00:28:09,600	00:28:10,368	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Channel 1800
EDL	00:28:11,136	00:28:13,184	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	10 overtime he moved operations
EDL	00:28:13,184	00:28:15,744	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	To Chicago and start growing out this larger mail order
EDL	00:28:16,768	00:28:20,352	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	And basically became the Amazon of the early 20th century
EDL	00:28:20,864	00:28:22,656	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	And in the 1920s
EDL	00:28:22,656	00:28:26,752	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	We started branching out even more adding retail outlets to their distribution centers
EDL	00:28:27,264	00:28:28,288	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	All the way from
EDL	00:28:28,288	00:28:28,800	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Boston to
EDL	00:28:29,824	00:28:31,872	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Can you show me pictures of bees they all looks
EDL	00:28:31,872	00:28:33,408	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Surprisingly similar even though they're like
EDL	00:28:33,408	00:28:34,944	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	What's scattered across the entire us
EDL	00:28:35,456	00:28:39,296	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	There's some different brake Styles but they're all kind of boxy that big windows
EDL	00:28:39,296	00:28:41,088	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	And other details income including
EDL	00:28:41,600	00:28:42,368	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	These really great
EDL	00:28:42,880	00:28:44,416	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Distinctive Art Deco style
EDL	00:28:44,416	00:28:45,696	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Powers Yeah
EDL	00:28:45,696	00:28:49,792	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Yeah they look a little bit like Castle Towers or something there a big giveaway
EDL	00:28:49,792	00:28:50,560	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	If you're ghetto
EDL	00:28:50,560	00:28:52,096	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Hunting these concert series build
EDL	00:28:52,096	00:28:56,448	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	The function to they basically concealed these huge Waters
EDL	00:28:56,960	00:28:58,752	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Is that didn't serve the floors below
EDL	00:28:59,264	00:29:02,848	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	And yeah what's you know you have the tower is in the other details
EDL	00:29:02,848	00:29:04,896	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	You can really easily start to spot
EDL	00:29:04,896	00:29:05,664	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Other Towers
EDL	00:29:05,664	00:29:06,176	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Another city
EDL	00:29:06,688	00:29:08,736	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	A lot of that commonality traces
EDL	00:29:08,736	00:29:09,504	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Back to this one
EDL	00:29:10,016	00:29:10,784	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	In particular
EDL	00:29:10,784	00:29:11,808	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	George Coleman
EDL	00:29:12,576	00:29:14,112	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	He did a lot of work for
EDL	00:29:14,112	00:29:14,880	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Serious
EDL	00:29:14,880	00:29:21,024	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	A mansion for the company president but he's mostly known for big
EDL	00:29:21,024	00:29:21,792	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Stihl commercial
EDL	00:29:22,304	00:29:25,632	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Among other things he worked on this really big early plan
EDL	00:29:25,632	00:29:26,912	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Administrative hub
EDL	00:29:26,912	00:29:27,680	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Four Seasons
EDL	00:29:28,448	00:29:29,984	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	But this is not the Sears Tower
EDL	00:29:29,984	00:29:33,824	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Chicago Willis Tower it's something else
EDL	00:29:33,824	00:29:39,200	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	About actually can many decades later but amazingly it was only like half again as big as this
EDL	00:29:39,200	00:29:41,760	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Really old complex
EDL	00:29:41,760	00:29:42,528	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Knows about
EDL	00:29:42,528	00:29:46,112	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	The old complex was built a bit West of downtown and it was about
EDL	00:29:46,112	00:29:47,392	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	3 million square feet
EDL	00:29:48,416	00:29:52,000	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	The company boasted that it was the largest commercial complex in the world at
EDL	00:29:53,024	00:29:54,560	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	And it's been multiple blocks
EDL	00:29:55,328	00:29:56,864	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Covered existing Street
EDL	00:29:56,864	00:30:02,240	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Could actually blocked off city streets and I had to get special permission of course from the city to do that
EDL	00:30:02,240	00:30:05,568	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	In the place basically function like a city within the city
EDL	00:30:05,568	00:30:06,848	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Had some power plant
EDL	00:30:06,848	00:30:07,360	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	It had its own
EDL	00:30:07,872	00:30:11,200	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Corporate employee based Fire Department
EDL	00:30:11,200	00:30:12,736	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	And it even has its own radio show
EDL	00:30:13,248	00:30:14,272	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	WLS
EDL	00:30:14,272	00:30:15,040	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Short for
EDL	00:30:15,040	00:30:15,808	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Worlds large
EDL	00:30:15,808	00:30:20,672	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Store commercial radio station that sell great
EDL	00:30:20,672	00:30:21,952	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Yeah I mean
EDL	00:30:21,952	00:30:27,584	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Sick of basically buying airtime
EDL	00:30:27,584	00:30:33,472	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Giant it's America's biggest retailer
EDL	00:30:33,984	00:30:38,080	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	And they just kept expanding to they kept following kind of where the country
EDL	00:30:38,080	00:30:39,616	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	If you took down at first the
EDL	00:30:39,616	00:30:42,176	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Did mail order where they serve rural populations
EDL	00:30:42,688	00:30:44,480	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Then they added these mixed-use plants
EDL	00:30:45,248	00:30:46,528	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	With retail outlets
EDL	00:30:46,528	00:30:47,552	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Surf City
EDL	00:30:47,552	00:30:50,112	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	And then if people moved out to the suburbs
EDL	00:30:50,112	00:30:50,880	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Going to the shopping
EDL	00:30:52,160	00:30:54,976	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Today obviously serious is not doing quite as well
EDL	00:30:55,488	00:30:57,024	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	And a lot of that complex in
EDL	00:30:57,024	00:30:58,816	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Chicago for example has been torn down
EDL	00:30:59,328	00:31:02,656	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	But some parts are still around and some of you
EDL	00:31:02,656	00:31:03,936	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Including that Central iconic
EDL	00:31:04,704	00:31:06,240	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Because it's really hard
EDL	00:31:06,240	00:31:07,264	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	To reuse
EDL	00:31:07,264	00:31:08,288	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	A million +
EDL	00:31:08,800	00:31:09,312	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Where feet inside of
EDL	00:31:09,824	00:31:15,968	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Yeah it's incredibly difficult almost impossible to find a single corporate client take that on
EDL	00:31:15,968	00:31:21,600	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	I am so like the one in Minneapolis for instance it had to bring in all these different stakeholders he's our local hospital
EDL	00:31:22,112	00:31:25,952	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	You get to see onboard another developers so that you know there was a plan to make it next
EDL	00:31:26,464	00:31:26,976	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Start
EDL	00:31:27,488	00:31:30,304	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	These buildings also has some advantages to 4 adapter
EDL	00:31:31,072	00:31:34,144	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Yeah they're built of 30 Concrete & Masonry
EDL	00:31:34,144	00:31:35,936	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	And they get a lot of light
EDL	00:31:35,936	00:31:38,496	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	On all sides because they have these huge windows
EDL	00:31:39,264	00:31:44,384	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	And so when you wrote me years and years ago it was in part a story about how cities are we using these
EDL	00:31:44,384	00:31:44,896	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Sears
EDL	00:31:45,408	00:31:46,176	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Buildings
EDL	00:31:46,176	00:31:48,224	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Yeah and that's what really fascinates me
EDL	00:31:48,992	00:31:55,392	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	It's it's not just you know that they're being reused but it's the story that they tell about the different cities they're being used in
EDL	00:31:55,392	00:31:57,952	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	So in some ways it's like this big Urban experiment
EDL	00:31:57,952	00:31:58,720	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	Put
EDL	00:31:59,232	00:32:00,256	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	These different box
EDL	00:32:00,256	00:32:03,584	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	But all the time of the same sort of similar in size
EDL	00:32:04,352	00:32:07,424	| 323_The_House_that_Came_in_the_Mail_pt01 |	You spread them out across the country and you abandon them
