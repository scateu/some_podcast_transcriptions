EDL	00:01:36,512	00:01:38,560	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Under the bleachers at the firing range
EDL	00:01:38,560	00:01:40,608	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	In the bottoms of washing machines
EDL	00:01:40,608	00:01:43,680	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	They are cheap and effective at making noise
EDL	00:01:43,680	00:01:44,960	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Less noisy
EDL	00:01:44,960	00:01:48,032	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Most ear plugs reduce Noise by about 30 decibels
EDL	00:01:48,544	00:01:54,688	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	That is Mary Roach author of a bunch of great books her latest one is called but it's about the science of humans at
EDL	00:01:55,200	00:01:57,248	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	30 decibels can be significant
EDL	00:01:57,248	00:02:00,320	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Every three decibel increase in a loud noise
EDL	00:02:00,320	00:02:01,088	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Cut in half
EDL	00:02:01,600	00:02:03,136	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	The amount of time you can be exposed
EDL	00:02:03,648	00:02:05,184	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Without risking hearing damage
EDL	00:02:06,208	00:02:12,608	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	To put that another way in unprotected human ear can spend 8 hours a day exposed to 85 decibels
EDL	00:02:12,608	00:02:13,632	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Without entering hearing loss
EDL	00:02:14,400	00:02:15,936	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	That's the level of freeway
EDL	00:02:18,240	00:02:21,312	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	85 decibels is also the level of a crowded restaurant
EDL	00:02:24,128	00:02:26,688	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	But if you go up to 115 decibels
EDL	00:02:26,688	00:02:27,712	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Things like a chainsaw
EDL	00:02:28,224	00:02:34,368	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Or a really loud concert
EDL	00:02:35,136	00:02:37,952	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Your safe exposure time is only half a minute
EDL	00:02:37,952	00:02:39,488	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Before your hearing can be affected
EDL	00:02:39,488	00:02:41,024	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	So without earplugs
EDL	00:02:41,024	00:02:44,608	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	You should only be exposed to the sound of a chainsaw for about 30 seconds
EDL	00:02:45,120	00:02:46,144	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	But with your plugs
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:48,192	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	You got closer to 8 hours
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:55,616	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	In a military situation or reduction of 30 decibels is especially helpful with a steady
EDL	00:02:55,616	00:02:56,896	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Finding background in
EDL	00:02:57,408	00:03:00,736	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Like say a Bradley tank clattering over asphalt
EDL	00:03:00,736	00:03:03,040	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Is it from of a Blackhawk helicopter
EDL	00:03:06,368	00:03:10,720	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	But there's a problem with ear plugs as the solution on a Battlefield
EDL	00:03:10,720	00:03:12,000	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	I will tell you that I
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:13,536	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	I've never seen a Marine

EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:26,592	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	And this is Eric Fallon

EDL	00:03:27,872	00:03:30,688	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	24 years of military experience
EDL	00:03:31,200	00:03:36,064	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	I've never seen soldiers put a passive ear plug in and go on a dismounted
EDL	00:03:36,064	00:03:36,576	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Control
EDL	00:03:37,088	00:03:41,952	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Soldiers aren't using their ear plugs because when they do they can't hear what's happening around them
EDL	00:03:42,464	00:03:47,584	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	And with unprotected ears a lot of service members are coming home from Battle with tinnitus
EDL	00:03:47,584	00:03:49,376	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Which is a ringing in your ears
EDL	00:03:49,888	00:03:50,400	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Or hearing
EDL	00:03:50,912	00:03:54,240	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	It's not uncommon anyone especially in the Infantry
EDL	00:03:54,752	00:03:55,264	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Will
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:03:57,568	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Pretty much tell you that they have hearing loss
EDL	00:03:58,336	00:04:01,408	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	When Aaron and his buddies get together in social situations
EDL	00:04:01,408	00:04:03,456	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Everyone speaks a little louder
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:07,040	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	You know when we get together everybody knows who has the worst
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:08,320	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Amount of hearing loss

EDL	00:04:11,136	00:04:12,928	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	We know what year are they
EDL	00:04:12,928	00:04:16,256	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	They tend to have hearing loss and I can tell you two or three

EDL	00:04:21,887	00:04:23,679	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	I need to speak to his left ear
EDL	00:04:23,679	00:04:27,519	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Well Aaron's fellow Marines are naturally understanding about his hearing loss
EDL	00:04:28,031	00:04:30,079	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	His wife and kids find a challenging

EDL	00:04:44,415	00:04:46,463	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Or ask them as though you forgot

EDL	00:04:57,727	00:04:59,263	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Think about how long we've lived with that
EDL	00:04:59,775	00:05:03,871	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	I'm really without a solution the solution is to put something in your ears

EDL	00:05:05,407	00:05:09,247	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	And by the way it doesn't just bought the sound that we want to prevent it blogs
EDL	00:05:09,247	00:05:09,759	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	All the same
EDL	00:05:11,551	00:05:15,903	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Since World War II the VA has been reporting on what kind of injuries they treat
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:22,047	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	And tinnitus and hearing loss have always been the number one and number two most prevalent injuries

EDL	00:05:45,599	00:05:48,415	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	But Eric's main focus is trying to find Solutions

EDL	00:06:00,703	00:06:04,287	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	And he's fond of saying that the military has a noise problem but
EDL	00:06:04,287	00:06:05,567	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	We have a significant
EDL	00:06:05,567	00:06:06,335	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Quiet problem
EDL	00:06:07,359	00:06:11,967	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	What do you mean to that service members in combat need ear protection that works for them in both environment

EDL	00:06:18,623	00:06:21,695	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	In a war zone you have to consider everything
EDL	00:06:21,695	00:06:24,255	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Even just walking down the road has a strategy

EDL	00:06:30,143	00:06:32,191	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	If troops walked along in a clump like

EDL	00:06:36,031	00:06:39,871	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	So they try to keep at least 15 feet between each other on Patrols
EDL	00:06:39,871	00:06:42,943	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	But the more spread out they are the harder it is to hear one another
EDL	00:06:43,967	00:06:47,295	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Troops in combat might walk in the quiet for hours
EDL	00:06:47,295	00:06:49,343	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	The only two ways being is a little bit of
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:50,111	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Chatting
EDL	00:06:50,111	00:06:52,415	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	The sound of gravel crunching under their boots
EDL	00:06:52,927	00:06:53,695	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	And then suddenly
EDL	00:06:54,207	00:07:00,351	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	This is a video that Eric Fallon likes to show of troops on patrol in Iraq
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:02,911	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	These troops were just walking along
EDL	00:07:03,423	00:07:04,191	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Avon
EDL	00:07:05,727	00:07:07,775	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	And then all of a sudden things got
EDL	00:07:07,775	00:07:08,543	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Genetic very quickly
EDL	00:07:11,359	00:07:12,639	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Are you okay
EDL	00:07:12,639	00:07:15,711	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	In the video when the truth comes Under Fire
EDL	00:07:15,711	00:07:16,735	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	All the soldiers
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:18,783	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Boulder ground who can shoot it it's allowed
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:21,087	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	They probably aren't wearing hearing protection
EDL	00:07:21,855	00:07:25,439	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	But Eric says the pencil damage to their ears isn't the only boy
EDL	00:07:26,207	00:07:27,487	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Their lives are in danger
EDL	00:07:27,999	00:07:29,279	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	And they're hearing
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:31,583	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Turn on the main things helping them figure out what to do
EDL	00:07:32,095	00:07:35,935	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Just because they're being shot at doesn't mean that they understand what's happening to
EDL	00:07:36,959	00:07:40,287	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	They may not know am I being shot at by 50 people or three
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:44,639	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	What's happening to the left of me what's happening to the right of me
EDL	00:07:44,639	00:07:48,991	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	One of the major tools to figure out what's happening in this situation is Radio
EDL	00:07:49,503	00:07:54,111	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	With a radio you can connect to someone who has more of a bird's-eye view of the place
EDL	00:07:54,111	00:07:56,159	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	This might be another Soldier somewhere on a roof
EDL	00:07:56,671	00:07:58,719	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Or someone monitoring from a drone camera
EDL	00:07:59,487	00:08:05,887	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Communication will help the person on the ground answer all the questions running through their head in that moment what do I do do I
EDL	00:08:05,887	00:08:06,911	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Push through the assault
EDL	00:08:07,423	00:08:08,447	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Do I hold in place
EDL	00:08:08,959	00:08:11,007	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Do I wait for the quick reaction force
EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:11,775	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Succumb
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:12,799	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	And help us
EDL	00:08:13,311	00:08:15,103	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	How do I call in air support
EDL	00:08:16,639	00:08:17,663	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	But it's loud
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:21,247	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	They can probably barely hear what the other people around them are saying
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:25,343	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	I love butts on the radio and if I can't hear the signal
EDL	00:08:25,343	00:08:28,927	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	I may be missing the information that I need to make the right decision
EDL	00:08:29,439	00:08:34,815	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	And so you are seen that video there's a young Soldier laying on the ground communicating over the radio and
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:36,863	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	And just before the video stops
EDL	00:08:37,887	00:08:39,167	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	You'll hear him say
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:40,191	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	I can't hear you
EDL	00:08:48,639	00:08:51,967	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	A point that I try to make whenever I use that video is
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:55,295	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	That's probably one of the more important communication
EDL	00:08:55,295	00:08:59,135	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	That not only that person but his team members will ever have in their life
EDL	00:09:01,183	00:09:03,743	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Because they're under direct enemy fire
EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:07,583	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Being able to hear the radio and each other is crucial to their survival
EDL	00:09:08,863	00:09:11,423	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Eric believes that he has a solution to this problem
EDL	00:09:11,935	00:09:16,543	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	He thinks that service members on dismounted combat controls like the one in that video
EDL	00:09:16,543	00:09:18,847	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Should be wearing a device called TCAP
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:22,943	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Soe tactical communication and protective systems or TCAP
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:27,039	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	I'm all products that are designed to not only deliver hearing for
EDL	00:09:27,039	00:09:27,807	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Protection
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:34,207	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	But to allow you a better ability to hear what's happening around you so you can maintain situational awareness
EDL	00:09:34,207	00:09:36,255	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Tea cups come in a couple of styles
EDL	00:09:36,255	00:09:39,839	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	One style fits inside your ear kind of like a pair of earbuds
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:41,887	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Any other style fits over here
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:45,727	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	And they look like that your love seem like we're while operating power tools
EDL	00:09:46,239	00:09:52,639	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Both styles are equipped with environmental microphones that pick up the sounds around you and feed them into your
EDL	00:09:52,639	00:09:55,711	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Careers at levels that your eardrums can tolerate
EDL	00:09:55,711	00:09:57,247	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	And in some cases these products
EDL	00:09:58,271	00:10:02,879	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Integrated into a radio system so that you can have more seamless
EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:03,391	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Two way radio
EDL	00:10:05,183	00:10:10,303	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	With the radio feature you could be talking with a drone operator or communicating with a command center
EDL	00:10:10,303	00:10:12,607	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	And you can actually hear what they're saying to you
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:15,167	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Because the device is blocking out other noise
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:16,447	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	And yes
EDL	00:10:16,447	00:10:19,263	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	3M the company Eric works for cells tcaps
EDL	00:10:19,775	00:10:25,407	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	But he's also an audiologist who's dedicated his career to protecting the hearing of people in the military
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:28,735	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Eric sent as a few of the over-the-ear style tcaps
EDL	00:10:28,735	00:10:30,015	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Headsets to dry out
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:31,295	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Powerball
EDL	00:10:33,855	00:10:36,671	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Each pair have a power button that allows you to
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:38,207	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	You toggle between a few settings
EDL	00:10:44,095	00:10:48,447	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	99 Pi producers
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:53,823	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Katie mingle and Sam Greenspan tested out the tcaps in front of our office where there's been a bunch of loud
EDL	00:10:53,823	00:10:55,103	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Destruction happening all week
EDL	00:10:55,615	00:10:57,407	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Nkt recorded what the world sounds
EDL	00:10:58,175	00:10:58,687	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Through her teeth
EDL	00:11:08,927	00:11:11,999	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	So in this clip Katie and Sam are standing on the sidewalk
EDL	00:11:11,999	00:11:12,767	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Rock wearing tcaps
EDL	00:11:13,279	00:11:14,303	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Looking like a
EDL	00:11:14,303	00:11:15,071	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	A couple of weirdos
EDL	00:11:16,095	00:11:17,119	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	People are walking path
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:19,167	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	How to spell construction worker is sweeping
EDL	00:11:19,679	00:11:22,751	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	And despite the fact that they're wearing big padded earmuffs
EDL	00:11:22,751	00:11:24,031	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	I can hear it all really well
EDL	00:11:27,871	00:11:30,943	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Because the environment of microphones are picking up the noise around them
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:32,223	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Feeding into their ears
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:42,207	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	That's am talking to Katy using the radio feature on the tcaps
EDL	00:11:44,255	00:11:49,375	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Mail someone has started to saw through the concrete nearby but the tcaps are attenuating the sound
EDL	00:11:50,143	00:11:51,679	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	So that Sam and Katie
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:52,191	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Still here at
EDL	00:11:52,703	00:11:54,495	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	It's a much lower volume
EDL	00:11:54,495	00:11:56,031	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	But if they take the keycaps off
EDL	00:12:04,479	00:12:10,111	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	I won't make it within that very long but basically the tcaps allowed Katie and Sam to communicate
EDL	00:12:10,111	00:12:12,671	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Through some very loud construction noises
EDL	00:12:12,671	00:12:14,207	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	While also protecting their ears
EDL	00:12:14,719	00:12:17,535	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	And when it was quiet they were able to hear the environment around them
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:18,815	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Soft sounds
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:19,583	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Like sweeping
EDL	00:12:19,583	00:12:20,607	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	And people talking
EDL	00:12:20,607	00:12:25,215	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Teacups are also being marketed for use in industrial and construction settings
EDL	00:12:25,215	00:12:28,287	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Just like the one Katie and Sam were standing in the middle of
EDL	00:12:28,287	00:12:29,567	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	In the military
EDL	00:12:29,567	00:12:34,687	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	They've been used since the early 2000 mostly by Special Operations groups like Navy Seals
EDL	00:12:35,199	00:12:36,735	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	But they're not standard issue
EDL	00:12:36,735	00:12:41,087	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Even for troops in combat who would be exposed to the kind of noise that can damage your hearing
EDL	00:12:41,599	00:12:42,879	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	The conventional forces
EDL	00:12:43,391	00:12:48,767	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Do what I think that conventional forces of done for many many years they just did
EDL	00:12:48,767	00:12:51,071	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Except that communicating is going to be a challenge
EDL	00:12:51,839	00:12:54,399	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Communication challenges and hearing loss
EDL	00:12:54,399	00:12:56,959	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	So much a part of the culture of combat
EDL	00:12:56,959	00:12:58,751	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	The Earth says when he was a soldier
EDL	00:12:58,751	00:13:00,543	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	He actually wanted hearing loss
EDL	00:13:00,543	00:13:02,591	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	So the people would know he had experience
EDL	00:13:03,103	00:13:07,199	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	So if you didn't have a degree of hearing loss it was obvious that you were one of the new guys
EDL	00:13:07,711	00:13:14,111	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	I meant that you had not really been around much noise and you really have not fired that many artillery
EDL	00:13:14,111	00:13:14,879	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Rounds down range
EDL	00:13:16,415	00:13:21,535	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Well soldiers are actively serving they do have to undergo fairly comprehensive hearing test
EDL	00:13:21,535	00:13:22,815	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Send periodic check out
EDL	00:13:22,815	00:13:25,375	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	These tests are administered by an audiologist
EDL	00:13:25,887	00:13:31,263	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	But the results of those tests get passed onto the unit commander and he or she decides what to do with them
EDL	00:13:31,775	00:13:34,591	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	And a soldier who is found to have degraded hearing
EDL	00:13:34,591	00:13:37,151	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Often won't be taken out of their position
EDL	00:13:37,151	00:13:40,479	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	We're just so accustomed to finding work around
EDL	00:13:40,479	00:13:40,991	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	With hearing loss
EDL	00:13:41,503	00:13:44,063	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	You will sometimes fine soldiers that have a c
EDL	00:13:44,063	00:13:45,599	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Significant degree of hearing loss
EDL	00:13:46,111	00:13:49,951	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	But their unit leadership may be so dependent on that
EDL	00:13:49,951	00:13:50,719	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	A person
EDL	00:13:50,719	00:13:53,023	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	But they also want that person to
EDL	00:13:53,023	00:13:54,559	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	I remain where they are
EDL	00:13:55,071	00:13:59,167	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	I look forward to the day when we put as much info
EDL	00:13:59,679	00:14:01,983	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	Tips on maintaining good hearing
EDL	00:14:01,983	00:14:03,519	| 99pi-0222-combathearingloss-1 |	As we do good vision
