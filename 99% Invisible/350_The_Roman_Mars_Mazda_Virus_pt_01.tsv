EDL	00:00:45,568	00:00:47,616	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	We got an email from getting been
EDL	00:00:47,616	00:00:49,408	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	He lives in Houston

EDL	00:00:50,432	00:00:51,712	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Huge fan of pikas
EDL	00:00:52,480	00:00:54,016	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	He has his own podcast
EDL	00:00:54,016	00:00:57,088	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	He said he listened to over 100 podcasts which like
EDL	00:00:57,088	00:00:58,112	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Possible
EDL	00:00:58,624	00:01:01,440	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	He said that the one complaint he has about his podcast app
EDL	00:01:01,440	00:01:04,512	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Is that a lease how much time he spends listening to podcasts
EDL	00:01:05,024	00:01:09,632	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Who tells me how many overall days of podcasts I've listened to
EDL	00:01:09,632	00:01:11,680	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And it's just more and more depressing
EDL	00:01:11,680	00:01:12,960	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	You know you like to guess
EDL	00:01:13,472	00:01:14,240	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Sure yes

EDL	00:01:19,360	00:01:21,152	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And recently he started having this
EDL	00:01:21,152	00:01:22,432	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Very strange podcast
EDL	00:01:24,992	00:01:25,504	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	So
EDL	00:01:26,016	00:01:26,528	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Ben
EDL	00:01:27,040	00:01:31,136	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Not too long ago got a new car it was a 2016 Mazda 6
EDL	00:01:31,648	00:01:32,672	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:01:32,672	00:01:34,976	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	The thing that he was most excited about in his new car
EDL	00:01:35,488	00:01:36,000	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	With that
EDL	00:01:36,512	00:01:41,376	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	He compared his phone using bluetooth so that he could listen to podcasts before he was like yes
EDL	00:01:42,400	00:01:43,424	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	For some reason
EDL	00:01:44,448	00:01:46,496	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	The radio in his new car
EDL	00:01:46,496	00:01:48,800	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Refuses to play one podcast
EDL	00:01:49,312	00:01:50,592	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And one podcast only
EDL	00:01:52,896	00:01:54,432	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	The radiotopia podcasts
EDL	00:01:54,432	00:01:55,456	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	99percentinvisible
EDL	00:01:55,968	00:01:56,736	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Really
EDL	00:01:56,736	00:01:59,296	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Yes and it's driving him absolutely insane
EDL	00:01:59,808	00:02:02,112	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	His car Bluetooth has rejected
EDL	00:02:02,624	00:02:03,904	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Roman Mars and his stories
EDL	00:02:05,184	00:02:09,792	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Yes I'm obviously like for people who don't know 90% visible host by Roman Mars
EDL	00:02:09,792	00:02:12,352	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	It's really great non-fiction podcast they tell
EDL	00:02:12,352	00:02:16,960	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Like always art design like how things work in the world and why they're made
EDL	00:02:16,960	00:02:19,008	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	The way they're made like the stories behind those things
EDL	00:02:20,288	00:02:23,104	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And apparently is the one I guess it doesn't work on his car
EDL	00:02:23,616	00:02:24,128	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	That's right
EDL	00:02:24,640	00:02:27,200	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Turn fan to play 99% invisible
EDL	00:02:27,200	00:02:31,552	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Through his car stereo while he was on the phone with me can you tell me exactly where you're sitting at the MoMA
EDL	00:02:32,832	00:02:35,136	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	I am sitting at my driver seat in my
EDL	00:02:35,136	00:02:37,440	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	2016 Mazda 6
EDL	00:02:38,464	00:02:39,744	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:02:40,256	00:02:41,792	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Let me know when you press play
EDL	00:02:44,096	00:02:45,376	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Press play right now
EDL	00:02:45,888	00:02:51,264	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	This is 99% invisible I'm Roman Mars
EDL	00:02:51,776	00:02:52,544	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	But
EDL	00:02:52,544	00:02:56,128	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Like the display screen stops working at totally freezes
EDL	00:02:56,128	00:02:57,920	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	The buttons aren't working properly
EDL	00:02:58,432	00:03:00,224	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	He has no control it's just for playing on the phone
EDL	00:03:02,016	00:03:08,416	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Record screen at all it still says whatever I played right before I presented
EDL	00:03:08,416	00:03:10,464	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And then after about a minute
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:11,744	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Passover
EDL	00:03:11,744	00:03:15,584	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	What you saw
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:17,376	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And now it's cut off Andre
EDL	00:03:17,376	00:03:18,144	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Restart it
EDL	00:03:18,144	00:03:21,472	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And I'm not playing 90% invisible anymore because every time I've done that
EDL	00:03:21,984	00:03:23,520	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	It's still playing it will freeze
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:29,152	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	How can you have a type problem where the trigger was
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:29,920	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Like content
EDL	00:03:30,432	00:03:32,480	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	You know it's weird right it's very weird
EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:34,272	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	It's like it would make more sense to me if like
EDL	00:03:34,784	00:03:36,576	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	A broken a time you try to listen like
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:38,368	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Podcasts at work
EDL	00:03:38,880	00:03:40,160	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	It didn't work for Car Talk
EDL	00:03:40,672	00:03:46,048	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Okay maybe his car doesn't want to hear stories about sick cars maybe that's like upsetting or something like that
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:50,656	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	I really like that you've immediately got two cars a cheap sentience
EDL	00:03:51,936	00:03:53,728	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	You have any theories about what's going on
EDL	00:03:54,752	00:03:57,568	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	I don't know my best guess is that
EDL	00:03:58,080	00:04:02,432	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Because I looked at the file sizes and I listen to things like hardcore history and
EDL	00:04:02,432	00:04:04,736	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	A blank check which have big file sizes
EDL	00:04:05,248	00:04:10,624	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And it's not that my best guess is maybe he's using some sort of weird
EDL	00:04:11,136	00:04:12,416	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Audio codec
EDL	00:04:13,952	00:04:16,256	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Interac streams with my
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:19,071	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	System but I really couldn't tell you
EDL	00:04:19,071	00:04:19,839	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	So I don't know
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:25,727	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Ben thinks that because Romans voice is so like warm and closing his podcasts
EDL	00:04:26,495	00:04:30,079	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Maybe he's doing something specific and Technical
EDL	00:04:30,079	00:04:31,871	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	To the files to achieve that
EDL	00:04:31,871	00:04:34,431	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	That would be my actual gas is like it's like a
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:37,503	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	There's something about the actual kind of
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:41,855	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	File the way that Roman is putting you converting his bike as soon MP3
EDL	00:04:41,855	00:04:43,391	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Does just like too complicated for Ben's
EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:44,415	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Car system
EDL	00:04:44,927	00:04:46,975	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And I was thinking about it and I was like
EDL	00:04:47,999	00:04:52,351	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	These are the two constants in his problem one is the podcast it's always the same pot
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:54,143	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Any other has been it's always the same radio
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:55,935	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	I was like maybe just act like a battery
EDL	00:04:56,703	00:05:00,543	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	But even if it's a bad radio silly Jersey just like why is this radio bad
EDL	00:05:00,543	00:05:01,311	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Only
EDL	00:05:01,823	00:05:02,591	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Not only that
EDL	00:05:03,103	00:05:03,615	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	But

EDL	00:05:11,551	00:05:14,111	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	With exactly the same podcast that is so weird
EDL	00:05:15,647	00:05:20,255	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	All right

EDL	00:05:51,487	00:05:52,511	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Totally
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:57,375	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	So I told Roman why I was telling him and I told him about what was going on with in the car
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:05:58,655	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	There's one
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:01,727	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	That causes his car stereo
EDL	00:06:01,727	00:06:02,751	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Jefferies
EDL	00:06:03,263	00:06:05,055	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Shutdown and restart
EDL	00:06:05,567	00:06:08,639	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And Roman had actually heard about this problem
EDL	00:06:08,639	00:06:09,407	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	From other listener
EDL	00:06:09,407	00:06:11,455	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Yeah I don't know what it is

EDL	00:06:16,319	00:06:17,343	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	But
EDL	00:06:18,367	00:06:20,415	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	I've never really figured it out
EDL	00:06:20,415	00:06:22,207	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	All Roman nose is that
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:22,975	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	In some cars
EDL	00:06:23,487	00:06:25,023	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Bluetooth classic car radio
EDL	00:06:25,535	00:06:27,327	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	What's 99percentinvisible
EDL	00:06:27,327	00:06:28,351	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Cousin everything to break
EDL	00:06:29,119	00:06:30,911	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	But he has no idea why
EDL	00:06:30,911	00:06:31,935	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	So
EDL	00:06:31,935	00:06:32,959	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Iran Bentley
EDL	00:06:33,727	00:06:36,287	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	He's like what Roman obviously cares about the
EDL	00:06:36,799	00:06:40,895	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Sort of texture of the sound maybe he's doing something very specific to his file
EDL	00:06:41,919	00:06:43,199	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And I'm curious little
EDL	00:06:43,199	00:06:45,503	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	What is what is your setup like
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:47,807	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	You have a strange microphone of some kind
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:51,391	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	No I mean we have
EDL	00:06:51,391	00:06:52,671	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	A couple are you
EDL	00:06:52,671	00:06:54,975	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Like a shotgun mic in the studio
EDL	00:06:54,975	00:06:59,327	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	But you're not using some kind of special encoding settings that are different from the rest of radiotopia
EDL	00:07:02,655	00:07:06,239	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Roman said that he had a theory that he's actually pretty confident about which is
EDL	00:07:06,751	00:07:07,519	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	The thing that makes
EDL	00:07:08,031	00:07:10,079	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	His podcast unusual
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:10,847	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Is that
EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:12,383	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	It uses the percent sign
EDL	00:07:12,383	00:07:13,663	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Percent sign
EDL	00:07:13,663	00:07:16,223	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	As into % 99percentinvisible
EDL	00:07:17,759	00:07:18,527	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Oh
EDL	00:07:20,063	00:07:23,903	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	He was like it must just not play well with the stereo for some reason
EDL	00:07:23,903	00:07:24,927	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	So it's like
EDL	00:07:24,927	00:07:31,071	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Because it's Derek also display the name of the podcast there's something about just there being a symbol where does inspector to be a symbol where it
EDL	00:07:32,095	00:07:37,215	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Brakes and it really bums Roman out honestly he's been hearing about it for years
EDL	00:07:37,727	00:07:39,519	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	From other people who are not been
EDL	00:07:40,031	00:07:40,543	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	But
EDL	00:07:41,055	00:07:42,847	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Like what can you do about it
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:44,895	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	He's not going to change the name of the podcast
EDL	00:07:45,407	00:07:50,271	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	You know like I would love it to be fixed and I really if someone is a fan of the show I really hate for them not to be able to hear it
EDL	00:07:50,783	00:07:57,183	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	I wish I could be better but I think I recognize the futility of me fighting and I think is that I feel
EDL	00:07:57,183	00:08:00,255	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Like a primary fundamental tenet
EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:01,023	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Super tech support
EDL	00:08:01,535	00:08:03,583	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Is a realizing that something is futile
EDL	00:08:04,095	00:08:06,655	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And relever well outside of our capability
EDL	00:08:07,167	00:08:07,679	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:08:08,447	00:08:12,799	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Putting on a football helmet and running headfirst into it anyway
EDL	00:08:12,799	00:08:15,103	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	I mean if you solve it I would be
EDL	00:08:15,103	00:08:16,127	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Really grateful
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:20,735	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	It just said it just like when it just seemed like there's these those were those things were
EDL	00:08:20,735	00:08:22,271	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	All these Technologies are
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:24,063	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Butting up against each other
EDL	00:08:25,599	00:08:26,879	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And all I am
EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:29,183	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Is some little bit of grit
EDL	00:08:29,695	00:08:30,463	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	That
EDL	00:08:30,463	00:08:32,511	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Gets caught between the gears
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:34,303	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Youku
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:36,351	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Companies
EDL	00:08:36,863	00:08:37,631	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	You know
EDL	00:08:37,631	00:08:39,167	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Not knowing how to
EDL	00:08:39,679	00:08:41,471	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Past things off and talk to each other
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:42,751	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	That's what I feel like I am
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:46,591	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	The irony of this was crazy make
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:48,383	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	99percentinvisible
EDL	00:08:48,895	00:08:52,991	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Podcast dedicated to explaining the beauty of good design
EDL	00:08:52,991	00:08:56,831	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	That is the one podcast that breaks when you try and play it on Ben's Mazda
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:09:01,951	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	It just felt like an imbalance in the universe that I had to correct and
EDL	00:09:01,951	00:09:03,999	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Romans theory about the percent sign
EDL	00:09:03,999	00:09:05,791	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	It felt really plausible to me
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:07,327	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	So I thought I'd start there
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:08,095	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And I figured like
EDL	00:09:08,607	00:09:10,655	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	If a percent sign car trouble
EDL	00:09:10,655	00:09:11,679	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Because it's a special character
EDL	00:09:12,447	00:09:14,751	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Other special characters to break the car to
EDL	00:09:14,751	00:09:16,287	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	So I just wanted to test that theory
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:19,871	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Visit your thing like classic tech support problem like you have to
EDL	00:09:19,871	00:09:21,407	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Replicate the glitch
EDL	00:09:21,407	00:09:23,455	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	To understand it to solve it exact
EDL	00:09:25,247	00:09:31,647	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	So I started thinking about other special characters like you know what about like the carrot or the curly brackets or
EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:32,159	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Whatever
EDL	00:09:32,671	00:09:37,023	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Curly brackets
EDL	00:09:37,023	00:09:38,047	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Okay
EDL	00:09:38,047	00:09:38,815	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	So
EDL	00:09:38,815	00:09:41,887	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	We wanted to make a podcast that would break his stare
EDL	00:09:42,911	00:09:44,703	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And to do that we divide the test
EDL	00:09:44,703	00:09:45,983	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Who's we
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:46,495	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Me

EDL	00:13:04,127	00:13:10,527	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	A berry cough with tea is basically a pancake with berries in it but instead of being cooked on the stove it's
EDL	00:13:10,527	00:13:11,295	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Cooked in the oven
EDL	00:13:11,295	00:13:12,063	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Okay
EDL	00:13:12,063	00:13:13,599	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Do you feel like this
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:16,415	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	I feel very well for a Mazda
EDL	00:13:16,415	00:13:19,743	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	What you have to understand about this is this isn't your average cooking show
EDL	00:13:19,743	00:13:25,375	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Because the only way that you could give me instructions as by telling me the ingredients were less than approximately or greater than
EDL	00:13:25,887	00:13:26,399	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	We need a
EDL	00:13:29,471	00:13:30,751	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	I have my heart
EDL	00:13:30,751	00:13:32,031	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Hbase
EDL	00:13:32,543	00:13:35,359	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Less than approximately are greater than some other thing
EDL	00:13:35,871	00:13:37,407	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	So I let me find an example
EDL	00:13:38,175	00:13:44,575	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	The measurement for the sugar should be about do you have you ever had one of those toys that you eat
EDL	00:13:44,575	00:13:45,599	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Stress balls
EDL	00:13:45,599	00:13:46,367	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Yes
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:48,927	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Okay you should put about a stress ball amount of
EDL	00:13:50,207	00:13:52,767	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	So you're saying like greater than one of those Super Bowl
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:54,047	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	This is
EDL	00:13:54,047	00:13:55,327	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Greater than a Super Bowl
EDL	00:14:00,447	00:14:01,983	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Okay okay
EDL	00:14:02,495	00:14:08,895	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	For the eggs can you add an amount of exits greater than the number of nipples you have
EDL	00:14:08,895	00:14:10,175	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	So you're saying like
EDL	00:14:10,943	00:14:12,735	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Less than the sides of a
EDL	00:14:12,735	00:14:13,503	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Square
EDL	00:14:13,503	00:14:14,271	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Correct
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:15,295	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Anyway
EDL	00:14:15,295	00:14:19,135	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	At the barre class 40 I made as you might imagine.
EDL	00:14:19,135	00:14:20,671	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Was not edible
EDL	00:14:20,671	00:14:22,207	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	So did this break the Mazda
EDL	00:14:22,719	00:14:24,255	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	He popped it in the podcast player
EDL	00:14:25,535	00:14:27,071	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Hi this is so mean
EDL	00:14:27,071	00:14:29,375	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Go get the greater than less than
EDL	00:14:29,375	00:14:31,423	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	It seems to be working just fine
EDL	00:14:33,471	00:14:35,519	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	So at this point we have tried
EDL	00:14:35,519	00:14:36,287	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	The carrot
EDL	00:14:36,287	00:14:42,687	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	The tilde the less than sign the greater than sign we made another podcast where we tested the play
EDL	00:14:42,687	00:14:44,223	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Plus sign equal sign
EDL	00:14:44,223	00:14:45,503	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	The curly brackets
EDL	00:14:45,503	00:14:46,783	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	None of them
EDL	00:14:46,783	00:14:48,063	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Replicating is prop
EDL	00:14:49,087	00:14:55,487	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Have you ever had that thing happened where you go to get like an object repaired and the people and repair chapter about the object differently than you care about it
EDL	00:14:55,487	00:14:56,255	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Guarantee mean
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:15:00,607	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	What district is Harley needs like to be a double neck guitar in right now it doesn't
EDL	00:15:00,607	00:15:05,471	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Then they're just like doing it and they're often doing it you're as I gave more of a relation to the work they want to do than to helping you
EDL	00:15:06,239	00:15:08,287	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	I don't know what you're talking about Tammy there okay
EDL	00:15:08,799	00:15:12,127	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	But of course at this point we were definitely going to test
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:13,663	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Right right
EDL	00:15:14,175	00:15:20,319	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Some would want to make a bunch of garbage podcast
EDL	00:15:20,319	00:15:21,343	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	How dare you call this garbage
EDL	00:15:22,111	00:15:24,415	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	So we made a podcast that was called
EDL	00:15:24,927	00:15:26,719	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	100% related
EDL	00:15:26,719	00:15:33,119	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Hi my name is Alice Goldin and you're looking to 100% related
EDL	00:15:33,119	00:15:34,399	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	The price of it is
EDL	00:15:35,423	00:15:40,287	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	A couple days ago I was talking to our editor Tim Howard and he insisted
EDL	00:15:40,287	00:15:45,663	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	But I was only 50% related to my dad because I only have 50% of my dad's genes
EDL	00:15:46,687	00:15:53,087	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Father answer your 50% relieve your dad your 50% related your mom I'm a hundred my opinion is I'm a hundred percent related to book
EDL	00:15:53,087	00:15:55,135	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	In hims worldview yes
EDL	00:15:55,135	00:15:59,487	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And so what we did is we got my dad a former judge to adjudicate this argument
EDL	00:15:59,487	00:16:05,631	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Thank you what should I call you should I call you judge Goldman or should I call you whatever
EDL	00:16:05,631	00:16:08,703	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Now I'd like for you to lay out your case to him because what you're saying is insane
EDL	00:16:09,215	00:16:10,751	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Well
EDL	00:16:10,751	00:16:14,079	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	I really just seems to me that if you were a hundred percent related

EDL	00:16:54,527	00:16:55,039	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	I don't feel
EDL	00:16:56,575	00:16:57,087	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	So
EDL	00:16:58,367	00:17:04,511	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	The percent sign related to the thing
EDL	00:17:05,023	00:17:09,119	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	So clearly we were wrong about all the special characters breaking the radio witch
EDL	00:17:09,631	00:17:10,911	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Surprise me
EDL	00:17:10,911	00:17:11,423	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	But
EDL	00:17:12,191	00:17:13,727	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	I just wanted to confirm
EDL	00:17:14,495	00:17:17,567	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	The one thing that we were actually confident was true
EDL	00:17:17,567	00:17:19,103	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Which was that the percent sign
EDL	00:17:20,383	00:17:21,919	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	So I get back in the podcast
EDL	00:17:22,431	00:17:22,943	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	All right
EDL	00:17:23,967	00:17:24,479	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	All right
EDL	00:17:26,271	00:17:28,319	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Is it freezing your
EDL	00:17:28,831	00:17:29,343	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Stereo
EDL	00:17:29,855	00:17:31,903	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Allison really sorry to say no
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:34,719	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	It is totally normal
EDL	00:17:34,719	00:17:36,255	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	But how is that
EDL	00:17:36,255	00:17:37,535	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	How is that possible
EDL	00:17:39,839	00:17:41,887	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	So clearly this caught me off guard
EDL	00:17:42,655	00:17:44,959	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Seromas whole Theory they found so obvious
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:48,799	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	It doesn't seem to
EDL	00:17:49,823	00:17:53,151	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	It has to be something
EDL	00:17:53,151	00:17:55,967	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Within the file itself that they are uploading this bus
EDL	00:17:56,735	00:17:58,783	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	That it doesn't actually have anything to do
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:17:59,807	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Interesting
EDL	00:18:00,319	00:18:01,343	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	But n Ben
EDL	00:18:02,111	00:18:03,135	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Tell the something that
EDL	00:18:03,647	00:18:04,415	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Again
EDL	00:18:04,927	00:18:05,951	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Befuddled
EDL	00:18:05,951	00:18:07,231	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Okay which is
EDL	00:18:07,231	00:18:09,791	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Ben 10 a copy of a 99percentinvisible episode
EDL	00:18:10,303	00:18:11,071	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	On YouTube
EDL	00:18:11,583	00:18:12,607	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And tried playing that
EDL	00:18:13,631	00:18:16,703	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	So he was like I'm going to see if pirated 990i works
EDL	00:18:17,215	00:18:17,983	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:18:17,983	00:18:18,751	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	It breaks the car
EDL	00:18:19,519	00:18:22,591	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Brakes the car and your brakes
EDL	00:18:24,127	00:18:30,527	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Which is weird because it just means like it's is not actually anything about the file itself because when someone's uploading a podcast
EDL	00:18:30,527	00:18:33,855	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	YouTube that's totally new file yes it's like the content
EDL	00:18:34,879	00:18:37,695	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	It's like the car is sentient and doesn't like Roman Mars
EDL	00:18:37,695	00:18:40,511	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And so Ben would like the only option is that
EDL	00:18:40,511	00:18:41,791	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	There must be some
EDL	00:18:41,791	00:18:43,327	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Some Sonic
EDL	00:18:43,327	00:18:49,471	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Frequency that is breaking the car and I was like a note in Romans I said if you were just sitting in a Mazda and started talking too loud the cartridge

EDL	00:18:51,775	00:18:53,055	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	There's a rumor that there is
EDL	00:18:54,591	00:18:56,383	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	I'm very familiar
EDL	00:18:56,383	00:18:57,407	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Is that the sound real
EDL	00:18:57,407	00:19:03,807	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	I don't think it's not real but I'm glad I've been thinking about it this whole time
EDL	00:19:03,807	00:19:09,183	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	I've been thinking about it since the story began and I could like
EDL	00:19:09,695	00:19:15,839	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	I'm in mixed company I can bring this up but you stop yourself from saying something one time
EDL	00:19:16,863	00:19:20,959	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Everybody
EDL	00:19:21,727	00:19:22,495	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	I hope so
EDL	00:19:22,495	00:19:23,007	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Okay
EDL	00:19:24,799	00:19:25,567	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	So
EDL	00:19:26,335	00:19:28,127	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	We're like okay
EDL	00:19:28,127	00:19:30,431	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	We have no idea we're like totally back and forth
EDL	00:19:30,943	00:19:31,455	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	You got to find them
EDL	00:19:33,503	00:19:35,551	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Subway
EDL	00:19:37,087	00:19:39,391	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Any other reason this doesn't make any sense is because
EDL	00:19:39,903	00:19:41,183	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Roman has another podcast
EDL	00:19:41,183	00:19:42,207	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	About Trump
EDL	00:19:42,207	00:19:48,351	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And constitutional law yeah it's called what Trump can teach us about con law fine
EDL	00:19:48,351	00:19:51,167	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Romans voice doesn't break the radio on that podcast
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:52,703	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Only when it's 99percentinvisible
EDL	00:19:53,471	00:19:54,495	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	So what happened
EDL	00:19:55,263	00:19:58,847	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	U-Haul John Mazda we call the company that makes the radio
EDL	00:19:58,847	00:20:04,479	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	We called Ben's Mazda dealer we are specifically dealing with a Mazda Tech problem
EDL	00:20:04,991	00:20:08,575	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	From a person who's in your service area and I was wondering if I could ask you
EDL	00:20:08,575	00:20:10,111	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	A question or two about it
EDL	00:20:11,135	00:20:12,159	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	They weren't familiar with
EDL	00:20:12,159	00:20:14,207	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	So we called Andrew quits
EDL	00:20:14,207	00:20:16,255	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	The CTO of PRX the public radio Exchange
EDL	00:20:16,767	00:20:19,327	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Hello Steve Andrews
EDL	00:20:19,839	00:20:21,887	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Oh hello how are you I'm good
EDL	00:20:21,887	00:20:25,983	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	He's in charge of how the show gets uploaded to podcast apps that RSS feeds
EDL	00:20:26,495	00:20:27,775	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Cedar County everybody be like have you heard
EDL	00:20:28,543	00:20:29,055	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Yeah
EDL	00:20:29,567	00:20:31,103	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And Andrew said that he heard of it
EDL	00:20:31,871	00:20:35,199	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And that he'd always figured like Roman that was the percent sign
EDL	00:20:35,199	00:20:36,735	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	But I told him about the test that we do
EDL	00:20:37,759	00:20:38,783	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	All of them work
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:40,063	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Including 100% really
EDL	00:20:43,903	00:20:44,415	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	That's
EDL	00:20:45,695	00:20:46,975	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	He's like
EDL	00:20:46,975	00:20:49,023	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	So painful these kind of bugs
EDL	00:20:49,023	00:20:50,303	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	No one knew what was going on
EDL	00:20:51,071	00:20:51,839	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And then
EDL	00:20:52,863	00:20:54,143	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	I saw this ahead of you
EDL	00:20:54,655	00:20:56,959	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	So did that
EDL	00:20:56,959	00:20:59,519	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	She actually got back in touch with us and said
EDL	00:20:59,519	00:21:02,079	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Hey I've been running some tests on my own
EDL	00:21:02,591	00:21:04,127	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	I tried uploading a couple podcast
EDL	00:21:04,895	00:21:05,663	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:21:05,663	00:21:09,759	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	What I found is that it's not the % alone that is causing this issue
EDL	00:21:10,271	00:21:13,599	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	It is the percent sign followed by an uppercase i
EDL	00:21:14,111	00:21:14,623	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	That shuts down there
EDL	00:21:16,159	00:21:16,928	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Lowercase i
EDL	00:21:17,440	00:21:19,232	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	It doesn't uppercase i
EDL	00:21:20,256	00:21:21,280	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	It shut down
EDL	00:21:21,280	00:21:22,048	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	That's all we know
EDL	00:21:22,816	00:21:24,608	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	We don't know why because I hate your car doesn't fly
EDL	00:21:25,120	00:21:26,144	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Lowercase i
EDL	00:21:26,144	00:21:28,960	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	I got a guy
EDL	00:21:30,240	00:21:31,264	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	That's exactly right
EDL	00:21:32,800	00:21:33,824	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	So we're getting closer
EDL	00:21:34,592	00:21:36,640	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And then you know arpel Kurt Melby who
EDL	00:21:37,152	00:21:39,968	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Where to get my it works again when I play fortnite with most weekends
EDL	00:21:39,968	00:21:43,040	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Who does coding at the at the office yet
EDL	00:21:43,040	00:21:43,552	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	He had an idea
EDL	00:21:45,344	00:21:46,112	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Alex
EDL	00:21:46,112	00:21:48,672	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Thank you for coming to the studio today thank you
EDL	00:21:49,184	00:21:54,560	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	The reason that we have you here is because you're the person who actually uploaded the
EDL	00:21:54,560	00:21:56,096	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Podcasts that we made
EDL	00:21:56,096	00:21:58,400	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Yeah you know this
EDL	00:21:58,912	00:21:59,936	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	But none of them work
EDL	00:21:59,936	00:22:01,216	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	I listen to them also and over
EDL	00:22:03,520	00:22:06,080	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Surprised that didn't work
EDL	00:22:06,592	00:22:07,616	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Alright smart guy
EDL	00:22:08,640	00:22:10,176	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Kurt says I have a theory
EDL	00:22:10,944	00:22:12,224	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	The theory is
EDL	00:22:12,992	00:22:13,504	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	That
EDL	00:22:14,528	00:22:16,320	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	The programming language C
EDL	00:22:18,112	00:22:19,648	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Oh I know it is I know it happen
EDL	00:22:20,672	00:22:22,464	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Literally 99% mean something
EDL	00:22:22,976	00:22:24,000	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Can you turn off your stereo
EDL	00:22:24,768	00:22:27,840	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	I would say you're close but not exactly
EDL	00:22:27,840	00:22:29,120	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	In a programming language C
EDL	00:22:30,144	00:22:31,936	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Basically in some scenarios
EDL	00:22:31,936	00:22:33,216	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	The percent sign means hey
EDL	00:22:33,728	00:22:37,824	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	The character immediately following me the character immediately following the percent sign
EDL	00:22:38,848	00:22:40,384	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Think about that like code rather than liked
EDL	00:22:41,408	00:22:42,944	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	End and start
EDL	00:22:43,456	00:22:46,016	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Parsing bat as though it's asking you to run command
EDL	00:22:47,552	00:22:48,576	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Being called Princess
EDL	00:22:49,088	00:22:52,416	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	NC that's like used very very common lean heavily
EDL	00:22:52,928	00:22:54,720	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Another languages of copy this feature
EDL	00:22:55,488	00:22:56,256	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	2
EDL	00:22:56,256	00:22:58,816	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Interpolate is the technical term
EDL	00:22:58,816	00:23:01,632	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Interpolate the number into the string
EDL	00:23:02,144	00:23:03,936	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And he said percent I
EDL	00:23:04,960	00:23:05,728	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	In
EDL	00:23:06,752	00:23:08,288	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	C & C
EDL	00:23:08,288	00:23:12,640	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Is a command where a percent are which would be 100% related
EDL	00:23:12,640	00:23:13,408	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	?
EDL	00:23:13,408	00:23:14,688	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Is not so like
EDL	00:23:14,688	00:23:16,992	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	What's the command what is percent I tell
EDL	00:23:17,504	00:23:18,528	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Computer to Dell
EDL	00:23:19,040	00:23:21,600	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	So I have it up here it has to do with
EDL	00:23:21,600	00:23:24,160	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Basically 2% in NC
EDL	00:23:24,160	00:23:26,208	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Has to do with displaying integers
EDL	00:23:26,720	00:23:30,816	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	NC I know this is very confused
EDL	00:23:30,816	00:23:31,328	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	So
EDL	00:23:31,840	00:23:36,192	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Percent and then a bunch of different letters tell it to display integers in a certain
EDL	00:23:36,704	00:23:37,472	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	In a certain way
EDL	00:23:37,472	00:23:39,008	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	But basically what's happening
EDL	00:23:39,008	00:23:39,776	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	It sounds like
EDL	00:23:39,776	00:23:41,312	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Is the car
EDL	00:23:41,312	00:23:42,080	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Stereo
EDL	00:23:42,848	00:23:43,872	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Hey guess what
EDL	00:23:43,872	00:23:45,408	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	He thinks is it audio file
EDL	00:23:45,408	00:23:46,688	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	What is an audiophile
EDL	00:23:46,688	00:23:49,760	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Okay this part of the information I have is just for the humor
EDL	00:23:49,760	00:23:50,528	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	This is like the title
EDL	00:23:51,040	00:23:57,440	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Yeah 99 and then it there's some stuff for you the robots to understand
EDL	00:23:57,440	00:23:58,976	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	I can't get confused and a chest
EDL	00:23:58,976	00:23:59,488	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Yes
EDL	00:24:01,280	00:24:04,608	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	So there's a bunch of different commands in C that would cause this to happen
EDL	00:24:05,632	00:24:07,680	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Okay and so we were like okay
EDL	00:24:08,448	00:24:11,776	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	If curtright we should be able to test this with other commands
EDL	00:24:12,288	00:24:14,336	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And those should also mess up the car stereo
EDL	00:24:14,848	00:24:15,872	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And so
EDL	00:24:17,408	00:24:19,200	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	We made one more podcast
EDL	00:24:20,224	00:24:21,760	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	With another one of the
EDL	00:24:21,760	00:24:25,856	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Another one of the recognized piece of syntax which is the letter which is the letter
EDL	00:24:25,856	00:24:26,368	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Key
EDL	00:24:26,880	00:24:30,976	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Which when it follows the % becomes the pointer at
EDL	00:24:30,976	00:24:31,488	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Grass whatever that means
EDL	00:24:32,000	00:24:36,096	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Okay but whatever as long as going to code it should shut down the stereo. That's what happen
EDL	00:24:36,864	00:24:39,680	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	So we made a podcast that's called 88% parents
EDL	00:24:44,288	00:24:50,688	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	This is Erica
EDL	00:24:50,688	00:24:52,736	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Edelbrock
EDL	00:24:53,760	00:24:56,576	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Let me tell you about this document I've been waiting for
EDL	00:24:56,576	00:25:00,928	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	This one piece of paper it was going to change everything I thought I understood it for now
EDL	00:25:01,952	00:25:03,232	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	It arrived on a Monday
EDL	00:25:03,744	00:25:05,536	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Monday began like a normal day
EDL	00:25:05,536	00:25:06,816	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	I was walking to work
EDL	00:25:06,816	00:25:07,584	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	With my dog
EDL	00:25:07,584	00:25:09,120	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	His name is Bruno by the way
EDL	00:25:09,120	00:25:15,008	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Come with that name my name to Bruno he's a rescue dog he came with a name like Bradley or something which I really didn't like
EDL	00:25:15,008	00:25:21,408	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	So I changed it to Bruno which by the way is the name I also wanted to name my son but my
EDL	00:25:21,408	00:25:22,432	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	I understand what you've done
EDL	00:25:22,432	00:25:23,200	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Who is Bruno
EDL	00:25:23,200	00:25:26,784	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And we get there it's a short walk like maybe 10 minutes which is
EDL	00:25:27,296	00:25:29,088	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Crazy because people are always like what
EDL	00:25:29,088	00:25:35,488	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Podcasts to listen to what podcast you listen to cuz you make podcast and I'm like not that many cuz I'm such a short walk to work anyway
EDL	00:25:35,488	00:25:37,536	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	The strong okay
EDL	00:25:37,536	00:25:38,048	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	I've heard enough
EDL	00:25:38,560	00:25:39,072	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Okay
EDL	00:25:44,704	00:25:48,800	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	All seems like people are like I went the next season of Serial coming out like 20 minutes later than it would
EDL	00:25:52,896	00:25:53,408	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	So what happened
EDL	00:25:54,176	00:25:55,968	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Well we send it Urban
EDL	00:25:56,992	00:25:58,272	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And it didn't break the car stereo
EDL	00:25:59,296	00:25:59,808	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	I didn't break it
EDL	00:26:00,576	00:26:01,600	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	So that screwed up the whole Theory
EDL	00:26:02,112	00:26:02,624	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:26:03,392	00:26:03,904	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	I mean
EDL	00:26:04,416	00:26:05,440	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	We didn't just try
EDL	00:26:06,208	00:26:12,096	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Percent P we tried a bunch of different things that should have broken the car stereo in the same way the percent Idol
EDL	00:26:12,608	00:26:14,144	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And none of them cause a problem
EDL	00:26:14,912	00:26:16,704	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	So what that is Kirstie rebunk
EDL	00:26:17,216	00:26:19,008	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Curtsy reappears
EDL	00:26:19,008	00:26:19,776	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Not to work
EDL	00:26:20,288	00:26:23,360	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	The only combination that did anything what percent
EDL	00:26:23,360	00:26:25,664	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Followed by an uppercase i
EDL	00:26:25,664	00:26:26,944	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Okay but we don't know why
EDL	00:26:27,712	00:26:28,224	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Noe.
EDL	00:26:28,736	00:26:30,784	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And it is driving
EDL	00:26:30,784	00:26:31,552	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Peanuts
EDL	00:26:32,064	00:26:34,624	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And this is the point in the story where Andrew cuckoo it's comes to the rescue
EDL	00:26:35,136	00:26:36,416	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Andrew Cuomo
EDL	00:26:36,416	00:26:41,792	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Remember he's the CTO at public radio exchange the company that distributes 99%
EDL	00:26:43,328	00:26:44,352	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	He really dove
EDL	00:26:44,864	00:26:45,888	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Like he
EDL	00:26:45,888	00:26:48,960	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Really invested what is that mean
EDL	00:26:49,472	00:26:50,240	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Well
EDL	00:26:50,240	00:26:56,640	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	You know we're trying to figure out a way to diagnose this properly without actually having access to the code
EDL	00:26:56,640	00:27:02,016	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	You made a bunch of nonsense podcast for no reason you talk to somebody worked at a Mazda dealership and one guy at work
EDL	00:27:02,784	00:27:04,064	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	We also called master
EDL	00:27:06,880	00:27:13,280	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Andrew was God until like a Mazda owners message board and found the actual code
EDL	00:27:13,280	00:27:14,560	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Code
EDL	00:27:14,560	00:27:20,960	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	For the Mazda connect infotainment system really and within the code from the name of one of your
EDL	00:27:20,960	00:27:23,264	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Original authors of the original code
EDL	00:27:23,264	00:27:25,056	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Which event gave to us
EDL	00:27:25,056	00:27:29,408	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Author of the code for the Mazda car stereo program yes
EDL	00:27:30,176	00:27:35,808	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	His name is Brandon Guzman that you can look
EDL	00:27:35,808	00:27:39,136	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Encode and see the codes author like I didn't know that
EDL	00:27:39,136	00:27:41,440	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	There's a way to write your authorship in your code
EDL	00:27:41,952	00:27:42,976	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And it's been
EDL	00:27:42,976	00:27:46,048	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Done forever as always like that like a signature on a painting
EDL	00:27:46,048	00:27:51,424	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	It's a little a lot of times it's harder to find you have access to the code to see the authorship
EDL	00:27:51,424	00:27:54,752	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And my favorite story about this is early in
EDL	00:27:54,752	00:27:59,616	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	The development of Atari games Atari would not allow the author of The Game to put their name on it
EDL	00:28:00,128	00:28:04,224	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Because there's being a company about it and so the author of the game Adventure
EDL	00:28:04,736	00:28:06,784	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Create this incredibly arcane
EDL	00:28:06,784	00:28:07,808	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Set up
EDL	00:28:07,808	00:28:11,904	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Things that you had to do in the game so that you would find a secret room
EDL	00:28:11,904	00:28:14,464	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	They just flashed his name in the center of the screen
EDL	00:28:14,464	00:28:16,000	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	That's brilliant and sad
EDL	00:28:16,512	00:28:18,560	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Because it said that they had to go to that much work.
EDL	00:28:18,560	00:28:20,608	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	I just feel like I made that anyway
EDL	00:28:20,608	00:28:21,376	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Chicken tenders Brandon
EDL	00:28:22,144	00:28:25,472	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Yes he works on exercise technology now
EDL	00:28:25,472	00:28:28,032	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Work work
EDL	00:28:28,032	00:28:30,336	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	We develop connected strength products
EDL	00:28:30,848	00:28:32,384	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	As a person who's terrible at exercising
EDL	00:28:33,664	00:28:35,456	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	I'm not your toy
EDL	00:28:35,456	00:28:40,576	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Yeah baby irony is the entire office of us working on this or not either
EDL	00:28:40,576	00:28:42,880	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	We're more like stay up late and Senator computer longer
EDL	00:28:44,672	00:28:47,488	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	So we told Brandon what was going on with Benz car
EDL	00:28:48,512	00:28:52,352	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And he told us that he was pretty sure he knew what was going on
EDL	00:28:52,352	00:28:53,120	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Which is
EDL	00:28:53,632	00:28:54,400	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	So
EDL	00:28:55,168	00:28:56,448	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	What he said was
EDL	00:28:56,448	00:29:01,312	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	One thing that caught my eye immediately is that there's a percent symbol in the name
EDL	00:29:01,312	00:29:05,152	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And that has some special meetings and things like a URL
EDL	00:29:05,664	00:29:06,176	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Right
EDL	00:29:06,688	00:29:11,296	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Is a URL certain characters are allowed in certain characters are not
EDL	00:29:11,808	00:29:15,904	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	So our operating Theory with 8% I was breaking a radio
EDL	00:29:15,904	00:29:16,416	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Because
EDL	00:29:16,928	00:29:18,464	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	The percent sign followed by the letter i
EDL	00:29:18,976	00:29:21,280	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Meant something in the programming language C
EDL	00:29:21,280	00:29:22,816	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	But what Brandon told us was
EDL	00:29:22,816	00:29:25,376	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Know that program wasn't even written in C
EDL	00:29:25,376	00:29:27,168	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Is written in a totally different program
EDL	00:29:27,680	00:29:28,448	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Okay
EDL	00:29:28,448	00:29:29,984	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Into the radio
EDL	00:29:29,984	00:29:32,032	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Super Sentai doesn't actually mean anything
EDL	00:29:33,312	00:29:34,848	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Brennan think the problem is
EDL	00:29:35,360	00:29:41,248	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Is that the code should tell the radio to ignore things that doesn't understand or that don't mean anything
EDL	00:29:42,016	00:29:44,064	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	But in this case for whatever reason it's not
EDL	00:29:45,088	00:29:47,136	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	So the radio Super Sentai
EDL	00:29:47,136	00:29:47,904	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	It just keeps
EDL	00:29:47,904	00:29:49,952	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Desperately trying to figure out what it means
EDL	00:29:49,952	00:29:51,488	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	So it's like it's having a panic attack
EDL	00:29:51,488	00:29:52,000	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Kind of
EDL	00:29:54,048	00:29:54,560	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Is an eye
EDL	00:29:56,096	00:29:57,888	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And so then
EDL	00:29:57,888	00:29:58,912	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	I was like okay
EDL	00:29:58,912	00:30:00,704	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	So why is the stereo restarting
EDL	00:30:01,216	00:30:03,776	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And Brandon told me that when they designed the car
EDL	00:30:03,776	00:30:05,568	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	They made it to the radio
EDL	00:30:05,568	00:30:09,664	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	With regularly sending a little message to the rest of the car saying
EDL	00:30:09,664	00:30:12,224	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	I'm working I'm working I'm working Brandon call it a heart
EDL	00:30:13,248	00:30:14,016	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:30:14,016	00:30:16,064	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	The hardware layers listening for that
EDL	00:30:16,064	00:30:17,344	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	As long as it gets it
EDL	00:30:17,856	00:30:18,368	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	It's happy
EDL	00:30:19,392	00:30:20,160	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	If it doesn't get it
EDL	00:30:20,928	00:30:23,488	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	It will assume that the UI has frozen
EDL	00:30:23,488	00:30:24,256	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And it will
EDL	00:30:24,768	00:30:26,560	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Restart it to a known good state
EDL	00:30:26,560	00:30:28,864	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	It's it's saying it's not communicating with me
EDL	00:30:29,376	00:30:30,400	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Something is wrong
EDL	00:30:30,912	00:30:33,216	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And it just start start over
EDL	00:30:33,728	00:30:35,264	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	So if it freezes up
EDL	00:30:36,800	00:30:38,080	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	It's in the heartbeat
EDL	00:30:38,592	00:30:44,992	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	It is trained to automatically shut down and start back up by the computer is that swipes

EDL	00:30:47,040	00:30:48,064	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	That wakes up and tries again
EDL	00:30:48,832	00:30:53,184	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	I really like how much effort we put into personifying these cars
EDL	00:30:53,184	00:30:55,232	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	I just understand that they're sentient
EDL	00:30:55,232	00:30:57,792	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	I do feel like this by original Theory
EDL	00:30:58,560	00:31:00,608	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Like everybody else they freak out with it on the right answer
EDL	00:31:01,120	00:31:01,632	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Threat
EDL	00:31:03,168	00:31:05,984	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	There is one other thing that was suggested to us
EDL	00:31:06,496	00:31:08,032	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Several times along the way
EDL	00:31:09,312	00:31:09,824	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Benz
EDL	00:31:10,336	00:31:12,640	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Car stereo firmware
EDL	00:31:12,640	00:31:17,248	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Is a few
EDL	00:31:17,248	00:31:22,624	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	So the theory is that it might fix this problem
EDL	00:31:22,624	00:31:23,904	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	According to myself
EDL	00:31:24,416	00:31:28,256	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	But been looked into getting a firmware updated and it was just too expensive
EDL	00:31:29,536	00:31:30,304	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	However
EDL	00:31:31,072	00:31:34,400	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	That doesn't mean that we don't have a more permanent solution for bed in Roma
EDL	00:31:35,168	00:31:35,680	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Because

EDL	00:31:37,728	00:31:39,008	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Had a very sweet idea
EDL	00:31:39,520	00:31:43,104	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Maybe we got a publisher version of 99% invisible with some slightly different
EDL	00:31:43,616	00:31:44,896	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Titles or something

EDL	00:38:07,104	00:38:09,152	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	I'd like for you to lay out your case to
EDL	00:38:09,152	00:38:10,176	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Because what you're saying is insane
EDL	00:38:12,224	00:38:15,552	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	It really just seems to me that if you were a hundred percent related
EDL	00:38:16,064	00:38:16,832	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	You
EDL	00:38:16,832	00:38:17,600	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Wood
EDL	00:38:17,600	00:38:21,696	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	You would be mark
EDL	00:38:21,696	00:38:23,488	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And you are not
EDL	00:38:24,000	00:38:25,792	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	You're 50% related
EDL	00:38:26,816	00:38:27,840	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	So okay
EDL	00:38:28,864	00:38:30,400	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	What I'm saying is like
EDL	00:38:30,912	00:38:32,704	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	When you're related to someone
EDL	00:38:32,704	00:38:36,800	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	You're 100% related to them regardless of how many genes you share
EDL	00:38:36,800	00:38:37,568	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Look
EDL	00:38:37,568	00:38:41,408	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	I have like a Mike I have like a second cousin twice removed
EDL	00:38:41,408	00:38:42,432	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	To get out who like
EDL	00:38:42,432	00:38:43,712	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Act like my aunt's
EDL	00:38:44,224	00:38:44,736	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Grandson
EDL	00:38:45,248	00:38:49,088	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	My cousin's kid 100% related to that
EDL	00:38:49,088	00:38:50,880	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	A person I'm a hundred percent
EDL	00:38:50,880	00:38:51,648	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Related
EDL	00:38:51,648	00:38:53,440	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	To anyone whose relative
EDL	00:38:53,440	00:38:56,000	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	So you are as related
EDL	00:38:56,512	00:38:58,048	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	To your father as
EDL	00:38:58,048	00:39:00,864	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Any other human being that's what you're saying
EDL	00:39:00,864	00:39:03,168	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	But you cannot be more related
EDL	00:39:03,168	00:39:04,448	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Or less related
EDL	00:39:04,448	00:39:05,216	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	To anybody
EDL	00:39:06,240	00:39:07,776	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Well this feels like a
EDL	00:39:07,776	00:39:10,848	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Like more like a less like a math argument more like a semantics
EDL	00:39:11,872	00:39:15,712	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	I mean I don't know but yeah I'm just I'm just following your logic here
EDL	00:39:15,712	00:39:17,760	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	My logic is you can have a closer relation
EDL	00:39:18,528	00:39:20,832	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	In that Oso higher percentage
EDL	00:39:22,368	00:39:26,208	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Judge objection
EDL	00:39:26,976	00:39:28,512	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Is that all you got
EDL	00:39:28,512	00:39:30,304	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	What are you talkin about
EDL	00:39:30,304	00:39:36,448	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Makes perfect sense what I'm saying we're not done with the idea that you just said that you can be club or closely related
EDL	00:39:36,960	00:39:40,800	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	But it's not a percentage what is it an on-off
EDL	00:39:40,800	00:39:41,568	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Okay
EDL	00:39:41,568	00:39:43,872	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Alright let me let me let me let me ask a question
EDL	00:39:43,872	00:39:44,640	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Okay
EDL	00:39:45,152	00:39:47,200	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	So I might get a genetic testing
EDL	00:39:49,248	00:39:50,784	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	About 45 years ago
EDL	00:39:50,784	00:39:53,344	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	This doesn't sound good for me
EDL	00:39:53,344	00:39:56,416	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	In NFL once every 3 or 4 months
EDL	00:39:56,416	00:39:59,232	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	I get this notice from the company that says

EDL	00:40:03,072	00:40:07,680	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And these relatives

EDL	00:40:12,032	00:40:16,896	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Okay but this company which is 23andMe still consider these people to be relics
EDL	00:40:19,456	00:40:23,296	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Although I've never heard their name I don't know what a access point

EDL	00:42:36,415	00:42:37,951	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	We need milk do you have milk
EDL	00:42:37,951	00:42:39,231	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Got it okay
EDL	00:42:39,231	00:42:40,511	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Do you have sugar
EDL	00:42:41,023	00:42:41,535	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Yes
EDL	00:42:42,047	00:42:42,559	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	An Egg's
EDL	00:42:43,071	00:42:43,839	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Yes
EDL	00:42:43,839	00:42:45,887	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Vanilla we need some salt
EDL	00:42:45,887	00:42:46,911	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	I have salt
EDL	00:42:47,423	00:42:49,471	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And then you need some flour
EDL	00:42:49,983	00:42:51,263	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Got it
EDL	00:42:51,263	00:42:53,823	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And some do you have any berries around
EDL	00:42:53,823	00:42:58,687	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	I have some blueberries perfect blueberries are great okay okay the first steps to making
EDL	00:42:58,687	00:43:00,735	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Is that we need to turn on the oven
EDL	00:43:01,503	00:43:05,855	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	So you have her heat your oven to a temperature
EDL	00:43:05,855	00:43:06,623	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	That's
EDL	00:43:06,623	00:43:07,903	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	A little bit
EDL	00:43:07,903	00:43:09,695	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Less than the number of days in a year
EDL	00:43:10,207	00:43:16,607	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Okay so we're talking like the number of degrees in a circle roughly approximately maybe a little bit less than that
EDL	00:43:16,607	00:43:18,143	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Okay alright okay
EDL	00:43:18,143	00:43:23,775	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And then you have to imagine that you're going to bake this pancake in a dish it could be any shape
EDL	00:43:23,775	00:43:28,895	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	It could be round or rectangular or like ovular I guess would be a word
EDL	00:43:28,895	00:43:33,759	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	But it needs to be approximately the size of like a
EDL	00:43:34,527	00:43:35,551	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Small
EDL	00:43:35,551	00:43:36,063	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Pan pizza
EDL	00:43:36,575	00:43:37,855	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Okay let me take a look old
EDL	00:43:41,183	00:43:42,207	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Okay I think I got it
EDL	00:43:42,207	00:43:42,975	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Okay great
EDL	00:43:43,487	00:43:45,279	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	So we're going to need to measure out some milk
EDL	00:43:46,303	00:43:49,375	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Basically I want you to put the amount of milk
EDL	00:43:49,375	00:43:53,215	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	That is like approximately you know like
EDL	00:43:53,215	00:43:55,775	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Like a small jar of mayonnaise
EDL	00:43:57,055	00:43:57,567	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Amount
EDL	00:43:58,335	00:43:58,847	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	So like
EDL	00:43:59,871	00:44:04,223	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Smaller than a full ketchup bottle definitely less than a full ketchup
EDL	00:44:04,223	00:44:06,527	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Like a bottle of ketchup
EDL	00:44:06,527	00:44:08,319	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	That has been used
EDL	00:44:08,831	00:44:09,343	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Generous
EDL	00:44:11,903	00:44:17,023	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And then we're going to put some sugar the measurement for the sugar should be about
EDL	00:44:17,023	00:44:21,375	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Do you have you ever had one of those toys that you know those stress balls
EDL	00:44:21,375	00:44:22,143	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Yes
EDL	00:44:22,655	00:44:24,703	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Okay you should put about a stress ball amount of shoe
EDL	00:44:25,215	00:44:25,983	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Into the wall
EDL	00:44:25,983	00:44:28,287	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	So you're saying like greater than one of those Super Bowl
EDL	00:44:29,055	00:44:31,103	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Yes greater greater than a Super Bowl
EDL	00:44:31,615	00:44:33,151	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	But less than a softball
EDL	00:44:36,223	00:44:37,247	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Okay
EDL	00:44:37,247	00:44:37,759	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Okay
EDL	00:44:38,271	00:44:39,295	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	For the egg
EDL	00:44:39,295	00:44:41,855	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Can you add an amount of eggs
EDL	00:44:41,855	00:44:44,159	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	It's greater than the number of nipples you have
EDL	00:44:44,159	00:44:47,487	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	First of all it's very presumptuous of you to know how many nipples I have
EDL	00:44:47,487	00:44:48,255	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Second of all
EDL	00:44:48,767	00:44:50,047	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	So you're saying like
EDL	00:44:50,559	00:44:52,607	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Less than the sides of a
EDL	00:44:52,607	00:44:53,631	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Square correct
EDL	00:44:56,703	00:44:57,215	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	All right
EDL	00:44:58,751	00:45:01,567	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And I feel like I was born to bake
EDL	00:45:01,567	00:45:03,103	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Really good I mean it looks really good
EDL	00:45:04,383	00:45:05,407	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	For vanilla
EDL	00:45:06,175	00:45:06,943	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	We're going to put
EDL	00:45:07,455	00:45:09,759	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Less than the number of lights on a
EDL	00:45:09,759	00:45:11,295	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Traffic light amount
EDL	00:45:11,295	00:45:12,063	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Glug
EDL	00:45:12,063	00:45:12,831	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Into the ball
EDL	00:45:13,343	00:45:14,111	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	You got it
EDL	00:45:16,927	00:45:18,719	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	I put it I put some plugs in there
EDL	00:45:19,231	00:45:22,047	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Okay great I want you to put more than
EDL	00:45:22,047	00:45:22,815	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Twice
EDL	00:45:22,815	00:45:23,839	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	The amount
EDL	00:45:24,863	00:45:27,423	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Planets in the solar system of grains of
EDL	00:45:27,423	00:45:28,703	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Salt into the bowl
EDL	00:45:28,703	00:45:29,215	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	You got it
EDL	00:45:29,983	00:45:31,007	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Done
EDL	00:45:31,007	00:45:33,823	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	When it comes to the flower
EDL	00:45:33,823	00:45:36,127	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	How how big is your big child
EDL	00:45:36,639	00:45:37,151	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Harvey
EDL	00:45:37,919	00:45:38,943	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	He is
EDL	00:45:39,455	00:45:40,223	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	I don't know I'll be
EDL	00:45:41,247	00:45:43,807	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Is he bigger than like 3 basketball stacked up
EDL	00:45:45,343	00:45:46,111	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Yes
EDL	00:45:46,111	00:45:49,951	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Alright I basically I want to imagine the size of Harvey's foot
EDL	00:45:50,463	00:45:54,815	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Okay could you do a little more flour than the size of Harvey's foot into the bowl
EDL	00:45:55,327	00:45:58,143	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	A little more flour than the size of Harvey's foot
EDL	00:46:00,959	00:46:04,287	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Now what you're going to have to do is use your whisk
EDL	00:46:04,799	00:46:07,103	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	To blend everything until it's
EDL	00:46:07,103	00:46:09,151	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Really smooth and frothy
EDL	00:46:18,111	00:46:20,927	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	All right it is looking pretty frothy
EDL	00:46:20,927	00:46:21,951	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Okay great
EDL	00:46:21,951	00:46:24,255	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Now you're going to pour enough batter
EDL	00:46:24,767	00:46:27,583	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	To create a layer that's a little bit thicker than a piece of
EDL	00:46:27,583	00:46:29,119	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Cardboard into the bottom of the day
EDL	00:46:30,655	00:46:31,679	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	So like
EDL	00:46:31,679	00:46:34,495	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	You be like approximately like two pieces of matzah stack
EDL	00:46:34,495	00:46:35,263	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	On top of each other
EDL	00:46:35,263	00:46:36,031	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	That sounds
EDL	00:46:36,031	00:46:36,799	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Approximately that
EDL	00:46:37,567	00:46:38,079	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Oh my God I'm so
EDL	00:46:39,359	00:46:40,895	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Does it smell good in vanilla
EDL	00:46:41,407	00:46:42,431	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Yes it does
EDL	00:46:42,943	00:46:49,343	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	So I wanted I want you to turn one of the burners of your stove on until the flame is a little
EDL	00:46:49,343	00:46:51,391	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Little bit greater than
EDL	00:46:51,391	00:46:52,159	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	A lighter
EDL	00:46:52,159	00:46:52,671	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Like a Zippo lighter
EDL	00:46:54,975	00:46:55,487	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Oh okay
EDL	00:46:55,999	00:46:57,023	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And then
EDL	00:46:57,023	00:46:59,327	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Set the dish on top of their
EDL	00:46:59,327	00:47:02,911	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	You're going to leave the dish on there for a little bit less than the time at
EDL	00:47:02,911	00:47:03,935	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Takes to brush your teeth
EDL	00:47:04,959	00:47:07,775	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And what you're looking for is that the batter
EDL	00:47:07,775	00:47:09,055	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Begins to set
EDL	00:47:09,055	00:47:09,823	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	In the bottom of the day
EDL	00:47:10,335	00:47:11,103	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	You got it
EDL	00:47:11,103	00:47:12,383	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	You got it all right here we go
EDL	00:47:12,383	00:47:13,407	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	So when's it set
EDL	00:47:14,175	00:47:15,711	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	You could pull it off the burner
EDL	00:47:17,247	00:47:19,295	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Aha and now you're going to add the bear
EDL	00:47:20,063	00:47:25,183	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Okay now we're going to add another stress ball amount of sugar over the berry
EDL	00:47:25,951	00:47:26,463	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Okay
EDL	00:47:26,975	00:47:29,791	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And now you get to top it all off with
EDL	00:47:29,791	00:47:31,071	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	With the rest of the batter
EDL	00:47:32,095	00:47:34,143	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Just sort of drizzling
EDL	00:47:34,911	00:47:37,983	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Okay now you can just throw it into the oven
EDL	00:47:38,495	00:47:39,263	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	For how long
EDL	00:47:39,263	00:47:40,799	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	It's going to be in there
EDL	00:47:40,799	00:47:41,823	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	For about
EDL	00:47:43,615	00:47:44,127	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Aztlan
EDL	00:47:44,639	00:47:45,407	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	As a movie
EDL	00:47:45,407	00:47:47,967	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	So approximately as long as
EDL	00:47:49,503	00:47:51,295	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	An episode of
EDL	00:47:51,807	00:47:52,575	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Bones
EDL	00:47:52,575	00:47:54,367	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Yes I would say it's
EDL	00:47:54,367	00:48:00,255	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Greater than the length of an episode of Bones without the commercials and the length of an episode of Bones with
EDL	00:48:01,535	00:48:03,583	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Somewhere in there
EDL	00:48:04,351	00:48:05,375	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	God I really miss Beau
EDL	00:48:06,911	00:48:07,423	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Noted
EDL	00:48:08,191	00:48:14,079	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	All right it's it's in there
EDL	00:48:16,639	00:48:18,175	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Alex are you going to
EDL	00:48:18,175	00:48:18,943	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Who are you going to
EDL	00:48:18,943	00:48:19,967	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Eat this classroom
EDL	00:48:20,991	00:48:23,039	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	I'm probably going to eat it with my wife and kids
EDL	00:48:23,807	00:48:28,671	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Which which I'm super excited about cuz my son loves dessert
EDL	00:48:28,671	00:48:29,951	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	More than anything in the world
EDL	00:48:29,951	00:48:32,767	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	And your children approximately how old are they
EDL	00:48:32,767	00:48:35,327	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Harvey is older than
EDL	00:48:36,607	00:48:37,887	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	A wheel of Parmesan
EDL	00:48:37,887	00:48:40,959	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	I don't know how old wheels of Parmesan are
EDL	00:48:40,959	00:48:43,263	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Is about as old
EDL	00:48:45,055	00:48:45,823	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	It's a little bit
EDL	00:48:46,847	00:48:48,895	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Find the length of a typical
EDL	00:48:48,895	00:48:49,663	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	American
EDL	00:48:52,735	00:48:55,295	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	He's he's he's greater than
EDL	00:48:56,063	00:48:57,343	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	A wheel of Parmesan
EDL	00:49:02,719	00:49:09,119	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Has it been approximately the number of minutes in
EDL	00:49:09,119	00:49:09,887	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	In a Bones episode
EDL	00:49:10,911	00:49:12,703	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	I'm going to take the clafouti
EDL	00:49:12,703	00:49:16,543	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	I'm going to show you what it looks like it's literally just came out of the oven
EDL	00:49:17,567	00:49:19,103	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Okay I can't wait to see it
EDL	00:49:19,871	00:49:20,895	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Interstate now
EDL	00:49:20,895	00:49:23,967	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	I would say that it approximately looks like
EDL	00:49:24,479	00:49:26,527	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Did your local skatepark
EDL	00:49:27,039	00:49:28,063	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	You know how there's like sort of
EDL	00:49:29,087	00:49:30,367	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Hills and Valleys
EDL	00:49:30,367	00:49:35,231	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	That are sort of oddly placed in order to maximize like grinding into jumping and leaping
EDL	00:49:35,231	00:49:37,535	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	That's I think what it looks like right now
EDL	00:49:37,535	00:49:41,119	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	The rising in the following is a natural part of the process
EDL	00:49:41,119	00:49:42,655	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	So you've done that part right
EDL	00:49:42,655	00:49:44,703	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	I think you've done a great job
EDL	00:49:44,703	00:49:48,543	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	I'm really excited for what you've made it's not a booty
EDL	00:49:50,335	00:49:56,479	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	It's closer to like a souffle pancake or a Dutch baby pancake but unfortunately it does look like
EDL	00:49:56,991	00:50:01,855	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	It's less brown than the Villa golden deliciousness that I had hoped
EDL	00:50:01,855	00:50:06,207	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	4 but I still think it will be delicious and I think you should taste it
EDL	00:50:06,207	00:50:07,231	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	I wish I were there
EDL	00:50:10,047	00:50:10,815	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Looks delicious
EDL	00:50:11,839	00:50:12,863	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	It's like eggie
EDL	00:50:13,375	00:50:14,655	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Kind of yeah
EDL	00:50:14,655	00:50:16,191	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	I feel like it's a success
EDL	00:50:17,727	00:50:18,239	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	All right
EDL	00:50:18,751	00:50:21,311	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	Samin thank you so much for having me on your show
EDL	00:50:22,591	00:50:25,407	| 350_The_Roman_Mars_Mazda_Virus_pt_01 |	I'm so pleased that you were able to join me today Alex
