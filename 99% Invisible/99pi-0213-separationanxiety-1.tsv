EDL	00:06:37,055	00:06:40,127	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	You can just take out your recycling in not official plastic bags
EDL	00:06:40,127	00:06:43,967	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	And you can generate as much compost and recycling as you'd like
EDL	00:06:43,967	00:06:47,807	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	So residents are incentivized to recycle more and throw Outlet
EDL	00:06:48,575	00:06:51,391	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	What's Aaron sort out all of her recyclables into
EDL	00:06:51,391	00:06:52,159	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Perfect categories
EDL	00:06:52,927	00:06:53,695	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	These are the cans
EDL	00:06:54,719	00:06:58,047	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Cans and bottle so we have a few tea bottles
EDL	00:06:58,047	00:07:02,911	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	So in Taipei every yellow garbage truck is followed by a small white recycling truck
EDL	00:07:02,911	00:07:05,471	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Is basically a cart full of different bands
EDL	00:07:05,471	00:07:07,263	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	There's a bin for plastic bottles
EDL	00:07:07,263	00:07:08,287	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	14 glass bottle
EDL	00:07:08,287	00:07:10,335	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Different Metals in cans
EDL	00:07:10,335	00:07:11,615	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Papers and cardboard
EDL	00:07:12,127	00:07:13,919	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	In a compost bucket for raw food weight
EDL	00:07:14,431	00:07:15,711	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Compost bucket
EDL	00:07:15,711	00:07:16,735	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Overcooked Foodway
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:21,599	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Taipei residents have to sort their recycling into all these different categories themselves
EDL	00:07:21,599	00:07:27,999	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Although in the recycling trucks there are officials and volunteers who can help instruct you about which item
EDL	00:07:27,999	00:07:28,511	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Goes where
EDL	00:07:29,023	00:07:32,095	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	So Aaron her housemates and I got all of her bags
EDL	00:07:32,095	00:07:32,863	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Trash and differ
EDL	00:07:32,863	00:07:34,399	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Kinds of recycling sorted out
EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:36,447	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	And we walked about a block down the street
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:37,727	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	To wait with the rest of her neighbors
EDL	00:07:38,495	00:07:40,799	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Who are all clutching official blue garbage bag
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:42,591	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	A lot of people gathered
EDL	00:07:43,103	00:07:43,871	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Genesis Maybe
EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:45,663	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Larger than your average

EDL	00:07:46,687	00:07:47,455	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Then
EDL	00:07:47,455	00:07:49,247	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	The moment we were waiting for
EDL	00:07:52,063	00:07:57,183	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Yeah there was this Mad Dash of people swarming to the
EDL	00:07:57,183	00:07:58,207	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	School bus yellow garbage
EDL	00:07:58,719	00:07:59,999	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	And the white recycling truck
EDL	00:08:00,511	00:08:03,583	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Okay let's not coughing at end
EDL	00:08:03,583	00:08:08,447	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Swiftly tossing their separate recyclables in the bins tossing their blue bags and the garbage truck
EDL	00:08:08,447	00:08:09,727	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	And running away
EDL	00:08:09,727	00:08:11,007	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	It was Madness
EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:11,775	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Like
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:13,311	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Extremely well organized Madness
EDL	00:08:13,823	00:08:14,847	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	I was so chaotic
EDL	00:08:15,359	00:08:18,431	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	And this system for all its chaos has been working
EDL	00:08:18,431	00:08:23,039	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Taipei City used to produce 3296 tons of trash a day
EDL	00:08:23,551	00:08:27,135	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Today the city produces about 1000 tonnes a day
EDL	00:08:27,135	00:08:28,927	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	That is according to Jen with you
EDL	00:08:29,439	00:08:30,975	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	When is 65 official
EDL	00:08:30,975	00:08:33,023	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Who supervised the garbage trucks and their routes
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:35,327	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	I met him at a garbage pickup site
EDL	00:08:35,839	00:08:38,399	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Where Jasmine Wong acted as interpreter
EDL	00:08:38,911	00:08:39,423	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Everett
EDL	00:08:39,935	00:08:41,727	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Mr10
EDL	00:08:41,727	00:08:43,007	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	And he is
EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:44,287	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Supervisor
EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:50,175	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	District 10 overseas 20 garbage truck routes
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:53,759	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	And all those trucks have to make sure that citizens are sorting properly
EDL	00:08:54,271	00:08:57,599	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	If it's a Friday garbage tree in the recycling
EDL	00:08:57,599	00:08:58,367	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Back
EDL	00:08:58,367	00:08:59,903	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	WWE Raw
EDL	00:08:59,903	00:09:01,951	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Cheap tell them that you cannot do that
EDL	00:09:02,975	00:09:05,023	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	One more time otherwise see you again
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:06,559	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	And how much
EDL	00:09:06,559	00:09:09,631	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Is the ticket 200 US dollars
EDL	00:09:09,631	00:09:11,679	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Podesta maximum
EDL	00:09:12,703	00:09:13,727	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	You might think
EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:15,007	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	This is such a drag
EDL	00:09:15,007	00:09:19,359	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	There must be some people who Buck the system by tossing their trash into public trash cans
EDL	00:09:19,871	00:09:20,639	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Well
EDL	00:09:20,639	00:09:23,455	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	There are hardly any public trash cans in Taipei
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:26,271	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	They're only in train stations or at bus stops
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:29,087	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	And those are little they come up just below your knees
EDL	00:09:29,087	00:09:31,135	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	So in Taipei for the most part
EDL	00:09:31,135	00:09:33,183	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	If you eat a candy or buy a coffee
EDL	00:09:33,183	00:09:34,463	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	You just take your empty coffee
EDL	00:09:34,975	00:09:35,999	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Or your candy wrapper
EDL	00:09:36,511	00:09:38,047	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Put it in your pocket and bring it home
EDL	00:09:38,559	00:09:39,071	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Your trash
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:41,631	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	You put in your blue bag
EDL	00:09:41,631	00:09:42,655	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	And bring out to the truck
EDL	00:09:43,423	00:09:43,935	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Yourself
EDL	00:09:44,959	00:09:48,031	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	It's hard to imagine a system like this working here in the US
EDL	00:09:48,031	00:09:52,383	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Every city here has a different method of trash pickup but across-the-board
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:57,247	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Uniting factor is that our American trash pickup system strive to be invisible
EDL	00:09:58,271	00:10:03,135	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	The trucks made great efforts to come when we're working or sleeping or trying to sleep
EDL	00:10:03,135	00:10:06,975	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Keeping out of the way of traffic and not disturbing the flow of the city
EDL	00:10:07,487	00:10:12,351	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	We take our trash and recycling out to Benz or down a shoe door to a dumpster
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:13,119	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	And
EDL	00:10:13,119	00:10:14,143	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	It's gone
EDL	00:10:14,143	00:10:15,167	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	We don't have to think about it
EDL	00:10:15,935	00:10:17,215	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	According to the EPA
EDL	00:10:17,215	00:10:19,007	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Americans recycle and compost
EDL	00:10:19,007	00:10:20,543	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	About 34% of their
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:23,103	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Which is less than most rich country
EDL	00:10:23,871	00:10:26,687	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	But some American cities do a lot better
EDL	00:10:27,455	00:10:33,087	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	San Francisco has probably the most forward recycling program in North America this is Robert Reed
EDL	00:10:33,599	00:10:35,135	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Is the representative of Recology
EDL	00:10:35,647	00:10:38,207	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	The company that takes care of San Francisco's waste
EDL	00:10:38,207	00:10:38,975	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Recycling and compost
EDL	00:10:39,743	00:10:45,887	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Unlike type A which has a public trash pickup system mini waste pickup services in the US are private
EDL	00:10:46,399	00:10:47,935	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	And we are the customers
EDL	00:10:47,935	00:10:50,239	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	That's how it works with ecology which means
EDL	00:10:50,239	00:10:52,543	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	They got to keep their customers happy
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:54,079	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Number one Focus
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:54,847	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Provides
EDL	00:10:54,847	00:10:56,127	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Superior customer service
EDL	00:10:56,639	00:10:58,175	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Their next focus is to
EDL	00:10:58,687	00:11:00,991	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Do as much recycling as possible
EDL	00:11:00,991	00:11:03,807	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	And to make recycling easy and convenient for customers
EDL	00:11:04,575	00:11:05,855	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Recology has set up
EDL	00:11:05,855	00:11:08,159	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Similar incentives to the system in Taipei
EDL	00:11:08,159	00:11:11,743	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	What trash pickup is way more expensive than recycling or compost
EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:14,047	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	For example in San Francisco
EDL	00:11:14,047	00:11:18,143	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Recycling and compost cost about $2 a month per bin
EDL	00:11:18,143	00:11:20,191	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Trash is about $26 a month
EDL	00:11:21,727	00:11:22,751	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Above all
EDL	00:11:22,751	00:11:24,287	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Recology system is mint
EDL	00:11:24,287	00:11:25,567	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	To be simple and
EDL	00:11:25,567	00:11:26,079	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Stress
EDL	00:11:26,847	00:11:27,359	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	It has to be
EDL	00:11:27,871	00:11:29,919	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	If you want people to keep paying for your service
EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:33,759	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	People have a lot of demands in their lives we understand that
EDL	00:11:33,759	00:11:37,343	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Young recycling might not be the very first thing they got the guy
EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:39,135	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Make a boss happy to go to pay their mortgage
EDL	00:11:39,647	00:11:42,975	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Garbage and recycling and composting might not always be at the top of the list
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:49,375	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	We understand that basically instead of putting the onus on the citizens to separate the different kind of compost and
EDL	00:11:49,375	00:11:50,655	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Recycling for themselves
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:52,703	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Recology does the brunt of the work
EDL	00:11:52,703	00:11:53,471	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Sorting
EDL	00:11:53,471	00:11:54,495	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	So we don't have to
EDL	00:11:55,263	00:11:59,103	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	San Francisco like a lot of other American cities that collect recycling
EDL	00:11:59,103	00:12:01,663	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Uses one catch-all recycling bin
EDL	00:12:01,663	00:12:04,991	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	So you throw your cans or bottles are cardboard all in the same place
EDL	00:12:05,759	00:12:08,575	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	And then all those different materials end up and if it
EDL	00:12:08,575	00:12:09,343	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Facility
EDL	00:12:09,343	00:12:10,623	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Like recycle Centre
EDL	00:12:11,391	00:12:13,951	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	So this is recycle Central this is the
EDL	00:12:14,719	00:12:15,487	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Large
EDL	00:12:15,487	00:12:17,535	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Recycling plant on pier 96
EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:22,399	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Where we sort all the materials from the blue band The Bottles cans with paper
EDL	00:12:23,935	00:12:25,471	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	We're going to go inside now
EDL	00:12:26,751	00:12:28,543	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	The facility is massive
EDL	00:12:28,543	00:12:31,871	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	That's where ecology process is most of San Francisco's recycling
EDL	00:12:33,919	00:12:34,943	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Straight bag
EDL	00:12:34,943	00:12:36,735	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Pile of recycling
EDL	00:12:36,735	00:12:37,503	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	This is
EDL	00:12:37,503	00:12:38,783	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	From this morning
EDL	00:12:38,783	00:12:40,319	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	This is from one day
EDL	00:12:40,319	00:12:42,111	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	And we're going to get this sorted out
EDL	00:12:42,623	00:12:43,903	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Because we got another big
EDL	00:12:43,903	00:12:46,719	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	File coming in tomorrow so we do 600
EDL	00:12:46,719	00:12:47,743	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Tons a day here
EDL	00:12:47,743	00:12:53,375	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	That 600 ton pile will wind its way of a huge surreal web of conveyor belt
EDL	00:12:53,887	00:13:00,287	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Where some of the 173 people on staff will separate the recyclables into 16 categories of
EDL	00:13:00,287	00:13:01,055	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Materials
EDL	00:13:01,055	00:13:03,359	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	With the help of some Modern Recycling equipment
EDL	00:13:04,127	00:13:09,247	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	So we've got a magnet's and we have fish ladders that separate bottles
EDL	00:13:09,247	00:13:10,527	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Zoo cams from paper
EDL	00:13:11,039	00:13:17,439	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	They're on a they're on an angle and they temporarily suspend gravity and to make sure everything gets precisely sordid
EDL	00:13:17,439	00:13:23,839	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	There's some real state-of-the-art technology like this apparatus that separates clear plastic from color plastic with
EDL	00:13:23,839	00:13:24,607	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Optic sensor
EDL	00:13:25,375	00:13:26,143	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Right here
EDL	00:13:27,167	00:13:33,567	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	The scanners looking at the materials as they come by and when it sees a clear plastic like a clear plastic water
EDL	00:13:33,567	00:13:35,871	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Ball and hits it with a puff of air
EDL	00:13:35,871	00:13:36,895	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Can you can hear it
EDL	00:13:38,687	00:13:44,063	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Expensive across $3000000 for this machine
EDL	00:13:44,063	00:13:45,599	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Going to keep for the Netherlands
EDL	00:13:47,903	00:13:49,183	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	So this system
EDL	00:13:49,183	00:13:54,047	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	With all that worrying twirling conveyors and magnets and machinery and 173 employees

EDL	00:13:55,839	00:13:57,887	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Make less trash by doing more cycling
EDL	00:13:58,399	00:13:59,935	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	And recycling
EDL	00:13:59,935	00:14:03,775	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Creates ten times more jobs than landfilling or incineration
EDL	00:14:04,287	00:14:08,895	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Of course it also takes all the direct sorting out of the hands of people who actually create the waist
EDL	00:14:09,407	00:14:10,943	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Charges them for the services
EDL	00:14:10,943	00:14:11,711	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Instead
EDL	00:14:11,711	00:14:12,479	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	As a result
EDL	00:14:12,479	00:14:14,015	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Recycling in the US
EDL	00:14:14,015	00:14:14,527	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Canby
EDL	00:14:15,295	00:14:21,183	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	I guess that's part of the problem like to the extent that there's pushback in recycling which I've seen some of it in the United
EDL	00:14:21,183	00:14:23,999	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	It states now is often about the cost of it and now it's
EDL	00:14:23,999	00:14:24,511	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Guitar cost
EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:28,863	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	And that's true if you're using me single-stream processes function
EDL	00:14:29,375	00:14:30,399	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	And it's less true
EDL	00:14:30,399	00:14:31,167	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	The household
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:34,751	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	That's Professor Mary Alice her. Again
EDL	00:14:35,263	00:14:39,871	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Your community wants to recycle all that stuff needs to be separated and sorted
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:40,895	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Somehow
EDL	00:14:41,407	00:14:44,735	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	What do you use a $3000000 machine from the Netherlands
EDL	00:14:44,735	00:14:50,367	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	For compelling entire sweet potato shaped island of people to stand on the corner at night
EDL	00:14:51,135	00:14:52,415	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	The Taipei system is
EDL	00:14:52,415	00:14:56,255	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Cheap and efficient because the city has conscripted their citizens as workers
EDL	00:14:57,023	00:14:58,047	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	And it's been successful
EDL	00:14:59,839	00:15:01,631	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Taipei has a great example of

EDL	00:15:06,751	00:15:10,847	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	That did not have a good garbage collection system not that long ago
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:11,615	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	And I have
EDL	00:15:11,615	00:15:12,639	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Slightly transformed
EDL	00:15:12,639	00:15:13,919	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	And it could be an example for us all
EDL	00:15:14,431	00:15:16,991	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Which is not to say we should necessarily

EDL	00:15:21,599	00:15:23,391	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	But consider the American garbage

EDL	00:15:35,167	00:15:36,959	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	You don't really pay attention to it
EDL	00:15:37,727	00:15:38,239	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	But
EDL	00:15:38,751	00:15:41,311	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Everyone should pay a lot of attention
EDL	00:15:42,335	00:15:48,735	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	We had to watch our garbage pile-up in our homes without taking it out to the van and had to set aside time in our days to
EDL	00:15:48,735	00:15:51,551	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	Catch the garbage and recycling trucks coming down the street
EDL	00:15:52,063	00:15:53,855	| 99pi-0213-separationanxiety-1 |	I bet we produce less drunk
