EDL	00:01:33,184	00:01:34,976	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Use scary music
EDL	00:01:34,976	00:01:38,304	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	And when we want to explore the design of music
EDL	00:01:38,304	00:01:40,352	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	We call rishikesh Railway

EDL	00:01:42,912	00:01:45,472	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	So here are two fundamental ways to make something sound scary
EDL	00:01:45,984	00:01:48,032	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	According to evolutionary biologist Dan blumstein
EDL	00:01:48,544	00:01:50,592	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	The first way is to use lots of screeching irregular
EDL	00:01:51,360	00:01:53,152	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Animals when they're scared
EDL	00:01:53,152	00:01:57,760	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Are blowing a lot of air across their vocal cords or cross their syrinx if there are bird
EDL	00:01:58,272	00:02:01,600	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	And the sounds of Screams are something that is
EDL	00:02:01,600	00:02:02,624	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Arousing
EDL	00:02:02,624	00:02:03,904	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	And makes people feel negative
EDL	00:02:04,416	00:02:10,560	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	It's biological your lizard brain hears Bernard Herman's knife stabbing music and psycho and Sassy
EDL	00:02:11,072	00:02:14,144	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Something terrible is happening right now
EDL	00:02:15,168	00:02:17,472	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	The second way sound can make you feel uneasy
EDL	00:02:17,472	00:02:17,984	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	To go the other way
EDL	00:02:18,752	00:02:19,776	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Make really low ground
EDL	00:02:21,824	00:02:28,224	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Another biological Cube that might lead to fear and anxiety is hearing low frequency
EDL	00:02:28,224	00:02:34,624	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	The lowest frequency of a species can produce as a function of its body size so low frequency
EDL	00:02:34,624	00:02:35,904	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Probably should scare you
EDL	00:02:36,416	00:02:38,720	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	It it might mean if something big is around
EDL	00:02:38,720	00:02:43,584	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Makes those both together and you're on your way to creating classic scary music for scary movies
EDL	00:02:54,336	00:03:00,736	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Good horror movies aren't just meant to be horrifying exciting fun so it's sometimes nice to have a

EDL	00:03:03,040	00:03:08,416	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	The music from the movie Halloween by composer John Carpenter will always greet me out
EDL	00:03:08,416	00:03:10,720	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	And also give me kind of excited
EDL	00:03:10,720	00:03:14,304	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	And some Sahara movies I certainly know that I respond
EDL	00:03:15,072	00:03:15,584	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	2
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:18,912	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Sound in horror movies in ways that are complex

EDL	00:03:22,752	00:03:26,080	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	That's a very specific thing that provokes drag

EDL	00:03:47,072	00:03:49,376	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Serial killer named Hannibal Lecter who you may know from

EDL	00:03:54,240	00:03:55,008	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Hannibal
EDL	00:03:55,008	00:03:59,104	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Is a nasty character who commits brisley and unspeakable crimes
EDL	00:03:59,104	00:04:05,504	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	The other main character is Will Graham FBI profiler with a knack for getting inside the heads of serial killer

EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:15,488	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	An inside will Graham's head is exactly where the sound design of Hannibal

EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:26,495	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	These are things that we want
EDL	00:04:26,495	00:04:27,263	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	How to make an audio
EDL	00:04:31,615	00:04:37,759	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	This is from the first episode of Hannibal
EDL	00:04:44,671	00:04:51,071	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	All the classic horror movie music we mentioned before exist outside the world of the story and other words it's not
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:53,119	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Being heard by the characters being depicted
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:57,983	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	It's just being heard by the audience but composer Brian reitzell score for Hannibal feels different
EDL	00:04:57,983	00:05:02,335	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	You get a sense that it's even being heard by Will Graham inside his own imagination
EDL	00:05:02,847	00:05:06,943	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Our whole goal with horror really is to
EDL	00:05:06,943	00:05:13,343	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Transport people into the other reality and it's a scary reality it's a tense reality but it's a
EDL	00:05:13,343	00:05:15,135	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	The beautiful place to
EDL	00:05:15,135	00:05:21,535	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	But to do that I find the most effective way to scare people is to throw sounds of them
EDL	00:05:21,535	00:05:23,071	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	That are unfamiliar to them
EDL	00:05:23,071	00:05:26,143	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	So Brian construx new sounds that the audience can't place
EDL	00:05:26,143	00:05:26,655	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Create Anis
EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:29,471	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Guitar what is that
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:36,383	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	A lot of what we do is create all of the sound so we turn all the sound effects off
EDL	00:05:36,383	00:05:39,967	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	And the ones that we think are important we try to make
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:42,783	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Tell me that resembles that sound or feels like that sound
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:44,575	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	I don't differentiate
EDL	00:05:44,575	00:05:46,111	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Really between
EDL	00:05:46,111	00:05:48,415	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Ambient sounds like a motor and
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:49,695	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Abase
EDL	00:05:50,207	00:05:51,487	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	So in this case
EDL	00:05:51,487	00:05:54,815	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	She's on a motorcycle I had to be really interesting to
EDL	00:05:54,815	00:05:58,143	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Make the feeling of what it would be like
EDL	00:05:58,143	00:05:59,679	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Being on that motorcycle
EDL	00:06:00,191	00:06:02,239	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Rush of adrenaline in the Wind
EDL	00:06:02,751	00:06:07,103	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Sound of engine which is underneath you I mean all this is very powerful
EDL	00:06:07,103	00:06:08,127	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Stop self
EDL	00:06:08,127	00:06:13,247	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	The first idea I had was to do it with an upright Bass
EDL	00:06:13,247	00:06:19,391	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Just listening up and down the neck
EDL	00:06:27,839	00:06:32,959	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	The Q starts with with the motorcycle starting up
EDL	00:06:33,727	00:06:36,543	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	So we do lots of little things in there too
EDL	00:06:36,543	00:06:37,055	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Mimic
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:39,103	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Or hinted those sound
EDL	00:06:39,103	00:06:41,151	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	On-screen Racine the key turn
EDL	00:06:41,663	00:06:42,431	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Castanets
EDL	00:06:42,943	00:06:43,711	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Can we see the
EDL	00:06:43,711	00:06:45,247	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Flames from the engine
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:47,039	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	The sound of sheep
EDL	00:06:47,551	00:06:49,087	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Is me bowing a wood block
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:52,927	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	River by and sounds
EDL	00:06:57,023	00:07:01,631	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	The more I work with the different instruments the more I understand what you can get out of them
EDL	00:07:12,127	00:07:16,991	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Almost all the towns in Hannibal start out as an acoustic element from Brian rifles Workshop
EDL	00:07:16,991	00:07:23,135	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Then the effort is made to strip it of identifying characteristics that would ground the sound in the real world
EDL	00:07:23,647	00:07:27,231	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	I'm constantly trying to d guitar a guitar or
EDL	00:07:27,743	00:07:29,535	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Drama drama
EDL	00:07:32,351	00:07:38,751	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Best Brian placing a wooden Chopstick on a snare drum and pulling a violin bow across the
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:39,519	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Chopstick
EDL	00:07:39,519	00:07:44,639	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	You could never tell by listening that Chopstick bow or a drum made this sound
EDL	00:07:49,247	00:07:54,623	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Brian doesn't just take regular instruments and make them weird he also takes weird instruments and makes them weirder
EDL	00:07:55,135	00:07:58,463	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	I went around Brian's Studio as he pulled out examples of the instruments uses
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:08:02,303	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	For example the sound of synapses firing inside will grab his head
EDL	00:08:02,303	00:08:03,583	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	It started out as a newton
EDL	00:08:03,583	00:08:07,167	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Gradle if you don't know a Newton Cradle by name you definitely know the sound
EDL	00:08:08,447	00:08:10,495	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	I already knows it's it's on your desk

EDL	00:12:59,263	00:13:02,079	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	And that was the way my dad was one of the ways that we bonded
EDL	00:13:02,079	00:13:03,103	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	In a small plane

EDL	00:13:05,407	00:13:06,431	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	So I had a lot of experience

EDL	00:13:23,327	00:13:25,119	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	In 2005
EDL	00:13:25,119	00:13:26,911	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	We were still
EDL	00:13:26,911	00:13:29,983	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Pretty close to 9:11 and the space shuttle
EDL	00:13:29,983	00:13:32,031	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Disaster followed
EDL	00:13:32,031	00:13:33,311	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Pretty close on the heels of a
EDL	00:13:33,823	00:13:36,895	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	But also there were all those smaller
EDL	00:13:37,919	00:13:39,711	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	The Alaska Airlines
EDL	00:13:40,223	00:13:42,783	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Crash that happened off the coast of California where
EDL	00:13:42,783	00:13:43,807	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Or they lost their
EDL	00:13:43,807	00:13:46,623	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Vertical stabilizer the Jack screw one
EDL	00:13:46,623	00:13:51,999	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	The pilots were aware there was a problem everyone was aware there was a problem and just flew around and then
EDL	00:13:51,999	00:13:53,279	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Flipped upside down in Plymouth
EDL	00:13:53,791	00:13:59,167	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	And then there was the one off of Long Island where maybe the gas tank exploded
EDL	00:13:59,679	00:14:01,215	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	And then there was that Learjet
EDL	00:14:01,215	00:14:01,983	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	That
EDL	00:14:01,983	00:14:04,543	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Lost compression and everybody in it
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:06,591	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Gone until it ran out of gas
EDL	00:14:07,103	00:14:08,127	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	And all of these
EDL	00:14:08,127	00:14:10,175	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Disasters stuck with me
EDL	00:14:10,175	00:14:14,783	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Digitally the ones where there was a sense that the people onboard knew that they
EDL	00:14:15,295	00:14:17,343	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	We're lost but they were still alive
EDL	00:14:17,343	00:14:22,207	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	The unfolding Dawning realization like you know we're not getting out of this
EDL	00:14:22,719	00:14:28,863	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	And what's your reaction in that situation do you do you scream you probably don't probably everybody is real
EDL	00:14:30,143	00:14:32,447	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Situation in

EDL	00:14:38,335	00:14:40,639	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Worry about it but everybody had convinced them in
EDL	00:14:41,151	00:14:42,687	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	And there
EDL	00:14:42,687	00:14:44,735	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Performing their duties

EDL	00:15:37,983	00:15:38,495	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Work
EDL	00:15:39,519	00:15:42,591	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Every once in awhile you get one as a songwriter where you sit down at your instrument
EDL	00:15:43,359	00:15:44,383	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	You have an idea
EDL	00:15:44,895	00:15:47,455	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	You have a first line you sing it and
EDL	00:15:47,455	00:15:49,247	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Compose the entire song in
EDL	00:15:49,247	00:15:49,759	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	In an hour
EDL	00:15:50,271	00:15:51,551	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	When you go I don't know where that came
EDL	00:16:00,767	00:16:03,327	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	I resisted piano lessons
EDL	00:16:03,327	00:16:05,887	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	As a kid but sometime in high school
EDL	00:16:06,655	00:16:09,215	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	I started to sit at the piano voluntarily
EDL	00:16:09,215	00:16:10,239	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	When no one was home
EDL	00:16:11,007	00:16:11,775	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	And trying
EDL	00:16:12,287	00:16:12,799	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Figure it out
EDL	00:16:13,567	00:16:15,103	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	And I got as far as
EDL	00:16:15,103	00:16:18,431	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	You could go if you were just practicing for 11 minutes at a time
EDL	00:16:19,711	00:16:22,015	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	And I didn't really learn the piano until I was in my thirties
EDL	00:16:22,783	00:16:23,807	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Learn the piano as much as
EDL	00:16:25,087	00:16:26,879	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	In the early 90s
EDL	00:16:26,879	00:16:28,671	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	In Seattle especially
EDL	00:16:28,671	00:16:31,743	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	There was a mentality that you didn't want to over learn
EDL	00:16:31,743	00:16:32,767	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Your instrument
EDL	00:16:33,535	00:16:37,119	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Right because that was going to affect the authenticity of your feelings
EDL	00:16:38,143	00:16:40,703	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	And I embrace that Hook Line & Sinker
EDL	00:16:41,727	00:16:43,519	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	So the producer of this
EDL	00:16:43,519	00:16:44,799	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Track was Tucker Martin
EDL	00:16:45,311	00:16:48,639	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Tucker head up just a stand-up parlor piano in his living room
EDL	00:16:48,639	00:16:49,663	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	That was recorded
EDL	00:16:50,943	00:16:52,735	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Now we would probably just
EDL	00:16:52,735	00:16:54,271	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Record at 1
EDL	00:16:54,271	00:16:55,551	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Measure and lupus
EDL	00:16:56,063	00:16:58,623	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	But at the time I had to sit and play it
EDL	00:16:59,647	00:17:03,231	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	For 5 minutes and then I would get to the end and he be like
EDL	00:17:03,999	00:17:10,143	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Let's hit it again
EDL	00:17:13,983	00:17:15,007	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Eric Corson
EDL	00:17:15,007	00:17:15,519	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Long layers
EDL	00:17:16,287	00:17:18,079	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	And my chief
EDL	00:17:18,079	00:17:18,591	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Musical park
EDL	00:17:19,359	00:17:20,383	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	He sat down at
EDL	00:17:20,383	00:17:21,919	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	At the micro cord which is not an instrument
EDL	00:17:21,919	00:17:22,431	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	What she knew
EDL	00:17:23,199	00:17:24,991	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	But he worked with it for a little bit and
EDL	00:17:24,991	00:17:25,503	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Figured it out
EDL	00:17:35,231	00:17:35,743	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	There are
EDL	00:17:36,255	00:17:39,071	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Five or six moments in the song that without Eric
EDL	00:17:39,839	00:17:40,351	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Part
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:42,399	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	It would be so much
EDL	00:17:42,399	00:17:43,423	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Less of a complete
EDL	00:17:45,215	00:17:46,751	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	His part is very cinematic
EDL	00:17:59,807	00:18:01,343	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	As the song unfolded
EDL	00:18:01,343	00:18:02,623	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	It just starts to go sideways
EDL	00:18:03,647	00:18:04,415	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Every successive
EDL	00:18:05,183	00:18:05,695	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Stuff
EDL	00:18:06,719	00:18:08,511	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Most of The Long Winter songs are
EDL	00:18:08,511	00:18:10,047	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	About relationships and they are
EDL	00:18:10,559	00:18:11,839	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Intentionally
EDL	00:18:11,839	00:18:12,863	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Difficult to parse
EDL	00:18:13,375	00:18:17,215	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Because they're meant to communicate in an emotional language rather than in a literal
EDL	00:18:18,239	00:18:20,287	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	And so as I was writing this song I
EDL	00:18:20,799	00:18:23,359	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	As I made my way through the emotional
EDL	00:18:23,359	00:18:26,175	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Story I was trying to tell I did arrive at a place where I was
EDL	00:18:26,687	00:18:27,711	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	I need to
EDL	00:18:28,223	00:18:28,991	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Give a
EDL	00:18:28,991	00:18:29,503	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Blue
EDL	00:18:30,527	00:18:34,111	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	The crew compartment
EDL	00:18:34,111	00:18:38,719	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	I was embarrassed
EDL	00:18:38,719	00:18:39,999	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	To say the crew compartment
EDL	00:18:39,999	00:18:40,767	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Breaking up
EDL	00:18:40,767	00:18:41,791	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Because I felt like
EDL	00:18:42,559	00:18:43,583	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	It was too little
EDL	00:18:45,119	00:18:48,447	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	And so to say the crew compartments breaking up the first time I went through and I was
EDL	00:18:49,727	00:18:50,495	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Let you know
EDL	00:18:50,495	00:18:51,263	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	But it needed it
EDL	00:18:52,031	00:18:55,359	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	The crew
EDL	00:19:00,991	00:19:02,015	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	And the thing was
EDL	00:19:02,015	00:19:03,039	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	You sing at once
EDL	00:19:03,551	00:19:05,855	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	The second time everybody gets it the third time
EDL	00:19:05,855	00:19:08,159	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	They've heard it now the 4th time they're like okay alright
EDL	00:19:08,927	00:19:10,975	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	56 time it starts to get annoying
EDL	00:19:11,487	00:19:13,279	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	And then a new kind of
EDL	00:19:13,791	00:19:15,327	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Gravity enters in
EDL	00:19:16,607	00:19:17,119	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	7
EDL	00:19:18,399	00:19:19,167	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Restart
EDL	00:19:19,167	00:19:19,935	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Fuel
EDL	00:19:19,935	00:19:20,447	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	The emotion
EDL	00:19:31,967	00:19:38,367	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	And when
EDL	00:19:38,367	00:19:41,183	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	When I perform at live if I'm not careful I will
EDL	00:19:41,695	00:19:42,207	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Start to cry.
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:51,423	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Dollar Tree
EDL	00:19:51,935	00:19:52,447	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Bailando
EDL	00:19:52,959	00:19:55,775	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	We tried to get a little string quartet to come in
EDL	00:19:55,775	00:19:57,567	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	We ran several passes
EDL	00:19:58,591	00:19:59,871	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	We took that and
EDL	00:19:59,871	00:20:00,895	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Play double speed
EDL	00:20:01,663	00:20:05,247	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	And they did their own version of this kind of swarm of bees
EDL	00:20:19,583	00:20:24,447	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	So we didn't have a drummer and it was like we should we get should we call that one guy because like or I could get the best drummer
EDL	00:20:25,471	00:20:26,495	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Any
EDL	00:20:26,495	00:20:28,543	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Producer would make that choice if he had
EDL	00:20:28,543	00:20:29,055	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Matt Chamberlain
EDL	00:20:30,079	00:20:30,847	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	And Tucker
EDL	00:20:40,319	00:20:42,623	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	And he managed to
EDL	00:20:42,623	00:20:44,927	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Not just introduced swing into it
EDL	00:20:44,927	00:20:48,767	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	But make this piano part which on its own is very Square
EDL	00:20:50,303	00:20:51,327	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	And on top of the beat
EDL	00:20:52,095	00:20:53,631	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	And he played to it
EDL	00:20:54,911	00:20:56,703	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Introduced swing to it
EDL	00:20:56,703	00:20:59,519	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Played a little bit behind in a little bit
EDL	00:20:59,519	00:21:01,567	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	With this tremendous sort of
EDL	00:21:02,079	00:21:03,615	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Breath and energy
EDL	00:21:03,615	00:21:05,407	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	And watching it all happen
EDL	00:21:05,407	00:21:07,711	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Was Revelation to me as a musician
EDL	00:21:07,711	00:21:09,759	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	I understood how much I have to learn
EDL	00:21:10,527	00:21:11,807	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	So what Matt did
EDL	00:21:12,319	00:21:15,135	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	He he came in he set up his drums and he had one microphone
EDL	00:21:15,647	00:21:16,928	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	But he pulled out of a bag
EDL	00:21:17,696	00:21:19,232	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Set up himself
EDL	00:21:19,232	00:21:20,768	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	And we all just for watching him
EDL	00:21:21,280	00:21:26,144	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	You know like you would watch a black panther that came into your kitchen looks like
EDL	00:21:27,168	00:21:28,192	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	What's it going to do
EDL	00:21:29,984	00:21:34,592	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Any put the microphone in front of his drums and he was like okay you know record me
EDL	00:21:34,592	00:21:40,224	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	And so he plays for about a minute and then he's like play that back from Annie listens to the track
EDL	00:21:41,760	00:21:45,088	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	And then he stands up he walks around and he moves the microphone
EDL	00:21:49,440	00:21:50,464	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Sit back down and says
EDL	00:21:52,256	00:21:53,792	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Any plays all the way through the trash
EDL	00:21:54,560	00:21:59,424	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	And I was listening to it and going like you know I'm the songwriter and kind of the main guy here and I was like
EDL	00:22:00,192	00:22:04,032	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Yeah it was pretty good I mean I got some comments
EDL	00:22:05,312	00:22:06,848	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	And here we got to the end he was like
EDL	00:22:06,848	00:22:08,128	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Okay roll it again
EDL	00:22:08,640	00:22:09,664	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	You know when you didn't
EDL	00:22:09,664	00:22:11,968	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Wait to hear any comments from the songwriter which is like
EDL	00:22:13,248	00:22:14,016	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	All right
EDL	00:22:16,832	00:22:18,112	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	He played through it again
EDL	00:22:18,112	00:22:19,904	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	And I was like most interesting
EDL	00:22:19,904	00:22:21,440	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	You know kind of variation
EDL	00:22:21,952	00:22:23,488	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	He was like give it to me again
EDL	00:22:24,256	00:22:25,024	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	He did that five times
EDL	00:22:25,792	00:22:26,816	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	And then he's like Alright
EDL	00:22:26,816	00:22:28,608	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	You know I'm coming into the control room
EDL	00:22:28,608	00:22:30,400	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	He comes and he sits down he's like okay
EDL	00:22:30,912	00:22:32,192	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Can those five tracks
EDL	00:22:32,704	00:22:33,728	| 99pi-0168-allinyourhead-1 |	Hard left
