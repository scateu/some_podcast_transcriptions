EDL	00:00:53,248	00:00:54,016	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	As the host
EDL	00:00:54,784	00:01:01,184	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	We don't like how it's so scary I don't know your voice
EDL	00:01:01,184	00:01:03,744	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	Especially in this round what I didn't know anything about it
EDL	00:01:04,256	00:01:06,048	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	And yeah there's a
EDL	00:01:06,048	00:01:06,560	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	So much to
EDL	00:01:07,072	00:01:08,096	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	Synthesizing
EDL	00:01:08,096	00:01:10,400	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	Working on it for so long
EDL	00:01:10,912	00:01:12,448	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	I learned
EDL	00:01:12,960	00:01:13,728	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	So much
EDL	00:01:14,496	00:01:17,056	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	And it's really changed
EDL	00:01:17,056	00:01:18,592	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	The way I dress
EDL	00:01:18,592	00:01:19,616	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	And the way I shop
EDL	00:01:20,128	00:01:23,200	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	Hireling it's amazing so what do you mean by that
EDL	00:01:23,200	00:01:25,760	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	The funny thing is I think going into the series
EDL	00:01:26,272	00:01:27,808	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	I was like I am a close purse
EDL	00:01:28,320	00:01:29,600	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	I am a person who loves
EDL	00:01:30,880	00:01:32,416	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	After reporting a series
EDL	00:01:33,184	00:01:34,464	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	I am a person
EDL	00:01:35,232	00:01:41,632	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	Who hates Claire and I am a person
EDL	00:01:41,632	00:01:42,912	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	I'm a person who loves
EDL	00:01:42,912	00:01:45,216	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	Style and I love fashion
EDL	00:01:45,728	00:01:46,496	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	But
EDL	00:01:46,496	00:01:47,264	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	Lowe's
EDL	00:01:48,544	00:01:49,312	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	Ricky
EDL	00:01:49,312	00:01:50,080	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	Json
EDL	00:01:50,080	00:01:51,104	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	Explain the nuance
EDL	00:01:52,384	00:01:55,968	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	As we learned in episode number 5 of Articles of interest about denim
EDL	00:01:56,480	00:01:57,248	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	The process
EDL	00:01:57,248	00:01:58,528	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	Making clothes
EDL	00:01:59,040	00:02:02,368	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	Any kind of clothes is really wasteful
EDL	00:02:02,368	00:02:05,184	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	And we live in a world where it is
EDL	00:02:05,184	00:02:08,000	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	So easy to just buy new clothes
EDL	00:02:08,512	00:02:14,912	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	And that's what I used to do all the time not even thinking about it I think a lot of people who don't consider
EDL	00:02:14,912	00:02:16,448	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	Big shoppers
EDL	00:02:16,448	00:02:22,848	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	Just you know it here and there occasionally just impulsively buy things from the internet from us
EDL	00:02:22,848	00:02:23,616	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	Store
EDL	00:02:23,616	00:02:26,176	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	And maybe sometimes it fits in sometimes
EDL	00:02:26,176	00:02:28,480	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	It's your style and sometimes it's not
EDL	00:02:29,248	00:02:34,112	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	Whatever then you donated to the Goodwill and that's good for the Goodwill and that is totally how I live
EDL	00:02:36,672	00:02:40,256	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	From the consumerism because you know you're going to donate it and clothes are these
EDL	00:02:40,256	00:02:41,280	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	And that lead
EDL	00:02:41,280	00:02:42,560	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	Donatable object
EDL	00:02:43,072	00:02:43,584	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	But that's
EDL	00:02:44,352	00:02:45,376	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	Not enough
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:47,168	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	It's no no because it
EDL	00:02:47,936	00:02:48,448	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	Really
EDL	00:02:49,472	00:02:51,520	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	Most clothes end up in landfill
EDL	00:02:51,520	00:02:52,288	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	Anyway
EDL	00:02:52,288	00:02:53,312	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	And
EDL	00:02:53,824	00:03:00,224	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	Goodwill and Salvation Army these amazing organizations provide this like a virtuous outlet for us to just continue getting rid of clothes
EDL	00:03:00,224	00:03:00,992	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	Buy new stuff
EDL	00:03:01,504	00:03:02,528	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	All the time
EDL	00:03:02,528	00:03:06,112	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	And when the cycle of Life by donut by donut by donut by donut
EDL	00:03:06,112	00:03:08,672	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	Which you know it's good to donate your clothes
EDL	00:03:08,672	00:03:09,440	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	But
EDL	00:03:09,440	00:03:10,208	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	It's not
EDL	00:03:10,720	00:03:12,256	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	The solution for overconsumption
EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:13,792	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	And
EDL	00:03:14,304	00:03:14,816	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	Close
EDL	00:03:15,328	00:03:16,096	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	Distribute
EDL	00:03:17,376	00:03:18,400	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	To 8%
EDL	00:03:18,912	00:03:21,472	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	All CO2 emissions in the world
EDL	00:03:21,472	00:03:22,496	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	Huge
EDL	00:03:22,496	00:03:23,520	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	Huge output
EDL	00:03:24,288	00:03:28,384	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	And we are just consuming too many new things until every designer I talked
EDL	00:03:29,408	00:03:30,176	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	Thinking about this
EDL	00:03:30,176	00:03:31,456	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	Concerned about this worried about this
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:32,480	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	And
EDL	00:03:32,992	00:03:35,296	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	So many people are just like you need to stop buying
EDL	00:03:36,832	00:03:37,344	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	Yeah
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:41,184	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	Even the people who make the clothes Vivienne Westwood

EDL	00:04:13,440	00:04:14,208	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	Expression

EDL	00:04:41,087	00:04:43,135	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	Frau that's because I was traveling so much

EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:16,415	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	Suddenly look at my now in Norma Seaman closet
EDL	00:05:16,927	00:05:17,951	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	I guess I was just
EDL	00:05:18,975	00:05:22,815	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	So overwhelmed by the number of clothes I had him if I go to the Wonderland and I can

EDL	00:05:51,487	00:05:53,791	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	Appreciating what you already have
EDL	00:05:53,791	00:05:55,327	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	But you know
EDL	00:05:55,327	00:05:56,351	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	But doesn't that you're never
EDL	00:05:57,119	00:06:02,239	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	You will check your body changes you change attitudes change and style is a thing
EDL	00:06:02,751	00:06:04,031	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	I used to have this idea
EDL	00:06:04,031	00:06:07,615	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	I used to think I was immune to fashion and I used to think that fashion people
EDL	00:06:08,127	00:06:10,431	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	Like get Vogue magazine
EDL	00:06:10,431	00:06:13,759	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	And a bit like it's the Bible and when Vogue says
EDL	00:06:13,759	00:06:20,159	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	Polka dots are in like you go out and you buy polka dots and you throw out your stripes and that's not how fashion works we all
EDL	00:06:20,159	00:06:21,695	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	Pay attention to Fashion
EDL	00:06:21,695	00:06:23,487	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	But the way it manifests is not from this
EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:26,815	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	Ruling that comes down from on high it's just when you
EDL	00:06:27,327	00:06:30,143	| Bonus_Episode_Avery_update_on_AoI |	Look in your closet and you think I have nothing to wear
