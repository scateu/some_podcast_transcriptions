EDL	00:02:32,576	00:02:37,696	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Basically wanted to figure out if and when the world was going to hit maximum capacity
EDL	00:02:37,696	00:02:38,464	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	And one out of resource
EDL	00:02:39,488	00:02:40,768	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	And toward this end
EDL	00:02:40,768	00:02:41,536	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	They had a tool
EDL	00:02:42,048	00:02:43,328	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	A relatively new tool
EDL	00:02:43,328	00:02:43,840	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	What's the time

EDL	00:02:46,144	00:02:51,008	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	And so they plugged a bunch of data into their huge 1970s computers
EDL	00:02:51,776	00:02:55,104	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	And then looked at the results and switched up the variables

EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:13,792	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	All of them should have led to the same conclusion
EDL	00:03:14,816	00:03:17,120	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Sometime in the 21st century there would be

EDL	00:03:21,216	00:03:25,312	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	In 1972 the club of Rome published a book outlining their findings
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:26,080	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Called
EDL	00:03:26,080	00:03:27,104	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	The limits to growth
EDL	00:03:27,616	00:03:29,920	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	And it got a lot of media attention
EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:36,832	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	They found the way things are going now the planet can support us for less than 100 years
EDL	00:03:36,832	00:03:38,112	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	It maybe never 50
EDL	00:03:38,624	00:03:42,464	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	The book became a surprise bestseller and was translated into more than
EDL	00:03:42,464	00:03:43,744	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Two dozen languages
EDL	00:03:44,512	00:03:47,840	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	And yeah there were critics who disagreed with the findings
EDL	00:03:47,840	00:03:52,192	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	But overall the limits to growth was incredibly influential
EDL	00:03:52,192	00:03:52,704	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	You know there was a

EDL	00:04:02,944	00:04:05,248	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	On the cover of Newsweek says running out of everything
EDL	00:04:06,528	00:04:08,576	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	You can see the idea of limits
EDL	00:04:08,576	00:04:10,112	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	All over popular culture

EDL	00:04:23,679	00:04:25,471	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Give me the whole premise of the movie is
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:26,495	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	It's based on
EDL	00:04:27,007	00:04:28,031	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	A scenario where they
EDL	00:04:28,031	00:04:29,567	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Overpopulation
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:31,359	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	And the Earth is

EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:52,607	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	But I think there was a
EDL	00:04:52,607	00:04:54,143	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Really Fierce debate
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:56,447	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	That the limits to growth report stimulated
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:05:00,287	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	About whether there was this need to curtail economic
EDL	00:05:00,287	00:05:01,055	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Growth
EDL	00:05:01,055	00:05:02,847	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Regulate populations
EDL	00:05:02,847	00:05:05,663	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	And perhaps even curtail individual freedoms
EDL	00:05:07,711	00:05:11,039	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	And out of this chorus of debate an alarm
EDL	00:05:11,551	00:05:15,391	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Emerges a physicist and engineer named Gerard O'Neill
EDL	00:05:15,903	00:05:17,951	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	He was mostly known as Jerry

EDL	00:05:26,655	00:05:31,775	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	And the answer to a lot of our problems here on Earth may actually be out in space
EDL	00:05:32,543	00:05:35,103	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	In what O'Neal called The High Frontier

EDL	00:05:57,887	00:05:59,679	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	From its surface out in the
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:05,055	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	The space O'Neal was motivated and really saw his ideas as a form of environmentalism

EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:35,007	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Before he started thinking about
EDL	00:06:35,007	00:06:35,775	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Space colony
EDL	00:06:35,775	00:06:38,591	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Jerry O'Neill was a professor in Princeton physics
EDL	00:06:39,103	00:06:41,407	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	But he wasn't content analyzing data
EDL	00:06:41,919	00:06:42,943	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	He like building things
EDL	00:06:43,455	00:06:45,503	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	O'Neill's contribution to physics
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:46,015	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Was
EDL	00:06:46,527	00:06:49,599	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Re-engineering the way in which particle accelerators work
EDL	00:06:49,599	00:06:50,623	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Designed and built
EDL	00:06:50,623	00:06:52,415	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	And he was really really successful at this
EDL	00:06:53,183	00:06:55,999	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	He was very famous already as a physicist
EDL	00:06:55,999	00:06:58,815	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Long before he got interested in space colonies
EDL	00:06:59,327	00:07:02,911	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	So he was very much respected among his equals
EDL	00:07:03,423	00:07:04,191	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	And a
EDL	00:07:04,191	00:07:06,495	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	So if a person of Great Character
EDL	00:07:07,007	00:07:08,799	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	I always got along very well with him
EDL	00:07:09,311	00:07:11,615	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	That's Freeman Dyson
EDL	00:07:11,615	00:07:17,247	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Freeman Dyson I'm a retired professor at The Institute for advanced study in Princeton

EDL	00:07:18,527	00:07:20,319	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	What is mathematics and physics
EDL	00:07:20,319	00:07:23,903	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	I was just a pencil Pusher Distributing equations
EDL	00:07:23,903	00:07:25,695	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Dyson is being modest
EDL	00:07:25,695	00:07:27,231	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	She was an is a
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:29,279	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Polymath in a veritable genius
EDL	00:07:29,791	00:07:33,119	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	He's made huge contributions in quantum mechanics
EDL	00:07:33,119	00:07:36,191	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	But also in nuclear energy biology
EDL	00:07:36,191	00:07:36,959	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Astrophysics
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:41,567	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	And he's got pop-culture cred to there's a video game character
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:42,847	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	You're named after him
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:45,919	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	There's even a Star Trek episode about one of his Concepts
EDL	00:07:46,431	00:07:49,759	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Titan was also a friend and colleague to Jerry O'Neill
EDL	00:07:49,759	00:07:51,807	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	O'Neal died in 1992
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:54,367	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	How many students were always
EDL	00:07:54,879	00:07:56,415	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Following him around
EDL	00:07:56,415	00:07:57,951	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	He actually
EDL	00:07:57,951	00:07:59,231	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Russian students
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:08:00,767	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Doing real projects
EDL	00:08:00,767	00:08:02,559	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	It wasn't just talk
EDL	00:08:02,559	00:08:06,911	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	In 1969 the same year the first astronauts walked on the moon
EDL	00:08:07,423	00:08:11,775	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	O'Neill posed a question to his introductory physics students at Princeton
EDL	00:08:12,287	00:08:14,079	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	What makes more sense
EDL	00:08:14,079	00:08:17,151	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Building human settlements on the surface of another planet
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:19,967	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Rebuilding free-floating settlement
EDL	00:08:19,967	00:08:21,247	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	In outer space
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:27,391	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	3 months of research and calculations O'Neal and his students came to the conclusion that building free floating habitat
EDL	00:08:27,903	00:08:28,927	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Was the way to go
EDL	00:08:28,927	00:08:35,071	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	First of all you don't have to overcome gravity every time you go on and off of free-floating space settlement
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:41,727	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	But even more importantly in space you have access to the sun's energy 100% of the time
EDL	00:08:42,495	00:08:44,287	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	So no other sources
EDL	00:08:44,287	00:08:45,823	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	The fuel would be needed
EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:50,687	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	But when the semester ended O'Neill didn't stop thinking about space colonization
EDL	00:08:51,199	00:08:51,711	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	In fact
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:53,759	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	He'd only just begun
EDL	00:08:54,527	00:08:55,551	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Goodwill Sumter

EDL	00:08:58,367	00:09:00,671	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	It was something O'Neal really salty should do
EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:09,887	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	O'Neill decided he would build his settlements at a place in our solar system 250,000 miles from
EDL	00:09:10,655	00:09:11,423	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Called

EDL	00:09:22,175	00:09:23,455	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	And so these are the most
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:26,271	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Convenient places if you want to have a fixed habitat

EDL	00:09:43,679	00:09:48,543	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Oliver nails designs for habitats were variations on cylinders spheres or rings
EDL	00:09:49,055	00:09:50,591	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	And it designs have been copied
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:51,359	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	All

EDL	00:09:57,503	00:09:59,551	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	The design that I find the easiest
EDL	00:09:59,551	00:10:01,343	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Picture basically looks like
EDL	00:10:01,343	00:10:03,903	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Giant bicycle wheel floating in space
EDL	00:10:04,927	00:10:07,487	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	The people would live inside the tire

EDL	00:10:08,511	00:10:10,559	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Which itself would be enormous
EDL	00:10:11,071	00:10:12,607	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	There would be a huge windows
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:14,143	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	What's that let in sunlight
EDL	00:10:14,143	00:10:16,959	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	And allowed amazing views of outer space

EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:34,623	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	An Italian Hilltown we we knew that the first ones wouldn't look like
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:36,415	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Anything like that
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:38,463	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	That's Tasha O'Neal
EDL	00:10:38,975	00:10:44,095	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	In 1969 Tasha had just moved to the US from Germany to work as an au pair
EDL	00:10:44,095	00:10:47,423	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	When she decided to attend a mixer the YMCA
EDL	00:10:47,935	00:10:51,263	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	In what Jerry O'Neill with his mop top haircut
EDL	00:10:51,263	00:10:55,359	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Looking more like a member of the 60s rock band than a physicist
EDL	00:10:55,359	00:11:00,991	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	I looked at him and I thought that's the first interesting guy that I see around here
EDL	00:11:00,991	00:11:04,319	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	I wouldn't say it was love at first sight but it was definitely
EDL	00:11:04,319	00:11:05,087	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Interest
EDL	00:11:05,087	00:11:06,623	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	At first sight words
EDL	00:11:06,623	00:11:08,159	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Gulou into love very quickly
EDL	00:11:09,183	00:11:14,303	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	When he and Tasha met O'Neal have just started seriously thinking about space colonies
EDL	00:11:14,303	00:11:16,607	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	And he was eager to share his ideas
EDL	00:11:17,631	00:11:19,423	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	I thought it was really ironic
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:20,703	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	That I would
EDL	00:11:20,703	00:11:22,751	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Meet and marry a physicist
EDL	00:11:22,751	00:11:25,311	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	My physics was non-existent
EDL	00:11:25,311	00:11:26,079	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	I fight
EDL	00:11:26,079	00:11:27,103	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Flunked it
EDL	00:11:27,103	00:11:28,383	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	But he was
EDL	00:11:28,383	00:11:31,711	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	So good at explaining things to lay people
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:34,783	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	And Tasha also got good attic
EDL	00:11:34,783	00:11:35,807	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Explaining his ideas
EDL	00:11:36,319	00:11:41,439	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Explain to me for example that the wheel in which people with live with rotate
EDL	00:11:41,439	00:11:43,743	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Very slowly on an access
EDL	00:11:43,743	00:11:46,559	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	And the centrifugal force of that rotation
EDL	00:11:46,559	00:11:50,399	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Who created gravity like sensation for the people inside
EDL	00:11:50,399	00:11:51,423	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	To keep them from
EDL	00:11:51,423	00:11:52,447	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Floating around
EDL	00:11:53,215	00:11:55,775	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	The rotating would have been very slow
EDL	00:11:55,775	00:11:57,311	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	And you would not have noticed it
EDL	00:11:58,079	00:12:02,431	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	But the closer you were to the Axis or the center of the wheel
EDL	00:12:02,431	00:12:04,735	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	The less gravity you experience
EDL	00:12:05,247	00:12:07,295	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	When when you went uphill
EDL	00:12:07,807	00:12:09,087	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	You got lighter
EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:10,111	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	And lighter
EDL	00:12:10,111	00:12:12,927	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	And you started skipping like a mountain goat
EDL	00:12:12,927	00:12:13,695	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	It always say that
EDL	00:12:14,719	00:12:17,535	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Jerry O'Neil imagine the first structure can house
EDL	00:12:17,535	00:12:20,607	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	10000 people and subsequent structures could house
EDL	00:12:20,607	00:12:21,375	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	3 million
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:23,935	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	I hope that eventually these settlements
EDL	00:12:23,935	00:12:26,239	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Could unburden the Earth of a significant
EDL	00:12:26,239	00:12:26,751	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Population
EDL	00:12:27,263	00:12:29,567	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Anne O'Neill also thought his settlements
EDL	00:12:29,567	00:12:34,175	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Could provide Earth with a source of energy by collecting the sun's energy in space
EDL	00:12:34,943	00:12:40,063	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Where it's in abundance all the time and sending it back to Earth via radio waves
EDL	00:12:40,831	00:12:43,135	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	This was a technology that another scientist
EDL	00:12:43,647	00:12:44,671	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	I've been working on already
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:47,743	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	By doing this O'Neal believe
EDL	00:12:47,743	00:12:50,559	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	What has a solution to the energy problems of the world
EDL	00:12:52,351	00:12:58,751	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	At this point you may be wondering how O'Neill plan to get all of the materials needed to build these massive star
EDL	00:12:58,751	00:12:59,263	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Structures
EDL	00:12:59,775	00:13:00,287	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Into space
EDL	00:13:01,055	00:13:04,895	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Imagine the first loads would be taken by the space shuttle
EDL	00:13:04,895	00:13:07,711	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	A new tool for which NASA havoc
EDL	00:13:07,711	00:13:09,503	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Extremely optimistic plans
EDL	00:13:10,271	00:13:12,575	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Historian Patrick McRae
EDL	00:13:13,087	00:13:16,671	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	In the 1970s people were predicting shuttle flights happening every week
EDL	00:13:17,439	00:13:17,951	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	And
EDL	00:13:20,255	00:13:22,559	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Build at the time is basically a space truck
EDL	00:13:23,071	00:13:26,143	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	But even with the space shuttle taking trips once a week
EDL	00:13:26,143	00:13:28,191	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	O'Neill knew that it wouldn't be enough
EDL	00:13:28,703	00:13:30,239	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	He needs to get his building materials
EDL	00:13:31,007	00:13:31,519	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	From the Moon
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:33,567	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	The Moon is a source of
EDL	00:13:34,079	00:13:36,895	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Minerals which we know about thanks to the Apollo project
EDL	00:13:37,663	00:13:39,455	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	All of the things in fact
EDL	00:13:39,455	00:13:43,551	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	That we need for many of the products of an industrial civilization
EDL	00:13:44,319	00:13:46,879	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	So his idea was to
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:51,743	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Move that material from the lunar surface using a type of electromagnetic catapult
EDL	00:13:52,255	00:13:58,655	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	This catapult was called a mass driver and it would swing raw materials from the Moon through
EDL	00:13:58,655	00:14:00,703	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Through space to LaGrange point five
EDL	00:14:01,471	00:14:05,567	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	O'Neil and some colleagues actually designed a working model of 1
EDL	00:14:05,567	00:14:09,407	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	The PBS program Nova recorded a demonstration of it
EDL	00:14:10,431	00:14:10,943	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Free
EDL	00:14:11,455	00:14:11,967	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	2
EDL	00:14:12,479	00:14:12,991	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	1
EDL	00:14:18,367	00:14:22,719	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	All of the people who lived in the first Bay settlement would be working in space as well
EDL	00:14:23,231	00:14:25,791	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	The process the raw materials to build the next settlement
EDL	00:14:26,559	00:14:28,607	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Also be jobs in other industry
EDL	00:14:29,375	00:14:32,191	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	I decided that I was going to be
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:33,727	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Running the first
EDL	00:14:33,727	00:14:34,751	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Restaurant up there
EDL	00:14:36,287	00:14:39,871	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	I thought about you know which spices I had to take along
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:42,687	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	That we couldn't grow up there right away
EDL	00:14:43,199	00:14:45,247	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Capture the imagination
EDL	00:14:46,015	00:14:50,623	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Not everyone was as enthusiastic about Jerry O'Neill's ideas as
EDL	00:14:50,623	00:14:51,135	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Tasha
EDL	00:14:51,903	00:14:53,951	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Aa1972 O'Neill hat
EDL	00:14:53,951	00:14:58,559	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Turn his ideas into a paper and was looking to be published in a scientific journal
EDL	00:14:59,327	00:15:00,351	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	He got a lot
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:01,375	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Rejection letters
EDL	00:15:01,887	00:15:07,775	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	But then in May of 1974 the New York Times ran a front-page article about O'Neill's ideas
EDL	00:15:08,287	00:15:09,823	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Which changed our lives
EDL	00:15:09,823	00:15:10,591	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Dramatically
EDL	00:15:11,103	00:15:13,663	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	We had to delist our telephone number
EDL	00:15:14,687	00:15:19,039	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Shortly thereafter O'Neal's ideas also found Traction in the academic world
EDL	00:15:19,039	00:15:21,343	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	When his paper was published in the journal
EDL	00:15:21,343	00:15:22,367	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Physics today
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:27,487	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	And the requests for interviews and lectures
EDL	00:15:27,487	00:15:28,511	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Came rolling in
EDL	00:15:29,023	00:15:33,375	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	O'Neill was interviewed by the Smithsonian in the science-fiction magazine Omni
EDL	00:15:33,375	00:15:34,399	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Even penthouse
EDL	00:15:34,399	00:15:36,447	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	But it was a very very good article
EDL	00:15:36,959	00:15:38,239	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	I mean I only read it
EDL	00:15:38,239	00:15:38,751	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	The articles
EDL	00:15:39,775	00:15:41,823	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	In addition to Penthouse or maybe
EDL	00:15:41,823	00:15:42,847	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Because of Ben house
EDL	00:15:42,847	00:15:45,151	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	O'Neill even gained the address of NASA
EDL	00:15:45,151	00:15:47,711	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Which funded the series of studies at the Ames Research

EDL	00:15:58,207	00:16:00,255	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	The bills on his original ideas
EDL	00:16:02,303	00:16:04,351	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	In all of his interviews and lectures
EDL	00:16:04,351	00:16:05,375	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Jerry O'Neill
EDL	00:16:05,375	00:16:06,911	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	What about space in this
EDL	00:16:06,911	00:16:07,935	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Onew way
EDL	00:16:08,959	00:16:11,519	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Space wasn't just a government program
EDL	00:16:11,519	00:16:13,311	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	For elite astronauts to take

EDL	00:16:20,223	00:16:25,599	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	When we open up the High Frontier by building colonies in space there is going to be
EDL	00:16:25,599	00:16:28,415	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Room for people who want to leave
EDL	00:16:28,415	00:16:31,743	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	We are to go out and to develop their own colonies
EDL	00:16:31,743	00:16:33,279	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	And to do their own thing
EDL	00:16:36,095	00:16:40,447	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Did the play
EDL	00:16:46,335	00:16:47,615	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	This idea of
EDL	00:16:47,615	00:16:48,639	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Space as a place
EDL	00:16:49,407	00:16:51,199	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Appeal to a lot of different kinds of people
EDL	00:16:51,711	00:16:55,551	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	And soon enough a social movement started coalescing around O'Neal's ideas
EDL	00:16:56,063	00:16:59,647	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	By 1975 a group called the L5 Society

EDL	00:17:03,999	00:17:04,767	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	They were
EDL	00:17:04,767	00:17:07,583	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Very vocal they were politically active so they would
EDL	00:17:08,095	00:17:11,167	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Oftentimes be lobbying Congress or NASA for

EDL	00:17:19,871	00:17:24,223	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	But it was the seventies and there was a strange convergence happening

EDL	00:21:15,391	00:21:19,232	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	And in fact in the 1970s we had just put astronaut

EDL	00:21:32,800	00:21:34,848	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Which is the more likely scenario

EDL	00:21:43,296	00:21:44,320	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Or scenario B

EDL	00:21:49,184	00:21:52,000	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	No I'd argue that in 1975
EDL	00:21:52,512	00:21:54,816	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Most people would have felt that scenario a
EDL	00:21:54,816	00:21:55,584	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Was the much more likely
EDL	00:21:59,168	00:22:03,520	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	In 1977 all of O'Neill's research was published in a very readable book

EDL	00:22:14,272	00:22:17,344	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	I sure hope so Dan or I wouldn't be working on it that's your hoe
EDL	00:22:18,112	00:22:20,416	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	But the question is what is your expectation
EDL	00:22:20,416	00:22:23,232	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Putting my own professional time and end my effort
EDL	00:22:23,744	00:22:28,864	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Into the scenario that says that these things will be realized within my working lifetime
EDL	00:22:30,656	00:22:32,960	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	But despite O'Neal's optimism
EDL	00:22:32,960	00:22:35,520	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	The 60 Minutes segment marked the peak

EDL	00:22:59,584	00:23:05,216	| 99pi-0217-homeonlagrange-1 |	Which is why in 1977 O'Neill founded the nonprofit space Studies Institute
