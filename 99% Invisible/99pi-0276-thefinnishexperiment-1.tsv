EDL	00:01:56,480	00:01:59,808	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Very very roughly defined Universal basic income
EDL	00:01:59,808	00:02:01,088	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Is this idea

EDL	00:02:04,928	00:02:08,512	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	And everyone will get a flat sum of money every month to cover their basic needs

EDL	00:02:42,048	00:02:46,144	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	For example you could take away food stamps Medicare and housing subsidies in

EDL	00:03:02,272	00:03:04,064	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	What is increasingly obsolete
EDL	00:03:04,064	00:03:05,856	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Our generation is going to have to deal with

EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:23,520	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	And then by his logic
EDL	00:03:23,520	00:03:25,568	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	If people don't have to worry about food and shelter

EDL	00:03:51,936	00:03:56,032	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	It's actually an idea that's been around for a long time and there are many

EDL	00:05:38,943	00:05:39,967	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Well actually help them
EDL	00:05:40,479	00:05:40,991	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Start work
EDL	00:05:41,759	00:05:45,599	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	In this whole experiment is especially interesting to us here at 99 pi
EDL	00:05:45,599	00:05:47,647	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Not just for what Finland is test
EDL	00:05:48,159	00:05:49,439	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	But how they are testing it
EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:54,559	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Finland is trying out a unique design-oriented way of thinking about government
EDL	00:05:55,071	00:05:57,119	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Rather than just rolling Outlaws on a massive scale
EDL	00:05:57,631	00:06:00,447	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	They're trying to craft legislation in stages
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:01,215	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	With user feedback
EDL	00:06:01,727	00:06:03,263	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Like a piece of design
EDL	00:06:03,263	00:06:08,127	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Because every good design is made to fill a need or solve a problem
EDL	00:06:08,127	00:06:08,639	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	This
EDL	00:06:09,151	00:06:10,175	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Is the problem
EDL	00:06:10,175	00:06:11,199	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	I hate it
EDL	00:06:12,223	00:06:13,503	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Unemployed
EDL	00:06:14,015	00:06:15,551	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Right now in 2017
EDL	00:06:15,551	00:06:17,599	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	The unemployment rate in Finland
EDL	00:06:17,599	00:06:18,879	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	8.8 /
EDL	00:06:18,879	00:06:19,903	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Percent and that's about
EDL	00:06:19,903	00:06:21,695	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Double the US unemployment rate
EDL	00:06:21,695	00:06:27,839	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	And that rate is worse than smaller finished cities like your insu
EDL	00:06:27,839	00:06:29,887	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Is ephelides always being there
EDL	00:06:29,887	00:06:31,679	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Poorest parts of the country

EDL	00:06:41,663	00:06:42,431	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Unemployment
EDL	00:06:42,943	00:06:44,223	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Has been here
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:47,551	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	That's a in southern or Western Finland
EDL	00:06:48,575	00:06:49,855	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Because we are far
EDL	00:06:50,367	00:06:54,975	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	From a bigger cities where are more much much much more
EDL	00:06:54,975	00:06:55,999	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Job opportunity
EDL	00:06:56,511	00:06:59,327	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Santa has a master's in history and she worked as a researcher
EDL	00:06:59,327	00:07:01,119	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Docker project ran out of funding
EDL	00:07:01,119	00:07:04,191	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	And all over Finland has been a massive decline in manufacturing
EDL	00:07:04,959	00:07:06,495	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Ever since Nokia was
EDL	00:07:06,495	00:07:08,799	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Crushed by Apple and Android phones
EDL	00:07:09,311	00:07:14,431	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Nokia's phone parts used to be made by contractors and companies all around the country
EDL	00:07:14,431	00:07:17,247	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	My mom actually work in that factory.
EDL	00:07:17,247	00:07:19,551	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Kenny went down when Nokia started go down
EDL	00:07:20,575	00:07:21,599	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	I kind of know
EDL	00:07:21,599	00:07:23,647	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Bottom part of a story
EDL	00:07:23,647	00:07:25,183	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Pretty well in the US
EDL	00:07:25,183	00:07:26,207	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Depending on the state
EDL	00:07:26,207	00:07:30,559	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	You can generally collect unemployment for about half a year after losing a job
EDL	00:07:31,071	00:07:33,887	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	In Finland you can collect unemployment for about
EDL	00:07:33,887	00:07:34,655	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	2 years
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:38,495	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	And then there different kinds of social assistance is an allowances
EDL	00:07:38,495	00:07:39,263	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Apply for
EDL	00:07:39,263	00:07:40,287	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	If you still
EDL	00:07:40,287	00:07:41,567	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Don't have a job
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:42,591	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	But here's the catch
EDL	00:07:42,591	00:07:45,151	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	If you're collecting unemployment assistant in Finland
EDL	00:07:45,151	00:07:47,711	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	You definitely cannot earn additional income
EDL	00:07:47,711	00:07:49,247	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Or you risk losing those benefit
EDL	00:07:49,759	00:07:51,807	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	And then you have to reapply
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:53,343	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Which is a massive drag
EDL	00:07:53,343	00:07:54,111	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	You cannot
EDL	00:07:54,623	00:07:55,391	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Take
EDL	00:07:55,391	00:07:56,159	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Like
EDL	00:07:56,159	00:07:57,439	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Part time job
EDL	00:07:57,951	00:07:58,719	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Because
EDL	00:07:58,719	00:08:01,279	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Then you are gaining money even though
EDL	00:08:01,279	00:08:02,559	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Very very little
EDL	00:08:03,071	00:08:05,631	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Then is counted against you
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:09,215	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	As so you lose that little bit of support money you were already gaining
EDL	00:08:09,727	00:08:12,799	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	So unemployed Finn's don't want to risk that loss
EDL	00:08:13,311	00:08:16,639	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	They don't want to pick up temporary gig work or part-time jobs
EDL	00:08:16,639	00:08:17,151	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Freelance work
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:20,479	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	So it's really really difficult situation
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:24,575	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	This actually happened with the person we hired to record sauna
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:26,623	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	We asked what is rate was
EDL	00:08:26,623	00:08:28,415	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	And he said he couldn't charge us
EDL	00:08:28,415	00:08:33,023	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Because he's also unemployed and would lose part of his allowance if you took on money from freelance work
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:35,071	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	So he did it for free
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:36,095	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Thanks
EDL	00:08:36,863	00:08:40,447	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Basically the government of Finland realize that something had to be done about this cyst
EDL	00:08:40,959	00:08:45,311	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	That they were accidentally disincentivizing citizens from getting small jobs
EDL	00:08:45,311	00:08:47,615	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Or maybe even starting businesses of Their Own
EDL	00:08:47,615	00:08:49,919	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	And these are citizens who want to work
EDL	00:08:49,919	00:08:50,943	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Like Santa
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:51,967	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Being unemployed
EDL	00:08:52,735	00:08:54,783	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Makes me feel anyway so whatever
EDL	00:08:56,063	00:08:56,831	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	I don't know
EDL	00:08:57,599	00:08:58,623	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Unimportant
EDL	00:08:59,135	00:09:00,671	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Doing a job
EDL	00:09:00,671	00:09:03,487	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Would make you feel like you're doing something for dinner
EDL	00:09:03,487	00:09:04,511	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	A purpose
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:06,815	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Is something bad being unemployed
EDL	00:09:08,095	00:09:09,631	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Hanging around and Chestnut
EDL	00:09:10,399	00:09:12,447	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Being very important to anything anybody
EDL	00:09:13,471	00:09:16,031	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	So this welfare system clearly needs to be changed
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:18,591	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	This could be done in a few different ways
EDL	00:09:18,591	00:09:20,383	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Like with an Earned Income Tax Credit
EDL	00:09:21,151	00:09:23,711	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	But first they wanted to try out something simpler
EDL	00:09:24,223	00:09:24,991	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	And go from there
EDL	00:09:25,503	00:09:26,783	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	And this is where we get
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:27,295	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Tattoo design
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:34,207	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	They wanted to design and test policy in a process very similar to the way designers come up with new products
EDL	00:09:34,207	00:09:35,487	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	You would design policy
EDL	00:09:35,999	00:09:38,047	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	That you would think about policies ass
EDL	00:09:38,047	00:09:39,839	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Kind of design objects
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:41,375	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Our Design Services
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:44,447	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	And that means that you could do alteration
EDL	00:09:44,447	00:09:45,215	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	And tests
EDL	00:09:45,215	00:09:48,031	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	That's roping mocha again founder of the think-tank

EDL	00:09:58,015	00:09:59,039	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	On
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:10:00,063	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	A national level
EDL	00:10:00,063	00:10:02,623	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Now can we do like governments level design thinking
EDL	00:10:03,391	00:10:04,159	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Design thinking
EDL	00:10:04,927	00:10:05,439	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	It goes like this
EDL	00:10:05,951	00:10:08,511	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	First there is a challenge or problem that must be song

EDL	00:10:13,119	00:10:13,631	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Express
EDL	00:10:14,143	00:10:17,215	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	That means designers come up with a few ideas and prototypes
EDL	00:10:17,215	00:10:17,983	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Test
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:19,007	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	The try those ideas
EDL	00:10:19,519	00:10:21,055	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Maybe with a model or sample
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:24,639	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Get feedback to Understand what actually happens what are the outcomes
EDL	00:10:24,639	00:10:25,407	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	And
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:29,503	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Cycle incorporate that feedback to make changes and revise the design
EDL	00:10:29,503	00:10:31,295	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Then the process begins again
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:33,855	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	And again and again in different iterations
EDL	00:10:34,367	00:10:35,391	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Couple years ago
EDL	00:10:35,391	00:10:39,487	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	This is how the Finnish prime minister decided he wanted to design legislation

EDL	00:10:56,127	00:10:56,895	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Will actually
EDL	00:10:56,895	00:10:57,407	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Work
EDL	00:10:57,919	00:11:02,527	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	So demos helped establish and experimentation unit which is an actual office
EDL	00:11:02,527	00:11:03,551	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Of the Finnish prime minister
EDL	00:11:04,063	00:11:06,879	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	At the prime minister's office is experimentation used
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:07,391	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	The first unit
EDL	00:11:07,903	00:11:08,415	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Bus like

EDL	00:11:09,695	00:11:10,975	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Policies in the kind of design
EDL	00:11:11,999	00:11:12,767	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Meaning of the word
EDL	00:11:13,279	00:11:16,351	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	There are other governments that are interested in experimentation
EDL	00:11:16,351	00:11:18,655	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	But here's what makes Finland different
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:20,191	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	They want
EDL	00:11:20,191	00:11:20,703	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	To create prototype
EDL	00:11:21,727	00:11:24,543	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	And then change and scale and update them dynamically
EDL	00:11:25,055	00:11:27,871	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	As a result of their experiments show what's effective
EDL	00:11:27,871	00:11:28,383	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	And what's not
EDL	00:11:28,895	00:11:30,943	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	And in order to run these experiments
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:36,063	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Finland actually had to pass a law to ensure that they were not in violation of their constitution
EDL	00:11:36,063	00:11:36,575	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Course
EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:38,879	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	All the Constitutions of
EDL	00:11:39,391	00:11:41,951	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	The Democratic countries in the world they say that you have to
EDL	00:11:41,951	00:11:43,487	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	To treat people equally
EDL	00:11:43,487	00:11:45,791	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	And by definition if you're running experiments
EDL	00:11:45,791	00:11:47,327	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	You're not treating people equally
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:48,607	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Cathay
EDL	00:11:48,607	00:11:49,887	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	People who are part of the experiment
EDL	00:11:50,399	00:11:51,167	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	I'm not
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:52,447	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Treated equally
EDL	00:11:52,447	00:11:54,495	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	So they needed to be a special law
EDL	00:11:54,495	00:11:56,799	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	That's all fine. Okay how do
EDL	00:11:56,799	00:11:57,823	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	The experiment
EDL	00:11:57,823	00:11:59,871	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Fit in the Constitution
EDL	00:11:59,871	00:12:00,383	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	That says
EDL	00:12:00,895	00:12:02,175	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	That people need
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:02,687	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Will be treated equally
EDL	00:12:03,199	00:12:06,015	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	And one of the first experiments The Finnish government decided
EDL	00:12:06,015	00:12:08,063	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Do was with basic income
EDL	00:12:08,575	00:12:10,111	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Because the welfare office
EDL	00:12:10,111	00:12:12,671	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Is extensive and complicated and rather than
EDL	00:12:12,671	00:12:16,767	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Rejigger in one part of it and changing a bunch of stuff around and reworking their normal operation
EDL	00:12:17,279	00:12:19,327	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	The basic income experiment just kind of
EDL	00:12:19,327	00:12:20,095	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Chugs Along on
EDL	00:12:20,607	00:12:27,007	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	We have automated and partly automated are processes so everything is run by computers
EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:32,383	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	The money the basic income just gets deposited in participants bank account every month automatically
EDL	00:12:33,407	00:12:35,967	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	The program is currently overseen by Mario keturunan
EDL	00:12:35,967	00:12:40,575	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Who works for government institution called Kellogg
EDL	00:12:40,575	00:12:42,879	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Social insurance institution here in Finland
EDL	00:12:43,647	00:12:47,487	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	So I was in charge of implementing this basic income
EDL	00:12:47,487	00:12:48,511	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Experiment
EDL	00:12:49,279	00:12:50,047	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Project leader
EDL	00:12:51,327	00:12:52,607	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Stigma about welfare in Finland
EDL	00:12:53,119	00:12:55,935	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Everyone goes through this office every now and then in life
EDL	00:12:55,935	00:12:59,007	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Because there are 40 different kinds of benefits that students can receive
EDL	00:12:59,519	00:13:03,615	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Including student support maternal care maternal care pension subsidies
EDL	00:13:04,127	00:13:04,639	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	And of course
EDL	00:13:05,151	00:13:05,663	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Unemployment
EDL	00:13:06,175	00:13:08,223	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	So in January of 2017
EDL	00:13:08,223	00:13:12,063	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Kellogg 2000 unemployed fins at random from all over the country
EDL	00:13:12,575	00:13:17,439	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	In this experiment we have 2,000 people who are getting this a basic income $500
EDL	00:13:17,439	00:13:18,719	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	60 Euros per month
EDL	00:13:19,231	00:13:21,535	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	And so they have to be at between 25.
EDL	00:13:22,047	00:13:23,327	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	The eighth so they are not
EDL	00:13:23,327	00:13:25,119	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Students or young people
EDL	00:13:25,119	00:13:29,727	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	And they are not those kind of people who will fill out their pension age during the sixth
EDL	00:13:29,727	00:13:31,775	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Experiment so this is kind of like the profile
EDL	00:13:32,799	00:13:35,359	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Participants didn't volunteer for the experiment
EDL	00:13:35,359	00:13:39,199	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Kelly just told them that they would now be receiving 560 Euros a month
EDL	00:13:39,711	00:13:41,247	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	The news came in a letter
EDL	00:13:41,247	00:13:42,015	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	I got an
EDL	00:13:42,783	00:13:43,807	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Fat fat
EDL	00:13:44,575	00:13:45,343	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Mail
EDL	00:13:45,343	00:13:45,855	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Andis
EDL	00:13:46,367	00:13:49,695	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Says that's okay you are chosen to be one
EDL	00:13:50,207	00:13:53,535	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	It is basic income experiment and I was like out
EDL	00:13:54,047	00:13:54,815	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	What's that
EDL	00:13:55,327	00:13:58,399	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Sauna the unemployed researcher and Yuan SU
EDL	00:13:58,399	00:14:04,799	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	I'm really thought about basic income until she read that big fat packet that came in the mail which outlines the experiment for her
EDL	00:14:04,799	00:14:07,871	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	And I was going to have the certain amount of money
EDL	00:14:07,871	00:14:09,407	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Did my bank account every month
EDL	00:14:10,175	00:14:12,479	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	It's not big but it's stable money
EDL	00:14:12,479	00:14:16,575	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	560 Euros a month would be a little less than sauna would get on unemployment
EDL	00:14:17,087	00:14:19,647	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	But you'd also be able to work and not worry about losing
EDL	00:14:19,647	00:14:21,183	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	So I was happy about it because
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:23,743	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Two years that experiments last
EDL	00:14:24,255	00:14:26,303	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	It's got to be that money every month
EDL	00:14:26,815	00:14:30,399	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	And I don't have to stress that much because I am a big
EDL	00:14:30,399	00:14:31,679	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Dresser person
EDL	00:14:31,679	00:14:33,215	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	I stress a lot
EDL	00:14:33,215	00:14:34,239	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Finding a job
EDL	00:14:34,239	00:14:35,007	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Is very important
EDL	00:14:35,007	00:14:36,287	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	So now
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:38,591	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Unable
EDL	00:14:38,591	00:14:41,151	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	If I find a job and work a part-time job
EDL	00:14:41,151	00:14:42,175	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	I could take it
EDL	00:14:42,687	00:14:46,783	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	And not lose the support of many that usually would if I wasn't part of this
EDL	00:14:47,295	00:14:48,319	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Basic income
EDL	00:14:48,319	00:14:48,831	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Experiment
EDL	00:14:49,343	00:14:52,927	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Some of the participants have been talking about their basic income with a press
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:54,207	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	But China has kept it a sin
EDL	00:14:54,719	00:14:56,511	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	I feel embarrassed about it
EDL	00:14:56,511	00:14:58,559	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Biggest it feels like I have this
EDL	00:14:59,071	00:15:02,143	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Advantaged so I haven't been fairy
EDL	00:15:02,143	00:15:03,679	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	I'm excited about
EDL	00:15:03,679	00:15:06,239	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Spreading that information and now us
EDL	00:15:06,239	00:15:07,007	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Participating this
EDL	00:15:07,519	00:15:09,311	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Your post this is like okay
EDL	00:15:09,823	00:15:13,919	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	I'm not very many people in Finland are probably here in your office.
EDL	00:15:13,919	00:15:15,711	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	I can see elephant devoted
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:17,759	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Sorry to put it this way
EDL	00:15:17,759	00:15:19,039	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	I'll have you know we are
EDL	00:15:19,551	00:15:21,087	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Huge in Finland sauna
EDL	00:15:22,111	00:15:26,975	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Santa doesn't know anyone else involved in the study and most people in Finland don't
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:30,047	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Her friends get kind of StarStruck when she tells them her Secret
EDL	00:15:30,047	00:15:33,375	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	I I get people out of court with that so
EDL	00:15:33,375	00:15:34,143	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Oh
EDL	00:15:34,143	00:15:37,215	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	First one I've ever met
EDL	00:15:37,727	00:15:39,007	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	It's kind of funny really
EDL	00:15:39,775	00:15:44,639	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	When you collect unemployment in Finland have to go to these job training meetings and check-ins every couple of months
EDL	00:15:45,151	00:15:48,223	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	But these two thousand participants scattered around the country
EDL	00:15:48,223	00:15:51,807	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Don't have to do anything at all to get this 502
EDL	00:15:51,807	00:15:52,831	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	60 Euros every month
EDL	00:15:53,343	00:15:56,159	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Even though they're part of this experiment they also don't have
EDL	00:15:56,159	00:15:57,439	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	How to report how they spent it
EDL	00:15:57,951	00:15:59,743	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	And at the end of the experiment
EDL	00:15:59,743	00:16:01,023	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Tell her we'll look and see if
EDL	00:16:01,023	00:16:04,351	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	This group of unemployed people who got basic income took on work
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:06,655	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	And compare it with their control group
EDL	00:16:07,167	00:16:09,727	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Which is the rest of the unemployed people in Finland
EDL	00:16:09,727	00:16:15,359	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	175000 people who are in the same profile than these two thousand people
EDL	00:16:16,383	00:16:17,919	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	But they are not getting this basic
EDL	00:16:18,431	00:16:20,991	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	I'm so we are comparing these two groups of people
EDL	00:16:21,503	00:16:23,295	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	In this two years.
EDL	00:16:23,295	00:16:28,415	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	I see what is happening to these how are these people behaving when they get this basic income
EDL	00:16:28,415	00:16:29,951	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	And that how are these people
EDL	00:16:29,951	00:16:30,463	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Behaving
EDL	00:16:31,999	00:16:34,047	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	And then when they compare the results
EDL	00:16:34,559	00:16:35,839	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Basic income my
EDL	00:16:35,839	00:16:39,679	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Just might get one step closer to becoming a reality
EDL	00:16:39,679	00:16:44,799	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Play with the idea that these basic income would actually come a universal
EDL	00:16:45,311	00:16:46,591	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	I can compare in Finland
EDL	00:16:46,591	00:16:47,871	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Which is kind of like the
EDL	00:16:47,871	00:16:50,687	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	The idea that I don't actually believe
EDL	00:16:50,687	00:16:52,479	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Is going to happen
EDL	00:16:54,527	00:16:55,551	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	The people who
EDL	00:16:55,551	00:16:56,575	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	I'm not thinking this
EDL	00:16:57,087	00:16:57,855	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	A good idea
EDL	00:16:57,855	00:17:01,183	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Guess the person currently overseeing the experiment for basic income
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:03,231	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Believe that won't work
EDL	00:17:03,231	00:17:06,047	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	I think that it would be too dramatic
EDL	00:17:06,047	00:17:09,119	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	So we would wipe out the whole of this
EDL	00:17:09,119	00:17:12,959	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Social security system that he would have been building up for decades
EDL	00:17:13,471	00:17:15,519	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	And then just replace it with one
EDL	00:17:16,543	00:17:18,847	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Turn in imagines but not everyone would
EDL	00:17:18,847	00:17:19,871	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Prefer a flat income
EDL	00:17:20,639	00:17:23,455	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Some people do need more than one base some
EDL	00:17:23,967	00:17:25,759	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Like what if you have children or parents
EDL	00:17:25,759	00:17:27,551	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Special needs you have to take care of old
EDL	00:17:28,575	00:17:29,343	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	In that case
EDL	00:17:29,343	00:17:31,903	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	You don't have the capacity to start picking up gig work
EDL	00:17:32,671	00:17:34,463	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	The basic income wouldn't be enough for you
EDL	00:17:34,975	00:17:35,999	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	And of course
EDL	00:17:35,999	00:17:37,279	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Forward pay for it
EDL	00:17:37,279	00:17:38,559	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	So who would Finance it
EDL	00:17:39,071	00:17:43,167	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	It's really hard to say how much basic income would actually cost
EDL	00:17:43,167	00:17:43,679	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	The average tax
EDL	00:17:44,191	00:17:45,215	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Where it to be Institute
EDL	00:17:45,983	00:17:49,567	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	And we don't quite know how it would affect the economy or inflation rate
EDL	00:17:50,335	00:17:52,639	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	It's all dependent on a number of factors
EDL	00:17:52,639	00:17:54,431	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	And there's no exact math on this
EDL	00:17:55,199	00:17:56,223	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	If someone truly
EDL	00:17:56,223	00:17:57,759	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Planes that they know how much

EDL	00:17:59,295	00:17:59,807	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Basically
EDL	00:18:01,087	00:18:01,855	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	I think they're lying
EDL	00:18:02,623	00:18:03,391	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Sasha

EDL	00:18:10,815	00:18:12,095	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	It's like once again something
EDL	00:18:12,607	00:18:13,375	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Experiment
EDL	00:18:13,375	00:18:17,471	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Ropa says yes basic income would save money by cutting back on bureaucracy
EDL	00:18:17,983	00:18:20,799	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Blue probably still be expensive to fund
EDL	00:18:20,799	00:18:21,567	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	But that's almost
EDL	00:18:21,567	00:18:22,335	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Technical
EDL	00:18:22,335	00:18:24,383	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	You know you know if you need money right money
EDL	00:18:24,895	00:18:27,455	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	It's like what politicians do they changed
EDL	00:18:27,455	00:18:28,479	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	By the way
EDL	00:18:28,479	00:18:30,271	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Budgets are arranged
EDL	00:18:30,271	00:18:33,855	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	If basic income make citizens become more active and engaged
EDL	00:18:33,855	00:18:36,159	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Girl that has faith that governments will
EDL	00:18:36,159	00:18:37,183	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Find a way to pay for it
EDL	00:18:37,695	00:18:41,279	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Because I'm excited and activated population is generally good for the economy
EDL	00:18:41,791	00:18:44,863	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	He says that's why they have to test before anything else
EDL	00:18:44,863	00:18:47,167	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Basic income would really increase productivity and
EDL	00:18:47,167	00:18:48,447	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Improve General well-being
EDL	00:18:48,959	00:18:51,007	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	At this point they're testing to see
EDL	00:18:51,007	00:18:52,543	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	If it be worth more in there
EDL	00:18:53,567	00:18:54,847	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	I really really
EDL	00:18:54,847	00:19:00,479	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Really hope that this will continue. Just spread out that more people are involved
EDL	00:19:02,271	00:19:03,807	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	This experiment has

EDL	00:19:05,343	00:19:08,671	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Even though she gets slightly less money than she would on unemployment
EDL	00:19:09,183	00:19:11,231	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	She's free to do whatever she wants
EDL	00:19:11,231	00:19:13,023	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	I am trying to find a job
EDL	00:19:13,535	00:19:17,119	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	I meant sending applications and take off
EDL	00:19:17,119	00:19:18,399	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Play a part time job
EDL	00:19:18,399	00:19:20,447	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	She feels like she's about to start a new chapter
EDL	00:19:21,215	00:19:21,983	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Ready for what snack

EDL	00:19:24,799	00:19:25,823	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	It brought that to me

EDL	00:19:30,687	00:19:31,455	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	But
EDL	00:19:31,455	00:19:32,735	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	To give people hope
EDL	00:19:32,735	00:19:34,783	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Give people a chance to

EDL	00:19:36,063	00:19:37,855	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Away from the stress

EDL	00:19:39,647	00:19:40,927	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Do we survive
EDL	00:19:40,927	00:19:43,487	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	It's really important to keep in mind that son is just
EDL	00:19:43,487	00:19:46,047	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	One participant in a very small study
EDL	00:19:46,559	00:19:49,631	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	And basic income may have helped her search for part time work
EDL	00:19:49,631	00:19:52,959	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	But when I spoke with her she had yet to actually find employment
EDL	00:19:52,959	00:19:58,079	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	And also you probably noted that this form of basic income is not Universal basic income
EDL	00:19:58,591	00:19:59,359	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Who are Universal
EDL	00:19:59,871	00:20:02,943	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	It would be money for every citizen employed or not
EDL	00:20:02,943	00:20:03,967	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	In this particular
EDL	00:20:03,967	00:20:04,735	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Experiment
EDL	00:20:04,735	00:20:07,039	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	The basic income is only for unemployed people
EDL	00:20:07,551	00:20:12,415	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Yeah I think what we're experimenting that would be cold partial basic income is 8
EDL	00:20:12,415	00:20:15,999	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	This is a limited experiment I don't know how relevant it is because
EDL	00:20:16,511	00:20:17,791	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	A lot of groups are missing
EDL	00:20:19,583	00:20:22,911	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	If we want to see what people do when they don't have to work anymore
EDL	00:20:23,423	00:20:29,055	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Roper says they should next see what happens if basic income is given to people who are already employed
EDL	00:20:29,055	00:20:31,359	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	To see if they then quit their jobs
EDL	00:20:31,871	00:20:36,735	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Critics of the experiment also argue that 2000 people is too small a sample size
EDL	00:20:36,735	00:20:41,087	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	To finish Economist published an op-ed in the New York Times called

EDL	00:20:44,159	00:20:46,975	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	And said it had the potential to incentivize people to
EDL	00:20:46,975	00:20:49,791	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Accept low paying and low productivity jobs
EDL	00:20:50,303	00:20:51,583	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	It's an experiment that
EDL	00:20:51,583	00:20:52,351	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Far from perfect
EDL	00:20:53,119	00:20:55,935	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	But it's not supposed to be a be-all end-all
EDL	00:20:56,447	00:20:57,471	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Ideally
EDL	00:20:57,471	00:20:58,495	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	What's a first draft

EDL	00:21:05,663	00:21:06,687	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	It's going to be

EDL	00:24:28,928	00:24:29,952	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Idea
EDL	00:24:29,952	00:24:30,720	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	It was
EDL	00:24:30,720	00:24:32,000	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	First proposed right
EDL	00:24:32,000	00:24:35,584	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	He's kind of first mentioned by American Founding Father Thomas Paine

EDL	00:24:38,656	00:24:39,936	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	And in terms of
EDL	00:24:40,448	00:24:42,496	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Basic income experiment
EDL	00:24:43,264	00:24:45,312	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	We've actually been down this road before
EDL	00:24:45,312	00:24:47,616	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	For as a nation here in the United States
EDL	00:24:47,616	00:24:49,664	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	We did some studies
EDL	00:24:49,664	00:24:50,944	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	With basic income
EDL	00:24:50,944	00:24:51,968	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Back in the seventies
EDL	00:24:52,480	00:24:55,296	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	I shall ask to change the framework of government itself
EDL	00:24:56,320	00:24:59,392	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	So we can make it again fully responsible for the needs and the wish
EDL	00:24:59,904	00:25:05,280	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	The American people wanted to see if you could guarantee a family of four
EDL	00:25:05,280	00:25:06,816	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	$1,600 a year
EDL	00:25:07,840	00:25:08,864	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Like $10,000
EDL	00:25:08,864	00:25:09,632	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Is today
EDL	00:25:09,632	00:25:11,680	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Any hints at it in this State of the Union Address
EDL	00:25:12,192	00:25:15,264	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Let us place the floor under the income of every family with
EDL	00:25:15,264	00:25:16,288	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Children in America
EDL	00:25:17,568	00:25:19,616	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Let us provide the means by which
EDL	00:25:20,128	00:25:20,896	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	More
EDL	00:25:20,896	00:25:21,664	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Can't help himself
EDL	00:25:22,688	00:25:28,064	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	And so yeah and then he decided to really try and do it tens of millions of dollars
EDL	00:25:28,064	00:25:29,088	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	We're budgeted
EDL	00:25:29,088	00:25:32,160	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	So that more than 8500 American
EDL	00:25:32,672	00:25:34,720	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Could be involved in experiments all around the country
EDL	00:25:35,488	00:25:36,512	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	And their bunch of different one
EDL	00:25:36,512	00:25:39,584	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Different people running them and they tested like
EDL	00:25:39,584	00:25:40,864	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Different variations of basic
EDL	00:25:40,864	00:25:41,888	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Can come in different ideas around
EDL	00:25:42,656	00:25:44,448	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	When in Seattle in one in Denver
EDL	00:25:44,448	00:25:46,496	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	And one in Gary Indiana and one in North
EDL	00:25:46,496	00:25:47,264	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Carolina just like
EDL	00:25:47,264	00:25:49,056	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	All kinds of places all over the country
EDL	00:25:49,056	00:25:50,336	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	And so why haven't
EDL	00:25:50,848	00:25:52,384	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	I heard of these at all
EDL	00:25:52,384	00:25:55,200	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	I have no I've known Elizabeth and what do they find out
EDL	00:25:55,200	00:25:58,784	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Well the results were kindness
EDL	00:25:58,784	00:25:59,808	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Screwy because
EDL	00:26:00,320	00:26:01,600	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	It wasn't like
EDL	00:26:01,600	00:26:02,624	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	In a perfect
EDL	00:26:02,624	00:26:03,392	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Scientific
EDL	00:26:03,392	00:26:04,928	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Bubble there all these variations
EDL	00:26:05,440	00:26:06,464	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	All at the same time
EDL	00:26:06,976	00:26:08,256	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	And some of them were like
EDL	00:26:08,256	00:26:14,144	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Different marginal tax rates in like different benefit levels and all the different kinds of stuff which makes it really difficult
EDL	00:26:15,168	00:26:16,704	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Identify the effects
EDL	00:26:16,704	00:26:18,496	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Because you were texting so many different versions of it
EDL	00:26:19,520	00:26:20,032	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	And then
EDL	00:26:20,544	00:26:21,312	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Actually
EDL	00:26:21,312	00:26:24,896	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	The really big pitbull like they did find some stuff for the reason
EDL	00:26:24,896	00:26:25,664	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	That
EDL	00:26:25,664	00:26:28,736	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Has been pretty much discarded to the sands of time was because
EDL	00:26:28,736	00:26:30,528	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	People started analyzing the results
EDL	00:26:31,040	00:26:32,320	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Or did it was a
EDL	00:26:33,344	00:26:34,624	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	And so they're like
EDL	00:26:34,624	00:26:35,392	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	These rumors
EDL	00:26:35,392	00:26:36,160	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Swirling around
EDL	00:26:36,160	00:26:41,024	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	But people were dropping out of the workforce and just like enjoying this basic income
EDL	00:26:41,024	00:26:43,840	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	And it wasn't actually a statistically significant Trend it was
EDL	00:26:44,352	00:26:46,144	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Kind of a Rumour which can sometimes
EDL	00:26:46,144	00:26:47,168	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Be more powerful than a fact
EDL	00:26:47,680	00:26:49,472	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	And they're also all these reports
EDL	00:26:49,472	00:26:52,288	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Increase separation and divorce rates
EDL	00:26:52,288	00:26:58,688	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	And that was considered really scandalous and set off a lot of opposition but then when the data was actually a
EDL	00:26:58,688	00:26:59,200	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Analyzed
EDL	00:26:59,968	00:27:01,248	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	It wasn't as
EDL	00:27:01,248	00:27:02,016	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Seems that many more
EDL	00:27:02,784	00:27:05,856	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Is there a few but this wasn't necessarily A Bad Thing
EDL	00:27:05,856	00:27:12,256	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Totally. The economic slavery

EDL	00:27:15,840	00:27:16,352	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Cancel
EDL	00:27:17,632	00:27:19,936	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Tolerate it and it's all just because like
EDL	00:27:20,448	00:27:24,800	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	They started chatting about it before they had before they had the numbers
EDL	00:27:25,312	00:27:27,872	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	It was kind disregarded before we really had a chance to
EDL	00:27:29,408	00:27:31,200	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	I think that's certainly a challenge
EDL	00:27:32,224	00:27:32,992	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Keeping in mind

EDL	00:27:34,272	00:27:40,160	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	And she is a research director of a basic income study that is happening at y combinator research
EDL	00:27:40,160	00:27:42,208	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Which of the nonprofit research lab
EDL	00:27:42,208	00:27:44,768	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Can you buy a startup accelerator called y combinator
EDL	00:27:44,768	00:27:47,584	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	It works like right down the street from our office
EDL	00:27:47,584	00:27:50,912	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	And she's helping to launch a basic income experiment nearby

EDL	00:27:51,680	00:27:52,960	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	We are
EDL	00:27:52,960	00:27:53,728	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	In the process of

EDL	00:27:58,336	00:28:00,640	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Protest sticks and work through
EDL	00:28:00,640	00:28:06,016	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Questions around that and preparing for a larger randomized control trial that we hope to Launch
EDL	00:28:06,784	00:28:08,064	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	After that local time
EDL	00:28:08,576	00:28:09,600	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	They want to react
EDL	00:28:09,600	00:28:10,880	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Expended actually looking
EDL	00:28:10,880	00:28:11,904	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Do two US states
EDL	00:28:12,416	00:28:12,928	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Embroidery
EDL	00:28:14,208	00:28:17,536	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	They have definitely learned from these early experiments
EDL	00:28:18,304	00:28:19,072	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	2
EDL	00:28:19,072	00:28:20,608	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Start small
EDL	00:28:20,608	00:28:22,656	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Expand slowly and to not
EDL	00:28:23,168	00:28:23,680	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Promise to me
EDL	00:28:24,192	00:28:26,240	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Because
EDL	00:28:26,240	00:28:29,056	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	You know they want to wait for this experiment to fully play out
EDL	00:28:29,056	00:28:32,384	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	I'm like Finland they're definitely doing this because of the robots
EDL	00:28:32,384	00:28:35,456	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	And because they're based here in the Bay Area which is
EDL	00:28:35,456	00:28:36,736	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Home of the gig economy
EDL	00:28:37,248	00:28:40,064	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Then just want to see if this will make people happy
EDL	00:28:40,064	00:28:42,880	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	In an era where robots take over all of our jobs
EDL	00:28:42,880	00:28:45,952	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Or jobs are not like jobs that are today
EDL	00:28:45,952	00:28:47,488	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Rare a big trout
EDL	00:28:47,488	00:28:48,000	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	And therefore
EDL	00:28:48,512	00:28:50,560	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Having a basic income would ameliorate
EDL	00:28:50,560	00:28:51,840	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	A kind of economy that
EDL	00:28:52,608	00:28:53,376	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	A lot of the
EDL	00:28:53,376	00:28:54,912	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Silicon Valley is helping to

EDL	00:28:59,264	00:29:03,360	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Startup accelerator like to help businesses grow and they're like this is what it takes
EDL	00:29:04,128	00:29:07,968	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	If they need a basic income in order to innovate capital I like
EDL	00:29:07,968	00:29:13,088	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Let's let's see if it'll work yeah and they just want to make sure that they don't set expectations
EDL	00:29:13,088	00:29:13,856	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Too high

EDL	00:29:15,904	00:29:17,184	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	And so I don't expect

EDL	00:29:18,720	00:29:19,744	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	No changes overnight
EDL	00:29:20,256	00:29:21,536	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Anyway and so I think
EDL	00:29:21,536	00:29:23,072	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	We really need to give it time
EDL	00:29:23,840	00:29:24,864	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Sew in
EDL	00:29:24,864	00:29:26,912	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Doing this research about basic income
EDL	00:29:26,912	00:29:29,472	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	I come across a thousand polarizing thanks
EDL	00:29:29,472	00:29:31,264	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Pieces that are either like
EDL	00:29:31,264	00:29:36,640	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Ubi is a great idea and we should do this right now or like this is a terrible idea and we need to stop it
EDL	00:29:37,152	00:29:39,712	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	But realistically it's going to be years
EDL	00:29:39,712	00:29:43,808	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Before we know what we can learn from this privatized American experiment
EDL	00:29:44,576	00:29:46,368	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Or from The Finnish experiment for that matter
EDL	00:29:47,392	00:29:49,184	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Because most of the arguments were having about
EDL	00:29:49,184	00:29:50,464	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Basic income at this point in time
EDL	00:29:50,976	00:29:55,072	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	In all of basic incomes many different definitions and variations
EDL	00:29:55,072	00:29:56,864	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	It's all based on speculation
EDL	00:29:57,376	00:29:59,168	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	We're having a debate without
EDL	00:29:59,168	00:29:59,680	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Data
EDL	00:30:00,192	00:30:05,568	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	And no one has solid answers yet about what basic income would mean for the national tax
EDL	00:30:05,568	00:30:10,176	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Kotor inflation or unemployment rate for the economy or the robots are happiness and well-being
EDL	00:30:10,176	00:30:11,200	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	And
EDL	00:30:11,200	00:30:15,552	| 99pi-0276-thefinnishexperiment-1 |	Right now all we know is that different experimenters all around the world are trying to figure out
