EDL	00:01:58,784	00:01:59,552	| 99pi-0245-theeponymist-1 |	The Illusionist
EDL	00:02:01,856	00:02:03,904	| 99pi-0245-theeponymist-1 |	Molokai Raymond tweeted the following
EDL	00:02:03,904	00:02:09,024	| 99pi-0245-theeponymist-1 |	I would totally listen to an ongoing Ray J series comprised solely of the stories behind eponyms
EDL	00:02:09,536	00:02:10,560	| 99pi-0245-theeponymist-1 |	Firstly I thought
EDL	00:02:11,072	00:02:11,840	| 99pi-0245-theeponymist-1 |	What's an eponym
EDL	00:02:14,656	00:02:15,936	| 99pi-0245-theeponymist-1 |	F&M noun
EDL	00:02:15,936	00:02:18,752	| 99pi-0245-theeponymist-1 |	A word or name derived from the name of a person
EDL	00:02:18,752	00:02:22,592	| 99pi-0245-theeponymist-1 |	Or a pass enough to human Discovery invention Place Etc is named
EDL	00:02:23,104	00:02:27,200	| 99pi-0245-theeponymist-1 |	Second day I wondered what it was about eponyms look up Romans so excited
EDL	00:02:27,200	00:02:29,504	| 99pi-0245-theeponymist-1 |	An eponym does almost by definition
EDL	00:02:29,504	00:02:33,600	| 99pi-0245-theeponymist-1 |	Has some gun store even if it isn't the origin story it has something
EDL	00:02:33,600	00:02:34,880	| 99pi-0245-theeponymist-1 |	Where it
EDL	00:02:35,904	00:02:38,208	| 99pi-0245-theeponymist-1 |	Got the F&M attached to it
EDL	00:02:38,208	00:02:39,232	| 99pi-0245-theeponymist-1 |	Which is
EDL	00:02:39,232	00:02:41,024	| 99pi-0245-theeponymist-1 |	A good enough story to be retold
EDL	00:02:41,792	00:02:45,376	| 99pi-0245-theeponymist-1 |	And so for that reason I just I kind of love them and it's worth starts
EDL	00:02:45,888	00:02:46,912	| 99pi-0245-theeponymist-1 |	A good conversation I think

EDL	00:02:49,472	00:02:52,288	| 99pi-0245-theeponymist-1 |	Silhouette because I think it's a little bit of a slur
EDL	00:02:52,800	00:02:53,568	| 99pi-0245-theeponymist-1 |	If I have this right
EDL	00:02:54,080	00:02:56,384	| 99pi-0245-theeponymist-1 |	The idea that like really elaborate

EDL	00:03:06,624	00:03:07,136	| 99pi-0245-theeponymist-1 |	And
EDL	00:03:07,648	00:03:09,440	| 99pi-0245-theeponymist-1 |	And that's right at the time when
EDL	00:03:09,952	00:03:14,304	| 99pi-0245-theeponymist-1 |	Outline drawings for becoming a fashion which are clearly not as elaborate didn't require

EDL	00:03:18,144	00:03:19,168	| 99pi-0245-theeponymist-1 |	And so
EDL	00:03:19,168	00:03:21,984	| 99pi-0245-theeponymist-1 |	That type of a portrait was all a silhouette

EDL	00:03:29,408	00:03:30,432	| 99pi-0245-theeponymist-1 |	It's a bit of

EDL	00:21:01,567	00:21:03,871	| 99pi-0245-theeponymist-1 |	In medicine as in everything communication
EDL	00:21:03,871	00:21:04,639	| 99pi-0245-theeponymist-1 |	So important
EDL	00:21:04,639	00:21:05,407	| 99pi-0245-theeponymist-1 |	And so
EDL	00:21:05,919	00:21:07,967	| 99pi-0245-theeponymist-1 |	You want to strike that middle ground where you're making
