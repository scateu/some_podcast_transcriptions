EDL	00:03:06,624	00:03:07,904	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Not a humble man
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:09,696	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Doug Williams but also not wrong

EDL	00:03:15,584	00:03:18,656	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Meaning of he got a head in over 40% of his at-bats
EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:19,936	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Which is incredibly good
EDL	00:03:20,448	00:03:23,520	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	No one has batted above 400 since Ted Williams
EDL	00:03:23,520	00:03:25,824	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Ted Williams
EDL	00:03:26,336	00:03:32,480	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	The greatest hitter of them all
EDL	00:03:36,832	00:03:38,368	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	And Williams kept it up
EDL	00:03:38,880	00:03:41,440	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Even left to fight in World War I
EDL	00:03:41,440	00:03:42,464	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Came back
EDL	00:03:42,464	00:03:43,744	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	And was still the best
EDL	00:03:43,744	00:03:44,256	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Best hitter in baseball
EDL	00:03:45,280	00:03:50,144	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	But in 1946 just as Ted Williams was on track for another record-breaking year
EDL	00:03:50,144	00:03:53,728	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	He came face-to-face with someone hell-bent on ending history
EDL	00:03:53,728	00:03:57,568	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	A guy with the Cleveland baseball team named Lou Boudreau
EDL	00:03:57,568	00:03:59,360	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Boudreaux was a shortstop for the Indy
EDL	00:03:59,872	00:04:01,664	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	But he was also the manager of the
EDL	00:04:02,432	00:04:05,760	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Because back then you could actually be both a player and a manager at the
EDL	00:04:05,760	00:04:06,272	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	The same time
EDL	00:04:06,784	00:04:08,576	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	He was an incredibly ambitious person
EDL	00:04:09,088	00:04:09,600	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	And a great player
EDL	00:04:10,112	00:04:12,160	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	But despite Boudreaux's success
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:14,208	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	There was this other player that got
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:15,232	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	All the attention
EDL	00:04:16,000	00:04:16,768	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Ted Williams
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:17,536	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	The greatest
EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:19,071	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Hitter who ever lived

EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:27,007	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	That's Russell Schneider
EDL	00:04:27,007	00:04:29,567	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	He covered the Indians for the Cleveland Plain Dealer
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:30,335	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	And became close with
EDL	00:04:31,359	00:04:33,151	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Knowing Boudreaux's
EDL	00:04:33,151	00:04:33,663	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Think I did
EDL	00:04:34,175	00:04:36,479	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	There's no doubt but this was a Clash
EDL	00:04:36,479	00:04:37,247	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Eagles
EDL	00:04:37,247	00:04:38,015	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Between William
EDL	00:04:38,015	00:04:38,783	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Boudreaux
EDL	00:04:38,783	00:04:40,319	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	But Boudreaux had a plan
EDL	00:04:40,831	00:04:44,671	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	He knew that Williams almost always hit the ball to the right side of the field
EDL	00:04:44,671	00:04:45,951	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Between first and second base
EDL	00:04:46,463	00:04:47,743	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	As the Indians manager
EDL	00:04:48,255	00:04:50,815	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	He could actually set up his team strategy
EDL	00:04:50,815	00:04:53,119	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Specifically to beat Williams
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:54,911	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Voice whisper.
EDL	00:04:55,423	00:04:56,191	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Cleveland manager

EDL	00:05:05,407	00:05:06,431	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	And it is
EDL	00:05:06,431	00:05:07,199	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	This is what I want to do
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:12,831	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Lou Boudreau decided that he would shift three players from the left side of the field
EDL	00:05:13,343	00:05:13,855	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	To the right
EDL	00:05:14,623	00:05:15,647	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	He put a wall up
EDL	00:05:15,647	00:05:20,767	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	3 infielders between first and second base with a trio of outfielders backed up behind them
EDL	00:05:21,279	00:05:22,047	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Now 6
EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:25,119	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Of the seven Defenders were standing on the right side of the field
EDL	00:05:25,887	00:05:28,959	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Only one lonely outfielder remains on the left
EDL	00:05:29,727	00:05:32,287	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	The Familiar symmetry of the baseball diamond

EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:34,591	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	And with it
EDL	00:05:35,103	00:05:36,639	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	The Ted Williams shift
EDL	00:05:37,151	00:05:37,663	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Was born
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:39,711	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	I called the Boudreau shift
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:42,783	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Some people call it the defensive shift or just
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:43,295	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	The chef
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:48,415	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	First time boudreaux use the shift on williamswood july 14th 1946
EDL	00:05:48,927	00:05:49,695	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Fenway Park
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:52,255	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	When William stepped into
EDL	00:05:52,255	00:05:54,559	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	The place and saw the shift for the first time
EDL	00:05:54,559	00:05:57,375	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	He said that the Umpire what the hell is going on out there
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:05:58,399	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	They can't do that
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:05:59,679	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	But they could
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:01,983	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Totally legal
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:03,775	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	And so Williams had a choice
EDL	00:06:04,287	00:06:06,079	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Swing just like he always swan
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:07,359	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Any might hit a homerun
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:11,967	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	But he might also hit the ball into the crowded offender shifted to his right
EDL	00:06:12,479	00:06:13,247	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Or
EDL	00:06:13,247	00:06:15,039	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	He could go outside his comfort zone
EDL	00:06:15,039	00:06:16,319	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Try to hit the ball to the left
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:20,671	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Boudreaux knew they would be difficult for Ted to alter his swing
EDL	00:06:20,671	00:06:22,207	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	The song I'm selfish
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:22,975	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	The Slugger
EDL	00:06:22,975	00:06:23,743	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Home run hitter
EDL	00:06:24,255	00:06:25,791	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	And that therefore he would
EDL	00:06:25,791	00:06:28,351	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Continue doing it his way
EDL	00:06:28,863	00:06:30,399	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Who wrote the Ted Williams biography
EDL	00:06:31,167	00:06:33,727	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	He was appealing to the williamses pride
EDL	00:06:34,495	00:06:35,519	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	And it worked
EDL	00:06:35,519	00:06:37,567	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	The first time Williams came up to bat he hit
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:39,359	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Straight into the teeth of the shaft
EDL	00:06:39,359	00:06:42,175	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	In fact he hit the baseball right to Boudreaux himself
EDL	00:06:42,175	00:06:44,223	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Standing directly between first and second base
EDL	00:06:47,039	00:06:52,415	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Boudreaux kept using the shift on Williams and pretty soon other teams were using it against him to
EDL	00:06:52,927	00:06:57,279	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Wasn't long at all maybe within a week or two that the rest of the American League
EDL	00:06:57,279	00:06:58,303	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Was adopting it
EDL	00:06:58,303	00:07:00,607	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	The Williams argued that
EDL	00:07:00,607	00:07:03,679	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	No he wasn't going to alter his natural swing
EDL	00:07:03,679	00:07:06,239	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	But the fans were showing up at
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:07,775	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	The park to see him hit
EDL	00:07:07,775	00:07:12,127	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	In interviews William said he thought the ship shaved about 15 points
EDL	00:07:12,127	00:07:13,407	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Off of his lifetime batting a
EDL	00:07:14,431	00:07:15,199	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Back
EDL	00:07:15,199	00:07:18,271	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Probably the only tactic that ever actually had an effect on head while you
EDL	00:07:18,783	00:07:20,831	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Eventually Ted Williams retire
EDL	00:07:20,831	00:07:21,599	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	And the chef
EDL	00:07:21,599	00:07:23,647	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	It more or less disappeared from baseball
EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:26,207	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	A lot of managers were hesitant
EDL	00:07:26,207	00:07:28,255	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	To use it because it didn't always work
EDL	00:07:28,767	00:07:30,559	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	When it goes bad you look
EDL	00:07:31,327	00:07:33,375	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	This is John Dewan the author of The
EDL	00:07:33,375	00:07:34,399	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Fielding Bible
EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:37,215	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	And the guy you'd be safe calling The Godfather
EDL	00:07:37,215	00:07:37,727	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Shift date
EDL	00:07:38,495	00:07:40,287	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	And he says for a long time
EDL	00:07:40,287	00:07:45,151	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Teams didn't have the kind of data that would back up the idea that risk would pay off overtime
EDL	00:07:45,663	00:07:47,967	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	You know they weren't real strong Analytics
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:50,783	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Back in the seventies and eighties that could tell you
EDL	00:07:50,783	00:07:51,551	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	I just kind of think
EDL	00:07:51,551	00:07:53,599	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Would work but then sabermetrics came along
EDL	00:07:54,111	00:07:59,743	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Sabermetrics is a movement in baseball that started in the 90s to collect data and study it to find advantages
EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:06,655	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Suddenly GM's in front office is across the major leagues were focused on this idea that to win without spending much
EDL	00:08:06,655	00:08:07,423	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	How much money
EDL	00:08:07,423	00:08:09,471	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	All you had to do was look at the numbers
EDL	00:08:10,751	00:08:12,543	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Enter the Tampa Bay Rays
EDL	00:08:12,543	00:08:14,079	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Formerly known as The Devil Rays
EDL	00:08:14,847	00:08:16,639	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	It was regarded as
EDL	00:08:16,639	00:08:18,431	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	You know maybe the worst franchise in all the bass
EDL	00:08:19,455	00:08:20,735	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	That's Jonah Keri
EDL	00:08:20,735	00:08:22,271	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	A journalist who wrote a book about the rain
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:24,831	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	They just didn't really understand what it took to win
EDL	00:08:24,831	00:08:31,231	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	This is bad baseball defensive miscues have cost a Devil Rays
EDL	00:08:31,231	00:08:32,255	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Dearly in the 8th
EDL	00:08:33,279	00:08:36,095	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	But things started changing for the rights in the mid 2000
EDL	00:08:36,863	00:08:39,167	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Stuart Sternberg former partner Goldman Sachs
EDL	00:08:39,679	00:08:40,959	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Decided he was going to buy the tea
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:43,519	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	And with him he brought a bunch of other Wall Street
EDL	00:08:44,287	00:08:45,823	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	You know number guys
EDL	00:08:45,823	00:08:46,335	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Quad
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:49,663	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Guys who are good at using data to find hidden
EDL	00:08:49,663	00:08:50,431	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Advantages
EDL	00:08:50,431	00:08:51,711	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Is Siri was
EDL	00:08:51,711	00:08:54,783	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Let's just succeed and be 2% better than the competition
EDL	00:08:55,295	00:09:01,439	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	The Rays numbercruncher study the data and they discovered a really efficient tactic that can help their fielding and defense
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:02,975	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Atactic
EDL	00:09:02,975	00:09:05,535	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Dredged up from baseball distant past
EDL	00:09:06,047	00:09:06,815	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	You guessed it
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:08,095	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	The defensive she
EDL	00:09:08,607	00:09:11,423	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	The shift really is a perfect example of an extra toe
EDL	00:09:11,423	00:09:16,031	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	2% Advantage because this doesn't work all the time Infected fails quite a bit
EDL	00:09:16,031	00:09:20,383	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	But the Rays didn't have much to lose so they decided to take a risk and bring back the chef
EDL	00:09:20,895	00:09:22,175	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	And they hire manager
EDL	00:09:22,175	00:09:23,967	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	The team who's on board with their plan
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:25,503	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	A guy by the name of Joe Maddon
EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:26,783	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	And right away
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:28,319	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Madden starts using the show
EDL	00:09:28,319	00:09:29,599	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Death on all kinds of
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:30,367	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Different headers
EDL	00:09:30,367	00:09:36,767	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Joe Maddon he's kind of the doctor and the master of the defensive shift
EDL	00:09:36,767	00:09:37,535	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Against Hardy
EDL	00:09:37,535	00:09:42,655	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	The Joe Maddon has come up with all kinds of interesting shifts this year She'll follow me you don't really ride
EDL	00:09:42,655	00:09:43,423	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	See this type of shoe
EDL	00:09:43,423	00:09:43,935	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Just all that often
EDL	00:09:45,471	00:09:45,983	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	And all the sudden
EDL	00:09:46,495	00:09:48,543	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Just a disaster of a team
EDL	00:09:48,543	00:09:49,567	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Airtight in the
EDL	00:09:49,567	00:09:50,847	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	You can score runs off their pictures
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:10:01,599	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	From nowhere they transform themselves from a
EDL	00:10:01,599	00:10:03,903	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Petrol doormat to a championship contender
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:07,231	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	And the shift was right at the center of their resurgence
EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:09,279	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	The shift caught on
EDL	00:10:09,279	00:10:11,583	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	All the sudden every team the league started shifting
EDL	00:10:12,095	00:10:15,679	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	In fact other teams began shifting against the Rays on best hitters
EDL	00:10:16,191	00:10:20,799	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Including this guy my name is Carlos Pena net play Major League Baseball 414ce
EDL	00:10:21,823	00:10:25,663	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Carlos Pena grew up playing baseball and a kid in the Dominican Republic
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:28,223	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	And being a power hitter I believe
EDL	00:10:28,735	00:10:30,271	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Was his ticket to the US
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:37,183	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	We swing our way you know off the island we have two other stuff that's the way we but we were taught you know we want to make some

EDL	00:10:53,311	00:10:56,127	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Right around the same time Joe Maddon was reintroducing
EDL	00:10:56,127	00:10:57,151	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	In the shift to the Major League
EDL	00:10:58,431	00:11:04,831	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	And there's a high fly ball back into right field number 46

EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:08,415	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Bad to shift on
EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:13,279	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	And the shift is absolutely a killer

EDL	00:11:46,559	00:11:47,839	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	When Penny was shifted on
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:49,119	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	He had to make a decision
EDL	00:11:49,119	00:11:53,983	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Do I swing my natural swing and maybe get a homerun or maybe hit straight into the shaft
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:55,007	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Where do I change my
EDL	00:11:55,775	00:11:56,799	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Eventually
EDL	00:11:56,799	00:12:00,127	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Unlike Williams whose ego led him to try to power through this shift
EDL	00:12:00,895	00:12:02,687	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Pena started to adopt another tax
EDL	00:12:03,455	00:12:07,807	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	He did something Ted Williams it only tried a handful of times during his whole career
EDL	00:12:08,831	00:12:14,463	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Shifters on Prytania

EDL	00:12:17,279	00:12:17,791	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Budget
EDL	00:12:18,303	00:12:19,327	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Be humble but
EDL	00:12:19,839	00:12:21,375	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	There's nothing pretty about this move
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:25,215	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	You just kind of bummed about with your bad and it dribbles out onto the field
EDL	00:12:25,983	00:12:30,847	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Bunting with something that players traditionally did just to move their teammates from one base to another
EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:33,919	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	For Carlos Pena turn the butt into his own
EDL	00:12:33,919	00:12:34,687	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Secret weapon
EDL	00:12:35,199	00:12:38,783	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	Using the bundt pan you could tap the ball toward third base

EDL	00:15:07,263	00:15:09,567	| 99pi-0234-theshift-1 |	According to John Dewan the author of The Fielding
