EDL	00:17:42,655	00:17:44,959	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Plate tectonics was still just a theory
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:51,359	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	It's hard for people to accept that the continents we stand on
EDL	00:17:52,127	00:17:52,895	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	We're actually in motion
EDL	00:17:53,919	00:17:56,223	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	They were just sliding around randomly
EDL	00:17:56,223	00:17:57,503	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Violently colliding
EDL	00:17:58,271	00:17:58,783	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Rock
EDL	00:17:59,295	00:18:00,319	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Nothing is stable
EDL	00:18:01,343	00:18:02,111	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	But everything runs
EDL	00:18:02,623	00:18:03,647	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Pure chance
EDL	00:18:04,927	00:18:06,719	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	That's what the stories about really
EDL	00:18:06,719	00:18:07,231	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Champs
EDL	00:18:07,999	00:18:08,767	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Maybe that's obvious
EDL	00:18:09,279	00:18:10,303	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Steven the woman's last name
EDL	00:18:11,839	00:18:12,607	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	But
EDL	00:18:12,607	00:18:13,375	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	The question is
EDL	00:18:13,375	00:18:14,911	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	How are we supposed to live
EDL	00:18:14,911	00:18:17,471	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	On the surface of such unbearable random
EDL	00:18:18,495	00:18:20,543	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	What can we grab hold of
EDL	00:18:21,055	00:18:21,567	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Fixed
EDL	00:18:23,359	00:18:27,199	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	I want to hear the old recordings of Jeannie on the radio that weekend
EDL	00:18:27,199	00:18:28,991	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	All the other voices working too
EDL	00:18:29,503	00:18:30,783	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	A picture of them as saw it up
EDL	00:18:31,807	00:18:32,831	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Like wires
EDL	00:18:32,831	00:18:33,599	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Crossing

EDL	00:18:36,415	00:18:36,927	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Further out
EDL	00:18:37,951	00:18:39,743	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Crossing each other to like a net
EDL	00:18:40,767	00:18:41,791	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Kind of alternate

EDL	00:19:38,879	00:19:45,023	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Time right now to evaluate
EDL	00:20:04,479	00:20:10,623	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	This one I'm very happy for not
EDL	00:20:12,927	00:20:17,535	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Okay

EDL	00:20:25,215	00:20:30,335	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Your family has been contacted and everything is okay

EDL	00:20:39,807	00:20:45,951	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	I really hadn't stopped to think how worried and concerned my parents must be I understand that
EDL	00:20:45,951	00:20:51,583	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Kfar in Fairbanks is monitoring us and is relaying messages to the South 48th
EDL	00:20:51,583	00:20:57,983	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	I wonder if the person in Kfar would take down a message from me and get the word to my family
EDL	00:20:57,983	00:20:59,263	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Right and Bonham
EDL	00:20:59,263	00:21:00,799	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Second chance
EDL	00:21:00,799	00:21:02,335	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Family is all right
EDL	00:21:03,103	00:21:04,895	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	The chance family is all right
EDL	00:21:07,711	00:21:08,479	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Received
EDL	00:21:09,759	00:21:15,903	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	We have another message here to
EDL	00:21:58,912	00:22:00,192	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Late on Saturday
EDL	00:22:00,960	00:22:01,472	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	The day after
EDL	00:22:02,752	00:22:05,568	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Jeanne read a list of the missing and dead on the air
EDL	00:22:06,592	00:22:07,616	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	No one told her to do it
EDL	00:22:08,896	00:22:10,688	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	But there didn't seem to be anyone to ask for
EDL	00:22:10,688	00:22:11,200	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Permission either
EDL	00:22:13,504	00:22:15,040	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	The next day was Easter Sunday
EDL	00:22:15,808	00:22:18,112	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Ministers talked about death and Resurrection
EDL	00:22:18,624	00:22:22,720	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	The staff of the Anchorage Daily Times picked up all the pieces of movable type
EDL	00:22:23,232	00:22:24,512	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Thrown all over there printing room
EDL	00:22:25,280	00:22:26,304	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Managed to put on a noose
EDL	00:22:27,328	00:22:31,424	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Do JCPenney Executives declared we will build again
EDL	00:22:31,424	00:22:33,472	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Bigger and better than before
EDL	00:22:34,496	00:22:38,080	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Eventually the Little Theatre resumed its production of our town too
EDL	00:22:38,592	00:22:44,480	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	What are the actors told me that after the Quake whenever a restaurant in Anchorage reopened or a church held a mass
EDL	00:22:44,480	00:22:46,528	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	There was never an empty seat she said
EDL	00:22:47,296	00:22:49,088	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Everyone wanted to be with someone else
EDL	00:22:50,368	00:22:51,904	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	I never something especially poetic
EDL	00:22:52,416	00:22:55,232	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	About the sold-out crowd at the theater that first night
EDL	00:22:56,256	00:23:01,376	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Because that kind of togetherness is basically what Thornton Wilder's play is about
EDL	00:23:01,888	00:23:04,704	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Play about daily life in a small town
EDL	00:23:04,704	00:23:06,240	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	The deaths and marriages
EDL	00:23:06,240	00:23:07,264	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Tragedies
EDL	00:23:07,264	00:23:07,776	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Spurts
EDL	00:23:08,288	00:23:09,568	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	And how I wonder all that
EDL	00:23:09,568	00:23:11,360	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Flux their stability
EDL	00:23:11,360	00:23:13,152	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Every community over time
EDL	00:23:13,920	00:23:14,944	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	In Anchorage
EDL	00:23:14,944	00:23:17,504	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	A city that worried it was temporary
EDL	00:23:17,504	00:23:18,784	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Realized
EDL	00:23:18,784	00:23:20,320	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	It was temporary
EDL	00:23:20,320	00:23:23,392	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	At least all its buildings and houses in Rhodes
EDL	00:23:23,904	00:23:27,488	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	But it was discovering there was something permanent about itself to
EDL	00:23:28,512	00:23:34,656	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	All night at the theater the character of the stage manager talks to the audience directly narrating the story of the play
EDL	00:23:35,168	00:23:36,704	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Kind of like I've been doing tonight
EDL	00:23:36,704	00:23:39,520	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Now when the curtain rose on the Final Act
EDL	00:23:40,032	00:23:41,312	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	He came out for his monologue
EDL	00:23:44,896	00:23:46,944	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Now there are some things we all know
EDL	00:23:47,712	00:23:48,992	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	But we don't take him out
EDL	00:23:48,992	00:23:54,112	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	And look at them very often we all know that something is eternal
EDL	00:23:54,880	00:23:57,952	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	And it ain't houses and it ain't names
EDL	00:23:57,952	00:24:04,352	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Earth and it ain't even Stars everybody knows in their bones
EDL	00:24:04,352	00:24:06,144	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Is that something is eternal
EDL	00:24:06,144	00:24:09,216	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	And that something has to do with human beings
EDL	00:24:10,240	00:24:14,336	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	All the greatest people ever lived been telling us that for 5000 years
EDL	00:24:14,336	00:24:14,848	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	And yet
EDL	00:24:15,360	00:24:18,432	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	You'd be surprised how people are always losing hold of it
EDL	00:24:20,480	00:24:23,296	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Me and Jeannie chance stayed on duty
EDL	00:24:23,296	00:24:25,344	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Kni for 59 hours
EDL	00:24:25,856	00:24:26,368	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	That weekend
EDL	00:24:27,136	00:24:28,928	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	When things finally calm down
EDL	00:24:28,928	00:24:30,976	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	She sat down to write a letter to a parent
EDL	00:24:32,512	00:24:37,120	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	They'd written to her right after the Quake pleading with Jeannie to send her three kids to live with them
EDL	00:24:37,632	00:24:39,680	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Well that battered City up in Alaska
EDL	00:24:39,680	00:24:40,704	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Figured out what's next
EDL	00:24:41,472	00:24:42,752	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Think of the kids safety
EDL	00:24:44,544	00:24:46,336	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Depart of Jeannie thought it was a good idea
EDL	00:24:47,616	00:24:49,152	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	She had another more convinced
EDL	00:24:50,688	00:24:51,456	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	We must be together
EDL	00:24:52,224	00:24:53,504	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	As long as we're together
EDL	00:24:53,504	00:24:54,272	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	We are confident of the
EDL	00:24:55,552	00:24:56,576	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	She explained to her.
EDL	00:24:58,368	00:25:00,416	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	That Good Friday night
EDL	00:25:00,416	00:25:02,976	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	I knew we had survived miraculously
EDL	00:25:03,744	00:25:07,072	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	And for this reason there must be a purpose to our lives
EDL	00:25:07,584	00:25:09,632	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Apparently the children must sense this to
EDL	00:25:10,144	00:25:11,424	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Remain calm
EDL	00:25:12,192	00:25:15,008	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Steven fully aware of the emergency but if not
EDL	00:25:15,520	00:25:19,104	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	We are proud that they are such Dependable responsible young
EDL	00:25:19,872	00:25:23,200	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	I would not undermine their confidence in the future
EDL	00:25:23,200	00:25:26,784	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	In themselves by sending them away for their safety
EDL	00:25:27,808	00:25:29,344	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	What is DC anyway
EDL	00:25:30,112	00:25:33,184	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	How can you predict where or when tragedy will occur
EDL	00:25:33,696	00:25:36,512	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	You can only learn to live with it and make the best of it when it happens
EDL	00:25:37,792	00:25:39,328	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	These children are not afraid
EDL	00:25:40,096	00:25:42,144	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Their father and I are not afraid
EDL	00:25:42,912	00:25:44,704	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Please don't you fear for us
EDL	00:25:47,520	00:25:51,360	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	What is safety anyway
EDL	00:25:51,872	00:25:55,200	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Virginia seemed to be conceding that there is only randomness
EDL	00:25:55,712	00:25:56,992	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Only chance
EDL	00:25:57,504	00:25:59,296	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	And if everything Beyond this is chance
EDL	00:25:59,808	00:26:03,136	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Maybe the only Force we have to survive a world like that
EDL	00:26:03,648	00:26:04,160	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Disconnection
EDL	00:26:04,928	00:26:05,952	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	By then
EDL	00:26:05,952	00:26:07,744	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	It must have seemed so obvious to her
EDL	00:26:08,768	00:26:10,816	| 99pi_0259_thisischance_1 |	Take me to each other
