EDL	00:01:56,736	00:01:57,760	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Is REM
EDL	00:02:07,232	00:02:11,328	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	To be provocative right from the start I'm going to say that REM out of time
EDL	00:02:11,328	00:02:15,168	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Is the most politically important album in the history of the United
EDL	00:02:15,680	00:02:18,752	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Provocateur is reporter Whitney Jones do I have to say
EDL	00:02:19,264	00:02:24,128	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	I don't think out of time is even the most important album in the history of REM
EDL	00:02:24,128	00:02:26,688	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Actually my argument here is nothing to do with the music
EDL	00:02:27,200	00:02:31,040	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	This isn't one of those oh it's a soundtrack to a generation or anything like that
EDL	00:02:31,040	00:02:33,088	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Out of time made such a huge impact
EDL	00:02:33,088	00:02:34,112	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Because of its
EDL	00:02:34,112	00:02:34,624	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Packaging
EDL	00:02:35,136	00:02:39,744	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	The box out of time originally came in led to a bill being passed in Congress
EDL	00:02:39,744	00:02:41,792	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	An actual concrete law
EDL	00:02:43,584	00:02:45,120	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Let's go back to 1985
EDL	00:02:45,632	00:02:47,168	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	The pop charts were full of
EDL	00:02:47,168	00:02:48,960	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Prince and Sheena Easton
EDL	00:02:48,960	00:02:50,496	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	And the Youth of America
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:51,520	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	For being corrupted
EDL	00:02:52,032	00:02:57,408	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Tipper Gore in a few other Elite women of Washington form of the parents music Resource Center
EDL	00:02:57,408	00:02:59,200	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Or the pmrc for short
EDL	00:02:59,968	00:03:03,296	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	They put pressure on the creators and Distributors of quote on quote
EDL	00:03:03,296	00:03:04,320	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Objectionable music
EDL	00:03:05,088	00:03:07,136	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Musicians and labels called the censorship
EDL	00:03:07,648	00:03:09,184	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	There were Senate hearings about this
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:13,536	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	And eventually those little black and white Parental Advisory sticker started appearing on albums
EDL	00:03:14,304	00:03:16,864	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	This set off a wave of censorship across the country
EDL	00:03:17,376	00:03:22,752	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	In 1990 a federal district judge in South Florida ruled that the rap group 2 Live Crew album
EDL	00:03:22,752	00:03:23,776	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	As nasty as they wanna be
EDL	00:03:24,544	00:03:28,640	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Was so obscene that it couldn't be sold or performed within his jurisdiction
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:41,184	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	3 days after the ruling 2 Live Crew played a show in Broward County Florida
EDL	00:03:41,696	00:03:44,256	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	And after the show two members of the group got arrest
EDL	00:03:44,256	00:03:46,560	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	And it was a live performance I believe
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:50,144	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	That they found obscene with you know girls doing what would be
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:55,776	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Like what might working I think it would be a very early version of the twerking
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:04:01,408	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Jeff ayeroff wasn't there he saw it on TV and I just it was just so offencive to me
EDL	00:04:01,408	00:04:03,456	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Jeff was an executive at Virgin Records
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:06,528	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	And to be clear he wasn't offended by the raunchy lyrics
EDL	00:04:06,528	00:04:07,808	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Ixora the twerking
EDL	00:04:07,808	00:04:09,344	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	He was offended by the arrest
EDL	00:04:09,344	00:04:11,392	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Send the blatant censorship of the artist work
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:15,744	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Jeff spent the next couple days mulling this over and then he had a revelation
EDL	00:04:16,256	00:04:17,536	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	One of the reasons why
EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:21,631	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Politicians get away with things because there isn't an anti constituency
EDL	00:04:22,143	00:04:24,191	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	There was never anything to lose by
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:25,471	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Baiting
EDL	00:04:25,983	00:04:28,543	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Rock and roll because there was this
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:31,615	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Qunar that young people didn't vote
EDL	00:04:32,127	00:04:36,991	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	And you know within the next two days the idea came to me like fully formed in some way
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:39,551	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	And I came up with this damn Rock the vote
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:41,087	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Progesterone
EDL	00:04:41,087	00:04:43,391	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	The idea behind rock the boat with simple
EDL	00:04:43,391	00:04:47,231	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Get young people to vote for politicians who wouldn't censor music
EDL	00:04:47,231	00:04:49,535	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Yeah it was that simple it was the idea of you put
EDL	00:04:49,535	00:04:51,071	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Kids in the game
EDL	00:04:51,839	00:04:53,119	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	The game becomes different
EDL	00:04:53,631	00:04:57,983	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Politicians can no longer scapegoat music they can't keep using us as Annex
EDL	00:04:57,983	00:04:58,751	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Excuse
EDL	00:04:58,751	00:05:04,895	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Sogefi Rob got about 60 people together in a Los Angeles hotel the talk about launching Rock the Boat
EDL	00:05:04,895	00:05:06,431	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Frank Zappa was there
EDL	00:05:06,431	00:05:09,503	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Past and present California Governor Jerry Brown was there
EDL	00:05:09,503	00:05:11,039	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	As we're a bunch of other record exec
EDL	00:05:11,551	00:05:12,575	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	So there we are
EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:14,111	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Part of this
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:16,415	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Virtuous circle of record executives
EDL	00:05:17,439	00:05:23,839	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Who have spent a lot of their career being criticized for destroying the Youth of America and it was sort of like an affair
EDL	00:05:23,839	00:05:25,375	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Very altruistic way
EDL	00:05:25,887	00:05:28,959	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	I think we could do something positive we can get kids to vote we can
EDL	00:05:29,471	00:05:31,007	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	You know that's cool
EDL	00:05:31,007	00:05:35,871	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Also in attendance was Jeff Sprint
EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:36,639	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Jeff gold
EDL	00:05:36,639	00:05:38,687	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	He was working for Warner Brothers
EDL	00:05:38,687	00:05:40,479	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	And one of his major project of the time
EDL	00:05:40,991	00:05:42,015	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Trying to figure out
EDL	00:05:42,015	00:05:43,295	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	How to package CDs
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:49,183	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Compact disc packaging was the Hot Topic in the record world in the late eighties and early nineties
EDL	00:05:50,207	00:05:52,511	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	CDs have been around for a few years at this point
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:54,815	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	But record stores still didn't have a good way to display them
EDL	00:05:55,327	00:05:56,095	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Here's Jeff gold
EDL	00:05:56,607	00:05:57,375	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	When
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:05:59,167	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	CDs first came out on the market
EDL	00:05:59,935	00:06:01,471	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Record retailers
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:06,079	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Were angry about them because their stores were formatted
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:08,639	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	To display
EDL	00:06:08,639	00:06:10,943	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	12 and 1/2 inch for 12 and 1/4 inch square
EDL	00:06:11,455	00:06:12,223	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Talbots
EDL	00:06:12,223	00:06:16,319	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	In other words they didn't have any stands or display cases for these new CDs
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:18,879	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	So somebody the record industry said look
EDL	00:06:19,391	00:06:24,511	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	If you put a CD jewel case inside of a cardboard box that's as long as a vinyl album
EDL	00:06:24,511	00:06:26,303	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	And only half as wide
EDL	00:06:26,303	00:06:27,071	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	You can fit
EDL	00:06:27,071	00:06:30,911	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Two of these longbox CD side-by-side in an LP rack
EDL	00:06:31,423	00:06:32,447	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Problem solved
EDL	00:06:32,959	00:06:35,007	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Retailer said fine perfect
EDL	00:06:35,775	00:06:39,359	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	It's so millions of these things out of nowhere started getting made
EDL	00:06:40,383	00:06:42,943	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Record people loved the long box
EDL	00:06:42,943	00:06:44,479	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	They thought it was the future
EDL	00:06:45,247	00:06:50,879	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	A head honcho AEM I wrote this opinion piece in billboard magazine in 1989 entitled
EDL	00:06:50,879	00:06:52,927	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Why we should keep the CD longbox
EDL	00:06:53,695	00:06:54,975	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	He writes quote
EDL	00:06:54,975	00:07:00,863	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	I want to see the music industry continue to thrive and prosper as one of the cornerstones of entertainment
EDL	00:07:01,631	00:07:05,471	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	And I think making full use of the 6 by 12 CD carton
EDL	00:07:05,471	00:07:07,263	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Is one way to help us do just
EDL	00:07:07,263	00:07:09,823	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	That but not everyone loved along box
EDL	00:07:10,591	00:07:12,127	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Artist said wait a minute
EDL	00:07:12,895	00:07:15,711	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	We don't want you cutting down millions of trees
EDL	00:07:15,711	00:07:16,735	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	To put
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:18,271	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Are CD's in
EDL	00:07:18,271	00:07:21,087	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	And then having people throw these things away it's a
EDL	00:07:21,087	00:07:22,367	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Incredibly wasteful
EDL	00:07:22,367	00:07:23,135	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	In bed thing to do for
EDL	00:07:24,159	00:07:25,951	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Because the thing about the longbox
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:27,743	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Is that it was never meant to be collected
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:30,303	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	And the feel of a big Mike and Ike Carter
EDL	00:07:30,815	00:07:32,607	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	You when you bought a CD in a longbox
EDL	00:07:33,119	00:07:33,887	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	You open it up
EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:35,679	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	It take out the jewel case
EDL	00:07:35,679	00:07:38,239	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Switch out the actual CD in the album art in it
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:40,031	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	I need to toss a long box
EDL	00:07:40,031	00:07:41,567	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	There's no reason to keep it around
EDL	00:07:42,591	00:07:44,383	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Auriemma record coming out
EDL	00:07:44,895	00:07:45,663	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	In 1990
EDL	00:07:46,175	00:07:47,199	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	And they're saying
EDL	00:07:47,711	00:07:51,551	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	To me and to Warner Brothers there's no way our record is coming at a long box
EDL	00:07:52,319	00:07:54,367	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	We're sensitive to the environment
EDL	00:07:54,367	00:07:56,671	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	This is a ridiculous thing forget it
EDL	00:07:57,695	00:08:01,023	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	And one of their sales department is saying it absolutely has to come out in a long box
EDL	00:08:01,535	00:08:02,815	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Or record retailers
EDL	00:08:02,815	00:08:03,327	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Going to penalize
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:06,143	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	And that's when Jeff gold got this idea
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:08,191	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	He could merge the two projects He was working
EDL	00:08:08,959	00:08:12,031	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	They could use the CD longbox to advance The Rock the vote camp
EDL	00:08:12,799	00:08:16,127	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	But first he needed a concrete political cause to connect it to
EDL	00:08:16,639	00:08:18,687	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	And Jeff are all fat found just the thing
EDL	00:08:19,711	00:08:22,271	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	We were sitting there looking for a reason. Try to get us
EDL	00:08:22,271	00:08:23,039	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Send
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:24,575	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	A political situation
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:28,159	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	I'm reading Newsweek or time and there's this column article
EDL	00:08:28,671	00:08:30,207	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	About the Motor Voter bill
EDL	00:08:30,719	00:08:31,743	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	We just said
EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:34,559	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	We're going to help these people from the Motor Voter bill
EDL	00:08:34,559	00:08:40,703	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	This was going to be our first thing we were going to do but so there's this Motor Voter bill that's been bouncing around Congress since the 1970s
EDL	00:08:41,215	00:08:46,079	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	If passed Motor Voter would allow people to register to vote at the DMV when you got a driver's license
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:52,223	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	It also allowed you to register by mail or when you apply for social services like welfare or unemployment
EDL	00:08:52,735	00:08:55,039	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Basically making it easier for a lot of people
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:58,111	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Including Rock loving young people
EDL	00:08:58,111	00:08:58,879	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	The register to vote
EDL	00:08:59,391	00:09:01,439	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	By 91 a few states that already adopt
EDL	00:09:01,951	00:09:04,511	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	But Congress has never been able to get it passed naturally
EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:08,607	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Jeff gold went to a political event in Hollywood about the Motor Voter bill
EDL	00:09:08,607	00:09:10,143	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	And one of the speakers was
EDL	00:09:10,143	00:09:12,447	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Columbia sociologist in political activist
EDL	00:09:12,447	00:09:13,215	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Richard cloward
EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:16,543	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	He said that writing to elected officials could help sway them on the issue
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:20,127	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	After clouds talk Jeff gold went up and spoke with
EDL	00:09:20,639	00:09:21,663	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Then when the Panic started talk
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:27,295	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	What amount of letters would a senator a congressman
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:27,807	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	And take note of
EDL	00:09:28,319	00:09:28,831	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Particular
EDL	00:09:29,343	00:09:31,903	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	350 200
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:32,927	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	That would really have an empath
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:34,463	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Can I should really that
EDL	00:09:34,463	00:09:35,231	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Few
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:37,535	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	People don't write so
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:40,351	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Getting 150-200 letters
EDL	00:09:40,863	00:09:44,447	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	About an issue would would definitely make them sit up and take notice
EDL	00:09:44,959	00:09:48,031	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	That weekend Jeff gold was riding his bike around Santa Monica
EDL	00:09:48,031	00:09:49,823	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	And I had this moment where
EDL	00:09:49,823	00:09:52,383	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	It rushed into my mind this fully formed idea that
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:54,431	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	That we could
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:09:55,967	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Take care of REM
EDL	00:09:55,967	00:09:58,527	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	By turning their long box into a positive
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:10:02,111	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	If we put a petition on the back of the long box
EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:06,207	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	That would go to rock the boat saying I support the Motor Voter bill
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:08,767	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	And we could distribute it to
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:10,047	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Their respective senator
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:11,839	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	And I knew
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:13,375	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	We can generate
EDL	00:10:13,375	00:10:14,655	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Unbelievable amount of mail
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:17,471	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Jeff gold got on the phone with Jeff era
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:19,519	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	And they agreed that this would be the strategy
EDL	00:10:20,287	00:10:23,615	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	They would turn the album long box into a piece of political machinery
EDL	00:10:24,127	00:10:26,943	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	And they would flood congress with support for the Motor Voter bill
EDL	00:10:27,711	00:10:30,783	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	That Monday Jeff called REM manager with the plan
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:32,319	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	It's alright let me call the guys
EDL	00:10:32,831	00:10:33,599	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	I'll call you back
EDL	00:10:33,599	00:10:35,647	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	I probably heard back from him within an hour
EDL	00:10:35,647	00:10:37,951	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Bernie said great idea they're totally into it let's do
EDL	00:10:38,463	00:10:41,535	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	So out of time hit the record stores on March 12th 1991
EDL	00:10:42,047	00:10:44,095	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	And then the petition started rolling in
EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:46,655	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	And I remember vividly
EDL	00:10:47,167	00:10:50,239	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Maybe four or five days after the record come out
EDL	00:10:50,751	00:10:52,031	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	I mean a very short period of time
EDL	00:10:52,031	00:10:53,311	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	They had bags
EDL	00:10:54,847	00:10:56,127	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	It was really incredible
EDL	00:10:56,639	00:10:59,967	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Nobody can seem to put their hand on what the exact number of
EDL	00:11:00,479	00:11:02,783	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	That we got of these were but I remember thinking
EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:06,111	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Well after 3 weeks we got ten thousand I mean that's
EDL	00:11:06,623	00:11:08,159	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	100%
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:11,999	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	That's already half of what Richard cloward said would make an impact
EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:16,607	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	And he sings just kept coming in and drove their canvas bags full of them coming in
EDL	00:11:17,887	00:11:23,775	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	About a month after REM release the album Rock the books political director plus two members of the hip hop group KMD
EDL	00:11:24,287	00:11:28,127	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Wheeled a shopping cart full of these first ten thousand petition
EDL	00:11:28,127	00:11:28,639	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Into a senator
EDL	00:11:29,663	00:11:32,735	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	And they just left them there for senators window Ford
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:34,783	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	And a very young looking Mitch McConnell
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:39,647	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	It may have 1992 after thousands of petitions
EDL	00:11:39,647	00:11:40,671	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Senate testimony
EDL	00:11:40,671	00:11:42,207	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	The Motor Voter bill passed
EDL	00:11:42,207	00:11:42,719	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Congress
EDL	00:11:43,231	00:11:45,023	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	But then president HW Bush vetoed
EDL	00:11:45,791	00:11:49,375	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	This was in July right in the middle of Bush's re-election campaign
EDL	00:11:49,375	00:11:52,959	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Bush's opponent Bill Clinton took up Motor Voter as a talking point
EDL	00:11:52,959	00:11:54,239	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Bashing Bush over
EDL	00:11:54,239	00:11:55,007	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	What is veto
EDL	00:11:55,007	00:11:56,543	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	And the rest is basically history
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:11:58,335	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Clinton wins 92
EDL	00:11:58,335	00:12:03,967	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	The bill comes back before the house is actually the second bill that the house takes up in January of 93
EDL	00:12:03,967	00:12:06,527	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Motor Voter passofallpasses the Senate
EDL	00:12:06,527	00:12:08,831	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	And then Bill Clinton signed it into law
EDL	00:12:08,831	00:12:12,159	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	As the national voter registration Act of 1993
EDL	00:12:13,183	00:12:14,463	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	At the White House earlier
EDL	00:12:14,463	00:12:15,231	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Today prison
EDL	00:12:15,231	00:12:16,511	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Bill Clinton signed
EDL	00:12:16,511	00:12:18,559	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	The voter registration Act
EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:19,327	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Commonly
EDL	00:12:19,327	00:12:20,607	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Referred to as the Motor Voter bill
EDL	00:12:21,119	00:12:22,911	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Can we get invited to the White House
EDL	00:12:22,911	00:12:23,423	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	The signings
EDL	00:12:23,935	00:12:24,447	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	And it's this
EDL	00:12:25,215	00:12:26,751	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Totally surreal scene
EDL	00:12:27,519	00:12:29,311	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	His wife were there and I'm there with my wife and
EDL	00:12:29,823	00:12:30,335	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	All the people
EDL	00:12:31,615	00:12:32,383	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	And
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:35,967	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Clinton at the signing talks about how Rock the vote really helped make the difference
EDL	00:12:35,967	00:12:36,479	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	How to get this built
EDL	00:12:37,247	00:12:38,015	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	As I said I have
EDL	00:12:38,527	00:12:40,063	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Long supported the idea of
EDL	00:12:40,575	00:12:41,087	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Motor Voter
EDL	00:12:41,855	00:12:43,647	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	More than a year ago I promised
EDL	00:12:43,647	00:12:44,415	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Does president
EDL	00:12:44,415	00:12:46,463	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	But I would sign HR 2 and 5
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:46,975	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Rich Passage

EDL	00:15:11,871	00:15:13,407	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	And that was the end of the long box
EDL	00:15:13,919	00:15:17,503	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Some stores got new racks to accommodate the long box Free Jewel cases

EDL	00:15:30,815	00:15:31,839	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	The Motor Voter bill
EDL	00:15:31,839	00:15:35,679	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Which after apus became the national voter registration Act of 1993
EDL	00:15:36,191	00:15:37,727	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	That's still very much a thing
EDL	00:15:37,727	00:15:40,543	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	Between 1995 when the law went into effect
EDL	00:15:40,543	00:15:41,311	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	In 2012

EDL	00:15:56,159	00:16:00,511	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	That doesn't even include mailing registrations or registrations through Social Services
EDL	00:16:00,511	00:16:01,791	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	As for what's the law also brought
EDL	00:16:02,815	00:16:06,911	| 99pi-0124-longbox-1 |	So I think that proves it know album is as important to politics in the US
