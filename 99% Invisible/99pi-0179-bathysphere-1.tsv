EDL	00:01:16,032	00:01:18,080	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	The ocean is not our place

EDL	00:01:30,112	00:01:36,256	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	It's only humankind's incessant need to explore that drives us into such an unwelcoming invite
EDL	00:01:37,280	00:01:40,608	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	And since our bodies aren't built for it we must design thing
EDL	00:01:40,608	00:01:42,400	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	But allow us to explore this

EDL	00:01:43,936	00:01:44,960	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	And we have
EDL	00:01:45,472	00:01:47,008	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	That's our own Katie Mingle
EDL	00:01:47,008	00:01:52,896	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Alexander the Great is said to have descended into the ocean more than 2000 years ago in a glass Barrel
EDL	00:01:53,920	00:01:55,456	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	There are various paintings
EDL	00:01:55,456	00:01:55,968	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	This event
EDL	00:01:56,736	00:02:01,344	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	In one the great is being lowered into the ocean by a couple of men in a wooden boat
EDL	00:02:02,112	00:02:04,160	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	He's hunched inside his little Barrel
EDL	00:02:04,160	00:02:05,184	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Still wearing his
EDL	00:02:05,184	00:02:06,208	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Crown and robe
EDL	00:02:06,720	00:02:10,560	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	The guys in the boat looked to me like they're used to humoring his every whim
EDL	00:02:11,584	00:02:16,704	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	In some versions of the story Alexander the Great was not in a barrel but in a diving bell
EDL	00:02:17,472	00:02:19,776	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Diving Bells have been around for a long time
EDL	00:02:20,288	00:02:23,104	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Aristotle wrote about them around 300 BC
EDL	00:02:23,616	00:02:25,920	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	And they were often actual Bells
EDL	00:02:25,920	00:02:26,688	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Like from churches
EDL	00:02:28,736	00:02:32,320	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	To understand how one uses such a thing to Aid in an ocean dive
EDL	00:02:32,832	00:02:33,600	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Try this
EDL	00:02:33,600	00:02:34,624	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Quick experiment
EDL	00:02:36,416	00:02:37,696	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Fill up your sink with water
EDL	00:02:38,976	00:02:41,536	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	And push a cup open and down
EDL	00:02:41,536	00:02:42,816	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Into the water
EDL	00:02:42,816	00:02:44,352	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	You notice that the cop doesn't
EDL	00:02:44,352	00:02:45,376	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Fill up all the way
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:48,192	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	There'll be a pocket of breathable air on the inside
EDL	00:02:49,216	00:02:53,312	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Amazingly this works using giant church bells and the ocean to
EDL	00:02:54,592	00:02:56,384	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Diver's Cove lower about
EDL	00:02:56,384	00:02:59,200	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Into the ocean and use it as a kind of home base
EDL	00:02:59,968	00:03:03,296	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Swimming out and around searching for Sunken Treasure
EDL	00:03:03,296	00:03:05,344	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	And then popping back into the Bell
EDL	00:03:05,344	00:03:06,112	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	First few guys
EDL	00:03:07,392	00:03:09,184	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	But it wasn't a good solution
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:10,464	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	The air didn't last long
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:12,256	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	The bells were cumbersome
EDL	00:03:12,256	00:03:14,560	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	And the divers still couldn't go down very far
EDL	00:03:15,072	00:03:16,608	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Because of the pressure
EDL	00:03:17,120	00:03:21,728	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	The main obstacle to exploring the depths of the ocean has always been the pressure
EDL	00:03:24,032	00:03:24,544	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Bralette
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:25,824	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	200ft
EDL	00:03:26,336	00:03:28,128	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Your lungs collapse and you die
EDL	00:03:28,128	00:03:31,456	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	That's Jim Gould telling it like it is
EDL	00:03:31,456	00:03:33,248	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Professor biology
EDL	00:03:33,248	00:03:35,552	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Princeton and he's married to Carol gold
EDL	00:03:35,552	00:03:38,368	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Who will also be talking to you today I'm Carol Gould
EDL	00:03:38,880	00:03:40,160	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	I'm a science writer
EDL	00:03:40,160	00:03:44,256	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Sheen Jimmy written 10 books together they've been married for 45 years
EDL	00:03:44,768	00:03:46,816	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	This is how Jim talks about the
EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:47,840	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	The first time he met care
EDL	00:03:48,352	00:03:49,120	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	And
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:50,144	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	There she was
EDL	00:03:50,144	00:03:51,424	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	The person I've been looking for
EDL	00:03:51,424	00:03:51,936	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	All my life
EDL	00:03:54,496	00:03:56,032	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	I didn't take long from then
EDL	00:04:02,432	00:04:05,760	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	In the mid-1800s a naturalist named Edward Forbes
EDL	00:04:06,272	00:04:08,832	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Hypothesize that below 300 fathoms
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:10,624	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Or about 1800 ft
EDL	00:04:10,624	00:04:11,648	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	No life
EDL	00:04:11,648	00:04:12,416	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Exist
EDL	00:04:12,416	00:04:13,184	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	In the ocean
EDL	00:04:13,696	00:04:15,232	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	And people pretty much believed him
EDL	00:04:15,744	00:04:18,303	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Well the general thought was that
EDL	00:04:18,303	00:04:20,095	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	It was just common sense
EDL	00:04:20,095	00:04:21,375	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Nothing could live down there
EDL	00:04:22,399	00:04:24,447	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Because the deeper you get
EDL	00:04:24,447	00:04:25,215	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Pressure
EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:25,983	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Increases
EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:28,031	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	On the living tissues
EDL	00:04:29,055	00:04:31,359	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	And it gets darker and darker
EDL	00:04:31,359	00:04:33,407	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	And it just made sense to people
EDL	00:04:33,919	00:04:35,199	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	You know the way we are so
EDL	00:04:35,711	00:04:36,735	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Anthropocentric
EDL	00:04:37,247	00:04:39,807	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	If people can't live down there well
EDL	00:04:39,807	00:04:41,343	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Probably nothing else
EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:46,207	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	But these anthropocentric naysayers would soon be proven wrong
EDL	00:04:46,719	00:04:50,303	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Continents were about to be strung together with Telegraph wires
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:56,447	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Starting an 1858 nations were connected with extremely long wires
EDL	00:04:56,447	00:05:01,055	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Messages would travel great distances through cables that lay on the ocean floor
EDL	00:05:02,079	00:05:06,175	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	And in 1860 as the Mediterranean cable was raised for repair
EDL	00:05:06,175	00:05:07,967	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	I'm about 6000 feet
EDL	00:05:08,479	00:05:09,503	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Lo and behold
EDL	00:05:09,503	00:05:11,551	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Attached to the cable or Critters
EDL	00:05:12,063	00:05:13,087	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Mostly dead Critters
EDL	00:05:13,599	00:05:15,391	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	The critters that were once
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:16,159	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Alive
EDL	00:05:16,159	00:05:19,231	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	This discovery was much talked about in the Press
EDL	00:05:19,231	00:05:24,095	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	There was a life in the depths of the ocean and everyone wanted to know more about it
EDL	00:05:26,399	00:05:32,799	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	In 1872 the British royal Navy sent a modified warship called the HMS Challenger out on one of the
EDL	00:05:32,799	00:05:34,847	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	The first scientific expeditions
EDL	00:05:34,847	00:05:40,991	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	It was this big beautiful ship with sails it look like the kind of shape people hang paintings of and
EDL	00:05:40,991	00:05:42,527	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Old rustic pubs
EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:44,319	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Or get tattooed on their bicep
EDL	00:05:45,087	00:05:48,671	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	The scientists and sailors spent 4 years on this ship
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:53,791	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Studying the Earth's oceans trying especially understand the deepest
EDL	00:05:54,815	00:05:57,119	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	And they did things like put down Nets
EDL	00:05:57,631	00:05:59,167	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Very deep into the water
EDL	00:05:59,935	00:06:01,471	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	And go along
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:02,239	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Hoping
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:04,031	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	But the Nets would catch something
EDL	00:06:04,031	00:06:05,055	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	It was down there
EDL	00:06:05,055	00:06:08,639	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	But just like our bodies can't survive the pressure at Great depths
EDL	00:06:09,151	00:06:13,503	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Fish that live at the bottom of the ocean aren't made to live at the top
EDL	00:06:13,503	00:06:14,527	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	So as they come up
EDL	00:06:15,039	00:06:17,343	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	They they basically crystallizing fracture
EDL	00:06:18,111	00:06:19,647	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	So every cell
EDL	00:06:21,695	00:06:23,487	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	MicroCell explosion what you have is a bag of
EDL	00:06:24,511	00:06:28,095	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Listening to some Sailors were pulling up giant Netflix
EDL	00:06:28,095	00:06:29,119	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Bloated

EDL	00:06:30,143	00:06:36,543	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Still they managed to gather a bunch of specimen but they saved in jars full of pickling alcohol as they sale
EDL	00:06:36,543	00:06:37,311	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Around the world
EDL	00:06:37,823	00:06:41,151	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	In the end they traveled almost 70000 nautical miles
EDL	00:06:41,919	00:06:43,711	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Dredging in pickling
EDL	00:06:43,711	00:06:44,735	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	It was hard work
EDL	00:06:44,735	00:06:46,527	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	It was really an arduous
EDL	00:06:47,039	00:06:49,087	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Trip because they started out with
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:50,367	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	How many sailors
EDL	00:06:50,367	00:06:54,207	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Jump started with 214 and ended with 144
EDL	00:06:54,975	00:06:59,583	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Two men went insane to drowned one committed suicide and several deserted
EDL	00:06:59,583	00:07:05,983	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	But the Challenger Expedition did catalog around 4000 new species and took depth measurement that hunger
EDL	00:07:05,983	00:07:09,823	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Locations all over the ocean using a weighted string
EDL	00:07:09,823	00:07:16,223	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	On March 23rd 1875 at station number 225 located in the Southwest Pacific

EDL	00:07:18,783	00:07:22,367	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	11 Caster weighted string over the side of the ship
EDL	00:07:22,367	00:07:23,903	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	And it just kept dropping
EDL	00:07:24,671	00:07:25,695	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Dropping
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:28,511	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Dropping
EDL	00:07:29,023	00:07:30,047	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	10000 feet

EDL	00:07:31,071	00:07:33,887	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	30000
EDL	00:07:33,887	00:07:40,287	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	They had dropped their weight is the Mariana Trench and discovered what is still the deepest known place
EDL	00:07:40,287	00:07:41,567	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	On the ocean floor
EDL	00:07:43,871	00:07:46,431	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	But despite the challenges many accomplishments
EDL	00:07:46,431	00:07:47,711	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Still no one had
EDL	00:07:47,711	00:07:50,271	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Actually been very deep in the ocean
EDL	00:07:50,271	00:07:54,623	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Been among the living creatures to see them alive in their natural habitat
EDL	00:07:55,391	00:07:57,951	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	There were various attempts of diving suits over the years
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:08:01,279	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	The picture the aesthetic range of the suits
EDL	00:08:01,791	00:08:07,935	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Start with guy in a barrel with arm holes and get to Giant ridiculous Spaceman robot suit
EDL	00:08:08,447	00:08:12,287	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	You look back at these old suits if you seen the movie Forbidden Planet
EDL	00:08:12,799	00:08:13,823	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	You've seen
EDL	00:08:13,823	00:08:15,871	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Asserts Robby the Robot looks exactly
EDL	00:08:16,383	00:08:17,407	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Like one of these
EDL	00:08:17,407	00:08:20,223	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	What's the Michelin Man looks a lot like these suits
EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:23,039	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	They were incredibly heavy and cumbersome
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:24,319	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	You couldn't swim in them
EDL	00:08:24,319	00:08:27,135	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	He had to get dried up to the surface by boat
EDL	00:08:27,647	00:08:31,487	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	And they all had tubes that stretched up to the surface for oxygen
EDL	00:08:31,487	00:08:37,631	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Using one of these suits the Navy had said the man 563 feet under the surface of a freshwater lake
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:42,239	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	When do the submarines have been as deep as 383 ft in the ocean
EDL	00:08:42,751	00:08:44,287	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Brands of the 1920s
EDL	00:08:44,287	00:08:46,335	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	No one had gone further than that
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:48,383	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	And then came a scientist
EDL	00:08:48,383	00:08:49,663	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Named William Beebe
EDL	00:08:52,735	00:08:59,135	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	William Beebe was a respected ornithologist and an exceedingly Charming character who got around by bicycle
EDL	00:08:59,135	00:09:02,975	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Spend his time gazing into the skies and writing about birds
EDL	00:09:03,487	00:09:05,279	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Titles of his books include
EDL	00:09:05,279	00:09:07,327	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	The bird its form and function
EDL	00:09:07,839	00:09:12,191	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Two bird lovers in Mexico and a monograph of pheasants
EDL	00:09:12,191	00:09:13,727	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	He really love birds
EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:15,519	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	And then in the 1920s
EDL	00:09:15,519	00:09:17,055	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Working near the coast
EDL	00:09:17,055	00:09:19,103	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	William Beebe turn his attention
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:20,127	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	To the ocean
EDL	00:09:20,127	00:09:20,639	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	He would
EDL	00:09:21,151	00:09:22,687	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Look down in the water
EDL	00:09:22,687	00:09:23,199	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	And just
EDL	00:09:23,711	00:09:25,759	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	10 hours wondering what was down there
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:27,295	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	And
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:29,855	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	So then he started trying to think
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:30,879	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	And plan
EDL	00:09:30,879	00:09:31,903	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Awake
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:32,927	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Could get him down there
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:38,303	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	What is BB parted ways to go deep he couldn't seem to think outside the cylinder
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:40,863	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Which was the shape of pre-existing submarines
EDL	00:09:41,887	00:09:44,447	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Buy babies time of submarines could go down about
EDL	00:09:44,447	00:09:45,215	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	250
EDL	00:09:45,215	00:09:46,239	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	He went down further
EDL	00:09:46,751	00:09:47,519	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Collapsed
EDL	00:09:48,287	00:09:49,823	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Crush the pressure outside
EDL	00:09:51,103	00:09:52,895	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	I flattened everything inside
EDL	00:09:53,407	00:09:54,943	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	The result is you had a metal pan cake
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:10:02,367	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	And then in 1928 a young engineer named Otis Barton got in touch with baby and told him
EDL	00:10:02,367	00:10:04,671	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Pedego is deep as he wanted to go
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:06,975	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Cylinder was never going to work
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:09,279	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	The design had to be in the shape
EDL	00:10:09,279	00:10:10,559	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Of a sphere
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:11,327	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Even though
EDL	00:10:11,839	00:10:12,607	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	The ocean
EDL	00:10:13,887	00:10:16,191	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Brings on more and more pressure
EDL	00:10:16,191	00:10:17,215	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	The deeper you go
EDL	00:10:18,239	00:10:19,263	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	That pressure
EDL	00:10:19,263	00:10:20,543	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	If you're innosphere
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:23,615	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Is present equally on every
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:25,663	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Square inch of the spear
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:30,527	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Who does Martin told BBC help him design and engineer this new submersible
EDL	00:10:30,527	00:10:34,111	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	As long as he was allowed to accompany Bebe on all of the trip
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:36,159	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	The sphere made into the sea
EDL	00:10:36,159	00:10:42,559	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Which was a pretty crazy thing for Barton to want considering what eight tiny uncomfortable submersible he
EDL	00:10:42,559	00:10:43,327	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	He was about to make
EDL	00:10:43,839	00:10:45,375	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	The final design was about
EDL	00:10:45,375	00:10:47,423	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	4 1/2 ft in diameter
EDL	00:10:47,423	00:10:51,519	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	And there wasn't a bench or even a level floor inside the bathroom
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:53,823	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	I sat on this horrible cold
EDL	00:10:53,823	00:10:55,103	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Wet concave
EDL	00:10:55,615	00:10:56,127	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Floor
EDL	00:10:56,639	00:10:58,175	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	The kind of pushed back together
EDL	00:10:58,175	00:10:59,967	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	And they weren't really great friends
EDL	00:10:59,967	00:11:01,503	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Either
EDL	00:11:02,527	00:11:05,343	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	The sphere was made of steel and had two windows
EDL	00:11:05,343	00:11:06,367	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Fix you
EDL	00:11:06,367	00:11:07,135	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Quartz
EDL	00:11:07,135	00:11:08,159	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Provided
EDL	00:11:08,159	00:11:09,951	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Extremely Clear View into the water
EDL	00:11:10,975	00:11:12,511	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	It also had a small hat
EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:13,279	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Enter through
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:14,559	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	They called it
EDL	00:11:14,559	00:11:15,071	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	The baathist
EDL	00:11:16,095	00:11:17,887	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Bath is being the Greek word
EDL	00:11:17,887	00:11:18,911	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Pradeep
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:25,055	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	William Beebe set up a science station on nonsuch island in Bermuda and they began doing Dives in the bathysphere
EDL	00:11:25,567	00:11:31,967	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	The submersible couldn't move on its own so I had to be lowered on a cable off of a boat and then plant drive to
EDL	00:11:31,967	00:11:35,295	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	In retrospect the whole thing seems
EDL	00:11:35,295	00:11:38,111	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Extremely low Tech well it was 1930
EDL	00:11:38,111	00:11:41,183	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	And their high-tech is now our very very low-tech
EDL	00:11:41,695	00:11:48,095	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Inside the sphere were some canisters of oxygen and some trays of chemicals that's soaked up the CO2 they were
EDL	00:11:48,095	00:11:48,607	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Breathing out
EDL	00:11:49,375	00:11:51,167	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	It was cramped and humid in there
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:56,543	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Condensation pooled on the floor and Otis Barton was often seasick
EDL	00:11:58,079	00:12:00,639	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	They circulated the air with
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:04,223	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Onlyfans
EDL	00:12:04,223	00:12:04,991	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Back and forth
EDL	00:12:05,759	00:12:08,063	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	And that was the height of comfort
EDL	00:12:08,063	00:12:10,111	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	They were literally just Fanning themselves
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:12,927	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Yep
EDL	00:12:12,927	00:12:17,791	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	It wasn't comfortable but the sphere did completely Shield them from the outside pressure
EDL	00:12:17,791	00:12:23,935	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	They didn't have to worry about the bends or decompression sickness that divers can experience when it's ending too quickly
EDL	00:12:24,447	00:12:28,031	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	The thing that really scared them with the idea of a leek
EDL	00:12:28,031	00:12:30,591	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Because if there were even a pinhole
EDL	00:12:30,591	00:12:31,359	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Leak
EDL	00:12:31,359	00:12:32,127	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	A toastie
EDL	00:12:32,127	00:12:32,895	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Pressures
EDL	00:12:32,895	00:12:34,943	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	A jet of water would come in
EDL	00:12:34,943	00:12:36,991	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	At such a high rate of
EDL	00:12:37,503	00:12:38,527	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Pressure speed
EDL	00:12:39,039	00:12:40,575	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	That it would just be like being shot
EDL	00:12:40,575	00:12:44,415	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	The bullet if the two men can make it safely into the ocean's depths
EDL	00:12:44,415	00:12:48,255	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	They would be able to see out into the dark ocean using a spotlight
EDL	00:12:49,023	00:12:54,399	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	The Vessel also have a telephone they could use to talk to the people in the boat above them
EDL	00:12:54,399	00:12:58,495	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	Their first dive on May 27th 1930 was just 45 ft down
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:13:03,103	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	But overtime Bebe & Barton started doing deeper and deeper Dives in the bathroom
EDL	00:13:04,127	00:13:05,919	| 99pi-0179-bathysphere-1 |	When they steal them in it was in
