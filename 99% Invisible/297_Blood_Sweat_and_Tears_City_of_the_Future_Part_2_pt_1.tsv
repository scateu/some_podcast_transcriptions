EDL	00:20:30,847	00:20:36,479	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	But eventually a massive renewal began which included tearing down many of the original high rise
EDL	00:20:36,479	00:20:36,991	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	Apartment building
EDL	00:20:38,015	00:20:38,527	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	It was decided

EDL	00:20:42,879	00:20:45,439	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	And so they started taking down building
EDL	00:20:45,439	00:20:46,975	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	But not all at once
EDL	00:20:46,975	00:20:49,279	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	Buildings came down over about 15 years

EDL	00:20:54,911	00:20:59,519	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	And the buildings weren't dynamited like the infamous housing project pruitt-igoe in St Louis
EDL	00:21:00,287	00:21:06,687	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	They were taking apart Story by story to avoid the imagery and metaphor of a neighborhood being blown up and for sale

EDL	00:21:07,455	00:21:10,271	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	Because they weren't just going to tear down the belmermere
EDL	00:21:10,271	00:21:12,063	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	They were going to redesign it
EDL	00:21:12,063	00:21:12,831	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	Make it better
EDL	00:21:13,343	00:21:14,879	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	And that's what they did

EDL	00:21:23,072	00:21:26,656	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	Eventually a lot of the high-rises were replaced with smaller building

EDL	00:29:40,992	00:29:41,760	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	Common areas

EDL	00:30:23,232	00:30:27,072	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	And sustainability like there's less waste when people you know

EDL	00:30:29,632	00:30:31,680	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	What a big driver is affordability
EDL	00:30:32,448	00:30:38,848	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	Developers often add premium materials and fixtures to justify higher prices and Baton turn prices

EDL	00:30:43,456	00:30:45,504	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	About how and when to finish their homes
EDL	00:30:46,016	00:30:48,576	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	Presidents who want something more luxurious can have that
EDL	00:30:48,576	00:30:50,368	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	But others can pick more Spartan Ops
EDL	00:30:51,136	00:30:56,768	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	Or just you know add incrementally as they have the budget to do it starting with the basics and working the right from there
EDL	00:30:57,280	00:30:58,048	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	So causes mange
EDL	00:30:58,560	00:30:59,840	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	How much more affordable are these
EDL	00:31:01,632	00:31:02,912	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	From what I read
EDL	00:31:02,912	00:31:04,960	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	Those bilmar units were put on the market
EDL	00:31:04,960	00:31:08,288	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	Around 1200 Euros per square meter which is
EDL	00:31:08,288	00:31:09,568	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	Cheap for the Netherlands
EDL	00:31:10,080	00:31:13,152	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	And really cheap compared to Amsterdam where places can cause
EDL	00:31:13,152	00:31:13,920	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	Multiple times.
EDL	00:31:14,688	00:31:16,224	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	In this kind of DIY housing
EDL	00:31:16,736	00:31:18,528	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	This is something that is actually a larger trend
EDL	00:31:20,320	00:31:24,160	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	Absolutely there's a British nonprofit for example called naked house
EDL	00:31:24,672	00:31:26,464	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	Which is also working on strip down home
EDL	00:31:27,232	00:31:32,864	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	They clean their houses will actually go for 30 to 40% less than other homes of similar sizes on the market
EDL	00:31:32,864	00:31:35,168	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	So yeah that's a pretty huge potential saving
EDL	00:31:35,936	00:31:38,752	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	And part of their design strategy is to build in some double Heights
EDL	00:31:39,520	00:31:41,824	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	The idea being that people can build them out over
EDL	00:31:41,824	00:31:42,336	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	Time
EDL	00:31:42,848	00:31:44,640	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	And traditional floor space
EDL	00:31:44,640	00:31:45,408	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	When they need room decor
EDL	00:31:46,432	00:31:47,968	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	So you move in and
EDL	00:31:47,968	00:31:48,992	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	Your bottom floor is
EDL	00:31:50,272	00:31:51,808	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	Yeah
EDL	00:31:52,320	00:31:58,720	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	Yeah you get this kind of mezzanine level so you got this nice I want space but if you really need that floor space you can add the floor joists easily and it
EDL	00:31:58,720	00:32:00,256	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	Turn all outfit it's that easy
EDL	00:32:01,792	00:32:04,864	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	Reminds me of the story we did into a
EDL	00:32:05,376	00:32:05,888	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	Half a house
EDL	00:32:06,400	00:32:07,424	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	That we did about a year ago
EDL	00:32:07,936	00:32:09,984	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	Yeah exactly element all
EDL	00:32:09,984	00:32:10,752	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	As used
EDL	00:32:10,752	00:32:12,288	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	A similar approach in Chile
EDL	00:32:12,288	00:32:14,080	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	Basically they frame and roof
EDL	00:32:14,592	00:32:16,128	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	The house on both sides
EDL	00:32:16,128	00:32:18,688	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	But they only enclose one side with exterior wall
EDL	00:32:19,712	00:32:24,832	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	The open half can then be built into overtime and even those faces that are initially enclosed
EDL	00:32:24,832	00:32:26,112	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	Are there bones
EDL	00:32:26,624	00:32:27,904	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	They're missing
EDL	00:32:27,904	00:32:31,744	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	Basically everything except for the kitchen sink on painted drywall
EDL	00:32:31,744	00:32:33,536	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	Unfinished floors no appliances
EDL	00:32:34,304	00:32:35,840	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	I think there's a real intellectual
EDL	00:32:35,840	00:32:37,120	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	Appeal to this kind of approach
EDL	00:32:37,632	00:32:40,448	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	But it's definitely raised some questions and empiricism
EDL	00:32:40,448	00:32:41,216	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	2
EDL	00:32:41,216	00:32:44,032	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	It has in some of those are very legitimate
EDL	00:32:45,056	00:32:46,592	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	One of the most common is that
EDL	00:32:46,592	00:32:48,640	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	To make the place livable in the first place
EDL	00:32:49,152	00:32:50,688	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	DIY home buyer will have
EDL	00:32:50,688	00:32:51,968	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	Refuse them their upfront savings
EDL	00:32:52,480	00:32:53,760	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	To purchase materials database

EDL	00:32:57,088	00:32:59,136	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	Because they can't tap into the same economies ask
EDL	00:32:59,648	00:33:01,184	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	Fat Developers
EDL	00:33:02,464	00:33:04,256	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	Pause some people of course
EDL	00:33:04,256	00:33:06,816	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	Don't have the skills or the time to work on their own
EDL	00:33:07,840	00:33:14,240	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	But you don't for people with more time than money or would you experience building things these kinds of DIY
EDL	00:33:14,240	00:33:16,544	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	Why options can really make housing more accessible
EDL	00:33:17,312	00:33:18,848	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	They give people choices to
EDL	00:33:20,128	00:33:21,920	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	Build things out that they want

EDL	00:33:23,968	00:33:25,248	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	In this exact
EDL	00:33:25,248	00:33:26,272	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	Opposite approach
EDL	00:33:26,272	00:33:27,040	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	Set the modernist
EDL	00:33:27,808	00:33:28,832	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	Originally doing what

EDL	00:33:32,672	00:33:34,464	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	Their version of egalitarian
EDL	00:33:34,464	00:33:36,000	| 297_Blood_Sweat_and_Tears_City_of_the_Future_Part_2_pt_1 |	Yeah I mean
