EDL	00:11:13,279	00:11:14,047	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Somehow
EDL	00:11:14,047	00:11:15,327	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Everyone knew about the automat

EDL	00:11:25,567	00:11:26,591	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	In Philadelphia
EDL	00:11:26,591	00:11:31,711	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	For a lot of people they never could have imagined that horn & hardart was ever going to disa
EDL	00:11:31,711	00:11:34,015	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	The pr because it was such a big part of the fabric

EDL	00:11:43,743	00:11:48,863	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	I think maybe Horn & hardart got a little too comfortable and they couldn't imagine what was about to happen
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:50,911	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	What happened to the automat
EDL	00:11:51,423	00:11:52,959	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Was the story of the American city
EDL	00:11:53,727	00:11:55,775	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	White flight and mass migration to the suburbs

EDL	00:11:58,847	00:11:59,871	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	A new lifestyle
EDL	00:12:00,639	00:12:01,663	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	And of course
EDL	00:12:01,663	00:12:03,199	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	This changed how people ate
EDL	00:12:03,711	00:12:08,831	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	It became very trendy for women to be stay-at-home mothers
EDL	00:12:08,831	00:12:10,623	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Taking care of new homes

EDL	00:12:22,143	00:12:24,703	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	They transformed into 5-day week
EDL	00:12:24,703	00:12:25,727	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	One meal a day off
EDL	00:12:27,263	00:12:30,847	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	And the people who went out to eat for that one meal didn't want
EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:32,127	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Send steaks anymore
EDL	00:12:32,639	00:12:34,687	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	You're on the go now there was fast food
EDL	00:12:35,199	00:12:36,223	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Do you want to sit
EDL	00:12:36,223	00:12:40,575	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	You wanted white tablecloths and attentive waiter is in fancier food
EDL	00:12:40,575	00:12:41,855	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Good that you couldn't cook at home
EDL	00:12:42,367	00:12:43,903	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	People have more money to spend
EDL	00:12:43,903	00:12:46,975	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	They were more inclined to have maybe fewer meals out
EDL	00:12:46,975	00:12:47,743	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	But to have nicer
EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:51,327	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Horn & Hardart's we're getting old
EDL	00:12:51,327	00:12:52,607	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	I'm looking kind of bedraggled
EDL	00:12:53,375	00:12:59,519	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Customers and City governments were investing less and less in the increasingly neglected inner cities around
EDL	00:13:00,287	00:13:01,311	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	And so
EDL	00:13:01,311	00:13:03,103	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Horn & hardart launches their big
EDL	00:13:03,103	00:13:04,383	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Comeback ad campaign
EDL	00:13:05,151	00:13:05,919	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	In which
EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:08,223	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	They dig in their heels and refuse to change it all
EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:11,295	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	If you want something nice to look at when you eat at Horn & hardart
EDL	00:13:12,575	00:13:14,367	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	We suggest you keep an eye on your plate
EDL	00:13:15,391	00:13:18,207	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	The campaign was called it's not fancy but it's good
EDL	00:13:18,719	00:13:21,023	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Although eventually it wasn't even that good
EDL	00:13:21,023	00:13:23,583	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Horn & hardart got less popular
EDL	00:13:23,583	00:13:25,887	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	The food turnover wasn't as high
EDL	00:13:25,887	00:13:28,191	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	So it wasn't as fresh
EDL	00:13:28,191	00:13:30,751	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	There was something going on simultaneous
EDL	00:13:30,751	00:13:32,543	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	FYE which was that
EDL	00:13:32,543	00:13:34,079	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	The horns in the heart
EDL	00:13:34,079	00:13:35,615	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	We're being pushed out of the company
EDL	00:13:36,127	00:13:39,199	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	And the new people who weren't automat people they were fast food
EDL	00:13:39,967	00:13:44,319	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	The new heads of Horn & hardart realize that their greatest asset was not their restaurants
EDL	00:13:44,831	00:13:45,599	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Buckeye real estate
EDL	00:13:46,367	00:13:50,207	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	So the really prime horn & hardart locations were franchised in too fast
EDL	00:13:50,207	00:13:50,719	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Food restaurant
EDL	00:13:51,487	00:13:52,255	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	They were
EDL	00:13:52,255	00:13:53,023	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	The first
EDL	00:13:53,023	00:13:56,095	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Burger King Arby's franchises in Manhattan
EDL	00:13:56,863	00:13:59,167	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	The automat lasted the better part of a century
EDL	00:13:59,679	00:14:00,703	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Which is pretty incredible
EDL	00:14:02,239	00:14:04,031	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Bless automat in New York
EDL	00:14:04,031	00:14:04,799	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Triathlon
EDL	00:14:05,311	00:14:06,335	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	He much is a gimmick
EDL	00:14:06,335	00:14:07,359	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Finally close
EDL	00:14:07,359	00:14:08,383	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	In 1991
EDL	00:14:09,151	00:14:10,943	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	I will admit that where I felt
EDL	00:14:10,943	00:14:12,223	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Only disdain for
EDL	00:14:12,991	00:14:15,295	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	I was totally taken in by the idea of the automat
EDL	00:14:15,807	00:14:17,087	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Like 100%
EDL	00:14:17,087	00:14:22,207	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Sign me up for this place that is both highbrow and lowbrow or I can even a beautiful Art Deco dining room
EDL	00:14:22,207	00:14:23,999	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	As many slices of pie as I want without judgment
EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:28,095	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Enter some of that is just baseless nostalgia
EDL	00:14:28,095	00:14:29,375	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	And a genuine love of art deco
EDL	00:14:30,399	00:14:31,167	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	But
EDL	00:14:31,167	00:14:33,727	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	I think there's a reason Horn & hardart was in business
EDL	00:14:34,239	00:14:35,519	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	A hundred years
EDL	00:14:36,287	00:14:37,055	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	I think it's
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:38,847	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Because it was always a very Human Experience
EDL	00:14:40,127	00:14:41,407	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	It wasn't to go container
EDL	00:14:41,919	00:14:43,455	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	It was metal flatware and
EDL	00:14:43,455	00:14:43,967	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	China
EDL	00:14:44,479	00:14:46,271	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Customer stayed in the dining room to eat
EDL	00:14:46,783	00:14:48,575	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	It was always full of people hanging out
EDL	00:14:49,343	00:14:53,695	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	An ultimately humans seem to Crave some kind of interaction when they go out to eat
EDL	00:14:54,463	00:14:55,231	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Even today
EDL	00:14:55,999	00:14:59,583	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	People aren't necessarily looking for an all robot kind of experience
EDL	00:15:00,095	00:15:02,143	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Me when they walk in they want it to be
EDL	00:15:02,143	00:15:04,447	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Easy and convenient and they want to
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:07,775	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	If they have an issue be able to communicate to someone who can take care of them
EDL	00:15:08,287	00:15:09,567	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	This is Gwyneth Borden

EDL	00:15:16,479	00:15:20,831	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	2015 was the first year in the u.s. when the Department of Commerce was tracking it
EDL	00:15:20,831	00:15:22,879	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	People spend more money on dining out food then groceries
EDL	00:15:23,391	00:15:24,927	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	And increasingly what we have
EDL	00:15:24,927	00:15:25,951	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Scene is food is
EDL	00:15:26,463	00:15:27,743	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	The modern form of entertainment
EDL	00:15:28,255	00:15:29,535	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Demand for restaurants
EDL	00:15:29,535	00:15:32,607	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Up which means there's a national shortage of restaurant workers
EDL	00:15:33,631	00:15:36,447	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Especially in expensive cities like San Francisco
EDL	00:15:36,447	00:15:40,799	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	With the median cost of a one-bedroom apartment is now $3,700 a month
EDL	00:15:41,311	00:15:43,615	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	How do you pay for that while working in a restaurant
EDL	00:15:43,615	00:15:45,407	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Labor costs overall risen
EDL	00:15:45,407	00:15:47,711	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	It's hard to find people to work in farming
EDL	00:15:47,711	00:15:49,247	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Are the people working restaurants
EDL	00:15:49,247	00:15:50,271	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Do you have to pay people more
EDL	00:15:50,783	00:15:53,087	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	The restaurant have been trying to get by with fewer people
EDL	00:15:53,599	00:15:56,415	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	With self ordering screens or counter service
EDL	00:15:56,415	00:15:57,695	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Free describe a number for your table
EDL	00:15:58,463	00:16:00,255	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	But this can be taken too far
EDL	00:16:00,255	00:16:04,351	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	What we know for fact is that people will eat it on mediocre restaurant
EDL	00:16:04,351	00:16:06,143	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	For food but won't accept bad service
EDL	00:16:06,911	00:16:09,215	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	If you look at Yelp or TripAdvisor or whatever

EDL	00:16:11,263	00:16:13,567	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Service is a really important factor
EDL	00:16:13,567	00:16:15,615	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	You know in General yet people write things about

EDL	00:16:17,151	00:16:19,199	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	But it was usually drives them to
EDL	00:16:19,199	00:16:19,967	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	To do that
EDL	00:16:19,967	00:16:20,735	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	That is
EDL	00:16:20,735	00:16:22,527	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	A bad experience where they feel like they were not
EDL	00:16:23,807	00:16:26,367	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	So rather than hiding the workers in the back
EDL	00:16:26,367	00:16:27,903	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Automating the front of the house
EDL	00:16:27,903	00:16:29,439	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Like Itza or the automat

EDL	00:21:55,840	00:21:57,888	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Because food is he generally static
EDL	00:21:57,888	00:22:00,192	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Then when you subjected to the Hot Lights of a

EDL	00:22:16,576	00:22:19,392	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Well after photography it was widely adopted
EDL	00:22:19,392	00:22:23,744	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Advertisers in magazines and newspapers relied heavily on illustration

EDL	00:29:45,344	00:29:47,136	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Does President there alluringly
EDL	00:29:47,648	00:29:48,672	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Men take the crown off
EDL	00:29:55,328	00:29:58,656	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Top of the chicken
EDL	00:29:58,656	00:30:00,448	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Then the ground goes back on again
EDL	00:30:07,104	00:30:09,408	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	It took them all day to film this sandwich
EDL	00:30:09,920	00:30:12,224	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	The whole shoot precisely orchestrated
EDL	00:30:12,224	00:30:14,016	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Relying on highly technical tool
EDL	00:30:15,040	00:30:19,392	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Downstairs in macguffins proper I'm there all sorts of rig sitting in storage
EDL	00:30:19,392	00:30:21,184	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	A lot like the ones that you develop
EDL	00:30:21,696	00:30:23,744	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	But these are way more high-tech
EDL	00:30:24,512	00:30:26,304	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Riggers today use lasers
EDL	00:30:26,304	00:30:28,352	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	And sensors and pre-programmed Motors
EDL	00:30:28,864	00:30:30,912	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	And depending on the shot or the rig
EDL	00:30:30,912	00:30:32,704	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	There can be some intense physics
EDL	00:30:32,704	00:30:33,984	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	To take into account
EDL	00:30:33,984	00:30:40,384	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Like if you're trying to slice an onion into while it's flying through the air we break down the elements
EDL	00:30:40,384	00:30:42,688	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Onion to a certain height
EDL	00:30:42,688	00:30:44,224	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	This is Anthony the robber
EDL	00:30:44,224	00:30:45,504	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	He's a special effects
EDL	00:30:45,504	00:30:46,784	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Technician at MacGuffin films
EDL	00:30:47,296	00:30:49,856	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	And he designed a special rig just to get this
EDL	00:30:49,856	00:30:56,256	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Shotgun Dan's computer-controlled so when the onions in the right spot these two sharp knives come through split the onion
EDL	00:30:56,256	00:30:56,768	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Leave you with
EDL	00:30:57,280	00:30:58,304	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Sliced in the middle
EDL	00:30:58,304	00:31:01,376	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	And slices of onion artfully tumbling across a table
EDL	00:31:01,888	00:31:02,656	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Classic rock shop
EDL	00:31:03,168	00:31:06,752	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	But Wellbutrin may have introduced Rigs in action 2 tabletop
EDL	00:31:06,752	00:31:09,056	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Some directors like macguffins Nick few.
EDL	00:31:09,568	00:31:11,104	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	I'm trying to get away from you
EDL	00:31:11,104	00:31:12,384	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Fantastical Dreamscape
EDL	00:31:12,384	00:31:13,664	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Pics of flying shrimp
EDL	00:31:13,664	00:31:14,432	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	And oranges
EDL	00:31:14,432	00:31:20,832	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	I think that's a little bit of an older point of view for next few ghosts at the idealized images of food that be
EDL	00:31:20,832	00:31:22,112	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Tried to bring to his ass
EDL	00:31:22,112	00:31:25,952	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Just don't cut it in a world that's now totally saturated with food poor
EDL	00:31:26,464	00:31:31,840	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Well Butrans commercials often zoomed-in so close to food that you couldn't see the space around it
EDL	00:31:31,840	00:31:37,472	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Tabletop directors like people start now frame there food in the space that you might see out in the world
EDL	00:31:37,472	00:31:39,008	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Like at a restaurant or barbecue
EDL	00:31:39,520	00:31:43,360	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	You know when you dig into a lasagna do you want the sauce to go all over the place
EDL	00:31:43,360	00:31:45,920	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	We need to taco stuff going to fall out yet so let's shoot
EDL	00:31:46,944	00:31:48,480	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Let it the flavors mix
EDL	00:31:48,992	00:31:49,760	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	It's all right so tasty
EDL	00:31:51,552	00:31:53,344	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	But the thing to remember is this
EDL	00:31:53,856	00:31:55,392	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	On the set of a food commercial
EDL	00:31:55,392	00:31:55,904	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Everything
EDL	00:31:56,416	00:31:57,440	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Everything
EDL	00:31:57,440	00:31:59,232	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Is highly orchestrated and contrived
EDL	00:31:59,744	00:32:01,792	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Even if the ultimate effect feel somewhat.
EDL	00:32:02,304	00:32:07,936	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Because a 30-second TV spot by a firm like Magoffin can cost literally hundreds of thousands of dollars
EDL	00:32:08,448	00:32:11,008	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Who's got to do one thing to make it all worthwhile
EDL	00:32:11,776	00:32:12,800	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Sell a lot of food
EDL	00:32:13,312	00:32:15,872	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	I would say the number one rule
EDL	00:32:16,384	00:32:21,248	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	In food advertising is that the first taste is always with the eyes
EDL	00:32:22,784	00:32:24,832	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	So you trying to create a shot
EDL	00:32:24,832	00:32:26,368	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	That makes somebody's
EDL	00:32:27,904	00:32:29,696	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	This is Terry O'Reilly again
EDL	00:32:29,696	00:32:32,768	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	And he's fascinated by the links people go to sell something
EDL	00:32:33,280	00:32:36,608	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	He tells a story about working on commercial for a hamburger company
EDL	00:32:36,608	00:32:38,912	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	And watching an actor do take after take
EDL	00:32:39,424	00:32:41,216	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Biting into a hamburger
EDL	00:32:41,216	00:32:43,520	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	And I'm gazing into a camera with a lookup
EDL	00:32:43,520	00:32:45,568	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Total satisfaction on his face
EDL	00:32:45,568	00:32:47,104	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Then you cut and then there's this
EDL	00:32:49,152	00:32:54,272	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Right beside the actor then they just spit it right into the pale you know cut
EDL	00:32:54,272	00:32:59,392	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Edit and you have any watch that happened 40 times are 30 * 1/20 and it's so hilarious to me
EDL	00:32:59,904	00:33:01,440	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	Just the mechanics

EDL	00:33:02,464	00:33:06,560	| 01_356_The_Automat_pt01 |	The illusion and the reality of creating if that's exactly it in a nutshell
