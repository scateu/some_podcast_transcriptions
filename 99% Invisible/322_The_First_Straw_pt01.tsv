EDL	00:02:44,352	00:02:46,400	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	You hear the number 500 million
EDL	00:02:46,400	00:02:46,912	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Floating around
EDL	00:02:47,424	00:02:50,752	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Apparently that number came not from a rigorous study
EDL	00:02:50,752	00:02:53,568	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	But from a precocious 9 year old science project

EDL	00:03:27,872	00:03:28,896	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Because he says
EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:31,712	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	That when you zoom out from the controversies of today
EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:32,992	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	And look at the iPhone

EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:41,952	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Tell me about some of those bigger things that emerged when you looked at the history of plastic
EDL	00:03:42,464	00:03:47,584	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	You know I used to do this quite a bit like just take some little object and just
EDL	00:03:47,584	00:03:49,376	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Trace its history you know you can look up
EDL	00:03:49,376	00:03:50,912	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	The patents on Google and you can
EDL	00:03:51,424	00:03:55,520	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Search around for another company is that made it and you can see it
EDL	00:03:55,520	00:04:00,640	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Technical Evolution you know you can just look at it like the way you would look at the development of any

EDL	00:04:01,664	00:04:02,944	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	But the thing I was soaked
EDL	00:04:02,944	00:04:04,736	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Crazy about the straw

EDL	00:04:10,368	00:04:11,648	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	In the way that the
EDL	00:04:11,648	00:04:12,672	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	The country worked
EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:19,583	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	The straw is there for the invention of American industrialism for Organization for Public Health

EDL	00:04:23,935	00:04:27,007	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	And now of course the culture works like it's there for all of them
EDL	00:04:28,287	00:04:30,335	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	And to tell me where it all began
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:33,407	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Did someone invented the straw or was it just always there
EDL	00:04:33,919	00:04:35,711	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	So you know there's even like
EDL	00:04:36,223	00:04:37,247	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Scientific studies
EDL	00:04:37,247	00:04:38,527	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	The show that orangutan

EDL	00:04:46,463	00:04:49,023	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	But in nineteenth-century America
EDL	00:04:49,023	00:04:51,071	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	They see the straw with Rye
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:52,095	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Literally no grass.
EDL	00:04:53,375	00:04:54,399	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	This hollow tube
EDL	00:04:54,399	00:04:55,679	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	And you know you dry it
EDL	00:04:55,679	00:04:58,495	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Cut it into shape and that's what what happens that was the straw

EDL	00:05:00,543	00:05:03,103	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Around this time they're also straws made out of more durable
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:05,151	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Like metal
EDL	00:05:05,151	00:05:05,663	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Glass
EDL	00:05:06,175	00:05:06,943	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	But then
EDL	00:05:06,943	00:05:09,759	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Along Comes this guy
EDL	00:05:09,759	00:05:12,831	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	1888 Marvin Stone
EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:15,391	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	He creates what was then called the artificial straw
EDL	00:05:16,159	00:05:20,255	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Any artificial straw is basically paper dipped in some kind of wax
EDL	00:05:20,255	00:05:21,023	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	C substance
EDL	00:05:21,023	00:05:21,535	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Paraffin
EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:24,607	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	And that becomes this new standard
EDL	00:05:24,607	00:05:27,935	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	It wasn't just that it was artificial is also that it was
EDL	00:05:27,935	00:05:28,447	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Disposable
EDL	00:05:29,215	00:05:31,263	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	This was basically this
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:32,543	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Incredibly cheap
EDL	00:05:32,543	00:05:33,823	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	And it's incredibly busy
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:35,615	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Disposable and hygienic
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:37,919	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	This wasn't something that came from nature
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:39,455	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	He was in fact
EDL	00:05:39,455	00:05:39,967	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Produced
EDL	00:05:40,479	00:05:43,551	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	To a standard you know this wasn't patent straw
EDL	00:05:44,063	00:05:48,927	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	And the fact that this straw was hygienic and produced to a standard was important
EDL	00:05:48,927	00:05:54,559	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	His drawers are becoming a tool in the emerging Public Health movement that was happening in cities around this time
EDL	00:05:55,071	00:06:01,471	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	You know the reason public health is emerging at this time it's because people in American cities are just like dying all the time
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:02,495	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Name of communicable diseases
EDL	00:06:03,007	00:06:06,079	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	A lot of illnesses were spread through dirty drinking water
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:08,383	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Understand why this was such a big healthy

EDL	00:14:05,823	00:14:08,895	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	While our financial sector has been expanding
EDL	00:14:08,895	00:14:12,479	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Which has big implications for who ends up making money
EDL	00:14:12,991	00:14:15,807	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Long straws and a million other consumer goods
EDL	00:14:16,319	00:14:21,183	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	The slice of money that's going to the people who provide the money as opposed to provide the products
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:27,839	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Is growing and that has really important consequences for how things get made and who makes them and
EDL	00:14:28,607	00:14:33,727	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Where are the factories are located and how many people are employed in the culture of work and
EDL	00:14:34,239	00:14:34,751	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	And all these things
EDL	00:14:35,263	00:14:37,311	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	To tell me what happened to Maryland
EDL	00:14:37,311	00:14:39,615	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	This is one of the country's biggest troll makers
EDL	00:14:39,615	00:14:41,407	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	What would happen to them around this time

EDL	00:14:43,199	00:14:43,967	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	It just sucks

EDL	00:14:45,503	00:14:46,271	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Right
EDL	00:14:46,271	00:14:48,831	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Owned by these brothers the Shapiro Brothers
EDL	00:14:48,831	00:14:50,111	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	They started out as like
EDL	00:14:50,111	00:14:51,647	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Bakery and Anna turn into this
EDL	00:14:52,159	00:14:54,975	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	A bakery services provider and then they start making
EDL	00:14:55,999	00:14:57,023	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	So
EDL	00:14:57,023	00:14:58,815	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	After they make straws they make
EDL	00:14:58,815	00:14:59,839	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Cups after they make
EDL	00:14:59,839	00:15:00,607	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Cubs tickets

EDL	00:15:03,167	00:15:05,471	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	And it remained basically family-owned
EDL	00:15:06,239	00:15:07,263	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	But eventually
EDL	00:15:07,263	00:15:11,359	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Show the original management is gone the people are aging
EDL	00:15:11,871	00:15:14,175	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	And they decide that they're going to sell the company
EDL	00:15:14,943	00:15:16,991	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	They sell the company to another company

EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:24,671	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Yeah there's a great story in the Baltimore Sun
EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:29,023	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Where they describe going to the sales meeting you know the Maryland cup Executives like I'll show up
EDL	00:15:29,535	00:15:31,839	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	The new bosses are there
EDL	00:15:31,839	00:15:33,631	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	And he literally probably had a flip chart
EDL	00:15:33,631	00:15:39,007	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	WhitePages flipchart it said hear your old values and they were service quality responding to

EDL	00:15:39,775	00:15:40,799	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Are there parallel you literally like
EDL	00:15:41,311	00:15:43,615	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Flip the flip chart to the next page and it said
EDL	00:15:43,615	00:15:44,127	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	New value
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:46,175	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Profits profits profits
EDL	00:15:49,759	00:15:53,087	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Damn that's quite a PowerPoint do you know
EDL	00:15:55,391	00:16:01,791	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Maryland cop had been a very profitable company with a highly family
EDL	00:16:01,791	00:16:08,191	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Oriented kind of culture you know the boss has a dress up as Santa Claus you know turkeys to all
EDL	00:16:08,191	00:16:10,239	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Everybody at Thanksgiving and you know that kind of like
EDL	00:16:10,751	00:16:12,031	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Paternalistic
EDL	00:16:12,031	00:16:17,663	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	We are all one big family company thing once they go into Fort Howard it becomes
EDL	00:16:18,175	00:16:21,503	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	I truly just kind of like work we're going to have to make money so
EDL	00:16:21,503	00:16:24,063	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	All these people get laid off they cut pensions
EDL	00:16:24,063	00:16:30,463	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Did you all this stuff that's basically like the plot of Tommy Boy kind of speaker with his movie with Chris Farley
EDL	00:16:30,463	00:16:33,023	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Ohio
EDL	00:16:34,047	00:16:37,119	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Sowinski Industries has an offer on the table to buy us out
EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:40,959	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	But if you realise Callahan has been family owned
EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:43,775	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Since Tommy's great-grandfather laid the first brick
EDL	00:16:44,543	00:16:46,847	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	And I'll be damned if that's going to change on my watch
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:52,223	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	But it's played out many many many many
EDL	00:16:53,247	00:16:53,759	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	And
EDL	00:16:54,271	00:16:58,879	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	In the end what ends up happening is that Fort Howard itself then
EDL	00:16:58,879	00:17:00,671	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Is bought by private-equity firm
EDL	00:17:01,439	00:17:07,327	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Who then goes and combines a bunch of different paper cup and disposable Goods companies
EDL	00:17:07,839	00:17:09,631	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Into one kind of
EDL	00:17:09,631	00:17:10,655	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Larger entity
EDL	00:17:10,655	00:17:12,191	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	And then spins it out
EDL	00:17:12,191	00:17:12,959	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Loaded with a bunch of
EDL	00:17:13,727	00:17:18,591	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	And this is kind of a classic move that happens in private equity
EDL	00:17:18,591	00:17:20,639	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Because you can borrow against these companies
EDL	00:17:20,639	00:17:25,503	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Pay your investors and then spin out this other company that that is like soda floating in the ocean like
EDL	00:17:25,503	00:17:27,295	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	With rocks tied around its feet right
EDL	00:17:27,807	00:17:33,951	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	So operationally like from the from making cups and straws and all this stuff they're still making money but because
EDL	00:17:34,463	00:17:35,487	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	To pay all this debt
EDL	00:17:35,487	00:17:37,023	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	They're like deeply in the red
EDL	00:17:37,023	00:17:39,327	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	I have to lay off people
EDL	00:17:39,327	00:17:40,095	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Have to close factories
EDL	00:17:40,607	00:17:41,631	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	And it is just
EDL	00:17:42,655	00:17:43,679	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Classic story
EDL	00:17:44,191	00:17:45,983	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	I've kind of like vulture capitalism
EDL	00:17:46,751	00:17:47,519	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	And
EDL	00:17:47,519	00:17:48,799	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	The fact that
EDL	00:17:49,567	00:17:50,847	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Straw like this
EDL	00:17:50,847	00:17:53,919	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Stupid straw dislike empty vessel
EDL	00:17:53,919	00:17:58,271	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Somehow also is tied up in the financial of America
EDL	00:17:58,271	00:18:03,391	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Just said something to me every single goddamn thing is tied up with this
EDL	00:18:03,391	00:18:04,927	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Kind of system of production
EDL	00:18:09,535	00:18:14,143	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Can Banning straws really make a dent in our ecological problems
EDL	00:18:16,191	00:18:22,335	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	No it's not it's up to the scale of the of the problem
EDL	00:18:23,871	00:18:27,455	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Line I see what all this stuff cuz obviously
EDL	00:18:27,967	00:18:28,735	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	It's hard to connect
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:31,551	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Gala 1888 patent to the

EDL	00:18:33,855	00:18:37,183	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	To financial capitalism in its current form
EDL	00:18:37,183	00:18:38,719	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Here's the through line as I see it
EDL	00:18:38,719	00:18:41,791	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	The country has shed manufacturing job for decades
EDL	00:18:42,303	00:18:44,607	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Straws contribute tiny share

EDL	00:22:12,992	00:22:15,552	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	The Maryland cup Corporation got bought out and then
EDL	00:22:16,064	00:22:17,088	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	It's buyer's guide
EDL	00:22:17,088	00:22:18,112	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Bought out in Solano
EDL	00:22:18,624	00:22:19,904	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	The capital is fast food chain
EDL	00:22:20,416	00:22:23,232	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	But before Maryland cups sold their family business

EDL	00:22:26,304	00:22:27,328	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Key patents
EDL	00:22:27,328	00:22:28,352	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	From another

EDL	00:22:32,448	00:22:32,960	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	They bought out
EDL	00:22:33,984	00:22:34,496	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Flexible straw
EDL	00:22:35,264	00:22:36,544	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	The first of the contacts
EDL	00:22:36,544	00:22:40,640	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	As Alexis pointed out we'll never really know when humans first started using straws
EDL	00:22:41,152	00:22:44,736	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	But there's this Sumerian to about 5000 years
EDL	00:22:44,736	00:22:47,040	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	And I would still there these figures who
EDL	00:22:47,040	00:22:48,576	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Appear to be drinking from straw
EDL	00:22:49,600	00:22:52,672	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Sure enough when they found this ornate drinking
EDL	00:22:55,488	00:22:56,256	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Precious stones
EDL	00:22:57,280	00:22:59,328	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Really fancy and it's really old
EDL	00:22:59,328	00:23:01,120	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	It's probably not the oldest draw that
EDL	00:23:01,120	00:23:01,888	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Ever exist
EDL	00:23:01,888	00:23:03,168	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Digital this one we found
EDL	00:23:03,168	00:23:05,728	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	You may not even be close
EDL	00:23:05,728	00:23:09,568	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	It's expensive materials aside it's still just a straight to
EDL	00:23:09,568	00:23:14,944	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Precious sure but otherwise not that different from a modern grass
EDL	00:23:14,944	00:23:15,712	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Azure paper
EDL	00:23:15,712	00:23:16,224	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Elasticsearch
EDL	00:23:16,992	00:23:18,528	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	So in a lot of ways
EDL	00:23:18,528	00:23:20,832	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Straw design hasn't fundamentally changed for
EDL	00:23:20,832	00:23:21,856	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Thousands of years
EDL	00:23:21,856	00:23:23,136	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Or at least it didn't
EDL	00:23:23,136	00:23:23,904	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Until the 19th
EDL	00:23:24,928	00:23:25,696	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	And that's when the f***
EDL	00:23:27,488	00:23:28,000	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Yes
EDL	00:23:28,512	00:23:30,048	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	And as The Story Goes
EDL	00:23:30,048	00:23:33,888	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	The inventor Joseph E Friedman took his daughter to get a milkshake
EDL	00:23:33,888	00:23:34,400	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Steak in San Francisco
EDL	00:23:34,912	00:23:35,936	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	At a sweet shop unbiased
EDL	00:23:36,448	00:23:40,032	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	But as he's watching his daughter struggle with this normal straight straw
EDL	00:23:40,032	00:23:40,800	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	He thinks to himself
EDL	00:23:41,312	00:23:45,152	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Hey you get off maybe there's a better way to do this and it's like the classic
EDL	00:23:45,152	00:23:46,176	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	You see a problem you fix
EDL	00:23:46,176	00:23:47,712	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	It's a problem that this guy wasn't a
EDL	00:23:47,712	00:23:49,248	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Strong maker by trade how did he die
EDL	00:23:49,760	00:23:50,528	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Create this New Hampshire
EDL	00:23:51,040	00:23:52,320	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Start out with this
EDL	00:23:52,320	00:23:54,368	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Simple existing paper straw
EDL	00:23:54,368	00:23:56,416	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	How many slots in a metal screw into the neck
EDL	00:23:57,184	00:24:00,000	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	How many wraps dental floss around the screw
EDL	00:24:00,512	00:24:01,280	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	So that
EDL	00:24:01,280	00:24:02,816	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	When I tightened it down it creates ridges
EDL	00:24:03,328	00:24:05,632	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	And these ridges allow the things
EDL	00:24:05,632	00:24:07,168	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	You know like an accordion
EDL	00:24:07,680	00:24:09,728	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Till you just use the screws threading
EDL	00:24:09,728	00:24:15,872	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	To provide the groove and then
EDL	00:24:16,384	00:24:19,712	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	And he's really clear about this tune the patent application is like
EDL	00:24:20,224	00:24:23,808	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	I didn't invent the accordion I didn't invent the straw
EDL	00:24:24,320	00:24:27,904	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	All I did was I combine this idea flexibility with this you know Street
EDL	00:24:27,904	00:24:28,672	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Tube for drinking out of
EDL	00:24:29,184	00:24:31,232	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	So he MacGyver's this thing into existence
EDL	00:24:31,232	00:24:32,000	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Does it
EDL	00:24:32,000	00:24:34,304	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Revolutionize the industry by the way what does it do
EDL	00:24:34,304	00:24:35,584	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	It actually took
EDL	00:24:35,584	00:24:36,864	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	A while for these Flex
EDL	00:24:38,400	00:24:39,936	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Which is kind of shocking
EDL	00:24:39,936	00:24:46,336	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Because his brother oldest soda shop and yet somehow
EDL	00:24:46,336	00:24:52,736	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	It takes him 10 years to start selling these things
EDL	00:24:52,736	00:24:55,296	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Taking other jobs on the side he needed to work as a real estate agent
EDL	00:24:55,808	00:24:59,392	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Circuito live and he also got cash infusions from his brothers invest
EDL	00:24:59,392	00:24:59,904	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Business
EDL	00:25:00,416	00:25:02,720	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Got some business help from my sister Betty Who
EDL	00:25:06,048	00:25:08,608	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Finally 10 years later they get their first buyers
EDL	00:25:08,608	00:25:10,144	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	And it has nothing to do with kids
EDL	00:25:10,656	00:25:12,192	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	So who are the first people to buy
EDL	00:25:13,216	00:25:15,264	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Winter beanies large hospitals
EDL	00:25:15,264	00:25:17,312	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Which if you think about it makes perfect sense
EDL	00:25:17,312	00:25:17,824	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Steak-Out
EDL	00:25:18,336	00:25:20,384	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	Injured patients disabled patients
EDL	00:25:20,896	00:25:22,688	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	People lying in bed to a trouble sitting out
EDL	00:25:23,456	00:25:28,576	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	And so these Flex straws which argued openable disposable sanitary
EDL	00:25:28,576	00:25:30,368	| 322_The_First_Straw_pt01 |	They're just perfect for this Hospital
