EDL	00:06:12,479	00:06:14,271	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	We decided that will join the community
EDL	00:06:15,295	00:06:17,855	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	But it wasn't all a big romantic adventure
EDL	00:06:17,855	00:06:19,391	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	It was a real risk
EDL	00:06:19,391	00:06:20,927	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	First of all first with redis
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:25,279	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Nothing these days it's called mid-century modern
EDL	00:06:25,791	00:06:27,327	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	But the architecture then was red
EDL	00:06:27,839	00:06:33,983	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Meaning these homes were so strange looking to the larger world that the people who chose to live in them where
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:34,751	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Seen as radical
EDL	00:06:35,519	00:06:37,311	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	And in some ways they were
EDL	00:06:37,311	00:06:39,359	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Some of them were Lefty Jews from the Bronx
EDL	00:06:39,871	00:06:41,663	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Socialist ideals about land ownership
EDL	00:06:42,431	00:06:44,479	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	The true cooperatives that we were
EDL	00:06:44,479	00:06:45,247	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Was Radical
EDL	00:06:46,527	00:06:49,855	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Operators in the sense that no one owns their house
EDL	00:06:49,855	00:06:50,623	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Yes
EDL	00:06:50,623	00:06:52,415	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Also this was a Financial Risk
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:54,975	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Since the houses were not as cheap as they were supposed to be
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:57,791	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	They supposed $5,000 cost
EDL	00:06:58,303	00:07:00,351	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	What time that it was not a realistic number
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:04,959	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	During and after World War materials and labor became more
EDL	00:07:04,959	00:07:05,727	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Expensive
EDL	00:07:05,727	00:07:08,031	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	In the building of usonian homes involved
EDL	00:07:08,031	00:07:09,311	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Special skills
EDL	00:07:09,311	00:07:13,663	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Custom fixtures and the house has ended up being double or triple their price estimates
EDL	00:07:14,175	00:07:16,479	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	The Riley's house was over twenty Grand
EDL	00:07:17,247	00:07:18,783	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	But the members of usonia
EDL	00:07:18,783	00:07:23,391	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Would not be deterred we were determined to go forward with this we were all very optimistic
EDL	00:07:24,159	00:07:27,231	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Pill with occasionally to see these house under construction
EDL	00:07:27,743	00:07:29,279	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	You got to come and see you in the same to you
EDL	00:07:31,839	00:07:34,143	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	When Rowland and his wife signed up for the community
EDL	00:07:34,143	00:07:37,983	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	They thought they'd work with one of the Taliesin graduates to design their house
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:39,519	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Not the master himself
EDL	00:07:39,519	00:07:42,591	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	We didn't dream of a project Frank Lloyd Wright's I mean really
EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:46,175	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Who who is 31st
EDL	00:07:46,687	00:07:50,015	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	But Frank Lloyd Wright did in fact want to design Rowlands
EDL	00:07:50,783	00:07:52,063	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	They met up in New York
EDL	00:07:52,063	00:07:54,111	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	And they exchanged letters and ideas about the
EDL	00:07:54,111	00:07:56,671	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Roland went out to see right at Taliesin
EDL	00:07:57,183	00:08:02,815	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Who is the real person you could talk to him you could exchange a joke I mean people people don't don't see him that way
EDL	00:08:02,815	00:08:03,839	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	But
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:04,863	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	There there was
EDL	00:08:04,863	00:08:06,143	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Roland was 26
EDL	00:08:06,655	00:08:08,447	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Wright was 83

EDL	00:08:10,239	00:08:12,799	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	You're my client I'm your architect
EDL	00:08:12,799	00:08:15,871	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	I'll redesign your house as many times as I have to
EDL	00:08:15,871	00:08:18,175	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Until I was satisfied all of your needs
EDL	00:08:18,175	00:08:19,199	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	You have to speak up
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:20,223	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	But you don't you'll take what you get
EDL	00:08:21,503	00:08:26,879	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Roland's house would be one of three and usonia New York that Frank Lloyd wright-designed himself
EDL	00:08:26,879	00:08:30,463	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	About five years after the rise Lee's moved in when rolling is wifey

EDL	00:08:31,231	00:08:33,791	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Frank Lloyd Wright added an extension to their house
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:34,303	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	In fact
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:41,215	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Roland is the last living owner of a Frank Lloyd Wright usonian home built specially
EDL	00:08:41,215	00:08:41,727	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	For him
EDL	00:08:42,239	00:08:43,007	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	And he still lives in it
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:45,311	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	I came to realize
EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:48,127	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	After some years living here
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:52,223	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	It did not been a day in my life when I didn't see something beautiful
EDL	00:08:54,527	00:08:56,831	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Even the terrible days that occur in every life
EDL	00:08:58,367	00:09:00,671	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	The house is completely usonian
EDL	00:09:00,671	00:09:02,463	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	With simple carport
EDL	00:09:02,463	00:09:04,511	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Sumptuous wooden walls that almost
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:08,095	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Glow and one big main room in a tiny kitchen
EDL	00:09:08,863	00:09:13,983	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	It almost feels like you're outside because it has these big glass windows with long roof overhang
EDL	00:09:14,495	00:09:17,823	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Draw the eye out towards the thick forest of trees
EDL	00:09:17,823	00:09:20,127	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Just outside I feel included his
EDL	00:09:20,127	00:09:22,175	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Had an effect on me
EDL	00:09:22,175	00:09:23,455	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	In many many ways
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:27,551	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	The neuroscientist say that that kind of sense
EDL	00:09:27,551	00:09:29,855	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Reduces stress and that is
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:30,623	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Good for you
EDL	00:09:30,623	00:09:31,391	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Good for your love

EDL	00:09:39,327	00:09:40,607	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Partly I mean
EDL	00:09:40,607	00:09:41,375	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Who knows
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:43,167	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	I'd like to attribute that
EDL	00:09:43,167	00:09:44,447	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	To the experience
EDL	00:09:44,959	00:09:45,983	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Beauty around me
EDL	00:09:46,751	00:09:48,287	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	For most of my life
EDL	00:09:48,287	00:09:49,055	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Which is quite remarkable
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:52,895	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Is Roman season
EDL	00:09:52,895	00:09:57,247	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Frank Lloyd Wright's idea that better architecture could create a better way of life
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:10:02,111	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Has been entirely true we could depend on each other if there was a problem or a need
EDL	00:10:02,623	00:10:03,903	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	The kids will
EDL	00:10:03,903	00:10:06,719	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Do all the all the adults by their first name
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:10,815	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Used to say that children growing up here at 50 aunts and uncles and usonia
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:17,215	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	The first 40 Years of usonia New York only 12 of the 48 houses change pans six of those
EDL	00:10:17,215	00:10:19,263	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Go to Next Generation members of the community
EDL	00:10:19,775	00:10:21,311	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	There are only two divorces
EDL	00:10:21,823	00:10:24,639	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	I have the joke I could pick and decide who get the house
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:29,247	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	But life started to move at different Paces for people living in usonia
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:32,319	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Suddenly they weren't all new young families
EDL	00:10:32,831	00:10:35,647	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Are all groups of people in different phases
EDL	00:10:35,647	00:10:36,159	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	With different needs
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:42,303	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	And when it was time for homes to change hands perspective buyers were thrown off by The Cooperative nature of the village
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:46,655	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	In the first Decades of usonia members didn't own their homes
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:48,447	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	We decided very reluctant

EDL	00:10:53,823	00:10:55,615	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	While retaining all of our

EDL	00:10:57,919	00:11:00,735	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	And that made a big difference that suddenly people

EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:09,695	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Usonian houses can be a bit of an adjustment
EDL	00:11:10,207	00:11:13,279	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Today most of the homes and usonia New York have been expanded
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:17,887	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Any and all new additions have been built in a usonian style
EDL	00:11:17,887	00:11:22,239	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Using local materials flat roofs big glass windows and radiant sensibilities
EDL	00:11:23,007	00:11:24,543	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	They have to be built that way
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:28,383	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	While the outsides are not Landmark they are governed by the board of usonia
EDL	00:11:28,383	00:11:29,919	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	The insides are not at all
EDL	00:11:30,687	00:11:33,503	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	This is Evan Kingsley he's one of the newcomers to usonia
EDL	00:11:34,015	00:11:34,783	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Relatively
EDL	00:11:34,783	00:11:39,903	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	He's been there since 2003 but I think for the most part those of us who have chosen to move here
EDL	00:11:39,903	00:11:42,207	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Are really sensitive to the aesthetic of the
EDL	00:11:42,207	00:11:42,975	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Interior
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:47,583	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	But there's one specific part of the Interior that has changed in a lot
EDL	00:11:47,583	00:11:48,607	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Of the usonian homes
EDL	00:11:49,119	00:11:50,911	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	We've completely redone the kitchen
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:56,799	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	As was the case in most usonian homes the kitchen in Evans home was this little Alco
EDL	00:11:57,311	00:11:59,103	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Very efficient and very

EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:04,223	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Right never realize that the whole family might actually want to hang out in the kitchen
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:08,319	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Nowadays it's as much a place to gather at the living room or the dining room
EDL	00:12:08,831	00:12:12,927	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Evan is added new tiling and appliances and expanded his kitchen
EDL	00:12:13,439	00:12:19,839	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	But not by much closet space away and we gain I don't know maybe 10 in
EDL	00:12:19,839	00:12:21,375	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Is there that's all that we gained
EDL	00:12:21,375	00:12:21,887	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	I'm doing that
EDL	00:12:24,191	00:12:27,263	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	There are a smattering of usonian homes throughout the United States

EDL	00:13:47,647	00:13:49,183	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Which is why it was on the market
EDL	00:13:49,183	00:13:51,743	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Four and a half years before they bought it
EDL	00:13:51,743	00:13:53,279	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Everybody wanted to look at it
EDL	00:13:53,279	00:13:55,583	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Is it curiosity but nobody wanted to live here
EDL	00:13:56,863	00:13:58,655	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	If they're really not for everyone
EDL	00:13:59,423	00:14:02,751	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	The reason they sit on the market sometimes for so long is because
EDL	00:14:03,263	00:14:04,287	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	People consider them
EDL	00:14:05,311	00:14:06,335	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	A difficult

EDL	00:14:15,295	00:14:16,319	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	You sometimes have
EDL	00:14:16,319	00:14:16,831	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Modify
EDL	00:14:17,855	00:14:19,391	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	In order to make them more level
EDL	00:14:20,159	00:14:25,535	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	But even experts like eifler have a tough time keeping track of how many usonian homes exist
EDL	00:14:25,535	00:14:26,815	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	So how many are there
EDL	00:14:26,815	00:14:30,143	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	I don't know
EDL	00:14:30,655	00:14:34,495	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	I've heard numbers ranging from 27 to 140
EDL	00:14:35,007	00:14:39,103	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	It all depends on your definition of what an authentic usonian house is
EDL	00:14:39,615	00:14:41,407	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	You could consider usonia
EDL	00:14:41,407	00:14:42,175	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	.
EDL	00:14:42,175	00:14:43,455	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Frank Lloyd Wright's life
EDL	00:14:43,455	00:14:48,063	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Period in American architectural history which would include the houses by the apprentices
EDL	00:14:48,575	00:14:50,879	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Or just a general architectural style
EDL	00:14:51,647	00:14:53,183	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Depending on your definition
EDL	00:14:53,183	00:14:55,743	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	The number of usonian houses continues to grow
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:14:59,327	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	In 2013 a new usonian house was Bill
EDL	00:14:59,327	00:15:00,351	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	On the campus
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:01,375	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Florida Southern College
EDL	00:15:01,887	00:15:04,447	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	It was a design of Rights from 1939
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:06,495	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	But constructed 74 years later
EDL	00:15:07,007	00:15:08,799	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	All according to Wright's plans
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:15,199	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Usonia certainly never came to pass in the way that Frank Lloyd Wright originally envisioned
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:18,527	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	With every American living in an affordable
EDL	00:15:18,527	00:15:19,295	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Custom home
EDL	00:15:19,807	00:15:20,575	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	In fact
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:24,927	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Elements of the usonian home ever evolve into something else entirely
EDL	00:15:24,927	00:15:29,535	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	So it is kind of true the boat that usonia directly influence the development of the Rancho
EDL	00:15:29,535	00:15:31,071	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Without a doubt
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:31,839	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	I think so
EDL	00:15:33,119	00:15:37,983	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Ranch style houses are all over the country and nearly every suburb
EDL	00:15:37,983	00:15:40,799	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	They are horizontal close to the ground
EDL	00:15:40,799	00:15:42,079	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	One story
EDL	00:15:42,079	00:15:43,359	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	They have an open floor
EDL	00:15:43,871	00:15:44,895	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	With few walls
EDL	00:15:44,895	00:15:47,199	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	So it's not hard to see the similarities
EDL	00:15:47,199	00:15:47,967	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	G70
EDL	00:15:47,967	00:15:51,295	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Ranch homes are generally less inspired
EDL	00:15:51,295	00:15:55,135	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	I don't have the elegant details and they're made with standard materials
EDL	00:15:57,183	00:16:01,023	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Right might not have been pleased the concepts of usonia I got absorbed into
EDL	00:16:01,535	00:16:04,607	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Essentially the epitome of cookie cutters Suburban housing
EDL	00:16:05,119	00:16:08,959	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	At least these houses really were affordable for the middle class
EDL	00:16:08,959	00:16:10,495	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Unlike all the usonia
EDL	00:16:10,495	00:16:12,031	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Houses after usonia 1
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:13,823	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	Every war
EDL	00:16:13,823	00:16:15,871	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	American suburbs were full

EDL	00:16:17,663	00:16:19,455	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	There weren't that many variations

EDL	00:16:20,991	00:16:22,783	| 99pi-0247-usoniathebeautiful-1 |	And they
