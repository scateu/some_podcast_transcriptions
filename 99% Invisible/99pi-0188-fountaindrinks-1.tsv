EDL	00:14:30,655	00:14:34,495	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Drinking fountains are starting to disappear from the public landscape

EDL	00:14:46,527	00:14:48,319	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	The University of Central Florida
EDL	00:14:49,087	00:14:51,391	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	In 2007 opened
EDL	00:14:51,391	00:14:55,743	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	A brand new football stadium they had built the stadium with no public water fountain
EDL	00:14:56,767	00:15:01,631	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	And on opening day 45,000 people showed up to watch the UCF Knights

EDL	00:15:11,871	00:15:13,919	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	And then the bottled water sold out
EDL	00:15:14,431	00:15:20,831	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	18 people were taken to hospitals and 60 more were treated by local campus Personnel for heat-related

EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:24,415	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	At first the University was Unapologetic
EDL	00:15:24,415	00:15:27,743	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	And then some angry students organized into a group called
EDL	00:15:27,743	00:15:29,535	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Knights for free water
EDL	00:15:29,535	00:15:32,095	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	They demanded drinking fountains be installed in the stadium
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:35,935	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	We're going out for blood we just want water they said

EDL	00:15:40,287	00:15:42,079	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Yes it was Watergate
EDL	00:15:42,079	00:15:44,639	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	And finally the University was forced to concede
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:47,455	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	They installed 50 drinking fountains in their Stadium
EDL	00:15:47,455	00:15:53,855	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	The nights for free water probably didn't know anything about there for mothers and fathers in the metropolitan

EDL	00:20:55,935	00:21:02,079	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	I love when things are human and not machine like obviously as anyone listening stupid music would know
EDL	00:21:02,591	00:21:04,383	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	It is not perfect by any means
EDL	00:21:04,383	00:21:04,895	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	But
EDL	00:21:05,407	00:21:11,295	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	There's a tipping point at which I go nope I was a little bit too op the beat there
EDL	00:21:11,295	00:21:13,599	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	For using a song that I really wanted to be a dance
EDL	00:21:18,208	00:21:22,304	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	The story of the song is basically that I almost threw it away because I thought it was
EDL	00:21:22,304	00:21:23,072	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Dumb
EDL	00:21:23,072	00:21:28,192	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	It just sounded like really simple I mean think about me spending hours trying to workout Lane
EDL	00:21:28,192	00:21:29,984	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Mike laps over one another and then
EDL	00:21:30,496	00:21:34,592	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Coming up with the words like no wood in the Woodstock
EDL	00:21:34,592	00:21:36,384	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	What the hell does that mean
EDL	00:21:36,384	00:21:38,176	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	And I was like this is so annoying
EDL	00:21:38,176	00:21:40,224	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	And I'm annoying and everything
EDL	00:21:40,224	00:21:40,736	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Pink sucks
EDL	00:21:41,248	00:21:44,064	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	And neat had a hot dogs across from mine
EDL	00:21:44,064	00:21:47,136	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	And he would walk over every opportunity
EDL	00:21:47,136	00:21:47,904	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Ruby Lake
EDL	00:21:47,904	00:21:49,952	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	A sanity check and I be like this sucks
EDL	00:21:49,952	00:21:51,744	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	And he like no no it's cool and he
EDL	00:21:51,744	00:21:53,536	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	She came in and he played the first base line.
EDL	00:21:57,632	00:22:01,984	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	And I thought rhythmically is Baseline was awesome
EDL	00:22:01,984	00:22:08,384	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	But I thought no it sounds to rights like if you play in that kind of major key then it's going to sound too
EDL	00:22:08,384	00:22:09,152	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Rate
EDL	00:22:09,152	00:22:10,944	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	A little bit more wrong
EDL	00:22:13,504	00:22:15,552	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	We kind of thought about it a little bit
EDL	00:22:15,552	00:22:16,576	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	In our peaceful way
EDL	00:22:17,088	00:22:19,904	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	And then he came up with if he's playing in minor
EDL	00:22:24,256	00:22:26,304	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	And all the sudden the color of the song
EDL	00:22:26,304	00:22:28,608	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Completely changes and that was really important
EDL	00:22:28,608	00:22:30,400	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	To me that the things that the song was
EDL	00:22:30,912	00:22:36,544	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Talking about to me or really heavy and so it didn't make sense to just keep the whole sun in major it was like
EDL	00:22:36,544	00:22:37,312	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	This is
EDL	00:22:37,312	00:22:38,592	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Disturbing
EDL	00:22:38,592	00:22:39,872	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	That's kind of weird
EDL	00:22:39,872	00:22:40,896	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Do you like
EDL	00:22:40,896	00:22:43,200	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	How about this and I was like how did that in the world like okay both
EDL	00:22:43,712	00:22:45,504	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	I saved up for my pants
EDL	00:22:46,016	00:22:49,856	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Then I gave them to the special guy
EDL	00:22:58,816	00:23:02,656	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	In the store
EDL	00:23:02,656	00:23:05,472	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Pretty simple major Melody but then you just make
EDL	00:23:05,472	00:23:06,752	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	The bassline minor
EDL	00:23:07,264	00:23:08,032	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	And all the sudden it's like
EDL	00:23:08,544	00:23:09,824	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Stomach-churning
EDL	00:23:09,824	00:23:11,872	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Part of the song where all is on you know that
EDL	00:23:11,872	00:23:12,896	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Something's going to go down
EDL	00:23:26,208	00:23:32,608	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	You know now there a lot of people involved into yards the record label in our manager and they're like
EDL	00:23:32,608	00:23:34,912	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Men's the single this the catchy one
EDL	00:23:34,912	00:23:38,240	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Can you please just make it less dissonant and I was like
EDL	00:23:38,240	00:23:39,264	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	No
EDL	00:23:40,288	00:23:41,056	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	I really can't
EDL	00:23:41,568	00:23:44,384	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	I mean tuner it started when I was listening to us
EDL	00:23:44,384	00:23:46,688	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Ton of dancehall reggae
EDL	00:23:47,456	00:23:50,016	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	And there's something about the tradition
EDL	00:23:50,016	00:23:51,552	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Reggae that
EDL	00:23:51,552	00:23:52,832	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	For so many reasons
EDL	00:23:52,832	00:23:53,600	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Stairs
EDL	00:23:53,600	00:23:54,368	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Dissonance
EDL	00:23:54,368	00:23:54,880	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	And
EDL	00:23:55,392	00:24:01,792	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Kind of dub sensibility where there things that feel wrong or don't link up exactly but there's so much
EDL	00:24:01,792	00:24:03,072	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Much implied in that
EDL	00:24:03,072	00:24:04,352	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Disagreement between Ellen
EDL	00:24:04,864	00:24:06,656	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	There's some Reggae albums where you feel like
EDL	00:24:06,656	00:24:08,960	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Singer came in and saying and couldn't
EDL	00:24:08,960	00:24:09,984	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Hear the track
EDL	00:24:09,984	00:24:13,312	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	And then the check that they end up putting underneath the singer is like
EDL	00:24:13,312	00:24:14,080	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	I totally different
EDL	00:24:14,592	00:24:20,992	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Song with a different key
EDL	00:24:20,992	00:24:27,392	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	So I love
EDL	00:24:27,392	00:24:28,416	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	That sensitive
EDL	00:24:28,416	00:24:33,024	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Wrong parts put together but then when it comes back together as a whole it has is holding
EDL	00:24:33,024	00:24:33,536	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Conversation
EDL	00:24:34,048	00:24:35,328	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Wrongness
EDL	00:24:36,352	00:24:38,400	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Bino no water in the water fountain is
EDL	00:24:38,400	00:24:39,936	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	It's like a horrible concept
EDL	00:24:39,936	00:24:44,544	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Even more so now in California but in 2013 to we were talking about the drought and it was
EDL	00:24:44,544	00:24:48,640	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Terrifying to me to allow my imagination to go that far and think
EDL	00:24:49,408	00:24:51,200	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Of life without water coming out of your toe
EDL	00:24:51,968	00:24:55,296	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	You know even just talking about these things now it's like this
EDL	00:24:55,296	00:24:56,832	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Really uncomfortable
EDL	00:24:57,344	00:24:58,368	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Tension in my
EDL	00:24:58,368	00:24:59,648	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Stomach and I think that's
EDL	00:24:59,648	00:25:04,256	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	That feeling that I love to evoke in songs where I'm not writing pretty songs
EDL	00:25:04,256	00:25:06,304	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	For people to fall in love to Nessa
EDL	00:25:06,304	00:25:09,120	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Literally I'm writing songs that sound more
EDL	00:25:09,120	00:25:12,192	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Like the truth of the world to me and that has to mean that
EDL	00:25:12,192	00:25:15,264	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	That's literally built into the song that's literally built
EDL	00:25:15,264	00:25:17,568	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Come to the harmonies or the friction or that
EDL	00:25:17,568	00:25:19,104	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Reading sense of the song
EDL	00:25:19,104	00:25:20,384	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	And that's kind of why
EDL	00:25:20,896	00:25:27,296	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	I don't know what's listen to that drum machine stem and that first got the cute little cow bell sound
EDL	00:25:27,296	00:25:30,368	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	And then throughout the song as he gets the end of the song it's like this
EDL	00:25:30,368	00:25:36,512	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Crazy distorted meth of a drum machine
EDL	00:25:40,352	00:25:43,424	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	I found this awesome water bottle of the thrift store and
EDL	00:25:43,936	00:25:44,960	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	It's just like these things like
EDL	00:25:45,472	00:25:46,496	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Fit into the world of the
EDL	00:25:47,264	00:25:47,776	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Spare parts
EDL	00:25:49,056	00:25:50,336	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Like a water bottle
EDL	00:25:50,336	00:25:54,176	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Evokes water somehow even if you're not saying though the water bottle
EDL	00:25:54,176	00:25:55,456	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	There's just something about it that
EDL	00:25:55,456	00:25:56,224	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Buffets in
EDL	00:26:01,088	00:26:02,368	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	So this is where
EDL	00:26:02,368	00:26:03,136	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	The brilliant
EDL	00:26:03,136	00:26:04,416	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	John Hill comes in
EDL	00:26:04,416	00:26:04,928	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Because
EDL	00:26:05,952	00:26:06,976	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	He introduced the lasers
EDL	00:26:07,744	00:26:12,096	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Now we were so nervous working with other producers and I'm very possessive of the
EDL	00:26:12,096	00:26:13,888	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Turn producer because I feel like
EDL	00:26:13,888	00:26:14,656	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	You know I am
EDL	00:26:14,656	00:26:15,936	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	My own producer
EDL	00:26:15,936	00:26:16,704	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	But
EDL	00:26:16,704	00:26:17,472	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	WeChat
EDL	00:26:17,472	00:26:17,984	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	The song in
EDL	00:26:19,520	00:26:21,312	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Of some of our label people
EDL	00:26:21,312	00:26:22,336	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	And played it for
EDL	00:26:22,336	00:26:23,104	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	John Hill who's
EDL	00:26:23,104	00:26:23,872	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Worked on a lot of
EDL	00:26:24,896	00:26:25,920	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Rihanna and
EDL	00:26:26,688	00:26:27,968	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Am I a an
EDL	00:26:27,968	00:26:29,504	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	And so he had those lasers
EDL	00:26:29,504	00:26:30,528	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	For us and I
EDL	00:26:30,528	00:26:32,064	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Played those lasers
EDL	00:26:32,064	00:26:32,832	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	On honest
EDL	00:26:33,600	00:26:34,112	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Add with a stick
EDL	00:26:34,624	00:26:36,672	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	So we all agree that that was
EDL	00:26:36,672	00:26:37,440	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Again another
EDL	00:26:37,440	00:26:38,208	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Dancehall Elliman
EDL	00:26:38,976	00:26:40,000	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Amps up the song
EDL	00:26:40,000	00:26:41,792	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	When it's like another losers come in
EDL	00:26:49,728	00:26:50,496	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	You know what it is
EDL	00:26:53,824	00:26:54,336	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Oh my God
EDL	00:26:57,152	00:26:58,176	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Me and my voice
EDL	00:26:58,944	00:26:59,456	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Tongue making fun
EDL	00:26:59,968	00:27:00,736	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Crazy roll in there
EDL	00:27:06,880	00:27:07,648	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	But then
EDL	00:27:07,648	00:27:08,160	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Sample
EDL	00:27:08,672	00:27:09,184	| 99pi-0188-fountaindrinks-1 |	Implead
