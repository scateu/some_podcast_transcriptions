EDL	00:05:44,575	00:05:48,159	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	Basically on the whole industry was blind
EDL	00:05:48,159	00:05:51,231	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	To what was happening in transit they would place
EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:54,815	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	30 to 40 thousand pounds worth of produce
EDL	00:05:54,815	00:05:57,119	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	Into a container put it on a ship
EDL	00:05:57,119	00:05:57,887	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	And then
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:06:00,191	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	See what whatever happened at destination
EDL	00:06:00,703	00:06:01,471	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	It was like
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:03,007	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	Now behind door number 1
EDL	00:06:03,007	00:06:09,151	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	Will the peaches be rotten or under ripe if only 50% of the produce ended up in good shape
EDL	00:06:09,151	00:06:12,991	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	That's what would be consumed in the rest would be thrown in the trash
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:18,623	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	Barbara and her team decided to see what was happening to the properties inside the containers
EDL	00:06:19,135	00:06:20,159	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	What's the follow that contain
EDL	00:06:20,671	00:06:21,951	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	From Farm to truck
EDL	00:06:22,463	00:06:23,743	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	2 train to ship
EDL	00:06:23,743	00:06:24,767	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	They need a lab
EDL	00:06:25,279	00:06:28,607	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	But it would have to be a mobile that one that can move with the shipment
EDL	00:06:29,119	00:06:30,143	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	Until of course
EDL	00:06:30,655	00:06:33,215	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	Barbers research team would build their lab
EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:35,263	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	In a shipping container
EDL	00:06:35,263	00:06:37,311	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	It's really the only thing that made sense
EDL	00:06:37,311	00:06:41,919	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	Whether it was in the various terminals in the fields or even on board the ship
EDL	00:06:42,687	00:06:43,967	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	2 then connected
EDL	00:06:43,967	00:06:48,319	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	To the other refrigerated containers that were moving on the ship
EDL	00:06:48,319	00:06:51,391	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	To monitor what was going on inside the transit
EDL	00:06:51,391	00:06:55,743	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	And that's how it 22 years old Barbara began traveling the world
EDL	00:06:56,255	00:06:57,023	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	Working
EDL	00:06:57,023	00:07:00,095	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	Sleeping in a 40 foot shipping
EDL	00:07:00,095	00:07:00,863	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	Container
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:02,143	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	We converted this
EDL	00:07:02,143	00:07:03,423	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	Container to base
EDL	00:07:03,423	00:07:04,447	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	Basically a laboratory
EDL	00:07:05,983	00:07:09,311	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	Laboratory so that we could repeat our science
EDL	00:07:09,311	00:07:10,079	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	While we were in
EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:13,919	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	They worked with a company in Southern New Jersey that made mobile homes
EDL	00:07:14,431	00:07:15,199	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	The Outfitter
EDL	00:07:15,199	00:07:16,223	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	Are shipping container
EDL	00:07:16,223	00:07:18,015	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	Hino make it a little Cozier
EDL	00:07:18,015	00:07:19,295	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	And we would have the
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:20,831	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	Front section which had
EDL	00:07:20,831	00:07:22,111	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	Awesome bunk beds
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:23,903	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	In case we needed to stay overnight
EDL	00:07:23,903	00:07:28,255	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	It was a microwave a shower and of course a refrigerator
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:30,047	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	It actually looks pretty cool
EDL	00:07:30,047	00:07:32,095	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	The black and white checkered floors in a window
EDL	00:07:32,863	00:07:33,887	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	A small
EDL	00:07:33,887	00:07:34,655	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	Bulletproof
EDL	00:07:34,655	00:07:37,471	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	Window and you know ports are not known for being super
EDL	00:07:37,471	00:07:39,263	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	Pre-safe but it was fairly Pleasant
EDL	00:07:39,263	00:07:42,335	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	But at the heart of the mobile research lab was the computer
EDL	00:07:42,335	00:07:45,663	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	And what's really funny about it is we had a computer
EDL	00:07:45,663	00:07:47,455	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	Which was the latest and greatest
EDL	00:07:47,455	00:07:48,991	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	Set the time but it was
EDL	00:07:48,991	00:07:49,503	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	About
EDL	00:07:50,271	00:07:51,807	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	2 feet square by
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:53,855	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	3 ft Square by about 8
EDL	00:07:54,367	00:07:55,135	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	VTOL
EDL	00:07:55,135	00:07:56,415	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	And that was based
EDL	00:07:56,415	00:07:59,743	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	Basically gave us the Computing capability that a laptop has today
EDL	00:08:00,511	00:08:03,071	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	Attached to the lab computer where a hundred and fifty cents
EDL	00:08:03,583	00:08:05,631	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	Connected to all the other adjacent can't
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:08,447	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	Containers by long gray salt resistant wires
EDL	00:08:09,215	00:08:10,751	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	These wires were sending back
EDL	00:08:10,751	00:08:13,823	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	All kinds of information about what was happening in the containers
EDL	00:08:14,335	00:08:16,383	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	Temperature humidity levels
EDL	00:08:16,383	00:08:17,151	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	Airflow
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:19,199	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	Concentrations of different apps
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:19,967	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	Spirit gases
EDL	00:08:20,479	00:08:26,879	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	Starting in 1978 Barbara along with a small research crew went with the mobile research lab
EDL	00:08:26,879	00:08:31,999	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	To Trail produce from its Harvest on the farm to its arrival in their destination ports
EDL	00:08:31,999	00:08:35,327	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	We're in different countries in the Caribbean we were in Asia
EDL	00:08:35,839	00:08:37,887	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	We were on the US West Coast
EDL	00:08:37,887	00:08:38,655	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	Buse
EDL	00:08:38,655	00:08:40,447	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	Coast we were over in Europe
EDL	00:08:40,447	00:08:46,847	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	Remember Bob was only going to do this for like a year or two what happened basically as I got hooked in the industry and I just
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:47,359	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	Stay there
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:49,151	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	She kind of got hooked
EDL	00:08:51,199	00:08:54,527	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	For the next seven years Barb travel back and forth
EDL	00:08:54,527	00:08:57,087	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	Across the globe with the shipping container lab
EDL	00:08:58,111	00:08:59,391	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	She got the adventure she wanted
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:01,695	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	She didn't have much time for sightseeing
EDL	00:09:02,719	00:09:04,511	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	We ran our tests
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:07,071	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	And we were conducting a research in
EDL	00:09:07,071	00:09:09,887	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	Analyzing data as we could during the days
EDL	00:09:10,399	00:09:13,215	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	When they were on land out in the fields and Orchards
EDL	00:09:13,215	00:09:14,239	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	Did Sleep Inn hotel
EDL	00:09:14,751	00:09:19,103	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	Person would usually stay behind and sleep in the bunk beds in the lab
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:20,127	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	To keep an eye on the computer
EDL	00:09:20,639	00:09:24,735	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	When they were aboard the boat Barbara would pass the time doing cell membrane
EDL	00:09:25,247	00:09:28,831	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	Barb was the only one embroidering on the cargo ship
EDL	00:09:29,343	00:09:30,367	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	She was kind of a rarity
EDL	00:09:30,879	00:09:33,183	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	A young 20-something woman on the high seas
EDL	00:09:33,951	00:09:37,279	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	I found out about 15 years later that
EDL	00:09:37,279	00:09:39,327	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	Someone senior in the organization
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:41,119	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	Had told
EDL	00:09:41,119	00:09:43,423	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	The people that were around me
EDL	00:09:45,215	00:09:49,823	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	That I had a black belt in karate so that they would know that I could
EDL	00:09:49,823	00:09:51,103	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	Defend myself
EDL	00:09:51,103	00:09:51,871	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	But you didn't have any
EDL	00:09:52,895	00:09:53,919	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	Social Arts
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:09:55,967	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	Now I did not at all
EDL	00:09:55,967	00:09:58,271	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	But Barb had plenty of others going
EDL	00:09:58,271	00:10:01,599	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	She and her colleagues were the first to map airflow in a reefer
EDL	00:10:01,599	00:10:06,975	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	And the first to figure out how much produce could be stuffed in before air circulation started to suffer
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:10,815	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	With Frozen all you really need to do is keep it cold
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:11,583	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	Wythe produce
EDL	00:10:12,095	00:10:14,911	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	What you need to do or with most of the produce its
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:16,703	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	Breathing and respiring product
EDL	00:10:17,215	00:10:21,311	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	And so what you need to do in order to preserve its shelf life is
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:22,079	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	Is 2
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:25,407	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	Slow down the breathing and respiration that's going on
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:26,687	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	Based on their findings
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:28,479	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	The standard ventilation

EDL	00:10:39,999	00:10:41,279	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	And then the air base
EDL	00:10:41,279	00:10:42,559	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	Basically got forced
EDL	00:10:42,559	00:10:45,119	| 99pi-0180-reefermadness-1 |	Through the cargo which then allowed it to remove
