EDL	00:01:50,080	00:01:51,616	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Couple weeks ago I interviewed.
EDL	00:01:51,616	00:01:53,152	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Trotsky about his book in the
EDL	00:01:53,152	00:01:54,176	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	The state of infrastructure
EDL	00:01:54,176	00:01:54,688	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	The US
EDL	00:01:55,200	00:01:57,504	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	The first of many things that I learned that
EDL	00:01:57,504	00:01:58,272	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Xiaomi
EDL	00:01:58,272	00:02:02,624	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Was that the word infrastructure itself is actually kind of new to English
EDL	00:02:02,624	00:02:07,744	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	What we call infrastructure today used to be called Public Works and did America Public Works
EDL	00:02:07,744	00:02:08,768	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Was probably
EDL	00:02:09,280	00:02:12,608	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	A familiar term up until the 1980s
EDL	00:02:12,608	00:02:15,168	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	But Public Works became a term
EDL	00:02:15,680	00:02:18,240	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Closely associated with what was called
EDL	00:02:18,240	00:02:19,008	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Pork barrel
EDL	00:02:19,776	00:02:20,800	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Which was
EDL	00:02:20,800	00:02:22,592	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Also considered
EDL	00:02:22,592	00:02:24,896	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Rent a rather pejorative term because
EDL	00:02:24,896	00:02:26,432	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	It had to do with
EDL	00:02:26,432	00:02:28,992	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Building things that were considered unnecessary
EDL	00:02:29,504	00:02:30,784	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Or wasteful
EDL	00:02:30,784	00:02:32,320	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Pork barrel is government
EDL	00:02:32,320	00:02:34,368	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Spending pushed forward by a congressperson
EDL	00:02:34,880	00:02:35,904	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Casoli benefits
EDL	00:02:35,904	00:02:37,184	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	The people in their home District
EDL	00:02:37,696	00:02:40,512	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	It was associated with politics
EDL	00:02:40,512	00:02:41,024	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Start
EDL	00:02:41,536	00:02:43,328	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Was a tit-for-tat
EDL	00:02:43,328	00:02:45,888	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	You vote for my poor call vote for yours
EDL	00:02:46,400	00:02:52,032	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	But the connection between Public Works and government corruption got even worse than trading votes it reads to
EDL	00:02:52,032	00:02:53,824	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	It's pecan 1973
EDL	00:02:53,824	00:03:00,224	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	There was a major Scandal that one of our vice presidents of the United States had to resign Spiro Agnew
EDL	00:03:00,224	00:03:01,504	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	New because he basically
EDL	00:03:02,016	00:03:02,784	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Was
EDL	00:03:02,784	00:03:06,880	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Taking money for Road contracts in his home state of Maryland
EDL	00:03:07,392	00:03:13,280	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Send the 1980s when shrinking government was becoming all the rage and pork barrel and earmarks were our biggest enemy
EDL	00:03:13,792	00:03:14,304	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Did the Soviets
EDL	00:03:15,328	00:03:16,608	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	The term Public Works
EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:17,376	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Fell out of fashion
EDL	00:03:17,888	00:03:19,680	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Infrastructure
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:21,472	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Became a term
EDL	00:03:21,472	00:03:23,520	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	That replaced Public Works
EDL	00:03:23,520	00:03:24,032	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Generally
EDL	00:03:24,544	00:03:29,152	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	But the term was still so new that in the 1980s The Wall Street Journal put in first
EDL	00:03:29,664	00:03:30,432	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Within quotation
EDL	00:03:32,992	00:03:38,624	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Since infrastructure is the physical part of civilization it's hard to generalize
EDL	00:03:38,624	00:03:42,208	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Which government body or private party is responsible
EDL	00:03:42,208	00:03:43,488	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Fergie to individual part of
EDL	00:03:44,256	00:03:46,816	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	So when our conversation we tended to focus on the big
EDL	00:03:47,328	00:03:48,608	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Well let's take roads
EDL	00:03:48,608	00:03:50,912	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	We tend to think of Rose especially Highway
EDL	00:03:50,912	00:03:53,472	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	This is one of the wonderful things that the federal government
EDL	00:03:54,752	00:03:55,520	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Well that's pretty much why
EDL	00:03:56,544	00:03:57,312	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Rhodes
EDL	00:03:57,312	00:03:58,080	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Today
EDL	00:03:58,080	00:04:00,128	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	In the United States are
EDL	00:04:00,128	00:04:01,920	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Largely the responsibility of
EDL	00:04:02,432	00:04:03,456	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Municipalities
EDL	00:04:03,968	00:04:04,736	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	And
EDL	00:04:04,736	00:04:05,504	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	States
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:07,296	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	One of the reasons that that's
EDL	00:04:07,296	00:04:09,600	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Complicated like this is that the
EDL	00:04:09,600	00:04:10,624	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Federal government
EDL	00:04:11,136	00:04:12,160	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	It's not authorized
EDL	00:04:12,672	00:04:13,440	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Bye
EDL	00:04:13,440	00:04:14,464	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	The Constitution
EDL	00:04:14,464	00:04:17,024	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	To build roads or bridges are even
EDL	00:04:17,024	00:04:20,607	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Fixing them up by itself it has to go through the state
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:24,703	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Article 1 Section 8 of the US Constitution states that the Federal Government Can Build
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:25,471	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Post Road
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:26,239	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Meaning
EDL	00:04:26,239	00:04:28,287	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Routes for the post office to operate fact
EDL	00:04:29,055	00:04:31,615	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	But no other kinds of roads are Spotify
EDL	00:04:32,127	00:04:35,199	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	In fact in 1817 when bill was passed by
EDL	00:04:35,199	00:04:37,247	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	By Congress that approve the funding of
EDL	00:04:37,247	00:04:40,063	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Internal improvements in the country like roads
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:40,831	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Ben Canales
EDL	00:04:40,831	00:04:43,391	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	It was vetoed by then President James Madison
EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:45,439	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Cuz he felt it was unconstitutional
EDL	00:04:45,951	00:04:46,975	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	And you should know
EDL	00:04:46,975	00:04:47,487	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Because he wrote
EDL	00:04:48,255	00:04:49,023	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Constitution
EDL	00:04:49,023	00:04:50,559	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	The federal government can give
EDL	00:04:50,559	00:04:52,351	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Awards to the states
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:55,935	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	You give grants to the states or municipalities but it it can't do it
EDL	00:04:56,447	00:04:57,215	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Itself
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:05:01,567	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	But what the feds can do is put a tax on gasoline to raise money for roads
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:03,103	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Could stay then give to the states
EDL	00:05:03,103	00:05:03,871	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	10 cities
EDL	00:05:03,871	00:05:07,199	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	This has been the case since the Revenue Act of 1932 which was

EDL	00:05:07,967	00:05:09,247	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Hoover which re stacks
EDL	00:05:09,247	00:05:10,015	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Sazon pretty much ever
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:12,831	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Presently it's 18.4%
EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:13,343	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Per gallon
EDL	00:05:14,367	00:05:16,671	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	And that gives the federal government
EDL	00:05:16,671	00:05:20,255	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	About 30 billion dollars a year to distribute to the states
EDL	00:05:20,255	00:05:23,071	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	And that distribution the federal government X
EDL	00:05:23,071	00:05:24,351	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Exercises Sun control
EDL	00:05:24,863	00:05:30,751	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	And enables it to provide some standardization to the roads which I consider a good thing
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:35,871	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Me too because he don't really want to drive from one state to another and fun at the roads
EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:36,895	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Are completely different
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:38,943	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	It was the federal government that
EDL	00:05:38,943	00:05:40,479	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Brought all the states
EDL	00:05:40,479	00:05:42,527	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Into unification with
EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:43,551	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	The
EDL	00:05:43,551	00:05:44,575	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Colors of the
EDL	00:05:44,575	00:05:49,695	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Lines on the roads yellow lines divide traffic when different ways white dashes divided Lanes
EDL	00:05:49,695	00:05:50,463	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	The same way
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:54,815	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Federal government making money contingent on following a standard
EDL	00:05:55,327	00:05:55,839	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Is what
EDL	00:05:56,351	00:05:57,119	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Make that happen
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:06:02,495	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	But the 30 billion dollar Federal Highway trust fund which is fed by the national gasoline tax
EDL	00:06:03,263	00:06:05,311	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Isn't keeping up with our current needs
EDL	00:06:05,823	00:06:08,127	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	One easy solution of course would be to
EDL	00:06:08,895	00:06:10,687	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Increase the gasoline tax
EDL	00:06:10,687	00:06:12,223	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	It hasn't been increased since
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:14,271	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	1993
EDL	00:06:15,807	00:06:16,575	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Quiet
EDL	00:06:16,575	00:06:17,343	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	While
EDL	00:06:17,343	00:06:19,903	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Because the federal gas tax has been so stagnant
EDL	00:06:19,903	00:06:22,719	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	State state upon themselves to Levy their own State gas.
EDL	00:06:23,487	00:06:25,023	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	And funder road projects that way
EDL	00:06:25,535	00:06:28,095	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Increasing the federal gas tax is not popular
EDL	00:06:28,095	00:06:29,631	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	So politicians have trouble
EDL	00:06:29,631	00:06:30,399	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Will doing it
EDL	00:06:30,399	00:06:32,191	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	But even if they could
EDL	00:06:32,191	00:06:33,471	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	It isn't a great solution
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:39,103	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Obviously if you're going to depend upon the tax on gasoline per gallon
EDL	00:06:39,871	00:06:42,431	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Or replenishing the fund then
EDL	00:06:42,943	00:06:44,479	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	You have to project how
EDL	00:06:44,991	00:06:47,807	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Many gallons of gasoline are going to be used in weather
EDL	00:06:48,319	00:06:49,087	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	That
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:53,951	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Volume of consumption is going to the Be steady or increase and generally we
EDL	00:06:53,951	00:06:55,743	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Expect things like that to increase
EDL	00:06:56,767	00:07:00,351	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Right now people are driving more electric and hybrid vehicles than ever before
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:03,679	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	They still use the roads but they spend less money at the gas
EDL	00:07:04,447	00:07:06,751	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	So Prius owners maybe saving the environment
EDL	00:07:07,263	00:07:09,055	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	But they are mooching off our roads
EDL	00:07:09,823	00:07:10,847	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	It is so hard to do right
EDL	00:07:11,615	00:07:15,711	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	So now there's an option to separate the collecting of taxes needed to maintain the road
EDL	00:07:15,711	00:07:16,735	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	From the consumption
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:17,247	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Can of gasoline
EDL	00:07:17,759	00:07:18,527	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Instead of
EDL	00:07:18,527	00:07:20,831	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Taxing the fuel that used
EDL	00:07:20,831	00:07:21,599	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	You text
EDL	00:07:21,599	00:07:23,647	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	The mileage that the vehicle
EDL	00:07:23,647	00:07:24,927	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Travels on
EDL	00:07:24,927	00:07:25,951	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	State roads
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:27,231	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Regardless of
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:28,767	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Weather at uses fuel or not
EDL	00:07:28,767	00:07:31,327	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	And just to be done in a variety of ways
EDL	00:07:31,327	00:07:33,631	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	At present there are a number
EDL	00:07:34,143	00:07:35,679	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Of pilot program
EDL	00:07:36,191	00:07:38,239	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	That are trying this out
EDL	00:07:38,239	00:07:42,335	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	There are pilot programs that involve self-reporting the number amount edry
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:43,871	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	But the obvious
EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:46,431	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Is David gps-based tracking device
EDL	00:07:46,431	00:07:47,455	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Inside each car
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:49,759	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	And we'll see if that goes anywhere
EDL	00:07:49,759	00:07:52,063	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Because if you're someone who gets freaked out about
EDL	00:07:52,063	00:07:54,879	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	The constitutionality of the federal government building roads
EDL	00:07:55,391	00:08:00,511	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	I'm going to guess that you're not going to be too keen on the federal government installing a tracking device in your
EDL	00:08:00,511	00:08:01,791	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Cardizem
EDL	00:08:02,303	00:08:07,167	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	I suspect it will take at least a decade to replace the gas tax entirely
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:09,215	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	But it will probably come
EDL	00:08:10,239	00:08:12,287	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Infrastructure is all about choices
EDL	00:08:12,287	00:08:13,823	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	When a new bridge is proposed
EDL	00:08:13,823	00:08:16,127	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	There are countless discussions about whether the bridge
EDL	00:08:16,639	00:08:17,407	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Purely functional
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:23,807	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Cheaper or if it should be a signature piece of architecture that attracts International attention
EDL	00:08:24,319	00:08:26,367	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Their cases to be made on either side
EDL	00:08:26,879	00:08:27,647	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Signature
EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:28,671	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Myself
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:33,791	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	But even mundane features like roads involve choices that reverberate for decades
EDL	00:08:34,303	00:08:36,607	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Most roads today that are Interstate roads
EDL	00:08:36,607	00:08:37,631	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Are made of asphalt
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:41,215	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Asphalt advantages of course is it at seamless
EDL	00:08:41,727	00:08:44,543	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	There is a real pleasure and driving on a new
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:45,823	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Black asphalt road
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:49,151	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Plus asphalt can be laid down quickly it's relative
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:50,943	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Cheap and it's easy to patch and repair
EDL	00:08:51,455	00:08:52,223	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	The downside is
EDL	00:08:52,735	00:08:54,015	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	It's not especially durable
EDL	00:08:54,015	00:08:56,063	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	You actually have the patch repair quite a lot
EDL	00:08:56,063	00:08:59,647	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Alternatively you can build a much more durable concrete road
EDL	00:08:59,647	00:09:03,231	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Concrete doesn't offer that smooth seamless ride that ass
EDL	00:09:03,231	00:09:04,255	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Does because
EDL	00:09:04,767	00:09:05,279	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Physics
EDL	00:09:06,047	00:09:07,327	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	With concrete we need
EDL	00:09:07,839	00:09:10,399	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	What are so-called Expansion Joints what appear to be
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:11,679	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Cracks
EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:14,239	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	What are really deliberate lines
EDL	00:09:14,239	00:09:16,287	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Cut into the concrete to allow it
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:18,079	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	The crack in a controlled way
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:23,199	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	The cracks are there so the throat doesn't break into pieces in the concrete contracts and expands due to Bigfoot
EDL	00:09:23,199	00:09:23,967	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Fluctuations in temperature
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:26,783	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	But the tires of a vehicle
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:28,319	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Going over there making noise in
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:31,135	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Vehicle feels it when you're driving on a concrete road
EDL	00:09:33,951	00:09:36,767	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	And the ride is not as smooth as quiet as a
EDL	00:09:36,767	00:09:38,815	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Can be on well-laid asphalt
EDL	00:09:39,327	00:09:42,143	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	In addition concrete roads are more expensive than
EDL	00:09:42,143	00:09:43,935	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Send it to repair and they take long
EDL	00:09:44,447	00:09:48,799	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	But they aren't is prone to potholes and can last a lot longer than asphalt road
EDL	00:09:49,567	00:09:51,103	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	So decisions have to be made
EDL	00:09:51,103	00:09:55,199	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Do we go with the cheaper quicker easier method and save money now
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:09:56,735	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	I'll go with the more expensive
EDL	00:09:56,735	00:10:01,087	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Slower and less pleasing method and hope to save money on repairs and replacement cost
EDL	00:10:01,087	00:10:01,855	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Overtime
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:03,391	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Since so many of these
EDL	00:10:03,391	00:10:06,207	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Decisions are made in a political context
EDL	00:10:06,207	00:10:07,487	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	By people who
EDL	00:10:07,487	00:10:09,791	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Know that they are going to
EDL	00:10:09,791	00:10:11,583	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Probably move on
EDL	00:10:11,583	00:10:13,887	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Before the Patriot Paving has to be
EDL	00:10:13,887	00:10:14,655	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Done
EDL	00:10:14,655	00:10:16,191	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Will generally opt
EDL	00:10:16,191	00:10:18,239	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	For the Lesser expensive
EDL	00:10:18,751	00:10:20,031	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Choice which means ask
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:22,591	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Asphalt is simply cheaper than concrete
EDL	00:10:23,103	00:10:24,383	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	And therein is
EDL	00:10:24,895	00:10:26,175	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	One of the main reasons
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:27,967	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	That we have so much Asphalt in the
EDL	00:10:28,479	00:10:28,991	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Country
EDL	00:10:29,503	00:10:32,063	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	But there is a more radical choice
EDL	00:10:32,063	00:10:34,367	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	In Montpelier Vermont there was a road
EDL	00:10:34,367	00:10:35,135	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Call Bliss route
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:36,159	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Which was in a terrible
EDL	00:10:36,159	00:10:36,927	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	State of disrepair
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:37,695	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	For many years
EDL	00:10:37,695	00:10:40,767	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	It'll finally in 2009
EDL	00:10:41,279	00:10:43,839	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Unpaved the road turn it into a dirt and gravel road
EDL	00:10:44,351	00:10:46,143	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	It's in 27 States
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:49,215	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	It's have also unpaid some of their roads for the same reason
EDL	00:10:49,215	00:10:51,519	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	I wondered if it was a clever solution or just
EDL	00:10:52,031	00:10:52,799	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Demoralizing
EDL	00:10:53,567	00:10:55,103	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	I've heard about that
EDL	00:10:55,103	00:10:58,943	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	And that it does seem like a pretty clever solution it's
EDL	00:10:58,943	00:11:02,783	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Probably not a very popular solution among the paving contractors
EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:03,295	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	For example
EDL	00:11:04,831	00:11:11,231	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	It would it would depend on the nature of this road if this is a road that doesn't have especially heavy traffic
EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:13,279	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Not a lot of heavy truck traffic
EDL	00:11:13,279	00:11:15,071	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	It might work from an engineering
EDL	00:11:15,071	00:11:15,839	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	Point of view
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:19,167	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	When the Eastern span of the Bay Bridge
EDL	00:11:19,167	00:11:21,215	| 99pi-0227-theroadtaken-1 |	It's about to open in 2013
