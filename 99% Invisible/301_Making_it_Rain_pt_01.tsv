EDL	00:03:34,272	00:03:36,576	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Tradition and our heritage and our
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:42,720	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Education in our history all prepared us for a different kind of War
EDL	00:03:42,720	00:03:44,768	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Then we had to fight in the lake

EDL	00:03:45,536	00:03:47,328	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	This is General Merrill McPeak

EDL	00:03:51,936	00:03:55,520	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	And we weren't facing a enemy at least of the beginning
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:03:59,104	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	That was equipped with tanks and flamethrowers and
EDL	00:03:59,616	00:04:02,944	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	High-speed you know computers and so forth
EDL	00:04:03,712	00:04:05,504	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	It was a total Miss mismatch
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:07,808	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	That's from that standpoint it was us against the
EDL	00:04:08,576	00:04:12,672	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	A guerrilla Army that showed up occasionally and then disappeared vanished
EDL	00:04:13,952	00:04:15,232	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Spent the next day
EDL	00:04:15,744	00:04:19,839	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	No months looking for it and then it showed up Suddenly and then was gone again
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:22,143	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	That gorilla Army was the Viet Cong
EDL	00:04:22,655	00:04:23,679	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Communist Sports
EDL	00:04:23,679	00:04:26,751	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Allied with North Vietnam but fighting primarily in the south
EDL	00:04:27,263	00:04:29,311	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	One of the vietcong's greatest advantages
EDL	00:04:29,311	00:04:30,591	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Was the Ho Chi Minh trail
EDL	00:04:30,591	00:04:33,151	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Supply route that ran from North Vietnam
EDL	00:04:33,151	00:04:35,967	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Two parts of Laos and Cambodia into South Vietnam
EDL	00:04:36,479	00:04:38,527	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Hundreds of thousands of North Vietnamese troops
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:40,831	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Used it to infiltrate the South
EDL	00:04:40,831	00:04:42,111	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Weapons and supplies
EDL	00:04:42,623	00:04:46,463	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Travel through an isolated region full of rugged mountains and dense jungle
EDL	00:04:46,975	00:04:50,047	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	The trail itself is made up of dirt paths in handmade tunnel
EDL	00:04:50,559	00:04:52,607	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Along the way there were hidden bunkers
EDL	00:04:52,607	00:04:53,375	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Barracks
EDL	00:04:53,375	00:04:55,935	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Even hospitals cleverly camouflaged from above
EDL	00:04:56,447	00:05:00,287	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	It was a engineering Marvel that wasn't a single Road
EDL	00:05:01,311	00:05:04,127	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	It was a network of Amazing Frog
EDL	00:05:05,407	00:05:10,015	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	The covert trail system dramatically shortened the journey from North to South Vietnam
EDL	00:05:10,015	00:05:13,343	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Many more troops more weapons and more North Vietnamese
EDL	00:05:13,343	00:05:16,415	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Pork be made available to Communist forces in the south
EDL	00:05:16,927	00:05:19,999	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	And the key thing was that's how all their supplies
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:23,583	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Sa Supply both the Viet Cong and also
EDL	00:05:24,095	00:05:25,119	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Their own forces
EDL	00:05:25,631	00:05:26,911	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	I had to come down that trail
EDL	00:05:27,423	00:05:29,727	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	This is Lieutenant General Ed's oyster
EDL	00:05:29,727	00:05:34,591	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	And in order to cut off the supplies with your course very important for military operation
EDL	00:05:35,103	00:05:37,663	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	We had to close this Trail by various means
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:40,991	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	The US military tried disrupting the trail with
EDL	00:05:40,991	00:05:41,759	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Bombing campaign
EDL	00:05:42,271	00:05:44,319	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Am I plowing the jungles to strip the land
EDL	00:05:44,831	00:05:47,903	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	They also use deadly chemical defoliants like Agent Orange
EDL	00:05:48,671	00:05:49,951	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	But none of these
EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:50,463	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	It seemed to work
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:52,511	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	At least not for very long
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:55,327	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	So whenever we punched a hole in one part of it
EDL	00:05:56,095	00:05:58,143	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	They simply moved over to
EDL	00:05:58,143	00:05:59,167	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	I know a bypass
EDL	00:06:00,191	00:06:01,983	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	There was only one thing
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:06,335	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Significantly slowed the flow of supplies and people on ho chi Minh trail
EDL	00:06:07,615	00:06:08,127	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Rain
EDL	00:06:08,639	00:06:09,919	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	The reality was that
EDL	00:06:10,431	00:06:11,967	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Because of the nature of the trail
EDL	00:06:12,735	00:06:14,271	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	It was affected by heavy rainfall
EDL	00:06:15,039	00:06:19,391	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	So they had the same problem of course as we did in terms of trails that were
EDL	00:06:19,391	00:06:20,159	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Very very
EDL	00:06:20,159	00:06:20,671	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Marty
EDL	00:06:21,439	00:06:22,207	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	What the rain
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:24,511	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	The mud would make the trails difficult to navigate
EDL	00:06:25,279	00:06:26,815	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	And so during one month since
EDL	00:06:27,327	00:06:28,607	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	In the middle of the war
EDL	00:06:28,607	00:06:29,631	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Somebody
EDL	00:06:29,631	00:06:30,655	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Certainly not me
EDL	00:06:30,655	00:06:33,983	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Came up with the idea of let's see if we can increase the rainfall
EDL	00:06:34,495	00:06:36,031	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Enough to stop vehicle
EDL	00:06:36,031	00:06:36,543	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Qatar traffic
EDL	00:06:37,055	00:06:39,103	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	The Department of Defense design it

EDL	00:06:40,383	00:06:41,663	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Control the weather
EDL	00:06:42,175	00:06:46,783	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	This was the beginning of a top-secret military project called operation Popeye
EDL	00:06:47,295	00:06:50,367	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	The goal was to actually create more rain in Southeast Asia
EDL	00:06:50,879	00:06:54,719	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	They artificially extending and intensifying the naturally-occurring monsoon season
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:58,559	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	The monsoon season typically lasted from April to October
EDL	00:06:59,071	00:07:01,631	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	US military believe that if it could extend it

EDL	00:07:03,423	00:07:07,007	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	It would create a huge strategic advantage
EDL	00:07:09,311	00:07:11,615	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Humans especially military humans
EDL	00:07:11,615	00:07:14,175	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Have wanted to control the weather for a long time
EDL	00:07:14,687	00:07:16,223	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Because pets who up

EDL	00:07:19,807	00:07:21,087	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	This is Jim Fleming
EDL	00:07:21,087	00:07:24,927	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	He studied the history of human attempts at weather and climate modification
EDL	00:07:25,439	00:07:27,743	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	He doesn't think very highly of our abilities
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:33,375	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Turns out that if you do a rain dance for up to two weeks it'll probably rain and then you can take credit for that
EDL	00:07:37,471	00:07:40,799	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	And consistently enough it'll rain and you can claim responsibility
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:44,639	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Funny says that in the 19th century after the Civil War
EDL	00:07:44,639	00:07:46,175	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	A theory begin to develop
EDL	00:07:46,175	00:07:51,295	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	That major military operations Were Somehow disrupting the clouds and causing big rain storms
EDL	00:07:51,295	00:07:55,391	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	We could shoot Cannon
EDL	00:07:55,391	00:07:58,207	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Fireworks
EDL	00:07:58,719	00:08:00,767	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	We could sort of imitate battle
EDL	00:08:00,767	00:08:03,839	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Imitate battle in order to create rain
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:07,423	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	The federal government actually attended this in Texas in the 1890s

EDL	00:08:12,031	00:08:13,823	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	And they had a weather bureau Observer there
EDL	00:08:14,591	00:08:20,479	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	The locals love
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:24,831	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	It was during the monsoon season
EDL	00:08:25,343	00:08:27,647	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	It was a really good chance was going to rain anyway
EDL	00:08:30,207	00:08:34,815	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	This kind of experimentation continued from the 1890s into the early twentieth
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:35,583	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Century
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:37,887	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	It only accelerated after 19

EDL	00:08:40,959	00:08:43,263	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	And we just invented the bomb
EDL	00:08:43,263	00:08:46,591	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	And that technology made people think they had power over nature
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:51,967	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Those are heightened are paranoid that other countries were trying to develop their own nature controlling technology
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:53,247	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Like the Russians
EDL	00:08:53,759	00:08:56,063	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Before the space race with the Soviet Union
EDL	00:08:56,575	00:08:58,367	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	There was a kind of weather race
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:09:00,927	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	We thought they might get ahead of us
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:05,791	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	And if they had a nefarious purpose they might be able to change our weather and climate in
EDL	00:09:06,303	00:09:07,583	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Possibly caused
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:11,423	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Unlike another dust forward or drought or something if they really could do it
EDL	00:09:11,423	00:09:15,007	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	So there's a great rush to get into this field again
EDL	00:09:15,007	00:09:16,287	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Driven by military
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:16,799	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Concerns
EDL	00:09:17,311	00:09:20,895	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	There was a lot of money being poured into scientific research on whether
EDL	00:09:20,895	00:09:21,663	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	A control
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:25,247	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	And while many of these experiments didn't yield very promising results
EDL	00:09:25,247	00:09:26,271	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	One actually did
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:27,807	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	In 1946
EDL	00:09:32,927	00:09:36,511	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	The weather
EDL	00:09:42,655	00:09:45,983	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	This remarkable achievement happened in Schenectady New York
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:47,519	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Are the offices of General Electric
EDL	00:09:48,031	00:09:48,799	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Yep
EDL	00:09:48,799	00:09:52,639	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	The same company that made your dishwasher also invented weather control
EDL	00:09:52,639	00:09:59,039	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	GE was where scientist and Nobel Laureate and Irving Langer was working in collaboration with a colleague
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:10:00,063	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Vincent Schaefer
EDL	00:10:00,063	00:10:05,439	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Who developed a technique of dry ice put into a cloud that would make it super cool
EDL	00:10:06,207	00:10:07,999	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	And force it to be
EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:09,791	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Conditions to go below freezing
EDL	00:10:10,303	00:10:12,095	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	A little bit of ice in the cloud
EDL	00:10:12,095	00:10:14,911	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Could cause a cloud to play shade or creates snow
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:18,495	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	In case you didn't quite get that here's a quick lesson in 8th grade cloudphysics
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:23,103	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Clouds are essentially just tiny droplets of water
EDL	00:10:23,103	00:10:23,871	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Suspended in the atmosphere
EDL	00:10:24,639	00:10:26,431	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	When the right conditions occur
EDL	00:10:26,431	00:10:30,271	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Water molecules in these clouds will condense together and become heavy enough
EDL	00:10:30,271	00:10:31,807	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	The fall to Earth as rain or snow
EDL	00:10:32,575	00:10:34,623	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	And that's what Schaefer had figured out how to do
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:39,487	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	He figured out how to create the conditions in the clown such that it would produce rain or snow
EDL	00:10:39,999	00:10:44,863	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	In parallel with that breakthrough there was another guy doing instrumental work at GE
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:47,423	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	His name was Bernard or Bernie Vonnegut
EDL	00:10:47,935	00:10:49,215	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	The brother of author
EDL	00:10:49,215	00:10:52,799	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Kurt Vonnegut who also worked at GE in the PR department
EDL	00:10:53,311	00:10:54,591	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	And it's interesting
EDL	00:10:54,591	00:10:58,943	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	You can actually see the ways that GE influence some of vonnegut's writing
EDL	00:10:58,943	00:11:00,735	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Kurt was on staff at GE
EDL	00:11:01,247	00:11:02,271	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Writing a history
EDL	00:11:03,039	00:11:05,343	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Reports when he was also working on novels
EDL	00:11:06,367	00:11:07,135	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Play Cat's Cradle
EDL	00:11:07,903	00:11:09,183	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	In which the
EDL	00:11:09,183	00:11:13,791	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	The mad scientist kind of like in Irving Langer person develops Ice Nine which
EDL	00:11:14,559	00:11:15,583	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Messes up the environment
EDL	00:11:16,095	00:11:18,911	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Ice Nine was kind of like cloud seeding on steroid
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:21,727	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	It's clear that Bernie and Kurt
EDL	00:11:21,727	00:11:22,751	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	These two brothers
EDL	00:11:22,751	00:11:24,799	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Chris were uneasy about some of the brakes
EDL	00:11:24,799	00:11:25,823	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	If they were involved with
EDL	00:11:26,335	00:11:28,895	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	And I think you'll see some of Bernie's concerns
EDL	00:11:28,895	00:11:30,943	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Reflected in Kurt vonnegut's novels
EDL	00:11:31,711	00:11:32,991	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Which are pretty much
EDL	00:11:32,991	00:11:34,527	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Against the militarization
EDL	00:11:35,295	00:11:36,063	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Of nature
EDL	00:11:36,063	00:11:40,671	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	The Bernese work at GE actually helped lay the groundwork for that militarization
EDL	00:11:41,183	00:11:42,975	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Along with linear and Schaefer
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:44,255	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	She made another credit
EDL	00:11:44,255	00:11:44,767	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Call Discovery
EDL	00:11:45,279	00:11:49,631	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	He found a new weather-related use for a compound called Silver iodide
EDL	00:11:50,143	00:11:52,191	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	It had a hexagonal structure
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:52,959	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Like a snowflake
EDL	00:11:53,471	00:11:55,519	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	And he found that if you sprayed it into a cloud
EDL	00:11:56,031	00:11:58,079	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	It would trick the cloud in the glaciated
EDL	00:11:58,591	00:11:59,359	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	And so
EDL	00:11:59,359	00:12:01,151	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Armed with a Nobel Prize winner
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:03,967	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	A technique to super cool cloud

EDL	00:12:05,503	00:12:08,063	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	And a technique to trick a cloud with silver iodide
EDL	00:12:08,575	00:12:10,111	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	They really felt they had
EDL	00:12:10,111	00:12:11,903	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	The basis for chemical cloud seeding
EDL	00:12:13,183	00:12:16,767	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	GE was understandably very proud of their discovery
EDL	00:12:16,767	00:12:18,047	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	And so they
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:21,119	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Officiate a great big press release it said we can control the weather
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:27,263	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	But shortly after claiming responsibility for a storm that caused 8 inches of snowfall in Upstate New York
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:31,615	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	GE suddenly realize that they might not want to be known for controlling the weather
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:34,687	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Especially if that weather was destroying people's

EDL	00:12:41,599	00:12:44,927	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Given the risk of negative public reaction and liability

EDL	00:14:03,263	00:14:04,799	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	It wasn't a new technology
EDL	00:14:05,311	00:14:07,103	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	It was still a closely held Secret
EDL	00:14:07,615	00:14:10,175	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Operation Popeye was a Navy program
EDL	00:14:10,175	00:14:11,711	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Admissions were flown by air for

EDL	00:14:12,479	00:14:15,551	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	And as Pilots were given limited information about what they were doing

EDL	00:14:18,879	00:14:21,439	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	That group was doing until
EDL	00:14:21,951	00:14:23,487	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	We got over there and
EDL	00:14:23,487	00:14:23,999	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Showed up
EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:27,327	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	For the briefing
EDL	00:14:27,327	00:14:28,351	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	They told us what
EDL	00:14:28,863	00:14:30,399	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	This project is about
EDL	00:14:30,911	00:14:34,239	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	This is Brian Heckman a former Air Force pilot
EDL	00:14:34,239	00:14:36,799	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	He belongs to the 54th weather reconnaissance Squad
EDL	00:14:37,567	00:14:43,199	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	They contributed to the 2602 cloud seeding missions flown during operation Popeye

EDL	00:14:52,159	00:14:54,207	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Anyway to see if the cloud produce rainfall
EDL	00:14:54,719	00:14:57,023	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	There were times when we left an area
EDL	00:14:57,023	00:14:58,303	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	That we have been working
EDL	00:14:59,327	00:15:01,119	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	And it was obvious that
EDL	00:15:01,631	00:15:03,423	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	There was a lot of rain storms going on
EDL	00:15:04,191	00:15:06,239	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Operation Popeye at form an object

EDL	00:15:08,287	00:15:09,311	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Cause landslides

EDL	00:15:10,335	00:15:11,615	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	To washout River Crossing
EDL	00:15:12,127	00:15:14,687	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	And to keep roads muddier for longer than usual
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:18,015	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	It seemed to Heckman that operation Popeye was working
EDL	00:15:18,527	00:15:20,063	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	But it's really hard to know for sure
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:23,135	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Cloud seeding at the time and even today
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:25,183	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Far from an exact science
EDL	00:15:25,183	00:15:27,231	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	At best a military could measure three things
EDL	00:15:27,999	00:15:29,791	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	What's the average rainfall for that area was
EDL	00:15:30,303	00:15:32,095	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	What's the estimated rainfall would have been
EDL	00:15:32,607	00:15:34,655	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	And what actually fell after receiving mission
EDL	00:15:35,167	00:15:36,191	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	But they couldn't collect
EDL	00:15:36,191	00:15:37,215	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	That much data
EDL	00:15:37,215	00:15:39,775	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Like enough to really rigorously analyze the outcome
EDL	00:15:40,543	00:15:41,311	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Hughes Plumbing again
EDL	00:15:41,823	00:15:44,383	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	The rain is completely a variable
EDL	00:15:44,383	00:15:45,919	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	You have tremendous
EDL	00:15:45,919	00:15:46,943	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Temporal variability
EDL	00:15:47,711	00:15:48,735	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Spatial variability
EDL	00:15:49,247	00:15:52,063	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	And that means that statistics are not robust about
EDL	00:15:53,087	00:15:55,391	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Your particular intervention did to that
EDL	00:15:55,391	00:15:55,903	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Particular
EDL	00:15:56,415	00:15:56,927	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Rainfall
EDL	00:15:57,439	00:15:59,487	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	And even if they could make it rain
EDL	00:15:59,487	00:16:02,303	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	They couldn't precisely control where that rain landed
EDL	00:16:02,815	00:16:07,679	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	One official described accidentally dumping a ton of rain on the American Special Forces
EDL	00:16:08,703	00:16:12,799	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Still the program was deemed effective enough to continue for 5 years

EDL	00:16:17,919	00:16:22,783	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	But the biggest problem with operation Popeye wasn't so much the lack of quantifiable success
EDL	00:16:22,783	00:16:24,575	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	What's the many ethical concerns
EDL	00:16:25,087	00:16:26,367	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Weather modification
EDL	00:16:26,367	00:16:27,903	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Especially in the context of War
EDL	00:16:27,903	00:16:29,439	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Resalat of thorny question
EDL	00:16:30,207	00:16:35,583	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	The military Justified the program by arguing that increasing rainfall to Grandma and wash out roads
EDL	00:16:36,095	00:16:37,119	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Wood preferable

EDL	00:16:38,399	00:16:39,935	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	But the reality is
EDL	00:16:39,935	00:16:45,311	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	The US military still dropped a lot of bombs on southeast Asia during the Vietnam war
EDL	00:16:45,823	00:16:47,359	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Over 7 million
EDL	00:16:47,359	00:16:47,871	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Tons of them
EDL	00:16:48,639	00:16:49,919	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	So many in fact
EDL	00:16:49,919	00:16:51,199	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	That to this day
EDL	00:16:51,199	00:16:52,735	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	The government of Laos is
EDL	00:16:52,735	00:16:56,831	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Still trying to clean up all of the undetonated bomb scattered across the country

EDL	00:16:59,391	00:17:01,951	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	We dropped more bombs on Laos than
EDL	00:17:02,463	00:17:06,303	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	And we did on Germany and Japan all together in World War II
EDL	00:17:07,071	00:17:09,119	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Show the tonnage of of
EDL	00:17:09,119	00:17:10,911	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Bomb dropped was enormous
EDL	00:17:11,679	00:17:13,983	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	And the heavily-used
EDL	00:17:13,983	00:17:14,495	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Parts
EDL	00:17:15,007	00:17:17,055	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Of the Ho Chi Minh trail
EDL	00:17:17,055	00:17:18,591	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Look like the face of the Moon
EDL	00:17:19,103	00:17:22,175	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	It was just a lunar landscape nothing but dust
EDL	00:17:24,479	00:17:27,551	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	But just as it's unclear how much rain was generated
EDL	00:17:28,319	00:17:29,087	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Popeye
EDL	00:17:29,087	00:17:33,951	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	It's also unclear if Popeye actually prevented the military from dropping more bombs
EDL	00:17:34,719	00:17:35,743	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Or if they die
EDL	00:17:35,743	00:17:36,255	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Did both
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:39,583	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	And messing with another country's weather system
EDL	00:17:40,095	00:17:42,911	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	That has potentially bigen unpredictable consequences
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:46,239	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	You don't necessarily know what the long-term consequences

EDL	00:19:45,535	00:19:46,815	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Try to
EDL	00:19:47,839	00:19:49,631	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Intervene animations weather like that
EDL	00:19:50,143	00:19:52,703	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Research money for weather control rapidly disappeared
EDL	00:19:53,215	00:19:59,359	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	And in 1977 the US signed an international agreement called the environmental modification convention treaty
EDL	00:19:59,871	00:20:00,895	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Orin mod
EDL	00:20:00,895	00:20:01,663	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	For sure
EDL	00:20:01,663	00:20:04,223	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	How long did the Soviet Union and many other nations
EDL	00:20:04,223	00:20:07,039	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	They agreed to ban modification of the environment
EDL	00:20:07,039	00:20:07,807	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Pravda purposes
EDL	00:20:08,319	00:20:10,879	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	The treaty outlawed causing earthquakes and tsunamis
EDL	00:20:11,391	00:20:13,951	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Steering hurricanes or tampering with the ionosphere
EDL	00:20:14,719	00:20:18,815	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	It also banned any other widespread long-lasting and severe damage the environment
EDL	00:20:19,327	00:20:22,655	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	But there are questions about whether the end mod treaty was even that relevant
EDL	00:20:22,655	00:20:24,447	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Missouri easy to ban
EDL	00:20:24,447	00:20:25,727	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Environmental Warfare
EDL	00:20:26,239	00:20:29,567	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	The reason was easy to ban is because you're not giving up anything
EDL	00:20:30,335	00:20:34,175	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Because those things no longer work considered to be
EDL	00:20:34,175	00:20:35,711	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Important parts of the RC
EDL	00:20:35,711	00:20:37,247	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	They were developed during a Time
EDL	00:20:37,759	00:20:38,527	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	When
EDL	00:20:39,039	00:20:41,087	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	The US wanted to develop a lot of different weapons
EDL	00:20:41,599	00:20:43,135	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	But by the time you get to the
EDL	00:20:43,903	00:20:46,463	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	If there was going to be a war with the Soviet Union
EDL	00:20:46,463	00:20:47,487	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	It was going to be a noob
EDL	00:20:47,487	00:20:50,559	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Clear war was going to be a war in which thermonuclear weapons were used
EDL	00:20:51,071	00:20:53,887	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Intercontinental ballistic missiles were probably going to be used
EDL	00:20:53,887	00:20:57,471	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	And so Hamblin believes that giving up environment to Warfare
EDL	00:20:57,471	00:20:59,007	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Was more a gesture
EDL	00:20:59,007	00:21:02,591	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Of global cooperation rather than an actual step towards the storm
EDL	00:21:03,103	00:21:09,503	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	After all it's hard to find something that can cause more widespread long lasting or severe damage to the environment than nuclear
EDL	00:21:09,503	00:21:11,295	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Their weapons are not banned

EDL	00:21:13,343	00:21:15,903	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	You could argue yes sir it's progress but
EDL	00:21:16,416	00:21:19,744	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	I would encourage us all to take a more cynical view of that and
EDL	00:21:19,744	00:21:23,328	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	And see that it was signed for very political purposes and really gave
EDL	00:21:23,328	00:21:24,608	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Virtually nothing
EDL	00:21:28,704	00:21:31,776	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	The military interest in weather control had run its course
EDL	00:21:31,776	00:21:34,080	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	The cloud seeding is something that still takes

EDL	00:21:36,896	00:21:37,408	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Money

EDL	00:21:44,320	00:21:45,344	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	To the travel industry
EDL	00:21:45,856	00:21:50,464	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	More than 50 countries openly have some form of weather modification program
EDL	00:21:50,464	00:21:54,560	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	China attempted to use cloud seeding to clear skies over the Beijing Olympics
EDL	00:21:55,072	00:21:59,424	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	There's even a company in the UK that offers a wedding package that includes cloud seeding
EDL	00:21:59,936	00:22:02,240	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Can be used to burst rain clouds and make them

EDL	00:22:06,848	00:22:09,664	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	And that will only set you back about $150,000
EDL	00:22:11,712	00:22:15,040	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	As the conversation shifts away from the Cold War

EDL	00:22:21,440	00:22:22,976	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Suggestions have been thrown around like
EDL	00:22:23,488	00:22:26,816	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Brightening the clouds to reflect radiation back into space
EDL	00:22:26,816	00:22:30,912	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Or spraying reflective particles into the stratosphere to cool down the planet
EDL	00:22:31,424	00:22:33,472	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	People propose giant space umbrella
EDL	00:22:33,984	00:22:36,544	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	We're even trying to change the orbit of the Earth
EDL	00:22:36,544	00:22:37,312	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	So that it's
EDL	00:22:37,312	00:22:38,848	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Slightly farther from the Sun
EDL	00:22:39,872	00:22:41,664	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Changing the weather is one thing
EDL	00:22:41,664	00:22:45,248	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	But changing the climate on a permanent scale is next level modeling
EDL	00:22:46,784	00:22:48,320	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Many people are highly doubt

EDL	00:22:57,280	00:23:00,864	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	That's the main issue do we have a right to mess around with a right to Tinker with things

EDL	00:23:15,200	00:23:18,784	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	It's pretty much hubris to think we can intervene in predictable ways

EDL	00:26:25,920	00:26:26,944	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	The morbid
EDL	00:26:26,944	00:26:29,248	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Distinction of being the most bombed country
EDL	00:26:29,248	00:26:30,272	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Per capita in world
EDL	00:26:31,296	00:26:32,064	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	And it still
EDL	00:26:32,064	00:26:32,576	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Holds that
EDL	00:26:33,344	00:26:35,392	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	It's hard to wrap my mind around the counter
EDL	00:26:35,904	00:26:38,464	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Hundreds of millions a how is that even pause
EDL	00:26:39,232	00:26:41,792	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Well a lot of the devices that got dropped work
EDL	00:26:41,792	00:26:42,304	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Cluster bomb
EDL	00:26:42,816	00:26:46,912	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Basically these consist of hollow metal shells that open up on the way down
EDL	00:26:47,424	00:26:49,984	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	And deploy hundreds of smaller explosive

EDL	00:26:50,752	00:26:52,032	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Which are about
EDL	00:26:52,032	00:26:52,800	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	The size of tennis ball
EDL	00:26:53,824	00:26:57,664	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	And the US flew over 500000 missions into Laos
EDL	00:26:57,664	00:26:58,688	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	To drop these and other types
EDL	00:26:59,200	00:26:59,712	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Explosives
EDL	00:27:00,224	00:27:04,064	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	So the larger sell the big bomb is released the casing and it's his little
EDL	00:27:04,064	00:27:06,624	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Bomblet seen inside the bigger shell that would
EDL	00:27:06,624	00:27:07,392	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Spread out
EDL	00:27:07,392	00:27:07,904	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Explode when they
EDL	00:27:08,672	00:27:10,464	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Well they were designed to at least
EDL	00:27:10,464	00:27:12,256	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	But they actually had a really high failure
EDL	00:27:13,024	00:27:14,816	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Is many is 1/3 of those bombers
EDL	00:27:14,816	00:27:15,840	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Didn't detonate
EDL	00:27:15,840	00:27:16,608	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	An impact
EDL	00:27:16,608	00:27:18,144	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Leaving the country littered with
EDL	00:27:18,144	00:27:20,192	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Close to a hundred million unexploded device
EDL	00:27:21,216	00:27:23,264	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	And when the bombing finally stopped and 19
EDL	00:27:23,264	00:27:24,032	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	33
EDL	00:27:24,032	00:27:26,080	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Les oceans were left to deal with the aftermath
EDL	00:27:26,592	00:27:31,456	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	So the begin cleaning the landscape but they also started collecting the shells in the scraps
EDL	00:27:31,456	00:27:32,224	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	They found
EDL	00:27:32,224	00:27:33,504	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	And putting them to use another
EDL	00:27:34,016	00:27:35,296	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	And you mean the bigger
EDL	00:27:35,808	00:27:38,368	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Outer shell casings or these little bum
EDL	00:27:39,136	00:27:45,536	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Little bit of both and other types of bombs to but those big hollow metal shells in particular yet they turned out to
EDL	00:27:45,536	00:27:47,072	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	To be really useful at least
EDL	00:27:47,072	00:27:48,352	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	The ones that were relatively intact
EDL	00:27:49,120	00:27:51,168	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Some of the larger ones have been turned into things like
EDL	00:27:51,168	00:27:51,680	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Canoes
EDL	00:27:52,192	00:27:54,496	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Other mid-sized ones have been lined up
EDL	00:27:54,496	00:27:57,824	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Form the walls of buildings or used as spilled flick
EDL	00:27:57,824	00:27:58,848	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Tap houses off the ground
EDL	00:27:59,616	00:28:01,152	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Orchid pots
EDL	00:28:01,152	00:28:01,664	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Plants
EDL	00:28:02,176	00:28:06,272	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	And even the really small scrap can be melted down for other purposes
EDL	00:28:06,272	00:28:09,600	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Is like making jewelry or silverware or cowbells or
EDL	00:28:09,600	00:28:10,112	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Other things
EDL	00:28:10,880	00:28:12,160	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	And overtime
EDL	00:28:12,160	00:28:17,024	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Finding recycling the shells in Scotts is actually grown into this unlikely National Industry
EDL	00:28:17,024	00:28:21,120	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	So around the Laotian Countryside you can see tons of Bombshells baked into built
EDL	00:28:22,400	00:28:24,448	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	This story has this patina

EDL	00:28:27,264	00:28:28,032	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Really

EDL	00:28:31,360	00:28:32,896	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	But they have to deal with
EDL	00:28:32,896	00:28:34,944	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	These deadly devices that we dropped on
EDL	00:28:36,224	00:28:36,736	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Yeah it's
EDL	00:28:37,248	00:28:38,784	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	It's really very sad and
EDL	00:28:38,784	00:28:40,064	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Aside from the people who
EDL	00:28:40,064	00:28:40,832	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Who died
EDL	00:28:40,832	00:28:42,368	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Initially even those bombs were dropped
EDL	00:28:42,880	00:28:45,184	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Tens of thousands of people that actually died
EDL	00:28:45,184	00:28:46,976	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Duda detonations in the decade since
EDL	00:28:47,744	00:28:50,816	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	And even now hundreds of people are injured or killed

EDL	00:28:51,584	00:28:52,096	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Explosion
EDL	00:28:52,608	00:28:53,376	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Sometimes
EDL	00:28:53,376	00:28:54,400	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Gather up
EDL	00:28:56,192	00:28:59,008	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	So they've been cleaning up for Renewal since 1970
EDL	00:28:59,008	00:29:00,288	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	We three are they anywhere close
EDL	00:29:00,288	00:29:00,800	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	How to clean up on
EDL	00:29:01,312	00:29:01,824	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Not really
EDL	00:29:02,336	00:29:05,664	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Non-profit organizations that are working on this problem actively
EDL	00:29:05,664	00:29:06,944	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Still have to make that it will
EDL	00:29:06,944	00:29:08,736	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Will take decades or even a Century II
EDL	00:29:09,248	00:29:09,760	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Clean up the rest
EDL	00:29:11,040	00:29:12,832	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	And it's this Legacy in Paris
EDL	00:29:12,832	00:29:13,856	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	That is caused
EDL	00:29:13,856	00:29:17,184	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Over a hundred Nations to get on board with this convention of cluster munition
EDL	00:29:17,696	00:29:19,744	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Which is an international agreement.
EDL	00:29:19,744	00:29:21,280	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	To make or use or
EDL	00:29:21,280	00:29:22,048	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Transfer cluster
EDL	00:29:22,816	00:29:23,584	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	And I take it the United
EDL	00:29:24,096	00:29:25,376	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Is not one of the countries
EDL	00:29:25,376	00:29:26,912	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	That signed on to the convention.
EDL	00:29:26,912	00:29:27,424	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Cluster munition
EDL	00:29:27,936	00:29:31,520	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Correct the US military clearly didn't take away
EDL	00:29:31,520	00:29:33,568	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Is some of the same lessons that other countries did from
EDL	00:29:34,080	00:29:35,616	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	What happened in the Vietnam War
EDL	00:29:36,896	00:29:37,664	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Well it's
EDL	00:29:37,664	00:29:39,712	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Fastening to see how people in Lost
EDL	00:29:39,712	00:29:41,760	| 301_Making_it_Rain_pt_01 |	Managed to make something useful out of these devices
