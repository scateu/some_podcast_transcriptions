EDL	00:08:50,431	00:08:56,319	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	And as he is doing his work as a botanist in the 1920s he starts to get into this idea that

EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:06,303	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Because he might be able to breathe

EDL	00:09:45,727	00:09:49,055	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Remarkable way I mean he really was a superstar
EDL	00:09:49,055	00:09:52,383	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Up there with Charles Darwin and other people that we could mention
EDL	00:09:59,295	00:10:01,599	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	So we've been talking about Nikolai Babolat

EDL	00:10:24,127	00:10:25,663	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	And his altruism
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:28,223	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	In over his career vasilov does something that's
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:28,991	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Pretty incredible
EDL	00:10:29,503	00:10:35,135	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	He and his team of scientists together hundreds of thousands of different kinds of seeds from 64
EDL	00:10:36,159	00:10:38,975	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	It takes over 100 different expeditions to do that
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:42,559	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	He's like Russia's Indiana Jones of seed collection
EDL	00:10:43,071	00:10:44,863	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	And he's super charismatic
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:46,911	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	He's handsome he's good at raising money
EDL	00:10:47,423	00:10:48,703	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	But he's not without his

EDL	00:10:56,639	00:10:58,943	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	I think I'll start out as a student of Babylon
EDL	00:10:59,455	00:11:00,735	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Babbel app encourages him
EDL	00:11:01,247	00:11:04,319	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	But then listen kid gets into this weird pseudoscience
EDL	00:11:04,319	00:11:06,367	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	PepperJax the idea of genetics
EDL	00:11:07,135	00:11:10,975	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	And he becomes this like Auntie science-based agriculture guy
EDL	00:11:10,975	00:11:16,607	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Which is little odd because he also becomes the head of the Academy of Agricultural Science
EDL	00:11:17,631	00:11:19,167	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Wisynco doesn't like Babylon

EDL	00:11:27,103	00:11:28,383	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	You can almost guess
EDL	00:11:28,383	00:11:29,151	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	What happens next
EDL	00:11:31,199	00:11:32,223	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Davila
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:36,063	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Without on another collecting expedition in the caucasus
EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:41,951	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Found what he believed was a new subspecies of wild wheat that could be very effective because it was so
EDL	00:11:42,463	00:11:43,231	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Drought tolerant
EDL	00:11:43,743	00:11:46,559	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	And as he was coming back to his vehicle
EDL	00:11:47,071	00:11:49,631	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Several black
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:52,447	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Unmarked cars from the KGB or its

EDL	00:11:57,823	00:11:59,871	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Doesn't scientist on the expedition
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:02,687	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Bevilacqua scuttled away
EDL	00:12:02,687	00:12:03,711	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	And disappeared
EDL	00:12:04,479	00:12:05,759	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	From public site
EDL	00:12:06,527	00:12:11,135	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	So Babylon is thrown into a prison in Leningrad AKA Saint Peter
EDL	00:12:11,903	00:12:13,695	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	His family doesn't know where he is

EDL	00:12:24,703	00:12:26,495	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	His mission has a headquarters
EDL	00:12:26,495	00:12:29,823	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	It's this building at 44 person Street in St Petersburg
EDL	00:12:30,591	00:12:31,615	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Kiss staff
EDL	00:12:33,407	00:12:33,919	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Sort of
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:40,575	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Came together they adored this man and said we can't let anything happen to this collection we don't know what's going to happen
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:42,111	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	And so they put
EDL	00:12:42,111	00:12:43,903	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	325 of there
EDL	00:12:43,903	00:12:44,671	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Staffers
EDL	00:12:44,671	00:12:46,975	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	On duty 24 hours a day
EDL	00:12:46,975	00:12:49,023	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	And sealed off 18 rooms
EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:51,583	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Because there was another threat
EDL	00:12:51,583	00:12:52,863	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	About to hit
EDL	00:12:52,863	00:12:53,887	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Saint Petersburg
EDL	00:12:54,399	00:12:57,215	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	The siege of Leningrad starts in 1941
EDL	00:12:57,727	00:13:00,543	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	A year after Babolat disappears into a ghoul
EDL	00:13:01,567	00:13:04,895	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	This prison is a stone's throw from his family home
EDL	00:13:04,895	00:13:08,991	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Battle Ops family members passed by without even knowing he is right there
EDL	00:13:08,991	00:13:09,503	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	In prison
EDL	00:13:10,527	00:13:12,319	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	The siege of Leningrad is unique
EDL	00:13:12,319	00:13:13,343	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	And that it last
EDL	00:13:13,343	00:13:15,391	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Almost the entire War
EDL	00:13:15,391	00:13:16,927	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Nearly 900 days
EDL	00:13:17,695	00:13:21,279	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	The city is cut off on the North By The Finnish Army in the South by the German
EDL	00:13:21,791	00:13:26,655	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	And at the time it is one of the most destructive attacks on a major city in known history
EDL	00:13:27,423	00:13:28,447	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Constant bombing
EDL	00:13:28,447	00:13:29,471	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Lack of food and water
EDL	00:13:29,983	00:13:33,055	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	People actually rush into the craters after bombs drop
EDL	00:13:33,055	00:13:35,103	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Because water gathers in the crater
EDL	00:13:35,871	00:13:37,151	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	That's how they get their water
EDL	00:13:37,663	00:13:40,735	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	And through all of this people are starving to death in letting go
EDL	00:13:41,503	00:13:42,271	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Everyone
EDL	00:13:42,271	00:13:44,319	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Russian soldiers government officials
EDL	00:13:44,831	00:13:48,159	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Also the families of the scientists who are protecting

EDL	00:13:51,231	00:13:56,351	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	They're putting the location of the bank in the fact that it is full of food
EDL	00:13:56,351	00:13:58,143	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Seeds rice legumes
EDL	00:13:58,655	00:13:59,935	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	In the metaphorical vault
EDL	00:14:00,447	00:14:01,215	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	They're not
EDL	00:14:01,215	00:14:02,239	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Telling anyone
EDL	00:14:02,239	00:14:04,031	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	And they are really freaking out by the way
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:09,407	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Because Hitler is rumored to be really focused on capturing the seeds in this feedback
EDL	00:14:10,175	00:14:11,711	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	As part of his world domination f

EDL	00:16:20,479	00:16:21,759	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	And so did the mission
EDL	00:16:21,759	00:16:26,111	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	The svalbard seed vault in Norway is a direct descendant of a Velociraptor

EDL	00:17:53,663	00:17:55,711	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Let's go back to Marie haga forum
EDL	00:17:55,711	00:18:00,063	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Whose team of scientists recently opened svalbard seed Vault on that
EDL	00:18:00,063	00:18:01,855	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Frozen island in the Arctic
EDL	00:18:01,855	00:18:03,903	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Ocean so here's a question
EDL	00:18:04,415	00:18:06,207	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	If he's Country Store
EDL	00:18:06,207	00:18:07,999	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Seeds are for free
EDL	00:18:07,999	00:18:13,119	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Who's playing that song bird electric bill like like who pays for the seed Vault to exist
EDL	00:18:13,119	00:18:14,655	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Great question I asked
EDL	00:18:14,655	00:18:15,423	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	To Murrieta
EDL	00:18:15,423	00:18:17,215	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Our organization is
EDL	00:18:17,727	00:18:19,519	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	First and foremost funded
EDL	00:18:19,519	00:18:20,543	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Bye
EDL	00:18:20,543	00:18:21,567	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Government
EDL	00:18:22,079	00:18:25,919	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	But increasingly the crop trust is trying to work with the private sector
EDL	00:18:26,431	00:18:28,223	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Ann Marie give me an example
EDL	00:18:28,223	00:18:32,575	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	We have address developed a conservation strategy
EDL	00:18:32,575	00:18:33,343	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	For coffee
EDL	00:18:34,367	00:18:36,671	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Coffee happens to be very climate sensitive
EDL	00:18:37,439	00:18:40,255	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	And that is why we think
EDL	00:18:40,255	00:18:43,839	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Badsha the major coffee companies over the world
EDL	00:18:43,839	00:18:45,375	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Who get involved in lava rock
EDL	00:18:46,143	00:18:48,703	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	And also contribute to finding it
EDL	00:18:49,727	00:18:56,127	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	I for one am very glad that the organization trying to protect the world's food crops from a doomsday scenario
EDL	00:18:56,127	00:18:58,175	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Is also working on keeping
EDL	00:18:58,175	00:18:58,943	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Coffee around
EDL	00:18:58,943	00:19:00,479	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Yeah I think we're going to need
EDL	00:19:00,479	00:19:01,759	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Coffee after the
EDL	00:19:02,783	00:19:04,319	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	But for Murray of course
EDL	00:19:04,319	00:19:05,087	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	It's bigger than coffee
EDL	00:19:05,855	00:19:06,879	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	You know I

EDL	00:21:16,928	00:21:19,232	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Then it may be time to seek help
EDL	00:21:19,232	00:21:25,632	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Go to oh my God. Info podcast we can learn more about your symptoms that's oh my God
EDL	00:21:25,632	00:21:27,680	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Infowars podcast
EDL	00:21:27,680	00:21:28,192	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Oh my God
EDL	00:21:29,216	00:21:29,984	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Fox podcast
EDL	00:21:31,520	00:21:36,384	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Okay so we're back with 99 Pi producer Emmett Fitzgerald and he's with us because
EDL	00:21:36,384	00:21:39,200	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	He was actually looking into doing a story on Babylon
EDL	00:21:39,200	00:21:43,040	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Artio while back and it didn't pan out for a bunch of boring reasons
EDL	00:21:43,040	00:21:45,856	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	So when I heard the endless thread version I was like what
EDL	00:21:45,856	00:21:48,160	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Play that one because we love the story
EDL	00:21:48,160	00:21:50,976	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	But you actually done some interviews on the subject already
EDL	00:21:51,488	00:21:55,840	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Yeah and as I was researching it I found out about this other seat
EDL	00:21:55,840	00:21:59,936	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Back this one is based in Syria and it's run by an organization called a
EDL	00:21:59,936	00:22:00,704	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Carter
EDL	00:22:00,704	00:22:06,336	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	And that stands for the International Center for agricultural research in dry air
EDL	00:22:06,336	00:22:07,104	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Areas
EDL	00:22:07,104	00:22:08,896	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	And I actually spoke with
EDL	00:22:08,896	00:22:11,456	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Former director of a card at muscamoot Sula
EDL	00:22:11,456	00:22:13,760	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	My name is Mohamed Salah
EDL	00:22:13,760	00:22:20,160	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	I'm the former director general of the International Center for agricultural research in dry areas
EDL	00:22:20,160	00:22:25,024	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	And just like Nikolai vavilov when Mahmood was a young plant scientist
EDL	00:22:25,024	00:22:28,096	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	She said off on on his own seed collecting Journey
EDL	00:22:28,096	00:22:29,120	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	And where did he go
EDL	00:22:29,632	00:22:32,448	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	So she went through all these Central Asian countries places like
EDL	00:22:32,448	00:22:34,752	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Jordan Lebanon Iraq
EDL	00:22:34,752	00:22:37,568	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Turkey elected in Afghanistan
EDL	00:22:37,568	00:22:38,848	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	In August
EDL	00:22:38,848	00:22:40,384	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	1974
EDL	00:22:40,896	00:22:43,456	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	And at that time Afghanistan
EDL	00:22:43,456	00:22:45,248	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	It was a peaceful country
EDL	00:22:45,760	00:22:47,040	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	That was a beautiful country
EDL	00:22:49,088	00:22:53,184	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Ubf mountains of pistachio trees in Afghanistan
EDL	00:22:53,184	00:22:58,560	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Mahmoud drove all over Afghanistan in this little Jeep looking for in a wild lentils
EDL	00:22:59,072	00:22:59,584	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Chickpeas
EDL	00:23:00,096	00:23:00,864	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Pistachios
EDL	00:23:00,864	00:23:01,632	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	What you're talking about
EDL	00:23:03,680	00:23:07,776	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Inspired by Nikki literally following in Babylon footsteps
EDL	00:23:08,288	00:23:09,056	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Or at least
EDL	00:23:09,056	00:23:09,824	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	At least I was trying
EDL	00:23:10,336	00:23:11,360	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Like that time
EDL	00:23:12,128	00:23:13,408	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	I had the map
EDL	00:23:13,920	00:23:20,320	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Very low where did he go so I was trying to follow the routes but rule Afghanistan
EDL	00:23:20,320	00:23:21,344	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Extremely mountainous
EDL	00:23:21,856	00:23:22,880	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Too mountainous
EDL	00:23:22,880	00:23:23,392	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	For the Jeep
EDL	00:23:23,904	00:23:25,696	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Turned out we would love to go
EDL	00:23:26,208	00:23:29,280	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Does certain areas without going on a
EDL	00:23:29,280	00:23:31,072	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Back of a horse or a donkey
EDL	00:23:31,840	00:23:32,608	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	You know because
EDL	00:23:33,120	00:23:35,168	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Those areas are so narrow
EDL	00:23:35,168	00:23:36,448	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Sost
EDL	00:23:36,448	00:23:39,776	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	But to be honest with you even in 74
EDL	00:23:40,288	00:23:43,616	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	We could not follow what very low bid
EDL	00:23:43,616	00:23:45,408	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	In the earlier years
EDL	00:23:45,408	00:23:48,224	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	And that's why you really admire this man
EDL	00:23:48,224	00:23:50,784	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	You know he was certainly a remarkable person
EDL	00:23:51,296	00:23:54,368	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	So what happened to all the seeds that collected
EDL	00:23:54,368	00:23:57,952	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	So those seeds were the beginning of the year card at collection
EDL	00:23:58,464	00:24:04,864	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	And a cart of basically works with farmers in dry parts of the world and then one of the ways that they help them is by cancer
EDL	00:24:04,864	00:24:08,704	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Serving and also breeding drought-tolerant varieties of different crops
EDL	00:24:09,216	00:24:12,544	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Collectible huge variety of C
EDL	00:24:12,544	00:24:14,592	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	From Farmers all over the Middle East
EDL	00:24:14,592	00:24:15,360	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	East and North Africa
EDL	00:24:15,360	00:24:18,688	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	They've got one of the world's largest collections of drought tolerant
EDL	00:24:18,688	00:24:19,712	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Including
EDL	00:24:19,712	00:24:21,248	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Thousands of varieties
EDL	00:24:21,248	00:24:23,808	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	The barley and lentil and fava beans
EDL	00:24:23,808	00:24:27,648	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	And 4 years this collection was stored in the facility in Aleppo
EDL	00:24:27,648	00:24:28,416	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Syria
EDL	00:24:28,416	00:24:31,488	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Which I can see the problem
EDL	00:24:31,488	00:24:37,888	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Right and when violence broke out in that country in 2011 the plant scientist
EDL	00:24:37,888	00:24:38,656	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Starting to get worried about the
EDL	00:24:39,680	00:24:43,008	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	And so they sent some collective The Collection to other CB
EDL	00:24:43,008	00:24:43,520	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Banks around the world
EDL	00:24:44,032	00:24:45,312	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	They were creating
EDL	00:24:45,312	00:24:46,080	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Duplicate
EDL	00:24:46,080	00:24:48,384	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	The Collection you know in order to safeguard
EDL	00:24:48,384	00:24:52,224	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	All that material and then and then eventually they were forced to it to level up
EDL	00:24:52,992	00:24:54,784	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	But we got the seats out
EDL	00:24:54,784	00:24:56,064	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Before
EDL	00:24:56,064	00:24:59,136	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	The staff Polly had to abandon the research station
EDL	00:24:59,136	00:25:00,160	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	This is
EDL	00:25:00,160	00:25:04,512	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Harry Fowler and he's actually the founder of the svalbard global seed vault which
EDL	00:25:04,512	00:25:06,048	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Suite we heard about in DMs
EDL	00:25:06,048	00:25:06,816	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Spread peace
EDL	00:25:06,816	00:25:08,352	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	And Fowler end up
EDL	00:25:08,352	00:25:10,912	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Calling up my mood and an inviting him to
EDL	00:25:10,912	00:25:12,192	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Store some of the Carters
EDL	00:25:12,192	00:25:14,240	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Seeds up in up in the Norwegian Arctic
EDL	00:25:14,240	00:25:15,776	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	We got them up to svalbard
EDL	00:25:16,800	00:25:21,408	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	When it became clear that those researchers were not going to be able to go back to their insta
EDL	00:25:21,408	00:25:21,920	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Esthetician
EDL	00:25:22,688	00:25:27,808	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Leggett re-establish themselves in Morocco and Lebanon date they ask for their
EDL	00:25:27,808	00:25:30,880	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	There's a collection back so they could re-establish their
EDL	00:25:30,880	00:25:31,392	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Receipt Bank
EDL	00:25:31,904	00:25:35,744	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	This is actually the first time that anyone had taken seeds back out of the
EDL	00:25:35,744	00:25:36,768	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Svalbard seafall
EDL	00:25:36,768	00:25:37,792	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	And they use those
EDL	00:25:37,792	00:25:39,584	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Lucy is that Pepin store there in that
EDL	00:25:40,096	00:25:41,376	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Tunnel in the mountain
EDL	00:25:41,376	00:25:43,424	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	To create two new seed banks
EDL	00:25:43,424	00:25:45,728	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	One in Morocco and one in Lebanon
EDL	00:25:46,240	00:25:49,568	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	So it's almost like they had this external backup hard drive their computer
EDL	00:25:50,080	00:25:55,968	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	At unit something happens to the physical computer you've still got all the data in this case all the seeds with
EDL	00:25:55,968	00:25:57,504	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Backed up somewhere else
EDL	00:25:57,504	00:25:58,528	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	To start anew
EDL	00:25:58,528	00:25:59,552	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Seed bank somewhere else
EDL	00:26:00,064	00:26:02,112	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Yeah yeah that's exactly right that's
EDL	00:26:02,112	00:26:04,416	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Analogy that a lot of people use and you know
EDL	00:26:04,416	00:26:08,256	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	There are seeds in a Carter's collection that you can't find anywhere else
EDL	00:26:08,768	00:26:13,888	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	So the consequences of not having that back up could be
EDL	00:26:13,888	00:26:14,656	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Catastrophic
EDL	00:26:15,168	00:26:17,728	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	You know in the past this would likely
EDL	00:26:17,728	00:26:18,752	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	This kind of event
EDL	00:26:18,752	00:26:19,520	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Would like
EDL	00:26:19,520	00:26:21,312	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Likely have led to Extinction
EDL	00:26:22,336	00:26:24,640	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	And in this case I think it's pretty clear that
EDL	00:26:24,640	00:26:25,664	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	That would be the
EDL	00:26:25,664	00:26:28,480	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Extinction of something terribly valuable
EDL	00:26:28,480	00:26:30,016	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	2 world agriculture
EDL	00:26:30,016	00:26:32,320	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Because you can imagine that drought and Heat
EDL	00:26:32,320	00:26:34,112	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Tolerant varieties of wheat
EDL	00:26:34,112	00:26:34,880	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Barley went
EDL	00:26:34,880	00:26:35,392	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Is Chickpea in
EDL	00:26:35,904	00:26:37,696	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Weather going to be in high demand and that's
EDL	00:26:37,696	00:26:38,464	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	What's the place you got to get
EDL	00:26:39,232	00:26:41,024	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Sweetest name to hear a story
EDL	00:26:41,024	00:26:42,560	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Of the seed bank
EDL	00:26:42,560	00:26:43,584	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Not just being this
EDL	00:26:44,096	00:26:44,864	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Potential
EDL	00:26:44,864	00:26:45,632	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	To save us
EDL	00:26:45,632	00:26:46,400	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Really
EDL	00:26:47,168	00:26:47,936	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	It was used
EDL	00:26:47,936	00:26:52,288	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	As it was meant to be to take him seeds and then send them out into the world
EDL	00:26:52,288	00:26:53,312	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	To stop
EDL	00:26:53,312	00:26:57,152	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	What could be a potential Extinction of a species it's kind of stomach
EDL	00:26:57,152	00:26:57,920	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	What an action
EDL	00:26:58,432	00:27:03,808	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	It's interesting as people refer to it often as the Doomsday vaults and there's this kind of
EDL	00:27:04,320	00:27:07,904	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	This kind of expectation that it's it's just waiting around for the Apocalypse
EDL	00:27:07,904	00:27:09,952	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Casinos that we could then use the seeds
EDL	00:27:09,952	00:27:16,352	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Regrow Mina restart our civilization or something but but Fowler actually see that is having a much more active role
EDL	00:27:16,352	00:27:17,120	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	What is this kind of like
EDL	00:27:17,632	00:27:20,448	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	You know this her backup hard drive for others
EDL	00:27:20,448	00:27:22,240	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	Seed banks around the world so that if you
EDL	00:27:22,240	00:27:24,032	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	If you run into trouble you can
EDL	00:27:24,032	00:27:27,104	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	You can store your receipts there and then and then take him out when he did again
EDL	00:27:27,872	00:27:28,640	| 309_The_Vault_pt01 |	It seems like
