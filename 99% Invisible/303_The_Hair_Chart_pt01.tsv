EDL	00:04:53,375	00:04:58,239	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Like a lot of black women I spent years putting chemical relaxers in my hair to straighten it
EDL	00:04:58,239	00:05:01,823	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	It actually never even occurred to me not to relax my hair
EDL	00:05:02,591	00:05:05,919	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Until I was living in Cuba where relaxers were hard to come by
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:08,479	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	And so one day in Cuba
EDL	00:05:08,479	00:05:10,271	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	I just decided to do
EDL	00:05:10,271	00:05:11,039	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	The big
EDL	00:05:11,039	00:05:11,551	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Chop
EDL	00:05:12,319	00:05:14,879	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	To cut my hair and let it grow back natural
EDL	00:05:15,647	00:05:16,927	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	It felt like a big deal
EDL	00:05:17,439	00:05:19,487	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	For a while I didn't even know how to manage it
EDL	00:05:19,999	00:05:23,583	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Sometimes I felt frumpy with my short tight hair that I couldn't even come through
EDL	00:05:24,095	00:05:26,399	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	I put on bright red lipstick and big hoop earrings
EDL	00:05:26,911	00:05:29,215	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Anything to get through what some people call

EDL	00:05:32,799	00:05:34,847	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	All of this was a big change
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:38,175	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Not just the hair but how people reacted to me
EDL	00:05:38,943	00:05:42,783	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	In Cuba I went from being called mulata which is more of a mixed girl

EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:51,743	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	I felt pretty lost
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:54,047	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	So I turn to YouTube

EDL	00:07:06,495	00:07:07,263	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	And not in the field
EDL	00:07:08,031	00:07:09,567	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	This idea of good hair
EDL	00:07:09,567	00:07:10,591	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	And bad hair
EDL	00:07:10,591	00:07:12,383	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	All developed during slavery
EDL	00:07:12,383	00:07:17,247	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Your hair was the closer it was too white textured hair
EDL	00:07:17,247	00:07:18,527	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	The better it was

EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:27,231	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	And she says the common belief back then was
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:30,047	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	If you had straighter hair you probably had
EDL	00:07:30,047	00:07:30,815	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	More

EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:36,959	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	After slavery ended
EDL	00:07:36,959	00:07:39,007	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	These racist beauty standards hang on
EDL	00:07:39,775	00:07:41,567	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	In the early 1900s
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:46,175	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Some people try to straighten their hair by putting oil on it and then wrapping it with
EDL	00:07:46,175	00:07:46,943	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Heated flannel
EDL	00:07:47,455	00:07:49,759	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Mother's Reven wrapping their children's hair

EDL	00:07:51,295	00:07:52,319	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	A lot of hair damage
EDL	00:07:52,831	00:07:56,671	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Black churches in certain cities that would hang a column on the front door
EDL	00:07:56,671	00:08:00,767	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	And if your hair is you couldn't calm your hair with that then you couldn't worship
EDL	00:08:00,767	00:08:01,279	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	At that church
EDL	00:08:02,047	00:08:03,583	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	In the 1920s
EDL	00:08:03,583	00:08:05,375	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Hot cam for used to treat in hair
EDL	00:08:05,887	00:08:08,191	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	And then came a hairstyle known as The Conch
EDL	00:08:08,959	00:08:12,799	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	You can see it on famous jazz musicians like Cab Calloway and Duke Ellington
EDL	00:08:13,823	00:08:15,871	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	The Conch was the name of the style
EDL	00:08:15,871	00:08:18,175	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	But it was also the name of the relaxer itself
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:20,735	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Which was made with a harsh chemical
EDL	00:08:20,735	00:08:22,015	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Cut sodium hydroxide
EDL	00:08:22,527	00:08:23,295	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Rely
EDL	00:08:23,295	00:08:28,671	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	And it's essentially just ate away at your hair and your scalp and cause a lot of serious Burns
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:30,207	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	And they were not safe
EDL	00:08:31,231	00:08:32,767	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Some people made their own conch
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:37,631	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Sometimes with two white potatoes and egg and Red Devil brand lye
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:40,703	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	A combo that left many Scouts bleeding
EDL	00:08:41,727	00:08:43,775	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	The conky eventually went out of style
EDL	00:08:44,287	00:08:49,663	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	But relaxers made with sodium hydroxide continued on and became more and more popular
EDL	00:08:50,431	00:08:53,503	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	The wash-and-set and under the dryer with a magazine
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:56,063	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Became up very common image in Black salons
EDL	00:08:58,111	00:08:58,623	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	But then
EDL	00:08:59,135	00:09:00,159	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	In the 1960s
EDL	00:09:00,671	00:09:02,463	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Something different started Rising
EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:15,519	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	The Civil Rights Movement brought on the beginning of a new shift
EDL	00:09:15,519	00:09:17,311	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	It was all about embracing black
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:20,383	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	And this man embracing your natural hair
EDL	00:09:20,895	00:09:23,711	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	My mom aunties they all do the big chop

EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:27,807	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Loud and proud
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:31,647	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Does rabbit hear myself all of us were born without hair like this
EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:32,927	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	And we just wear like this
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:37,535	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	This is an interview from 1968 with former Black Panther
EDL	00:09:37,535	00:09:40,351	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Kathleen Cleaver
EDL	00:09:40,351	00:09:44,703	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	We're told that only white people were beautiful only straight hair light eyes
EDL	00:09:44,703	00:09:45,727	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Light skin

EDL	00:09:46,495	00:09:47,263	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	And so
EDL	00:09:47,263	00:09:52,639	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Black women with try everything they could straighten their hair lightening skin to look as much like white women
EDL	00:09:52,639	00:09:59,039	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Dickinson's changed because black people are where and
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:10:04,159	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	White people aware of the two because white people now one not perfect they won't wigs like this
EDL	00:10:04,159	00:10:08,511	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Isn't it beautiful
EDL	00:10:11,839	00:10:14,399	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Natural hair and afros were everywhere
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:19,263	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	From The Fluffy froze of the Jackson 5 to White celebrities like Barbra Streisand
EDL	00:10:19,775	00:10:20,799	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Copying from
EDL	00:10:20,799	00:10:23,615	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Was the first time that the relaxer industry
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:26,175	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	The chemical relaxer industry is really taking a hit
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:27,199	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Financially
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:29,759	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	And not as many people were chemically
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:30,783	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Straightening their hair
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:32,831	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Instead of straighteners
EDL	00:10:32,831	00:10:35,647	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	For the first time people racing products that were meant to
EDL	00:10:35,647	00:10:37,183	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	The compliment their natural hair
EDL	00:10:37,695	00:10:38,463	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Like Afro Sheen
EDL	00:10:38,975	00:10:41,023	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Which gave the afro a bit more shine
EDL	00:10:41,023	00:10:43,327	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	I made it glisten like a Halo in the sunlight
EDL	00:10:54,591	00:10:57,663	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Even if I froze continue to be an important Style
EDL	00:10:57,663	00:10:59,199	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	In the 1980s
EDL	00:10:59,199	00:11:01,247	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	A new chemical hairdo was on the rise

EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:04,575	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	1 2 3
EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:15,327	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	A Jheri curl created a bigger looser curl pattern
EDL	00:11:15,839	00:11:18,911	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	It was a turn away from the political statement of Afro
EDL	00:11:19,679	00:11:20,703	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	The Jheri curl
EDL	00:11:20,703	00:11:22,495	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Was all about fun
EDL	00:11:27,871	00:11:30,431	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	So the ads really shifted away
EDL	00:11:30,431	00:11:31,967	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	I from having anything to do with
EDL	00:11:32,991	00:11:38,111	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Black culture and community building and black identity and some more to just

EDL	00:11:48,607	00:11:51,423	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Although nothing about the Jheri curl was easy
EDL	00:11:51,935	00:11:54,495	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Jerry curls were the most product
EDL	00:11:54,495	00:11:55,007	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Heavy

EDL	00:11:56,799	00:12:02,687	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	That I think any people have ever known black people white people doesn't matter like to have a Jerry curl you had to have
EDL	00:12:02,687	00:12:04,223	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	All that activator in
EDL	00:12:04,223	00:12:08,063	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	It's so much stuff and you had to use it every single day
EDL	00:12:08,063	00:12:09,855	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	The Jheri curl was a very

EDL	00:12:12,671	00:12:17,791	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	The activator that you had to put in your hair everyday with drippy and greasy and your pillow would be

EDL	00:12:22,655	00:12:23,935	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	I know all of this
EDL	00:12:23,935	00:12:25,215	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Because when I was a kid
EDL	00:12:25,215	00:12:25,983	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	I had one
EDL	00:12:32,895	00:12:36,991	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	When a Jerry curl fade it out regular old relaxers were still an option
EDL	00:12:37,503	00:12:40,575	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	And I went back to a relaxer to
EDL	00:12:41,343	00:12:45,695	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Then in 2009 Comedian Chris Rock produced a documentary called

EDL	00:12:51,071	00:12:54,655	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	In the documentary he refers to chemical relaxers as creamy crack
EDL	00:12:55,167	00:12:58,751	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Because they're applied in a white paste and even though they're toxic
EDL	00:12:58,751	00:12:59,775	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Some people
EDL	00:12:59,775	00:13:00,543	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Can't seem to
EDL	00:13:00,543	00:13:01,311	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Quit them
EDL	00:13:01,311	00:13:07,455	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	In one scene he shows just how harsh the chemicals found in many relaxers can be he needs help with this camera

EDL	00:14:02,495	00:14:04,031	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Which amazingly is called
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:05,311	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Girlfriend

EDL	00:14:10,687	00:14:11,711	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	That's how I came up with
EDL	00:14:13,247	00:14:18,367	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Smith tells me that even though the Chris Rock movie brought up some deep-rooted stuff that we need to talk about
EDL	00:14:19,135	00:14:21,439	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	It also did actually affect her business
EDL	00:14:22,207	00:14:25,279	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	People used to come in every 6 to 8 weeks to get relaxers
EDL	00:14:26,047	00:14:30,399	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Some women would spend well over $1,000 a year on regular treatments in salon
EDL	00:14:31,423	00:14:33,471	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	I think the Chris Rock movie
EDL	00:14:33,471	00:14:34,495	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Had an effect on all that
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:39,359	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	For a minute I was bad at a cousin
EDL	00:14:40,127	00:14:43,199	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Why because it was affecting my money

EDL	00:14:59,327	00:15:04,959	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Today black consumer spending on relaxers is down 30% since 2011
EDL	00:15:05,471	00:15:08,287	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	And this brings us back to Andre Walker's hair chart
EDL	00:15:08,799	00:15:10,847	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	All of these newly natural people
EDL	00:15:11,359	00:15:12,895	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	I getting on YouTube for advice
EDL	00:15:13,663	00:15:18,783	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	I'm discovering the chart unbeknownst to me I was on the internet one day and
EDL	00:15:20,319	00:15:21,087	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Pence
EDL	00:15:21,087	00:15:24,415	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	List by reading some bloggers and they were referring to
EDL	00:15:24,927	00:15:27,999	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Andre Walker hair typing system in like
EDL	00:15:27,999	00:15:30,559	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Did I do that except the one I wrote about in my book
EDL	00:15:31,327	00:15:34,911	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	These days Oliver YouTube their people referencing Andres chart
EDL	00:15:35,423	00:15:38,495	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Which remember categorizes hair from 1 to 4
EDL	00:15:39,007	00:15:41,055	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	When a being looser curls
EDL	00:15:41,055	00:15:42,847	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	M4c being the tightest
EDL	00:15:43,615	00:15:45,919	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	I'm just going to be braiding my hair
EDL	00:15:46,431	00:15:47,455	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	So I can get
EDL	00:15:48,223	00:15:49,503	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	My Afro
EDL	00:15:49,503	00:15:50,527	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	To be like rounded
EDL	00:15:50,527	00:15:51,039	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Into the front
EDL	00:15:51,807	00:15:55,135	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Their videos on the best creams for a 4B twist out
EDL	00:15:55,647	00:15:58,719	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Or how many times a week you should wash your 3B hair
EDL	00:15:58,719	00:15:59,487	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Order
EDL	00:15:59,487	00:16:02,303	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Protective styles for your 4C hair
EDL	00:16:02,303	00:16:05,375	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	At first I found this all really helpful and positive
EDL	00:16:06,143	00:16:08,703	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	I mean it's great that more people are going natural
EDL	00:16:08,703	00:16:11,519	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	And it's great that there's a system to help them to do it
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:17,407	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	But then a few people started noticing that even in this new online community of natural
EDL	00:16:17,919	00:16:23,039	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	A lot of the videos were just reinforcing old bias about straighter hair being better
EDL	00:16:23,551	00:16:27,903	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	The videos often instruct women about how to go from very kinky hair to less kinky
EDL	00:16:28,415	00:16:28,927	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Straighter hair
EDL	00:16:29,695	00:16:33,023	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	So like from a 4C to 3B without using chemicals
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:35,327	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	But still implying that
EDL	00:16:35,327	00:16:36,351	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Straighter is better
EDL	00:16:36,351	00:16:37,887	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Serenity hair like vest
EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:40,703	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Terminating a campaign
EDL	00:16:40,703	00:16:41,983	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	But you do see

EDL	00:16:53,247	00:16:55,039	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	We should be given room to speak
EDL	00:16:55,807	00:16:57,343	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	That's a plus one flower
EDL	00:16:57,343	00:16:58,623	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	A popular blogger
EDL	00:16:58,623	00:17:01,951	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Who makes a lot of Straight Talk self-care types of videos
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:03,487	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	People like ourselves
EDL	00:17:03,487	00:17:06,815	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	You don't have hair that grows downwards our hair grows
EDL	00:17:08,351	00:17:09,119	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Even if my hair
EDL	00:17:09,119	00:17:10,911	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	It feels the slumflower and others
EDL	00:17:11,423	00:17:13,215	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Like online natural hair talk
EDL	00:17:13,727	00:17:16,799	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Is mostly about how to transform what we have into something else
EDL	00:17:17,823	00:17:19,103	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Something a little looser
EDL	00:17:19,615	00:17:21,919	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	That's not what our hair naturally does
EDL	00:17:22,687	00:17:24,735	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	And they're using Audrey's chart to do it
EDL	00:17:24,735	00:17:28,575	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	There has been a lot of criticism against a lot of natural hair websites
EDL	00:17:28,575	00:17:32,671	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	But they focus too much on quote-unquote 3B hair as opposed to 4C hair
EDL	00:17:33,183	00:17:34,463	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	And that the tighter
EDL	00:17:34,463	00:17:35,231	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Your crawl
EDL	00:17:35,999	00:17:40,863	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Pattern is and the kinky or your hair is the less represent it you are on the site
EDL	00:17:42,655	00:17:47,007	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	One woman I talked to said the chart feels to her like a modern-day pencil test
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:50,335	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Which was a test used in apartheid South Africa
EDL	00:17:50,335	00:17:52,639	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	To figure out if someone was white or black
EDL	00:17:53,407	00:17:55,455	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	If you put a pencil in someone's hair
EDL	00:17:55,455	00:17:56,991	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	And the pencil fell out
EDL	00:17:56,991	00:17:58,271	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	The person passed
EDL	00:17:58,271	00:17:59,551	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	And was considered white
EDL	00:18:00,831	00:18:05,439	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Skywalker says he just wanted to make a variety of products for different kinds of hair
EDL	00:18:05,951	00:18:08,767	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	It wasn't all his intention to create a hierarchy
EDL	00:18:08,767	00:18:11,327	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	People have asked me why did I label
EDL	00:18:11,327	00:18:14,143	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Straight hair is number one in kinky hair is number
EDL	00:18:14,143	00:18:15,679	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	For I also asked him
EDL	00:18:16,191	00:18:18,239	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	But my answer to that is
EDL	00:18:18,239	00:18:22,591	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	It's going from zero texture to highly textured so going from one
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:25,407	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Being straight to for being the kinkiest
EDL	00:18:26,175	00:18:27,967	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	And I've had people
EDL	00:18:30,527	00:18:32,575	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	That have been very sensitive about that
EDL	00:18:32,575	00:18:33,343	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Because
EDL	00:18:33,343	00:18:36,415	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	They thought that I was given kinky hair
EDL	00:18:36,415	00:18:37,183	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Left
EDL	00:18:37,183	00:18:38,463	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Important
EDL	00:18:38,463	00:18:40,255	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	By putting it in number four
EDL	00:18:40,767	00:18:43,839	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	And giving straight hair more important by being number one
EDL	00:18:44,607	00:18:47,935	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	But that just goes to show you how sensitive
EDL	00:18:47,935	00:18:49,983	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	You know hair is hair and texture is
EDL	00:18:50,495	00:18:52,031	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	You know for a lot of people
EDL	00:18:52,543	00:18:53,055	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	It's true
EDL	00:18:53,823	00:18:55,615	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	It's so so sensitive
EDL	00:18:56,383	00:18:58,687	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	And even though a lot more women are going natural
EDL	00:18:59,199	00:19:01,503	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	There are still so many who just don't want to
EDL	00:19:02,015	00:19:05,343	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Maybe they like the way their hair look straightened or find it easier to manage
EDL	00:19:06,111	00:19:09,439	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Or just don't want to deal with other people's reactions to their natural hair
EDL	00:19:10,975	00:19:14,815	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Pocket girlfriend hooked me up hair salon event voice of some guy
EDL	00:19:14,815	00:19:18,399	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Says she isn't the least bit concerned with Andres hair chart
EDL	00:19:18,911	00:19:20,191	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Because she doesn't want to go natural
EDL	00:19:21,727	00:19:22,495	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	I don't know that
EDL	00:19:23,007	00:19:23,775	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Look
EDL	00:19:23,775	00:19:25,567	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	I feel is not for me
EDL	00:19:25,567	00:19:27,103	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	There's just this
EDL	00:19:27,871	00:19:28,895	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Should I say fear
EDL	00:19:30,175	00:19:31,455	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Or discomfort
EDL	00:19:31,455	00:19:33,503	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	You know I'm not going to show up to an interview with braids
EDL	00:19:34,015	00:19:36,063	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Or fro or anything like that
EDL	00:19:36,063	00:19:37,855	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	My hair is going to be
EDL	00:19:37,855	00:19:40,415	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	As straight as it possibly can be
EDL	00:19:40,415	00:19:41,951	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Because as much as
EDL	00:19:41,951	00:19:44,255	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	I like it or don't like it
EDL	00:19:44,255	00:19:46,303	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	We still live in a society where
EDL	00:19:46,303	00:19:48,095	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Our hair is not accepted
EDL	00:19:49,119	00:19:50,655	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	For what it is in
EDL	00:19:50,655	00:19:51,423	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	You have to
EDL	00:19:51,423	00:19:52,447	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	To play the game to win it
EDL	00:19:55,007	00:19:55,775	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	There is
EDL	00:19:55,775	00:20:00,895	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	So much racism and colorism and years of painful history Tangled Up in all of this
EDL	00:20:01,663	00:20:02,943	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	It's deeply personal
EDL	00:20:03,711	00:20:06,527	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	And for those of us who have decided to go natural
EDL	00:20:06,527	00:20:11,135	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	It would be nice to see the hair conversation shift away from how to change our hair
EDL	00:20:11,135	00:20:14,463	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	And more towards how to manage the natural texture we were born with
EDL	00:20:15,487	00:20:16,511	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	Because my hair
EDL	00:20:17,023	00:20:18,047	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	It's still a crown
EDL	00:20:19,071	00:20:20,863	| 303_The_Hair_Chart_pt01 |	No matter where on the chart I land
