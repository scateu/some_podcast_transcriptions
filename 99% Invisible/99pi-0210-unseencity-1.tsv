EDL	00:02:57,152	00:03:03,552	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	I start out by asking if angelwood ascendant rope was

EDL	00:03:25,568	00:03:29,408	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Starlings that are growing generation after generation your attic
EDL	00:03:29,920	00:03:36,320	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And I've always been kind of a wannabe naturalist is interested in these types of things but
EDL	00:03:36,320	00:03:37,344	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	For some reason
EDL	00:03:37,856	00:03:39,648	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	These particular
EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:40,672	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Creatures
EDL	00:03:40,672	00:03:42,464	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Always seems like they weren't Worthy
EDL	00:03:42,976	00:03:44,000	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	A real study
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:46,048	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And so I kind of ignored them
EDL	00:03:46,048	00:03:47,584	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Until I had
EDL	00:03:47,584	00:03:48,608	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Baby girl
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:51,168	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And she didn't ignore them she was
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:53,472	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Incredibly interested in these creatures
EDL	00:03:53,472	00:03:54,240	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And
EDL	00:03:54,240	00:03:56,544	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	So I started looking at them too
EDL	00:03:56,544	00:04:01,920	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And when I started looking at them in the way that she did through these fresh eyes I started seeing things
EDL	00:04:01,920	00:04:02,944	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	But I've never seen before
EDL	00:04:03,712	00:04:09,600	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And that was really cool because you know you can go out into the woods and find something new that you've never seen before and it's like
EDL	00:04:09,600	00:04:10,368	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	That's amazing
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:11,904	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	But it's
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:13,440	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Even more magical
EDL	00:04:13,440	00:04:15,488	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	When it's been there right in front of you
EDL	00:04:15,488	00:04:18,303	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Day after day right underneath your nose and then you
EDL	00:04:18,303	00:04:20,351	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Are able to look at it in new way
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:21,375	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And see something that's
EDL	00:04:22,143	00:04:22,911	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Just pops out
EDL	00:04:22,911	00:04:23,423	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And is it
EDL	00:04:24,447	00:04:25,983	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Do you remember the first thing that she
EDL	00:04:25,983	00:04:27,263	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Pointed out that you
EDL	00:04:27,263	00:04:28,543	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Felt like you had
EDL	00:04:28,543	00:04:29,823	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Define answer for
EDL	00:04:30,591	00:04:32,639	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Yeah there's this thing that would happen
EDL	00:04:32,639	00:04:33,919	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Pretty much every day
EDL	00:04:33,919	00:04:35,199	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	As we were going to
EDL	00:04:35,199	00:04:35,711	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Her daycare
EDL	00:04:36,223	00:04:37,759	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	I have her in the front pack
EDL	00:04:38,527	00:04:39,039	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:42,623	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	She would point at basically everything that we pass
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:43,647	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And
EDL	00:04:44,671	00:04:45,439	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	What's that
EDL	00:04:46,207	00:04:47,743	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	I'd say that's a tree
EDL	00:04:48,255	00:04:48,767	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Stay.
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:53,375	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	That's still that's actually the same tree even
EDL	00:04:53,887	00:04:56,703	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	That and so I had this terrible choice between like
EDL	00:04:57,727	00:05:00,799	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Same tree tree tree over and over again or
EDL	00:05:00,799	00:05:03,615	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Listening to a screen for the entire time
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:10,527	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Until I decide to complicate the game a little bit by making a new rule which was that I could only say
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:14,367	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	The same thing one time so I can say tree but then I would have to say
EDL	00:05:14,879	00:05:15,647	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Branch
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:17,183	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Twig
EDL	00:05:17,183	00:05:17,951	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Leafs
EDL	00:05:17,951	00:05:19,999	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Stemen and by doing that this one time I
EDL	00:05:20,767	00:05:21,535	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	I saw it
EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:24,095	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	These tiny little flowers
EDL	00:05:24,095	00:05:28,703	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	On this tree that I've never seen before and we've just got close to it and they're these beautiful little
EDL	00:05:28,703	00:05:29,727	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Yellow flowers
EDL	00:05:29,727	00:05:32,031	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And so then I had to go find what
EDL	00:05:32,031	00:05:32,799	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	The three wise
EDL	00:05:32,799	00:05:33,311	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Send
EDL	00:05:34,079	00:05:36,639	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And it was it was just this wonderful moment and then you know
EDL	00:05:36,639	00:05:41,247	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Came back later and saw the same flowers and we saw they were developing into
EDL	00:05:41,247	00:05:41,759	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Peapod
EDL	00:05:42,271	00:05:43,295	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And she remembered in
EDL	00:05:44,831	00:05:47,391	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	That's cool inside so that was the first real MoMA
EDL	00:05:47,391	00:05:48,159	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Where is like
EDL	00:05:48,159	00:05:50,719	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	There's stuff out here then I could be noticing that I'm not
EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:51,999	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Right
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:55,839	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	You can be kind of a toolkit for noticing things that in one of my favorite so like
EDL	00:05:56,351	00:06:00,447	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	My show 99percentinvisible we have a saying it's always read the plaque
EDL	00:06:00,959	00:06:01,983	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	It is not because
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:04,031	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	All plaxer fantastic
EDL	00:06:04,031	00:06:05,823	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Many of them are really boring
EDL	00:06:05,823	00:06:06,591	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And
EDL	00:06:06,591	00:06:07,615	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Factually incorrect
EDL	00:06:08,127	00:06:08,895	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	But
EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:10,431	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	But at least
EDL	00:06:10,943	00:06:12,735	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	If you're the type of person that
EDL	00:06:12,735	00:06:15,039	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Read the black your person who notices
EDL	00:06:15,551	00:06:16,575	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	The story in place
EDL	00:06:17,599	00:06:20,927	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And you have this corollary that I love that store the
EDL	00:06:20,927	00:06:25,023	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Equivalent in the the natural wonders of the cityscape always eat the weed
EDL	00:06:26,815	00:06:31,679	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	So how does that through worked into to how you cultivate awareness in the natural world
EDL	00:06:32,191	00:06:35,263	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	So if if you always eat the weed
EDL	00:06:36,287	00:06:39,871	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	You you walk through the world in a very different way and I should say that
EDL	00:06:39,871	00:06:44,223	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	We're talking about edible weed
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:47,039	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	There's a surprising number of them that are edible
EDL	00:06:47,039	00:06:49,087	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And all these things that
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:50,111	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Grow in these
EDL	00:06:50,111	00:06:52,415	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Ready situations a lot of them
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:53,439	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	I happened to be
EDL	00:06:54,207	00:06:54,975	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Pretty tasty
EDL	00:06:54,975	00:06:56,511	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	If you catch them in the right situation
EDL	00:06:56,511	00:06:59,071	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	We just interact with nature generally through our eyes
EDL	00:06:59,071	00:06:59,839	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	I seen a we look at stuff
EDL	00:07:00,351	00:07:01,631	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Sometimes maybe we'd like
EDL	00:07:02,143	00:07:04,191	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Listen to Birdsong or smell
EDL	00:07:04,703	00:07:07,007	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	The roses are the skunk or whatever but
EDL	00:07:07,519	00:07:10,335	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	We rarely interact with nature by putting it in her mouth
EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:12,127	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And when you do that
EDL	00:07:12,127	00:07:14,431	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	All of the senses snap into Focus
EDL	00:07:14,431	00:07:16,223	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Because you got the feel in the mouth
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:18,527	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Centos at the back of your nose
EDL	00:07:18,527	00:07:19,807	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	There's a crunch
EDL	00:07:19,807	00:07:21,599	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And the taste of course
EDL	00:07:21,599	00:07:24,927	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And you also start seeing things differently because as soon as
EDL	00:07:25,695	00:07:27,743	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	The brain registers that that's
EDL	00:07:27,743	00:07:28,255	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Food
EDL	00:07:28,767	00:07:30,303	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	This mishmash of
EDL	00:07:31,071	00:07:31,839	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Weeds
EDL	00:07:31,839	00:07:33,887	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	That you can really distinguish before it
EDL	00:07:34,911	00:07:36,191	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Comes right into focusing
EDL	00:07:37,471	00:07:40,543	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	I'm terrible at remembering different species names
EDL	00:07:41,055	00:07:42,335	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	If it's something that I can eat
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:48,479	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	I'm for some reason there's this like evolutionary thing that like that
EDL	00:07:49,247	00:07:51,551	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	I remember the nasturtiums in the
EDL	00:07:52,575	00:07:54,879	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	You know that the dandelions when they're just coming in and
EDL	00:07:55,391	00:07:55,903	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Mallow and
EDL	00:07:58,207	00:07:58,719	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	So
EDL	00:07:59,743	00:08:01,023	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Let's talk about pigeons
EDL	00:08:01,023	00:08:04,351	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	I kind of view them as disgusting lice ridden lizards
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:09,215	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	You don't do them that way obviously in by the end of the chapter I didn't feel that way so why do we hate them
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:12,543	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	University people don't really like them
EDL	00:08:12,543	00:08:14,335	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And what are we getting wrong about pigeons
EDL	00:08:15,615	00:08:16,383	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	I think the
EDL	00:08:16,383	00:08:17,919	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	What happened with pigeons
EDL	00:08:17,919	00:08:18,943	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	This is
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:21,247	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	I mean they are legitimately
EDL	00:08:21,759	00:08:27,135	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Revolting let's let's just put that on the table noted
EDL	00:08:27,135	00:08:28,927	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	But all the things that we find
EDL	00:08:29,439	00:08:32,255	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Really loathsome about them are really caused
EDL	00:08:32,767	00:08:33,279	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Biots
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:34,815	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	But humans because
EDL	00:08:35,327	00:08:36,351	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	We bred them to be
EDL	00:08:37,631	00:08:38,911	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Massively productive
EDL	00:08:39,423	00:08:41,727	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And then we put them in the situation where we
EDL	00:08:41,727	00:08:42,239	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	We fed them all
EDL	00:08:43,263	00:08:49,151	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Food and we created this massive amount of food waste that they could eat and they reproduce like crazy
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:52,479	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And so then they're overpopulated and they're all squished together and they get
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:53,503	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Parasites
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:54,271	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Diseases and
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:56,575	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	A lot of the things that we
EDL	00:08:56,575	00:08:57,343	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Find
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:08:58,111	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Disgusting about
EDL	00:08:58,111	00:08:58,623	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Mr result
EDL	00:08:59,647	00:09:02,463	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Of that Cesaro thinks those are things he didn't start
EDL	00:09:02,975	00:09:04,767	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	He said Nobel Origins expansion
EDL	00:09:04,767	00:09:06,047	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Right so
EDL	00:09:06,047	00:09:07,071	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Pigeons
EDL	00:09:07,071	00:09:09,631	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Are really bird of the aristocracy
EDL	00:09:09,631	00:09:10,399	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Late
EDL	00:09:10,399	00:09:15,519	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Were first domesticated probably in the Middle East and then they spread around Europe
EDL	00:09:15,519	00:09:16,543	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	With the Romans
EDL	00:09:16,543	00:09:17,055	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:18,591	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	With Roman
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:22,431	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Upper class really they were built into the
EDL	00:09:22,431	00:09:23,711	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Architecture
EDL	00:09:23,711	00:09:25,503	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Of Roman houses one of the
EDL	00:09:25,503	00:09:27,295	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Classic elements
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:28,319	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	The Tuscan Villa
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:29,343	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Is this

EDL	00:09:31,135	00:09:32,671	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Stop like structure that
EDL	00:09:32,671	00:09:33,951	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	But you can go out and see the beauty
EDL	00:09:33,951	00:09:34,719	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Mapleview
EDL	00:09:34,719	00:09:35,743	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And that was a pigeon house

EDL	00:09:37,535	00:09:38,303	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Rooftop

EDL	00:09:42,143	00:09:42,911	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Picture of
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:45,727	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	A beautiful stately
EDL	00:09:45,727	00:09:46,495	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Upper class
EDL	00:09:46,495	00:09:47,007	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	House
EDL	00:09:47,519	00:09:49,823	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And then they came to the US with
EDL	00:09:49,823	00:09:51,359	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	The upper crust as well
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:53,151	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Samuel Champlain
EDL	00:09:53,151	00:09:53,919	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Governor of
EDL	00:09:53,919	00:09:54,431	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Quebec
EDL	00:09:54,943	00:09:56,991	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Person to bring them to the new world and
EDL	00:09:57,503	00:09:59,295	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	They spread across the us because
EDL	00:09:59,295	00:10:00,831	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Governors and dignitaries
EDL	00:10:00,831	00:10:02,111	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	This would give them to each other and
EDL	00:10:02,111	00:10:03,903	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	You had to have you know a pigeon
EDL	00:10:03,903	00:10:05,439	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Roost in your house
EDL	00:10:06,463	00:10:07,487	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Gym nearby
EDL	00:10:07,487	00:10:10,047	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And so they spread with Upper Crust
EDL	00:10:10,047	00:10:12,095	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	But then they became really successful
EDL	00:10:12,095	00:10:12,607	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	End
EDL	00:10:13,119	00:10:17,983	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	As America became more and more successful and we started producing more and more food and started building these
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:18,495	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Plaza
EDL	00:10:19,519	00:10:20,799	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Statues in the middle of the
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:21,823	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Kitchen
EDL	00:10:22,335	00:10:22,847	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Started
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:24,895	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Taking to those places
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:26,431	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	You taking them over
EDL	00:10:26,431	00:10:28,991	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And you can't really maintain
EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:32,319	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	If your status as a symbol of aristocracy
EDL	00:10:32,319	00:10:33,343	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	If you're incredible
EDL	00:10:33,855	00:10:34,623	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Common
EDL	00:10:34,623	00:10:35,391	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Think
EDL	00:10:35,903	00:10:40,255	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And so they they fell from grace and you can see this happening in the language
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:43,583	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	One of the interesting things about pigeons
EDL	00:10:43,583	00:10:45,119	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	The words
EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:46,143	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Pigeon and Dove
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:48,191	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	For a long time they were just
EDL	00:10:48,191	00:10:50,495	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Mixed together there's no scientific
EDL	00:10:50,495	00:10:51,007	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Distinction
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:52,543	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Is two things
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:54,591	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Cenote all kind of the same family often
EDL	00:10:54,591	00:10:57,663	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	The common name of something we'll both be a pigeon and a dove
EDL	00:10:57,663	00:10:58,943	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	But at some point
EDL	00:10:58,943	00:11:00,735	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Everything good
EDL	00:11:00,735	00:11:07,135	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Wizard of everything bad was occasion and and you can see it today I mean if you try and change it
EDL	00:11:07,135	00:11:09,183	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Around there's this huge cultural
EDL	00:11:09,183	00:11:10,463	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Antipathy toward
EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:11,743	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Pigeons rights of you
EDL	00:11:11,743	00:11:12,511	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	If you think of
EDL	00:11:13,023	00:11:14,559	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Like kitchen
EDL	00:11:14,559	00:11:15,071	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Soap
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:16,095	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Work

EDL	00:11:21,215	00:11:25,055	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	It just it just doesn't work or you could use you to think about it in like
EDL	00:11:26,079	00:11:28,639	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Busa's in in the Bible like
EDL	00:11:29,151	00:11:30,431	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	The Holy Spirit
EDL	00:11:30,431	00:11:31,967	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Sending from heaven
EDL	00:11:31,967	00:11:35,551	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	In the form of a pigeon
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:37,855	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And so they say
EDL	00:11:38,367	00:11:40,927	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Undergone this radical transformation
EDL	00:11:40,927	00:11:45,535	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And I sort of feel for them if you look at them closely there these beautiful birds
EDL	00:11:45,535	00:11:46,303	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	If they're not
EDL	00:11:46,815	00:11:48,863	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Disease didn't
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:56,031	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	We're coming is Cold War maybe even a hot war with pigeons all the time and it doesn't really work all that
EDL	00:11:56,031	00:11:58,335	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	What are the ways that we do with pigeon trailers
EDL	00:11:58,335	00:12:01,151	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	So there's the pigeon control industry is
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:02,431	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Massive
EDL	00:12:02,431	00:12:04,735	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Industry and you can do a lot of things you can put
EDL	00:12:05,247	00:12:06,015	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Bikes
EDL	00:12:06,015	00:12:06,783	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Out
EDL	00:12:06,783	00:12:07,807	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	To stop the pigeons you can
EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:10,367	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	But netting that blocks them
EDL	00:12:10,367	00:12:12,927	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	They even have like miniature electric fences
EDL	00:12:14,207	00:12:14,975	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Keep pigeons away
EDL	00:12:15,743	00:12:16,511	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And none of it worked
EDL	00:12:17,023	00:12:21,887	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	I mean it all works to certain degree in that you can push pigeons off of one building
EDL	00:12:22,399	00:12:24,703	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	But they can just go to the next building
EDL	00:12:24,703	00:12:26,239	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And that's what they do
EDL	00:12:26,239	00:12:29,055	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And as long as the food sources they are the
EDL	00:12:29,055	00:12:29,567	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	The pigeons
EDL	00:12:30,079	00:12:30,591	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Will be there
EDL	00:12:32,127	00:12:33,151	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Okay so let's
EDL	00:12:33,919	00:12:34,687	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Let's go
EDL	00:12:35,199	00:12:35,711	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Pigeon milk
EDL	00:12:37,503	00:12:38,271	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Please
EDL	00:12:38,783	00:12:39,551	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	I read this
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:45,439	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And it was really upsetting to me so I want you to upset all these people here in this room
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:48,767	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	What is Pigeon milk
EDL	00:12:48,767	00:12:50,815	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Normally we think of mammals
EDL	00:12:50,815	00:12:51,327	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Giving milk
EDL	00:12:56,959	00:13:00,031	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	But it's a really useful
EDL	00:13:00,031	00:13:01,823	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Delivery device of
EDL	00:13:01,823	00:13:03,615	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Have nutrients and
EDL	00:13:03,615	00:13:05,919	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Birds have figured it out too or at least
EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:07,455	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Pigeons have figured it out to
EDL	00:13:07,455	00:13:11,039	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And it's it's completely on convergent evolution it's not like
EDL	00:13:11,039	00:13:12,575	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	This is something that has
EDL	00:13:12,575	00:13:14,367	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Spread up the evolutionary tree
EDL	00:13:15,391	00:13:17,951	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	It's very similar in structure but it's
EDL	00:13:17,951	00:13:18,463	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Completely
EDL	00:13:18,975	00:13:20,255	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Independently derived
EDL	00:13:20,767	00:13:21,535	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And essentially what
EDL	00:13:22,303	00:13:23,583	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	What happens is
EDL	00:13:23,583	00:13:25,375	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	The birds secrete
EDL	00:13:25,887	00:13:28,959	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Some nutrients through the inside of their
EDL	00:13:28,959	00:13:31,007	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Throats and there's a little pouch that birds have
EDL	00:13:31,519	00:13:32,287	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Inside the throat
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:33,055	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Stop the crop
EDL	00:13:33,055	00:13:34,079	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And it collects
EDL	00:13:34,079	00:13:34,847	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	In the crop
EDL	00:13:34,847	00:13:37,151	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And it's the sort of yellowish cheesy
EDL	00:13:40,479	00:13:43,039	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And then that the squabs the little birds
EDL	00:13:43,039	00:13:45,087	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Stick their heads down the parents throats
EDL	00:13:45,087	00:13:46,367	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And thrusts
EDL	00:13:46,367	00:13:46,879	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	To get the
EDL	00:13:47,391	00:13:48,415	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Pigeon
EDL	00:13:48,415	00:13:50,719	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Both the males and the females produce that sits
EDL	00:13:50,719	00:13:51,743	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	It's a beautiful
EDL	00:13:51,743	00:13:52,255	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Wonder of nature
EDL	00:13:53,535	00:13:56,095	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	When you were researching pigeons
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:13:56,863	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	You noticed
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:13:58,655	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	That a bunch of them
EDL	00:13:58,655	00:13:59,935	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Have messed up legs
EDL	00:14:00,447	00:14:03,775	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And there's a mystery to why so many pigeons have messed up legs
EDL	00:14:03,775	00:14:06,335	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Yeah so I don't know if you've seen this but
EDL	00:14:06,847	00:14:10,175	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	I started seeing this as soon as I started looking closely a pigeons that
EDL	00:14:10,687	00:14:11,455	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	They
EDL	00:14:11,967	00:14:15,551	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Often would be missing a toe or they'd be missing their foot
EDL	00:14:15,551	00:14:16,319	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Entirely and it was just
EDL	00:14:17,343	00:14:23,743	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And it was like this huge percentage every time I would look I would see you again either be like 10 pigeons out there and one or two
EDL	00:14:23,743	00:14:25,279	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Two of them would have something wrong
EDL	00:14:25,279	00:14:25,791	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	With their feet
EDL	00:14:26,303	00:14:27,327	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And when I started
EDL	00:14:27,327	00:14:29,119	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Looking for the answers about
EDL	00:14:30,143	00:14:33,727	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	I found all of these ideas and people were pretty sure that
EDL	00:14:34,239	00:14:35,519	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Predators
EDL	00:14:37,567	00:14:38,591	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Attacking their feet
EDL	00:14:39,615	00:14:40,639	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Why would they just attacked
EDL	00:14:42,175	00:14:44,735	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Or they were getting staph infections
EDL	00:14:44,735	00:14:47,807	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And it took me a really long time to figure this out it was sort of throughout
EDL	00:14:47,807	00:14:48,575	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	The entire course
EDL	00:14:48,575	00:14:49,343	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	The research I was
EDL	00:14:49,343	00:14:49,855	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Cruising down the
EDL	00:14:50,367	00:14:51,135	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Different threads
EDL	00:14:51,647	00:14:58,047	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And eventually what I found the United Premier pigeon researchers said oh yes all of this is nonsense
EDL	00:14:58,047	00:14:59,839	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	What happens is that they
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:01,631	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Pick up little bits of
EDL	00:15:01,631	00:15:02,143	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Red
EDL	00:15:02,655	00:15:03,167	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	4share
EDL	00:15:03,935	00:15:05,215	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Incredibly common
EDL	00:15:05,215	00:15:05,983	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Insidious
EDL	00:15:05,983	00:15:08,287	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And it gets Tangled around their feet and they don't have any
EDL	00:15:08,287	00:15:09,055	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Anyway to get
EDL	00:15:09,055	00:15:09,567	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Get it off and it just
EDL	00:15:10,335	00:15:11,103	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Tighter and Tighter
EDL	00:15:11,871	00:15:12,895	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	The causes these lesions
EDL	00:15:13,407	00:15:14,175	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And
EDL	00:15:14,175	00:15:16,479	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Normally birds don't get this because most Birds hop
EDL	00:15:17,503	00:15:18,527	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And pigeons kind of Shuffle
EDL	00:15:19,039	00:15:19,551	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And so
EDL	00:15:20,831	00:15:23,135	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Really well adapted to cities in many ways except
EDL	00:15:23,647	00:15:24,415	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	1
EDL	00:15:24,415	00:15:25,439	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Parable

EDL	00:15:26,719	00:15:27,999	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Some reason their beaks to
EDL	00:15:27,999	00:15:30,559	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	They're not capable of tear not capable of
EDL	00:15:32,095	00:15:34,143	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	What's that okay feel bad for pigeons now
EDL	00:15:35,423	00:15:38,239	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	In the book most of the Flora and Fauna
EDL	00:15:38,239	00:15:43,615	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Are species that thrive in the concrete landscape purposely make it easy for them to survive
EDL	00:15:43,615	00:15:46,943	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	That's not the case for the ginkgo biloba which is the tree that
EDL	00:15:46,943	00:15:48,991	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	I probably wouldn't exist anymore
EDL	00:15:48,991	00:15:50,271	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	If it weren't for people
EDL	00:15:50,271	00:15:51,551	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Planting them in cities

EDL	00:15:52,831	00:15:53,599	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Why are
EDL	00:15:53,599	00:15:57,439	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Kinkos unsuitable for nature and what do they do so well
EDL	00:15:58,719	00:16:01,023	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	The Golden Age of ginkgos
EDL	00:16:01,535	00:16:02,303	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Was
EDL	00:16:02,303	00:16:03,583	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	The Cretaceous

EDL	00:16:04,607	00:16:06,143	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Rule the world as we all know
EDL	00:16:06,655	00:16:12,031	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	That's all we think of that you're on it just scared of dinosaurs
EDL	00:16:12,799	00:16:14,847	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Really they were in charge
EDL	00:16:16,127	00:16:17,663	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	At that time
EDL	00:16:17,663	00:16:20,479	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Kinkos had some evolutionary partner
EDL	00:16:20,479	00:16:24,063	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	They had some kind of creature that would help them distribute their seeds
EDL	00:16:24,831	00:16:26,879	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And today we have no idea what this
EDL	00:16:28,159	00:16:28,927	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Mystery
EDL	00:16:28,927	00:16:29,695	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	The people are still
EDL	00:16:29,695	00:16:30,719	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Still trying to figure out
EDL	00:16:30,719	00:16:33,279	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And it's a double mystery because their seeds
EDL	00:16:33,279	00:16:34,303	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Smell
EDL	00:16:34,303	00:16:35,071	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Like
EDL	00:16:35,071	00:16:36,351	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Like a microwave death
EDL	00:16:39,167	00:16:39,679	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Terrible
EDL	00:16:40,191	00:16:42,495	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	There's male and female ginkgos in the
EDL	00:16:42,495	00:16:44,799	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	The females produce the seeds in a few
EDL	00:16:44,799	00:16:46,591	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Around and around September
EDL	00:16:46,591	00:16:47,615	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	November
EDL	00:16:47,615	00:16:48,383	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	You'll notice
EDL	00:16:48,383	00:16:50,175	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Stop that's one thing you can
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:51,455	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Open your eyes to the
EDL	00:16:51,455	00:16:54,271	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And stop and find the seeds and notice just how terrible they smell
EDL	00:16:54,783	00:16:56,831	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	But there was something that must have liked
EDL	00:16:56,831	00:16:57,343	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	The smell
EDL	00:16:57,855	00:16:59,647	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And must have eaten it in
EDL	00:16:59,647	00:17:00,927	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Cherry did two different places
EDL	00:17:01,439	00:17:05,279	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And at some point the seed distributor probably died out
EDL	00:17:05,279	00:17:06,047	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And
EDL	00:17:06,047	00:17:08,351	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	It simply meant that the ginkgos
EDL	00:17:08,351	00:17:09,631	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Couldn't outrun the glaciers
EDL	00:17:09,631	00:17:10,399	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	At the climate change
EDL	00:17:11,423	00:17:12,703	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Until you see them
EDL	00:17:12,703	00:17:13,727	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	All lacrosse
EDL	00:17:13,727	00:17:16,031	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	The world they have these really tough leathery leaves
EDL	00:17:16,543	00:17:17,055	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Great boss
EDL	00:17:18,079	00:17:19,103	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Find them all over the place
EDL	00:17:19,871	00:17:20,639	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And then they
EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:21,919	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Retreat
EDL	00:17:21,919	00:17:22,943	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And they retreat
EDL	00:17:22,943	00:17:24,223	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And they Retreat until they're just
EDL	00:17:24,735	00:17:26,783	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Apple Valley's in China
EDL	00:17:26,783	00:17:27,295	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Were there left
EDL	00:17:28,063	00:17:29,599	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And their entire
EDL	00:17:29,599	00:17:30,879	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Family gets wiped out
EDL	00:17:30,879	00:17:32,927	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	They're the only remaining species
EDL	00:17:33,439	00:17:34,207	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	This whole
EDL	00:17:34,207	00:17:35,231	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Division
EDL	00:17:35,231	00:17:35,999	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	A plant life
EDL	00:17:35,999	00:17:36,511	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	That Remains
EDL	00:17:38,559	00:17:39,839	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And then people come along
EDL	00:17:39,839	00:17:41,375	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And people fall in love with
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:44,703	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Kinko's and it turns out the ginkgos kind of love us too
EDL	00:17:45,215	00:17:45,983	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	They can
EDL	00:17:45,983	00:17:47,263	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Drive-In
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:51,871	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Polluted air that do well in concrete they do well in partial eye twitch
EDL	00:17:51,871	00:17:52,895	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Which is perfect for cities
EDL	00:17:53,407	00:17:54,687	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	They're famously
EDL	00:17:55,711	00:17:58,015	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Good at taking abuse in Albion
EDL	00:17:58,015	00:18:01,599	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Backed into by a delivery truck for
EDL	00:18:01,599	00:18:02,111	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Or
EDL	00:18:02,623	00:18:06,719	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Close to atom bomb there's one just a kilometer away from the
EDL	00:18:07,743	00:18:10,815	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Hiroshima bomb site that survived and regrew
EDL	00:18:11,327	00:18:13,631	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	It was kind of amazing story where they just
EDL	00:18:13,631	00:18:18,239	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Barely hung on for millions and millions of years and then they happened to
EDL	00:18:18,239	00:18:19,519	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Find themselves in this
EDL	00:18:19,519	00:18:20,031	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Crazy
EDL	00:18:20,543	00:18:21,823	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Point in the Earth's history
EDL	00:18:22,335	00:18:23,359	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Where they could thrive
EDL	00:18:23,871	00:18:24,639	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Human cities
EDL	00:18:24,639	00:18:27,967	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Because the the fruits that the seeds are so stinky
EDL	00:18:28,479	00:18:30,271	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	We tend to plant only the male
EDL	00:18:30,271	00:18:35,391	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	The species right that's right people try to just plant the males and sometimes they get it wrong
EDL	00:18:35,391	00:18:38,463	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And it's heart you know it's like 30 years
EDL	00:18:38,463	00:18:40,767	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Before they become sexually mature so then it's like
EDL	00:18:40,767	00:18:46,399	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Oops I guess that was a female but even the males have their downsides because been
EDL	00:18:46,911	00:18:47,935	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	You know they pretty
EDL	00:18:47,935	00:18:49,215	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Tons and tons of Allah
EDL	00:18:49,215	00:18:50,239	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	So
EDL	00:18:50,751	00:18:51,519	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	One way or the other
EDL	00:18:52,543	00:18:54,591	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	So you discovered that Ginkgo seeds
EDL	00:18:54,591	00:18:55,103	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Edible
EDL	00:18:56,383	00:19:00,479	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Once you get rid of that really stinky flesh that's are around them in this quote
EDL	00:19:00,479	00:19:00,991	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	I want to be
EDL	00:19:01,759	00:19:03,295	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Which I really liked a lot says
EDL	00:19:03,807	00:19:07,391	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Ginkgo toxin is similar in structure to vitamin B6
EDL	00:19:07,391	00:19:10,975	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And eating too much of it interferes with our ability to synthesize the vitamin
EDL	00:19:11,487	00:19:15,839	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	That can provoke a biochemical Cascade that especially in children
EDL	00:19:15,839	00:19:17,631	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	May lead to seizures and even death
EDL	00:19:18,143	00:19:19,679	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	This sounds alarming
EDL	00:19:19,679	00:19:21,983	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	But it wasn't enough to deter me
EDL	00:19:23,263	00:19:24,799	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	What does deter you
EDL	00:19:25,311	00:19:26,335	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	From eating things
EDL	00:19:26,847	00:19:30,431	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And a little too paranoid about poisonous nature
EDL	00:19:31,455	00:19:33,503	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Yeah I think we're a little too paranoid
EDL	00:19:33,503	00:19:35,807	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	About poisonous nature and just poisons in general
EDL	00:19:36,319	00:19:38,623	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	For the previous book that I did I
EDL	00:19:38,623	00:19:40,927	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	I ended up researching a whole bunch about
EDL	00:19:42,207	00:19:42,975	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Relationship
EDL	00:19:43,487	00:19:44,255	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Plants and
EDL	00:19:45,023	00:19:46,815	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	When you look at that relationship
EDL	00:19:46,815	00:19:49,119	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Deku evolutionary Exchange
EDL	00:19:49,119	00:19:50,399	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Between animals
EDL	00:19:50,399	00:19:51,167	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Implants
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:53,471	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	It's a history of chemical warfare
EDL	00:19:53,471	00:19:54,751	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	You know plants produce
EDL	00:19:55,263	00:19:57,055	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Crazier and crazier chemicals
EDL	00:19:57,823	00:19:59,359	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Try and protect themselves from animals
EDL	00:19:59,871	00:20:05,759	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And you would think that they would just win right because they have these amazing Laboratories where they can just synthesize
EDL	00:20:06,527	00:20:07,551	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Stuff that would make
EDL	00:20:08,319	00:20:09,343	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Ghetto people
EDL	00:20:09,343	00:20:11,647	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	At the NSA just salivating
EDL	00:20:12,927	00:20:13,695	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Crazy stuff
EDL	00:20:14,719	00:20:16,511	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	But they don't because
EDL	00:20:16,511	00:20:17,535	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Animals are
EDL	00:20:17,535	00:20:20,607	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Really really tough and basically animals are like
EDL	00:20:20,607	00:20:22,655	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Pretty good poison their plant
EDL	00:20:23,167	00:20:26,495	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Guess I'll eat a little bit less of you
EDL	00:20:26,495	00:20:27,775	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Interweave evolve
EDL	00:20:27,775	00:20:33,151	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	The ability to deal with it and you really if you spend enough time with this history are you really taken the
EDL	00:20:34,687	00:20:36,223	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Lesson that the dose makes the poison
EDL	00:20:36,735	00:20:38,527	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And with Ginkgo seeds especially
EDL	00:20:39,551	00:20:42,367	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Yes there is this possibility of poisoning but
EDL	00:20:43,135	00:20:45,183	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Also there is this history of
EDL	00:20:45,183	00:20:46,463	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Millions of people
EDL	00:20:46,463	00:20:47,231	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Eating this
EDL	00:20:47,231	00:20:48,255	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Thousands of years
EDL	00:20:48,767	00:20:49,791	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	So I feel pretty
EDL	00:20:49,791	00:20:51,327	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Okay well it's safe with it
EDL	00:20:51,327	00:20:52,095	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	How did they end up taste
EDL	00:20:53,119	00:20:53,887	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	So
EDL	00:20:53,887	00:20:55,423	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	First of all I tried to
EDL	00:20:55,423	00:20:56,447	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Do it myself
EDL	00:20:56,447	00:20:58,495	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And I was a little bit paranoid about
EDL	00:20:58,495	00:20:59,519	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	The poison it's white like
EDL	00:20:59,519	00:21:03,103	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	I cooked and cooked and cooked and I cracked up in the ginkgo nut and
EDL	00:21:03,103	00:21:04,639	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	It was like this shriveled little
EDL	00:21:05,151	00:21:09,247	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Brown thing I was like I wonder if that's how it's supposed to look
EDL	00:21:09,247	00:21:11,551	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Like it's really hard and kind of
EDL	00:21:11,551	00:21:12,575	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Carmel tasting
EDL	00:21:13,087	00:21:15,391	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And then I went to someone shoes
EDL	00:21:16,928	00:21:18,464	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Chinese cooking enthusiast
EDL	00:21:18,464	00:21:19,488	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Knows how to
EDL	00:21:19,488	00:21:20,256	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Prepare this
EDL	00:21:20,256	00:21:20,768	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Correctly
EDL	00:21:21,280	00:21:22,304	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And she made it
EDL	00:21:22,304	00:21:25,888	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	It was it was a little bit of a letdown because it was so mild
EDL	00:21:26,400	00:21:26,912	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Justice
EDL	00:21:27,680	00:21:28,704	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	It's kind of a tacky
EDL	00:21:29,216	00:21:30,240	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Very mild
EDL	00:21:30,240	00:21:31,520	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Slightly bitter
EDL	00:21:31,520	00:21:32,288	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	But not
EDL	00:21:32,288	00:21:33,568	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Especially flavorful
EDL	00:21:33,568	00:21:34,848	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Not it's kind of like
EDL	00:21:34,848	00:21:35,872	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Overcooked gnocchi
EDL	00:21:36,640	00:21:38,176	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Just a little bit
EDL	00:21:38,176	00:21:40,992	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And it's really valued more for its texture in Chinese
EDL	00:21:41,504	00:21:42,016	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Jeans in for
EDL	00:21:42,528	00:21:43,040	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Taste
EDL	00:21:44,064	00:21:45,600	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And it's it's supposed medic
EDL	00:21:45,600	00:21:46,112	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Eagle properties
EDL	00:21:47,136	00:21:48,928	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Yeah what's the deal with medical properties
EDL	00:21:50,208	00:21:56,608	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	I don't know I mean I mean the medical properties that we generally talk about
EDL	00:21:56,608	00:21:57,632	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	How to do with
EDL	00:21:57,632	00:21:58,400	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Compounds
EDL	00:21:59,680	00:22:01,472	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Unthinkable obeid has been shown to
EDL	00:22:02,752	00:22:03,776	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Help facilitate
EDL	00:22:03,776	00:22:04,800	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Blood flow
EDL	00:22:04,800	00:22:05,568	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And so
EDL	00:22:05,568	00:22:07,360	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And I can help with things like
EDL	00:22:07,360	00:22:08,384	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Sodium blood flow

EDL	00:22:40,384	00:22:41,408	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Things that
EDL	00:22:41,408	00:22:47,552	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	Are probably not good for us as humans like streetlights people think that upsets are circadian rhythms like crows are all about Street line
EDL	00:22:48,064	00:22:49,088	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	YouTube

EDL	00:22:53,952	00:22:56,256	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	There's this mystery because there's this
EDL	00:22:56,256	00:22:58,048	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	This boom in Crows
EDL	00:22:58,048	00:22:58,816	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And

EDL	00:23:01,376	00:23:04,448	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	But actually just the concentration of crows in cities
EDL	00:23:04,960	00:23:08,032	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	So then the question is why are crows coming into cities

EDL	00:23:22,624	00:23:24,160	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And there's huge
EDL	00:23:24,160	00:23:24,928	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And there's silence
EDL	00:23:25,696	00:23:27,488	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And they just swoop down
EDL	00:23:27,488	00:23:28,512	| 99pi-0210-unseencity-1 |	And totally e
