EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:22,143	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	In the cities early days
EDL	00:04:22,143	00:04:23,423	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	The mountains were undeveloped
EDL	00:04:23,935	00:04:27,775	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	During the first half of the 20th century the city rapidly industrialized

EDL	00:04:32,639	00:04:36,735	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	And it began building homes and communities of the sides of those mountains
EDL	00:04:36,735	00:04:39,807	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	These informal settlements became known as camunas
EDL	00:04:40,575	00:04:43,647	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	The community really thought of as separate from the rest of the city below
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:47,231	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	Both because of their geographical distance from downtown
EDL	00:04:47,231	00:04:48,767	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	And also because it would neglect

EDL	00:05:09,247	00:05:11,039	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	And look the other way
EDL	00:05:13,343	00:05:15,647	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	Until the hills above the city were crowded with houses

EDL	00:05:19,743	00:05:24,607	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	But by the 1980s many of Columbia's manufacturing jobs are moving overseas

EDL	00:15:12,895	00:15:13,919	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	The city's murder rate
EDL	00:15:15,455	00:15:19,039	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	The cartel created fear to the idea that violence can strike anyone
EDL	00:15:19,039	00:15:19,551	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	Anytime
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:23,903	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	Around the same time Escobar made a deal with the Colombian state
EDL	00:15:24,415	00:15:30,303	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	Yes traditional Colombian citizen to the US have been prohibited by a newly approved Colombian Constitution
EDL	00:15:30,815	00:15:32,863	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	So that possibility was now off the table
EDL	00:15:33,375	00:15:37,727	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	Escobar agreed to surrender to authorities and to stop all criminal activity
EDL	00:15:37,727	00:15:40,799	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	In exchange for a reduced sentence and preferential treatment
EDL	00:15:41,311	00:15:43,359	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	Including no extradition

EDL	00:15:44,895	00:15:46,687	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	And he got very preferential treatment
EDL	00:15:47,711	00:15:50,527	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	Escobar was locked up in his own luxurious private prison
EDL	00:15:50,527	00:15:52,063	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	But Bill specially for him
EDL	00:15:52,575	00:15:54,111	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	He was called to like at the door
EDL	00:15:54,111	00:15:57,439	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	And it featured a soccer field a bar a giant dollhouse
EDL	00:15:57,951	00:15:59,231	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	A jacuzzi and a waterfall
EDL	00:16:00,255	00:16:05,631	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	Then it became clear that Escobar was continuing to orchestrate criminal activities from within the prison
EDL	00:16:05,631	00:16:08,447	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	Authorities made plans to move them to a new location
EDL	00:16:08,447	00:16:10,495	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	But Escobar escaped before they could
EDL	00:16:11,007	00:16:11,775	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	There was a man hun

EDL	00:16:17,663	00:16:19,711	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	But even before Escobar died
EDL	00:16:20,223	00:16:24,319	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	The city had undertaken an ambitious new project to try to figure out

EDL	00:16:44,287	00:16:50,687	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	What happened was a national government sent policymakers out into the neighborhood submitting especially the Kahuna's

EDL	00:17:17,567	00:17:20,127	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	They figured out that the city needed to reclaim public spaces
EDL	00:17:21,407	00:17:22,687	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	Places where people to meet up and talk
EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:26,527	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	Many of these spaces like parks and plazas
EDL	00:17:26,527	00:17:30,623	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	I've been abandoned because people were afraid to be outside with all the violence
EDL	00:17:31,391	00:17:34,207	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	People also said the city needed to invest in community group
EDL	00:17:34,719	00:17:39,583	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	They were already lots of artists collectors and Community organizations doing important work in the community
EDL	00:17:40,351	00:17:41,631	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	They just needed more support
EDL	00:17:42,143	00:17:48,287	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	And finally the city could no longer neglect and ignore the camunas on the steep hills above the city center
EDL	00:17:48,287	00:17:51,615	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	Those neighborhoods needed to be integrated with the rest of medine
EDL	00:17:52,127	00:17:54,431	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	City needed a modern Metro System

EDL	00:18:14,911	00:18:20,287	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	In 1995 the mini Metro opened linking parts of the previously fragmented City
EDL	00:18:20,799	00:18:25,407	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	The richest southern district was now easily connected with the poor camunas to the north

EDL	00:18:31,551	00:18:33,599	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	Natalia says
EDL	00:18:33,599	00:18:35,647	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	They were living in the time when violent attacks
EDL	00:18:36,159	00:18:37,951	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	Car bombs and assassinations were common
EDL	00:18:38,463	00:18:39,487	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	And obviously

EDL	00:18:40,767	00:18:41,279	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	Target

EDL	00:18:45,631	00:18:46,399	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	And many of them are cats
EDL	00:18:47,167	00:18:50,751	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	So the city came up with the idea of placing a statue of the Virgin Mary
EDL	00:18:51,263	00:18:52,287	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	And it's one of the metro state
EDL	00:18:53,311	00:18:56,127	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	They thought it would be a reminder to keep things calm and peaceful on the train
EDL	00:18:57,151	00:18:58,431	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	To complement the Metro
EDL	00:18:58,431	00:18:59,967	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	The City built something else
EDL	00:18:59,967	00:19:06,111	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	An Innovative system of cable cars that went right up the Steep Mountain sides to link the comunas to the rest of the city
EDL	00:19:06,879	00:19:08,671	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	And this made a huge difference
EDL	00:19:09,439	00:19:13,535	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	It wants taken people in the community over an hour to get to the city center
EDL	00:19:14,047	00:19:16,351	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	Now it took more like 15 or 20 minutes
EDL	00:19:16,863	00:19:17,887	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	Before
EDL	00:19:17,887	00:19:20,959	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	People in the community used to say I need to go to managing to run an errand
EDL	00:19:21,727	00:19:22,239	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	Now

EDL	00:27:47,328	00:27:48,352	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	As someone who has
EDL	00:27:48,352	00:27:49,376	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	That's a very present
EDL	00:27:49,376	00:27:50,656	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	Don't connection to that history

EDL	00:28:02,688	00:28:04,992	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	As opposed to what they see on television
EDL	00:28:04,992	00:28:08,320	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	So I think it's a positive thinking for more people are coming to Columbia
EDL	00:28:08,832	00:28:09,600	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	However

EDL	00:28:14,976	00:28:17,024	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	Hannah perpetuates the stigma
EDL	00:28:17,536	00:28:18,816	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	And perpetuates
EDL	00:28:19,328	00:28:20,864	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	Toilets that stereotype
EDL	00:28:20,864	00:28:21,632	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	That

EDL	00:33:55,456	00:33:59,552	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	When they were raising money for their company they looked into investment and grants
EDL	00:33:59,552	00:34:04,160	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	And found those traditional path unreliable and require them to give up too much control
EDL	00:34:04,672	00:34:07,232	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	So they're trying out something completely new
EDL	00:34:07,232	00:34:08,512	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	Here's an extended preview
EDL	00:34:10,560	00:34:16,960	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	Early on when we've been talking to everyone we need to figure out like really should we start our own company I am
EDL	00:34:16,960	00:34:21,824	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	Met with a friend of a friend who actually advised media startups his name is Josh Benson
EDL	00:34:22,592	00:34:24,384	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	And then Josh call me back
EDL	00:34:25,152	00:34:26,944	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	Because the more he thought about it
EDL	00:34:26,944	00:34:28,992	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	Since we had our first conversation
EDL	00:34:28,992	00:34:30,784	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	The more he thought that actually
EDL	00:34:31,296	00:34:35,136	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	Then I would be a great fit for this other start-up he was working with
EDL	00:34:35,136	00:34:39,744	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	It was kind of hard to explain but the gist of it was that this group of techies and journalists
EDL	00:34:40,256	00:34:41,536	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	We're building something
EDL	00:34:41,536	00:34:43,840	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	That would throw good journalism a life
EDL	00:34:44,608	00:34:47,680	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	Help it survive in a world now driven by
EDL	00:34:47,680	00:34:48,704	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	Free Facebook news feed
EDL	00:34:49,728	00:34:51,520	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	They were called civil
EDL	00:34:51,520	00:34:54,592	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	And thanks to the generosity of a multi-billionaire
EDL	00:34:54,592	00:34:55,360	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	They had money
EDL	00:34:55,872	00:34:58,432	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	Actually had grants to give out to journalist
EDL	00:34:58,432	00:34:58,944	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	Proven track
EDL	00:35:00,992	00:35:02,016	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	No strings attached
EDL	00:35:02,784	00:35:04,832	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	The journalists would own their work
EDL	00:35:05,344	00:35:07,904	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	All they had to do was contribute to the Civil platform
EDL	00:35:08,672	00:35:11,488	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	And the way they were making this media fantasy come true
EDL	00:35:12,000	00:35:14,816	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	It was something called the blockchain
EDL	00:35:20,704	00:35:23,520	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	Jen and I had heard of the blockchain you may have to
EDL	00:35:24,032	00:35:27,360	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	We weren't entirely sure how it worked or what it had to do with journalism
EDL	00:35:27,872	00:35:30,688	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	And like most people we pretty much
EDL	00:35:31,200	00:35:37,088	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	The most popular cryptocurrency that had made the people who bought in early really really rich
EDL	00:35:37,088	00:35:38,624	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	According to memes
EDL	00:35:38,624	00:35:40,928	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	Attempt to compel them to buy Lamborghinis
EDL	00:35:42,464	00:35:44,512	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	Why the hell would we want anything to do with
EDL	00:35:45,792	00:35:48,352	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	Research we started to understand
EDL	00:35:48,864	00:35:52,192	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	Black teen was just the technology that made Bitcoin possible
EDL	00:35:52,704	00:35:53,984	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	But it could
EDL	00:35:53,984	00:35:55,008	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	Maybe
EDL	00:35:55,008	00:35:58,592	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	Do so much more than just make some dudes Rich enough to buy Lambos
EDL	00:35:59,872	00:36:00,896	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	The movie Red
EDL	00:36:00,896	00:36:05,504	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	The more we felt like actually the blockchain could be a second chance for the internet
EDL	00:36:06,016	00:36:09,344	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	It's over the last few years we've seen that the promise of the web
EDL	00:36:09,344	00:36:11,904	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	Information and access for everyone
EDL	00:36:11,904	00:36:13,696	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	It had been totally perverted
EDL	00:36:14,464	00:36:15,744	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	But the blockchain
EDL	00:36:16,256	00:36:18,048	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	If it really got off the ground
EDL	00:36:18,048	00:36:20,352	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	Could do things like protect people's identity
EDL	00:36:20,864	00:36:23,680	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	Help get eat faster to natural disasters
EDL	00:36:23,680	00:36:25,728	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	Sustain the poorest population
EDL	00:36:26,240	00:36:28,544	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	Maybe even help protect democracy
EDL	00:36:29,056	00:36:31,104	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	And save important struggling industry
EDL	00:36:31,872	00:36:34,432	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	Like journalism
EDL	00:36:34,432	00:36:36,224	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	Either big promises
EDL	00:36:38,016	00:36:41,344	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	After hearing what civil was doing with the blockchain
EDL	00:36:42,368	00:36:43,392	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	We were kind of stoked

EDL	00:38:12,992	00:38:16,064	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	In the other half is a new crypto-currency
EDL	00:38:16,064	00:38:17,856	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	But they call Sybil tokens
EDL	00:38:17,856	00:38:24,256	| 312_Post_Narco_Urbanism_pt01 |	These tokens have no value yet but after they get auctioned off to the public
