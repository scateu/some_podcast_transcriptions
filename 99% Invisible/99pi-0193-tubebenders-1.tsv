EDL	00:07:33,375	00:07:36,447	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	Then it would take more cheap bars cheap hotels
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:37,215	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	And then

EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:45,151	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	People who you know more less critique

EDL	00:08:23,295	00:08:25,599	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	And that's why we came to symbolize

EDL	00:08:26,623	00:08:28,415	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	Neon tubes are Madewell
EDL	00:08:28,415	00:08:29,951	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	They can last about 30 years
EDL	00:08:30,463	00:08:31,999	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	Sometimes up to 70
EDL	00:08:32,767	00:08:34,047	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	But they are glass
EDL	00:08:34,047	00:08:34,559	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	So they can break
EDL	00:08:35,071	00:08:36,607	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	And they're out there in the elements
EDL	00:08:36,607	00:08:38,399	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	The electricity can flicker out
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:43,263	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	What a neon sign goes out you can't just screw in a new tube or order up a cheap replacement
EDL	00:08:43,263	00:08:44,031	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	You would think
EDL	00:08:45,055	00:08:50,175	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	Like a machine made product right that there was some sort of big neon Factory that
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:51,199	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	Just trying it out
EDL	00:08:51,199	00:08:52,735	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	Neon assembly line
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:54,783	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	And that's really not the case
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:57,599	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	30 Craftsman whose safety sign
EDL	00:08:57,599	00:08:59,903	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	The band The Tubes with their hands
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:04,767	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	That's really just one person doing this person like Shawna Peters
EDL	00:09:05,279	00:09:10,911	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	A neon glass blower is not a glass blower it's really called neon tube bending
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:11,679	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	That's the trade
EDL	00:09:12,447	00:09:12,959	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	42 Bender
EDL	00:09:13,471	00:09:16,799	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	Jonah Peterson has been bending since 1987
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:23,199	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	She says color is a good way to decode these signs to know what's inside of them and what quality they are
EDL	00:09:23,199	00:09:24,223	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	Are the most basic
EDL	00:09:24,735	00:09:26,271	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	And the most popular
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:27,551	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	And that's like a reddish orange
EDL	00:09:28,319	00:09:29,087	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	And that's the
EDL	00:09:29,087	00:09:30,367	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	Standard neon red
EDL	00:09:30,879	00:09:31,647	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	That is
EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:32,671	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	Short Neon gas
EDL	00:09:33,183	00:09:34,719	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	Does naturally burn fat color
EDL	00:09:34,719	00:09:37,791	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	And then there's blue neon also pretty basic
EDL	00:09:37,791	00:09:43,935	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	The cool secret about blue neon is that is not actually Neon gas its Argon gas brightened with a little mercury
EDL	00:09:44,447	00:09:46,239	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	Bowie still called them neon signs
EDL	00:09:46,751	00:09:50,591	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	And for a while almost all neon signs were just red and blue
EDL	00:09:51,103	00:09:52,895	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	Pier neon or argon Mercury
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:54,175	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	Clear tube
EDL	00:09:54,687	00:09:58,271	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	Then the industry came up with a way to make any color you want
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:10:01,343	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	There's a place for powder coating on the inside of the tube
EDL	00:10:01,343	00:10:07,743	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	Vendors can use tubes with different phosphorus on the inside of the tubes to create more colors than just red and blue
EDL	00:10:07,743	00:10:11,839	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	Use a fuchsia use a green a lime green go for lime green you know
EDL	00:10:11,839	00:10:13,119	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	Use of color
EDL	00:10:13,119	00:10:14,655	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	Dunwell is nice
EDL	00:10:14,655	00:10:20,031	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	Now just to be clear those neon beer signs at the bodega or the standard open sign
EDL	00:10:20,031	00:10:21,567	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	Candy and often are
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:24,383	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	Made on a massive scale in China
EDL	00:10:24,383	00:10:27,455	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	Those are still hand blown that's the only way to make neon
EDL	00:10:27,455	00:10:32,831	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	That's like one person makes only the letter e all day long another person makes
EDL	00:10:32,831	00:10:33,599	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	Only owes
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:35,647	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	And these signs are lower quality
EDL	00:10:36,159	00:10:42,559	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	Cheap signs for beer brands or generic open signs are often color with a coating of color plastic on the outside
EDL	00:10:42,559	00:10:43,327	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	Side of the glass tubes
EDL	00:10:43,839	00:10:46,911	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	Usually it's so cheap you can chip it off with your fingernail
EDL	00:10:47,423	00:10:53,567	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	But if you're looking at a sign over your local bar or hotel or sometimes even a neon sign over a chainsaw
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:54,847	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	If it's
EDL	00:10:54,847	00:10:57,151	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	Large and you haven't seen it anywhere else
EDL	00:10:57,151	00:10:59,199	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	It was probably painstakingly crafted
EDL	00:10:59,967	00:11:00,735	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	Probably logo

EDL	00:11:11,999	00:11:14,047	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	You have to map out in your mind

EDL	00:11:21,727	00:11:23,263	| 99pi-0193-tubebenders-1 |	And work your way out
