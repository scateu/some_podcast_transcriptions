EDL	00:02:40,512	00:02:46,912	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Because the sell-by date on the milk is required by state law to be just 12 Days After pastor

EDL	00:03:06,112	00:03:12,512	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Montana is throwing out so much milk affect the price of milk there is about $2 per gallon higher than it is in Surrey

EDL	00:03:13,536	00:03:15,328	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	And it's all because of the state label
EDL	00:03:15,840	00:03:20,192	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	In theory Montana strict State label law is about food safety

EDL	00:03:21,728	00:03:23,776	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	But it hasn't been updated since the 80s

EDL	00:03:38,880	00:03:45,280	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Is it shorthand for expires this is Emily broadleaf director of the food Law & policy clinic at

EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:51,680	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	She did a tally of all the different kinds of date labeling what we found was that 41 States
EDL	00:03:52,192	00:03:58,592	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Required a date label on at least some food product she says they're huge inconsistencies not Justa
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:03:59,360	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	In the wording
EDL	00:03:59,360	00:04:01,152	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	But in the meaning of these labels
EDL	00:04:01,920	00:04:03,968	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Some states require them only on Dairy

EDL	00:04:07,808	00:04:13,440	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	And then 20 of those States actually restrict the sale or donation of food after the date
EDL	00:04:13,440	00:04:18,559	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Some of them are quite strict some of them I flat-out band salary donation of food after the date
EDL	00:04:18,559	00:04:21,375	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	And some of them just say we're going to make it complicated
EDL	00:04:21,375	00:04:24,703	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	The powers-that-be have definitely succeeded in making a complex
EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:25,983	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Did to decipher these
EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:28,799	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Or to know how to act on them
EDL	00:04:28,799	00:04:31,359	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	For large retailers and individual consumers
EDL	00:04:31,871	00:04:33,151	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Like this is
EDL	00:04:33,151	00:04:39,551	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	A bad system it's not making people safer it's leading to food waste and the dates really aren't safety
EDL	00:04:39,551	00:04:40,063	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Debased
EDL	00:04:41,087	00:04:41,855	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	That's right
EDL	00:04:41,855	00:04:46,463	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	The date labels on our food are not about food safety
EDL	00:04:46,463	00:04:47,487	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	And
EDL	00:04:47,487	00:04:49,791	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	They were never actually meant to be
EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:52,351	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	But let's back up
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:54,143	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	It All Began in the 1970s
EDL	00:04:54,655	00:04:57,727	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Americans have moved farther away from their food sources
EDL	00:04:57,727	00:05:01,823	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	They were eating more packaged food and getting more of their food in supermarkets
EDL	00:05:01,823	00:05:04,895	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	And they wanted a way to measure how fresh their food was
EDL	00:05:04,895	00:05:10,783	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Most manufacturers already put encrypted dates on their products to help retailers rotate stock
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:14,367	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	And consumers craved access to this information
EDL	00:05:14,879	00:05:20,255	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	In 1977 the New York State consumer protection board published a booklet called blind date
EDL	00:05:20,767	00:05:22,815	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	How to break the codes of the foods you buy
EDL	00:05:23,327	00:05:27,935	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	The booklet told consumers how to decipher the encrypted date codes on their favorite products
EDL	00:05:28,447	00:05:32,543	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Deboer distributed more than 10000 copies and posted the booklet in supermarkets
EDL	00:05:33,055	00:05:34,079	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Eventually
EDL	00:05:34,079	00:05:37,919	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Consumers started to demand that these dates be put clearly on packages
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:40,479	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	But they shouldn't have to get a special book
EDL	00:05:40,479	00:05:41,759	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Decipher a code
EDL	00:05:41,759	00:05:43,295	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	And that seems pretty reasonable
EDL	00:05:43,295	00:05:45,343	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Cuz you're not ask for at 8 labels
EDL	00:05:45,343	00:05:51,743	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	So retailers in grocery stores responded but at that time everyone acknowledged this is really about quality in about fresh
EDL	00:05:51,743	00:05:58,143	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	No one's that I want a label because I'm afraid it won't be safe so a few states begin to regulate these date labels
EDL	00:05:58,143	00:06:04,543	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Massachusetts was the first state that actually required date labels on food
EDL	00:06:04,543	00:06:06,847	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Even though there were a number of attempts
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:13,247	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	And one Congress I think from 1973 to 75 there were 10 bills on date labeling standardization
EDL	00:06:13,247	00:06:14,271	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	None of them pass
EDL	00:06:14,783	00:06:19,135	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Lawmakers disagreed about what the system should look like and who should oversee it
EDL	00:06:19,135	00:06:21,439	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	The Food and Drug Administration is actually said
EDL	00:06:21,951	00:06:28,351	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	We could do that as we know we have the power to do it for the foods we oversee but since these labels were about freshness and
EDL	00:06:28,351	00:06:29,631	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	I'm not about safety
EDL	00:06:29,631	00:06:31,423	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Ultimately the FDA said
EDL	00:06:31,423	00:06:34,495	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	It's not something we want to spend the time and energy on
EDL	00:06:34,495	00:06:38,591	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Still consumers wanted freshness date so all kinds of different ones popped up
EDL	00:06:39,103	00:06:41,663	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Summer stamped on some printed on the label
EDL	00:06:41,663	00:06:44,735	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	There's no consistency and how this information was displayed
EDL	00:06:44,735	00:06:46,271	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Or the language that was used
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:48,831	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Used by all viabestbuy
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:50,879	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Buy tires on
EDL	00:06:51,391	00:06:55,231	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Some companies even tried to promote these dates to sell their products like
EDL	00:06:55,231	00:07:01,631	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Hey by Pepsi because it's going to give you the date to tell you what's fresher than all the other soft drinks
EDL	00:07:01,631	00:07:08,031	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Don't need to tell you how fresh they are diet colas
EDL	00:07:08,031	00:07:11,615	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Hyundai Pepsi introduces
EDL	00:07:12,639	00:07:16,735	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Some date labels were meant for consumers While others were just meant for retail
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:17,503	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Taylors
EDL	00:07:17,503	00:07:23,135	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	And as is still true now there were no clear definitions for any of the phrases
EDL	00:07:23,903	00:07:27,487	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	No consistency even within the same brand or product
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:30,559	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Dates could differ from state to state
EDL	00:07:30,559	00:07:33,887	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Manufacturer to manufacturer or store to store
EDL	00:07:33,887	00:07:40,287	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	And over the years we've lost track of what these labels meant in the first place
EDL	00:07:40,287	00:07:43,359	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Grabs just being used to having labels on their food no one
EDL	00:07:43,359	00:07:45,919	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	No one's ever said to them what they mean and what they don't
EDL	00:07:45,919	00:07:52,319	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	So we've made some false connections to people in their head of met this link and thought well I heard about
EDL	00:07:52,319	00:07:54,623	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	But someone getting salmonella or E coli
EDL	00:07:54,623	00:07:59,231	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	And I see this label on my food and these two things are somehow connected to one another
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:08:02,559	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	But Emily says as much as we might want them to
EDL	00:08:02,559	00:08:06,399	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	These dates are not going to tell us if our food will make us sick
EDL	00:08:06,399	00:08:09,983	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	People keep saying but I just want to know when it will be safe until
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:16,383	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	It's scientifically impossible to sort of say there's a date after which it will become unsafe
EDL	00:08:16,383	00:08:17,151	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Example
EDL	00:08:17,151	00:08:20,735	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	If you run a few errands on a hot day before getting your milk home
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:23,039	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Your milk will spoil faster
EDL	00:08:23,551	00:08:28,927	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	And once it's in the fridge it'll last longer it's a 35 degrees than at 40 degrees
EDL	00:08:29,439	00:08:30,975	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	There's just too many variables
EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:33,535	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	But here's the thing about spoiled milk
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:39,935	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Spoiled milk doesn't mean it has pathogens in it
EDL	00:08:39,935	00:08:42,495	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Json process along with most other bacteria
EDL	00:08:42,495	00:08:45,055	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	The big misconception around 8 label
EDL	00:08:45,567	00:08:48,127	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Is that people think that old food will make them sick
EDL	00:08:48,639	00:08:51,199	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	But for the most part all food doesn't make you sick
EDL	00:08:51,711	00:08:52,735	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Contaminated
EDL	00:08:52,735	00:08:53,503	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Food does
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:59,903	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	The longer a carton of milk exists the more teams that has to come into contact with contaminants that could grow and flourish
EDL	00:08:59,903	00:09:06,303	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Inside that milk and hurt you as long as it's properly pasteurized about the age specifically that makes
EDL	00:09:06,303	00:09:07,327	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Dangerous to drink
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:10,399	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	There is however a small handful of food
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:12,703	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Can become unsafe with age
EDL	00:09:13,215	00:09:16,287	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Deli meats unpasteurized cheeses smoked Seafood
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:19,103	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Stuff in the deli section of the grocery store basically
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:21,663	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	These foods have a high risk for Listeria
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:23,967	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	A bacteria that can be life-threatening
EDL	00:09:24,735	00:09:26,783	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	And in these cases listeria risk
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:28,319	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Does increase with time
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:33,183	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	But I current date labeling system doesn't treat this small subset of foods
EDL	00:09:33,183	00:09:36,255	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Any differently than any other date labeled item
EDL	00:09:36,255	00:09:39,839	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Mo State labels are arrived at by conducting taste test
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:43,935	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	They hit people around a table and then they have everyone eat their product
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:44,959	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Say It's Your Birthday
EDL	00:09:44,959	00:09:46,495	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	They taste a batch made that day
EDL	00:09:47,007	00:09:49,311	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	And then they taste some from the day before
EDL	00:09:49,311	00:09:55,711	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	And the day before that and what did you think was it good that was a tasty did it have the properties you expect for
EDL	00:09:55,711	00:10:00,063	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	From yogurt or whatever the product is when the manufacturer comes to a badge the people say
EDL	00:10:00,063	00:10:02,367	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	I don't really like the way this taste
EDL	00:10:02,367	00:10:05,439	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	They said okay well by for that many days are products not going to be at
EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:11,839	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	And that's where the date really comes from
EDL	00:10:11,839	00:10:12,607	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Companies
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:13,375	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	They just got

EDL	00:10:19,519	00:10:25,663	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	You know we look online for an estimate of what this few know how long this will be fresh or we just kind of

EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:34,623	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	There's some of them are very unscientific about where that date actually comes from
EDL	00:10:35,391	00:10:36,671	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	And yet today
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:39,487	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	According to a report that Emily Bradley co-authored
EDL	00:10:39,999	00:10:42,303	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Majority of consumers believe

EDL	00:10:47,167	00:10:52,287	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	And as many as 90% of Americans throw out food based on date labels
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:53,311	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	At least occasionally

EDL	00:11:21,215	00:11:27,615	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Just wasting the food is wasting the water to grow at the transportation to get to supermarket everything that goes in the ghetto

EDL	00:11:32,991	00:11:34,527	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	And to waste less food
EDL	00:11:34,527	00:11:36,831	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	We need to consider the language were using
EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:42,207	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Sell-by use-by enjoy by like what does that mean you know
EDL	00:11:42,207	00:11:44,511	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	And idea of an expiration date
EDL	00:11:44,511	00:11:45,791	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Is problematic to
EDL	00:11:46,303	00:11:48,095	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	For some reason expired it's dead

EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:16,511	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	States have laws that forbid the donation of so-called expired food
EDL	00:12:17,023	00:12:19,839	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Emily suggests only using the term

EDL	00:12:27,519	00:12:28,543	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	For everything else
EDL	00:12:28,543	00:12:31,359	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	She would go with best if used by
EDL	00:12:31,359	00:12:32,639	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Today would be to labels
EDL	00:12:33,151	00:12:35,967	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Expires on and best if used by
EDL	00:12:35,967	00:12:39,551	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	And this would be a standardized system used all across
EDL	00:12:39,551	00:12:40,319	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	The country
EDL	00:12:40,319	00:12:46,463	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Creating standardized easy-to-understand date labels is a design problem that must have a design solution
EDL	00:12:46,975	00:12:53,375	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Maybe Emily suggested labels or maybe something else entirely the fix doesn't seem like it should be that hard
EDL	00:12:53,375	00:12:54,143	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	And yet
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:12:59,263	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Most of the time when we say this is an issue needs to change people say I agree it's a terrible issue
EDL	00:12:59,263	00:13:03,103	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	But then people really got stuck up on what which phrase should we use and
EDL	00:13:03,103	00:13:09,503	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	How do we decide which foods have which one
EDL	00:13:09,503	00:13:14,367	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	70 different this time is now a part of a national conversation

EDL	00:13:20,767	00:13:24,095	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	And having a better date labeling system is one way to get there
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:25,887	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	But for now

EDL	00:13:31,263	00:13:32,287	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	The answer is
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:33,311	| 99pi-0195-bestenjoyedby-1 |	Trust your taste
