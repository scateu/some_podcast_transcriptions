EDL	00:04:10,112	00:04:11,392	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	The bottom of the lake Isle of
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:17,280	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	The part where it says for more info contact the Canadian Park service because it's cuz you could just

EDL	00:04:19,583	00:04:22,143	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Like strolling at the bottom of a Canadian lake
EDL	00:04:22,655	00:04:28,799	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Actually I asked Denise that and she was like yeah you you could because there's a lot of people to tighten this leg
EDL	00:04:29,311	00:04:32,383	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	But of course the most intriguing part of the plaque
EDL	00:04:33,151	00:04:35,199	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Is the part about the sea
EDL	00:04:35,199	00:04:36,223	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Secret World War
EDL	00:04:36,223	00:04:36,991	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	To project
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:39,039	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Involving the use of ice
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:39,551	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	In shipping
EDL	00:04:40,319	00:04:40,831	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	So what was it
EDL	00:04:41,343	00:04:43,391	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	So okay so in the early
EDL	00:04:43,391	00:04:43,903	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	19/4
EDL	00:04:44,671	00:04:45,695	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	During World War II
EDL	00:04:45,695	00:04:47,999	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	German submarines
EDL	00:04:47,999	00:04:49,279	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	U-boats
EDL	00:04:49,279	00:04:49,791	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	As they were called
EDL	00:04:50,559	00:04:52,351	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Or basically wreaking
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:54,655	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Havoc on Allied ships in the Atlantic
EDL	00:04:54,655	00:04:55,423	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Ocean just
EDL	00:04:55,935	00:04:57,215	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Thinking then left and right
EDL	00:04:57,727	00:05:01,055	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	And So eventually this person named Admiral mountbatten
EDL	00:05:01,055	00:05:03,359	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Goes to Winston Churchill and he's like
EDL	00:05:03,871	00:05:05,663	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	We have to do something about this
EDL	00:05:06,175	00:05:08,223	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	And I think I know what the solution is
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:11,039	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	A giant Unsinkable
EDL	00:05:11,807	00:05:14,111	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Aircraft carrier sized ship
EDL	00:05:15,135	00:05:15,647	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Made of ice
EDL	00:05:18,463	00:05:22,815	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	And actually turtle is intrigued like it sounds like one of those
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:28,191	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Farfetch'd ideas that the kind of gets flooded during times of War but never actually gets billed
EDL	00:05:28,191	00:05:28,703	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Except for this
EDL	00:05:29,215	00:05:31,007	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Really did get built or at least
EDL	00:05:31,519	00:05:32,543	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	A prototype of it
EDL	00:05:33,055	00:05:35,871	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	God built and that is the Shipwreck
EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:37,151	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	At the bottom of
EDL	00:05:37,919	00:05:38,687	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Patricia Lake
EDL	00:05:38,687	00:05:39,711	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	And that's what
EDL	00:05:39,711	00:05:40,735	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	The plaque commemorates
EDL	00:05:41,503	00:05:42,271	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Wow
EDL	00:05:42,271	00:05:43,807	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	So what in the world made
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:45,087	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Admiral mountbatten
EDL	00:05:45,087	00:05:47,391	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Think that an unsinkable ship
EDL	00:05:47,391	00:05:49,183	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Should be made of ice
EDL	00:05:50,719	00:05:51,487	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Yeah
EDL	00:05:51,487	00:05:52,255	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Sole
EDL	00:05:52,255	00:05:52,767	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	What the hell
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:05:59,935	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Reply so that was a big
EDL	00:05:59,935	00:06:02,495	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	They were actively looking for alternatives
EDL	00:06:02,495	00:06:07,359	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	And then the second thing is that they they hopes that this ice ship would be
EDL	00:06:07,359	00:06:08,383	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	So dense
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:09,663	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	And it would basically be induced
EDL	00:06:10,431	00:06:13,759	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	And what made them think that ice would be indestructible because it doesn't
EDL	00:06:13,759	00:06:15,295	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Seem like that
EDL	00:06:15,295	00:06:16,063	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Bright
EDL	00:06:16,063	00:06:18,623	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Oh it actually it wasn't just play nice
EDL	00:06:18,623	00:06:21,695	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	If they weren't they're going to build these ships out of a mixture of
EDL	00:06:21,695	00:06:23,231	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Of ice and Sawdust
EDL	00:06:24,255	00:06:24,767	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Kampai
EDL	00:06:25,535	00:06:28,607	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Named after its inventor a guy named Jeffrey
EDL	00:06:29,887	00:06:30,399	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Sophie mix
EDL	00:06:31,167	00:06:33,727	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Serve water and wood chips together and then
EDL	00:06:34,239	00:06:35,775	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Frozen and maybe ice
EDL	00:06:36,287	00:06:37,311	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Really really strong
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:40,383	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	And so this guy Jeffrey Pike he
EDL	00:06:40,383	00:06:42,175	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	He invented not only by creeper
EDL	00:06:42,687	00:06:45,503	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Came up with the idea of building a ship out of it
EDL	00:06:46,015	00:06:47,551	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	And then he got that idea
EDL	00:06:47,551	00:06:49,087	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	To Admiral mountbatten
EDL	00:06:50,111	00:06:52,671	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	So the ships will be built from blocks of
EDL	00:06:52,671	00:06:55,487	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	I treat and then there would be sleepy pipes
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:57,023	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	With coolant running through the hole
EDL	00:06:57,535	00:06:58,047	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Keep it up
EDL	00:06:58,815	00:07:00,607	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	So that's that's the refrigerator
EDL	00:07:00,607	00:07:02,399	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Are quails a Denisa the bottom
EDL	00:07:02,911	00:07:04,959	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Anti crease really was
EDL	00:07:04,959	00:07:05,727	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Dislike
EDL	00:07:05,727	00:07:07,263	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Credibly strong and then
EDL	00:07:08,031	00:07:09,567	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Mixture then there's this
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:13,407	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Amazing anecdote in the story where Admiral mountbatten
EDL	00:07:14,175	00:07:16,735	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Who is not the inventor of high-grade but
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:18,015	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	She's like the main kind of
EDL	00:07:18,015	00:07:20,575	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Evangelist for this idea and he was so
EDL	00:07:21,087	00:07:22,879	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Hype about it that he brings
EDL	00:07:23,391	00:07:25,439	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	A piece of pie feet to a meeting
EDL	00:07:26,207	00:07:28,511	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	This is a meeting in which they were trying to convince
EDL	00:07:29,023	00:07:32,095	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	The Americans or the British were trying to convince the Americans to
EDL	00:07:32,095	00:07:33,119	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	To get on board this
EDL	00:07:33,631	00:07:35,167	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	This crazy ice ship
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:35,935	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Plan
EDL	00:07:35,935	00:07:41,055	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	So he brings a block of Pie Face the meeting along with a regular block of ice
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:44,639	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	And at some point he does this demonstration where he
EDL	00:07:44,639	00:07:46,687	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Shakes out his revolver and he shoots
EDL	00:07:47,455	00:07:48,223	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	The regular ice
EDL	00:07:48,735	00:07:49,503	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	And it's
EDL	00:07:49,503	00:07:51,551	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Splinters into a thousand little pieces
EDL	00:07:51,551	00:07:52,319	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	And then he
EDL	00:07:52,831	00:07:54,879	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	He shoots The Patriot
EDL	00:07:55,391	00:08:01,535	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	And the bullet bounces off the pykrete and actually sort of ricochets into the leg of one of his car
EDL	00:08:05,119	00:08:06,911	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Successful actually
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:13,311	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Play take Claritin total success and and they're all like thumbs up like Greenlight Full Speed Ahead
EDL	00:08:13,311	00:08:19,711	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	And yeah they did they decide to go forward with this crazy plan Winston Churchill signs off on it I'm not sure what
EDL	00:08:19,711	00:08:20,479	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	What all Americans
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:22,527	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Sign off on it but they
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:24,575	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	American said we'll help you
EDL	00:08:24,575	00:08:28,415	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	You do this and then I guess at some point they also got Canadians involved because they
EDL	00:08:28,415	00:08:29,951	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	They end up building
EDL	00:08:29,951	00:08:31,743	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	This prototype on this little late
EDL	00:08:32,511	00:08:33,023	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	In Alberta
EDL	00:08:34,047	00:08:34,559	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Mike Patricia
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:37,631	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	I named it project
EDL	00:08:37,631	00:08:38,399	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Habakkuk
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:39,167	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	After a Bible
EDL	00:08:39,935	00:08:41,471	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	And I think the verses
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:43,007	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Pretty interesting Cemetery today cuz
EDL	00:08:44,287	00:08:47,103	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Behold ye among the Nations and look
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:48,127	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	And wonder marvelous
EDL	00:08:48,895	00:08:51,455	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	For I am working a work in your days
EDL	00:08:51,455	00:08:53,247	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Which you will not believe
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:58,879	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	He told to you Bible verse
EDL	00:08:59,391	00:09:04,511	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	We are building a crazy thing thing
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:08,095	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	And habakkuk apparently was the name of the Hebrew
EDL	00:09:08,095	00:09:08,863	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Prophet witch
EDL	00:09:08,863	00:09:09,887	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	I certainly never knew
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:16,031	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Prototype itself was built by Canadian conscientious objectors
EDL	00:09:17,311	00:09:20,127	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Didn't know what they were building and who had opted
EDL	00:09:20,895	00:09:23,199	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	For alternative service jobs
EDL	00:09:23,199	00:09:25,247	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	They were like giving this
EDL	00:09:25,247	00:09:27,295	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Job and not really told that it actually was
EDL	00:09:28,063	00:09:30,111	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Abortion before the war
EDL	00:09:32,159	00:09:38,559	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	In just a few months they built a prototype of this ship but it ended up being harder to build and then more expensive
EDL	00:09:38,559	00:09:41,887	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Then they thought and by the time the Prototype was ready
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:47,263	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	The Warhead kind of moved on like they were figuring out how to build the atomic bomb
EDL	00:09:47,775	00:09:49,055	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	They figured out how to mask
EDL	00:09:49,055	00:09:51,103	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Produce smaller aircraft carriers
EDL	00:09:51,871	00:09:57,247	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	And in the end they basically Scott the project and ultimately let it sink into the bottom
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:09:58,783	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Aflac Patricia and
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:09:59,807	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	As we know you can
EDL	00:10:01,343	00:10:02,879	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	See it there today
EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:07,743	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	The coolest thing about diving the habitat is being able to stay that you don't
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:10,815	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Like its it is cool to Diamond that's nice
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:14,911	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	But today but too many times it's not that interesting
EDL	00:10:23,359	00:10:27,455	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Yes apparently like if you build a ship out of ice if I just sort of like
EDL	00:10:27,455	00:10:29,503	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Turns into nothing
EDL	00:10:29,503	00:10:31,295	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	The bottom of the ocean
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:32,831	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Once
EDL	00:10:33,343	00:10:34,367	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	You've seen enough
EDL	00:10:34,367	00:10:36,927	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	That's fine that's awesome

EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:13,791	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	This is a story about a ruin
EDL	00:11:14,303	00:11:15,327	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Probably
EDL	00:11:15,327	00:11:16,095	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	The most
EDL	00:11:16,095	00:11:19,935	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Famous Bruin maybe Roman Colosseum

EDL	00:11:22,751	00:11:27,615	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	I've also never been but you can you can picture
EDL	00:11:27,615	00:11:28,895	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	In a white
EDL	00:11:28,895	00:11:29,663	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Columns
EDL	00:11:30,175	00:11:31,967	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Kind of Dusty
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:38,367	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Denuded of all life and it just looks like a classic ruin
EDL	00:11:39,903	00:11:45,279	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	White and brown hawk
EDL	00:11:45,279	00:11:51,679	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	I think that's like yeah that's part of it image we have of ruins but I was on Twitter the other day and I found this kind of amazing thread
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:55,519	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Read the future all these paintings from the 19th century
EDL	00:11:55,519	00:11:58,079	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	The Coliseum is totally green
EDL	00:11:58,079	00:11:58,591	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	It's like this
EDL	00:11:59,103	00:12:01,919	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	This greenhouse covered in Vines
EDL	00:12:02,431	00:12:07,295	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Plants and plant life and it was a thread put together by this guy named Paul Cooper
EDL	00:12:07,807	00:12:09,087	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Cheese Annapolis
EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:14,719	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Standard PhD researcher at the University of East Anglia and he studies the history of ruin
EDL	00:12:15,231	00:12:21,375	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	And he says that you know it until the middle of the nineteenth Century the Coliseum was totally overrun with plants
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:22,911	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Shrubs and Vines
EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:25,727	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Growing everywhere and then like always
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:29,055	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Artists and Poets were right about the Colosseum is this

EDL	00:12:36,991	00:12:43,391	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	And in 1850s this British botanist a man named Richard Deacon decides to do
EDL	00:12:43,391	00:12:45,695	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Botanical survey of the Coliseum

EDL	00:15:10,335	00:15:11,103	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	This
EDL	00:15:11,103	00:15:12,127	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Inadvertent

EDL	00:15:15,199	00:15:18,015	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Become the dusty dry ruin that we think of today
EDL	00:15:18,783	00:15:25,183	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	So in 1870 Italy gets unified under a secular democratic government

EDL	00:15:30,047	00:15:32,095	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	And this new government is really trying to say
EDL	00:15:32,095	00:15:38,495	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Create a set of rational scientific modern Italian identity but they see that is really rooted in this ancient

EDL	00:15:40,031	00:15:42,591	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Until they care a lot about these old ruins like

EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:41,215	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	The ruin was completely stripped and excavated
EDL	00:16:41,215	00:16:42,751	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	I completely cleaned witches
EDL	00:16:44,031	00:16:46,591	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Unless you unfortunately that the state we find in today
EDL	00:16:47,103	00:16:49,407	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Socially about whatever you think is
EDL	00:16:49,407	00:16:53,759	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Proper thing to preserve I mean do you preserve it is true
EDL	00:16:53,759	00:16:55,551	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	The Vines were destroying the room in
EDL	00:16:58,879	00:17:01,695	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	But what is the cost of removing all the vines
EDL	00:17:01,695	00:17:02,463	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	And
EDL	00:17:02,463	00:17:03,231	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	What is the
EDL	00:17:03,743	00:17:08,607	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	History represented in the natural history of the things that are there
EDL	00:17:08,607	00:17:10,399	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Cooper says that when he sees these
EDL	00:17:10,399	00:17:12,703	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	These beautiful paintings of the Colosseum
EDL	00:17:12,703	00:17:19,103	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	These rare plants travel there are potentially on the back
EDL	00:17:19,103	00:17:20,127	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Interesting questions about
EDL	00:17:20,127	00:17:21,151	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	About what state
EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:24,223	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	We should preserver ruining is it just
EDL	00:17:24,223	00:17:28,063	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	The rocks that the only thing that we care about our stories
EDL	00:17:28,575	00:17:31,391	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Embedded potentially within other aspects of
EDL	00:17:31,391	00:17:32,415	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	What's there that

EDL	00:17:34,719	00:17:37,279	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Yeah it does make me sad to think that we've lost
EDL	00:17:37,279	00:17:38,559	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	The Romantic potential

EDL	00:17:49,311	00:17:54,943	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	I don't like the floor growing up to take you to ruin can tell a huge part of the story
EDL	00:17:55,455	00:17:55,967	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	So
EDL	00:17:56,479	00:17:59,551	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Talking to pollen and then you have seen the Twitter thread that he
EDL	00:17:59,551	00:18:03,391	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Together and then later turn into an article at a really just made me think about
EDL	00:18:03,391	00:18:05,439	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Historical preservation in Ark
EDL	00:18:05,439	00:18:07,743	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Archaeological preservation really
EDL	00:18:07,743	00:18:08,511	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	What gets
EDL	00:18:08,511	00:18:11,071	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	To be a part of what lives on and what
EDL	00:18:11,071	00:18:12,351	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	We choose not to leave
EDL	00:18:12,351	00:18:13,119	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	But doesn't make the cut
EDL	00:18:14,143	00:18:15,167	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Who's in the spaces
EDL	00:18:15,167	00:18:15,679	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Always plants
EDL	00:18:16,191	00:18:18,239	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	In the story of the built world is not just
EDL	00:18:18,239	00:18:20,543	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	The things we build its all the stuff around it and it
EDL	00:18:21,055	00:18:23,103	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	It could be that natural flora and fauna
EDL	00:18:23,103	00:18:25,151	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Effects
EDL	00:18:26,175	00:18:29,247	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	And there are still some plants in the coliseum in NC
EDL	00:18:30,015	00:18:30,783	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Make decisions about what
EDL	00:18:31,295	00:18:36,159	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	The pick
EDL	00:18:36,159	00:18:37,695	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	The space and so it's smooth
EDL	00:18:37,695	00:18:38,975	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Even there even more kind of
EDL	00:18:38,975	00:18:39,743	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Outliers
EDL	00:18:39,743	00:18:40,511	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	So then the rest of the
EDL	00:18:40,511	00:18:41,023	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Adult environment
EDL	00:18:43,071	00:18:44,607	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Little bit of greenery in a gray
EDL	00:18:45,119	00:18:45,631	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Concrete world
EDL	00:19:02,015	00:19:06,111	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	So a while back nine ipi's digital director Kolstad started researching
EDL	00:19:06,111	00:19:06,623	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Story about
EDL	00:19:07,135	00:19:07,903	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Sackcloth
EDL	00:19:07,903	00:19:08,671	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Dresses
EDL	00:19:08,671	00:19:10,463	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	The type of DIY clothing
EDL	00:19:10,463	00:19:11,999	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	From upcycle of flour
EDL	00:19:11,999	00:19:12,767	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	And feed sacks
EDL	00:19:12,767	00:19:16,607	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	And we considered it for a full episode for a while but current had a connection to this
EDL	00:19:17,375	00:19:18,399	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	That made it even better
EDL	00:19:18,911	00:19:19,423	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	As a mini story
EDL	00:19:19,935	00:19:23,007	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Homemade tack cloth apparel group really popular during the Great Depression
EDL	00:19:23,519	00:19:27,615	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	But as I was looking into it I thought the idea seems familiar somehow
EDL	00:19:28,127	00:19:32,991	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	So I called it this is story and I know to see if maybe she had told me about them when I was a bit younger
EDL	00:19:33,503	00:19:34,527	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Okay

EDL	00:19:44,767	00:19:51,167	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Where I teach courses on science in American culture
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:53,727	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	So my mom was born in Michigan during World War II
EDL	00:19:53,727	00:19:55,519	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	And her dad worked in Detroit at the time
EDL	00:19:56,031	00:20:00,383	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	My father was shipped overseas
EDL	00:20:02,431	00:20:06,015	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	So I call people from Michigan she refers to the shape

EDL	00:20:07,807	00:20:09,087	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Gloved hand
EDL	00:20:09,087	00:20:15,231	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	And refers to it as the Fillmore the where it is in the hand right if they're trying to tell you where they are from
EDL	00:20:15,743	00:20:17,535	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Expensive toilet there hand in Lake Point to part of that
EDL	00:20:18,047	00:20:19,839	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Unlike other places in America
EDL	00:20:19,839	00:20:21,887	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	People in Michigan
EDL	00:20:21,887	00:20:22,911	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	To deal with shortages
EDL	00:20:22,911	00:20:24,447	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	In the late 1920s
EDL	00:20:24,447	00:20:25,983	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Going to World War II
EDL	00:20:25,983	00:20:31,103	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	When I was a little girl my grandmother did most of the spelling for all of us
EDL	00:20:31,103	00:20:36,223	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	And so the fabric that she used for
EDL	00:20:36,223	00:20:39,807	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	But she would pick out by going to the local General Store
EDL	00:20:39,807	00:20:43,903	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	My great-grandmother would buy sacks of flour and then reuse those fat
EDL	00:20:44,671	00:20:47,743	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	And the flower stalks became on the fabric store
EDL	00:20:48,255	00:20:50,303	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	These dresses
EDL	00:20:50,303	00:20:51,583	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Any other guy picture
EDL	00:20:52,607	00:20:53,119	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Socks
EDL	00:20:53,631	00:20:55,679	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Butthole rice or something which are
EDL	00:20:55,679	00:20:56,959	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Terrible burlap
EDL	00:20:56,959	00:21:03,103	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Style socks like what was the fabric like finely woven because it was
EDL	00:21:03,103	00:21:03,871	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Need to hold flour
EDL	00:21:05,663	00:21:07,199	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	All cotton fabric
EDL	00:21:10,271	00:21:15,903	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	These days we think of flower is being something that comes in these smaller 5 or 10 lb bag
EDL	00:21:15,903	00:21:16,416	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Made a paper
EDL	00:21:16,928	00:21:18,720	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Back then it was a different story
EDL	00:21:25,632	00:21:27,680	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	So did the flower companies know
EDL	00:21:27,680	00:21:29,984	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	That people were using their flower socks
EDL	00:21:30,496	00:21:32,032	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	An upscaling them
EDL	00:21:32,032	00:21:32,544	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	As dresses
EDL	00:21:33,056	00:21:35,616	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Yeah I've only started to figure this out over time
EDL	00:21:35,616	00:21:42,016	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	And they start to adjust their designs accordingly it's actually you think that would wash back out so you can have this clean white
EDL	00:21:42,016	00:21:45,600	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	White cloth and others went the other direction with it and they design these pattern
EDL	00:21:46,112	00:21:49,952	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	25 flour sacks with dancers are jockeys are bunnies are
EDL	00:21:49,952	00:21:54,560	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Flowers are other interesting things in my mom's grandmother would sit through those options and
EDL	00:21:54,560	00:21:56,096	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Bring home pay rent from the store
EDL	00:21:56,096	00:21:57,888	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Cheap learn quickly
EDL	00:21:57,888	00:21:58,912	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	I didn't like
EDL	00:21:59,680	00:22:05,568	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	So I think she avoided pink Fabric or pink flowers on fabric
EDL	00:22:05,568	00:22:07,360	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	People that time also turn sax
EDL	00:22:07,872	00:22:09,664	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Quilts curtains even diapers
EDL	00:22:10,176	00:22:11,456	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Informers reused
EDL	00:22:11,456	00:22:13,248	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Livestock feed bags to
EDL	00:22:13,760	00:22:15,296	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Matt Patrick was rougher
EDL	00:22:15,296	00:22:16,832	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	But it still work for things like tile
EDL	00:22:17,600	00:22:19,904	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Experience
EDL	00:22:19,904	00:22:24,000	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Eating a piece of that
EDL	00:22:24,512	00:22:25,792	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Apparently my
EDL	00:22:25,792	00:22:30,912	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Great-grandfather had a feedbag Hebron like great-grandmother meet him for doing really dirty work
EDL	00:22:30,912	00:22:32,704	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Like to dirty even for work
EDL	00:22:33,728	00:22:35,776	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Helping out cows in labor
EDL	00:22:38,336	00:22:43,712	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Are you really didn't want to wear even your ordinary work clothes because it was really a pretty bloody mess
EDL	00:22:43,712	00:22:44,480	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Wow
EDL	00:22:44,480	00:22:46,272	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	So you could buy
EDL	00:22:46,784	00:22:47,808	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Seed by a sack
EDL	00:22:49,088	00:22:50,624	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Of feed for the cows
EDL	00:22:51,136	00:22:51,648	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	And then
EDL	00:22:56,256	00:22:57,024	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	That's
EDL	00:22:57,024	00:22:58,048	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	That's pretty crazy
EDL	00:22:58,048	00:22:59,840	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	That's what I recall
EDL	00:23:00,352	00:23:06,752	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Tow companies across caught on to the sack fabric Trend and they realize they could boost their sales with nicer cotton and
EDL	00:23:06,752	00:23:08,800	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Depression worse or the fashionable patterns
EDL	00:23:09,312	00:23:10,336	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Along the way
EDL	00:23:10,336	00:23:11,872	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	And some manufacturers
EDL	00:23:11,872	00:23:14,432	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Even sponsored National sack cloth dress making copy
EDL	00:23:20,832	00:23:22,112	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	She actually said
EDL	00:23:22,112	00:23:26,208	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	This quote that I really liked that it was part of the fabric of life

EDL	00:23:30,560	00:23:32,864	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Ultimately these designs they evolved
EDL	00:23:32,864	00:23:38,240	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Beyond just being Look fashion
EDL	00:23:38,752	00:23:39,776	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	I think is really fast

EDL	00:25:48,032	00:25:50,080	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	In the process of recording at this time is
EDL	00:25:50,080	00:25:52,384	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Kind of hectic and I like to imagine
EDL	00:25:52,384	00:25:54,688	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	A lot of fun but maybe
EDL	00:25:55,200	00:25:57,248	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Maybe more hectic so
EDL	00:25:57,248	00:26:01,856	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Before they use microphones and Studio sound was captured by these big horns

EDL	00:26:05,184	00:26:06,976	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	And these recording horns
EDL	00:26:06,976	00:26:08,768	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Would collect and focus
EDL	00:26:08,768	00:26:10,048	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Sound Vibrations
EDL	00:26:10,048	00:26:13,888	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Into this little diaphragm in the diaphragm would vibrate a stylus
EDL	00:26:13,888	00:26:15,936	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	They cut a Groove into a wax disc
EDL	00:26:16,448	00:26:20,032	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Should I be picturing these recording horns pretty much like
EDL	00:26:20,032	00:26:21,056	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Phonograph
EDL	00:26:21,056	00:26:23,872	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	I don't fashion photography that plays out to one of these
EDL	00:26:25,152	00:26:26,688	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Yeah it's like the same thing it's
EDL	00:26:26,688	00:26:28,224	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	OK Google
EDL	00:26:29,248	00:26:30,016	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Side part of images
EDL	00:26:30,016	00:26:30,784	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Same backwards
EDL	00:26:30,784	00:26:35,392	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	The forwards for the problem with this process was that these recording horns were limited
EDL	00:26:35,904	00:26:38,464	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	In what sound frequencies they'd respond to
EDL	00:26:38,976	00:26:40,512	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	So certain instruments like
EDL	00:26:40,512	00:26:44,352	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Tubas and French horns were which were also made of brass
EDL	00:26:44,352	00:26:46,400	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	I'll get picked up much louder
EDL	00:26:46,400	00:26:47,680	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	10 string instruments
EDL	00:26:47,680	00:26:48,448	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Guitars
EDL	00:26:48,448	00:26:49,984	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Violence
EDL	00:26:49,984	00:26:50,752	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	So now it is
EDL	00:26:51,264	00:26:55,360	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	We record every instrument on its own track and do a lot of leveling after-the-fact but
EDL	00:26:56,128	00:27:00,992	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Back then they had to record whole orchestras with just one or sometimes
EDL	00:27:00,992	00:27:01,760	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	2
EDL	00:27:01,760	00:27:06,368	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	If they were really fancy of these like thing recording horns in a single room
EDL	00:27:06,368	00:27:09,696	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	And then they just make copies of the disc that they recorded on there was no editing
EDL	00:27:10,464	00:27:13,280	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	If there was too much French horn or if an opera singer like
EDL	00:27:13,280	00:27:15,840	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	And blew out the recording what their falsetto
EDL	00:27:15,840	00:27:17,120	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	You'd rather just go away and you do it again
EDL	00:27:18,400	00:27:20,192	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	So in order to get a balanced mix
EDL	00:27:20,960	00:27:22,752	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	I'm Different instruments and voices
EDL	00:27:22,752	00:27:24,800	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Sound Engineers would arrange
EDL	00:27:24,800	00:27:25,824	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Musicians
EDL	00:27:25,824	00:27:26,592	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	All around us
EDL	00:27:26,592	00:27:27,616	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Studio add berries
EDL	00:27:27,616	00:27:28,128	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Distance
EDL	00:27:28,896	00:27:29,664	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	From the recording
EDL	00:27:30,688	00:27:31,712	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Sometimes they do have
EDL	00:27:32,224	00:27:33,504	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Louder instruments like french horns
EDL	00:27:34,016	00:27:40,160	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Pointed at the back wall away from the recording horn and the musicians would be watching their conductor like anime
EDL	00:27:42,208	00:27:48,608	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	And they put pianos on top of platform so that you know like the mallets and chords that are inside would be lined up
EDL	00:27:48,608	00:27:49,632	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	With the recording horn
EDL	00:27:50,144	00:27:51,168	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	And this one's on my face
EDL	00:27:52,192	00:27:54,240	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	They'd sometimes put a singer like on a little
EDL	00:27:54,240	00:27:55,008	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Trolley
EDL	00:27:55,008	00:27:55,776	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	So that
EDL	00:27:55,776	00:27:56,544	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	An assistant coach
EDL	00:27:57,056	00:28:00,384	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Wheel them closer to the horn for quieter vocal passages
EDL	00:28:00,384	00:28:02,688	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	And will them away during loud ones
EDL	00:28:04,224	00:28:09,856	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Chaotic is like a Rube Goldberg recording of an orchestra
EDL	00:28:09,856	00:28:12,672	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	But the string instruments were the hardest to record
EDL	00:28:13,184	00:28:16,512	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	And because of that like stand up bass parts were often just
EDL	00:28:16,512	00:28:17,792	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Play it on tuba instead
EDL	00:28:18,304	00:28:19,840	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	And a lot of Engineers
EDL	00:28:20,352	00:28:21,376	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Didn't want to deal with
EDL	00:28:21,376	00:28:22,144	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Recording violin
EDL	00:28:24,448	00:28:28,032	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Very few recordings with violins on them before a certain time is that true
EDL	00:28:28,544	00:28:31,616	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Well there were actually a fair amount of recordings of viola
EDL	00:28:31,616	00:28:32,640	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	But
EDL	00:28:32,640	00:28:34,688	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	He was part because of the engineers going through all the
EDL	00:28:34,688	00:28:36,224	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Was troubled see these elaborate session
EDL	00:28:36,736	00:28:38,528	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	But also because of this
EDL	00:28:43,136	00:28:45,184	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Okay so can you describe what you're holding
EDL	00:28:45,696	00:28:49,024	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	I'm holding Astro violin witch
EDL	00:28:49,024	00:28:50,304	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	My bandmate founded
EDL	00:28:50,304	00:28:51,584	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Does novelty music shop and it's
EDL	00:28:52,352	00:28:53,120	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	It's got like
EDL	00:28:53,632	00:28:54,400	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	The neck
EDL	00:28:54,912	00:28:55,680	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	And
EDL	00:28:55,680	00:28:58,240	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Like head and Bridge of a violin and the strings
EDL	00:28:58,752	00:29:02,080	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	But instead of like a body it's just got this like
EDL	00:29:02,592	00:29:04,640	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Wooden rod and then
EDL	00:29:05,152	00:29:06,176	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Dislike
EDL	00:29:06,176	00:29:07,200	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Huge horn
EDL	00:29:07,200	00:29:08,736	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Yeah it's coming out of it
EDL	00:29:08,736	00:29:14,368	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	A violin with the body that has the
EDL	00:29:14,368	00:29:19,744	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Thinking that resonate that goes up against your neck when you play a violin that's all gone and then instead
EDL	00:29:19,744	00:29:20,256	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Is this
EDL	00:29:20,768	00:29:22,048	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Bisley a trumpet
EDL	00:29:22,048	00:29:27,936	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Sitting on your pointed folded back into itself in the sound comes out of the end of the of the trumpet
EDL	00:29:28,448	00:29:30,496	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Just like how recording was like
EDL	00:29:30,496	00:29:31,520	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	The gramophone back
EDL	00:29:31,520	00:29:33,312	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Backwards this is also the same concept
EDL	00:29:33,312	00:29:34,080	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Of the gramophone
EDL	00:29:34,080	00:29:36,128	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Vibrating of the strings
EDL	00:29:36,128	00:29:40,480	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Goes into this diaphragm that's down here by the bridge
EDL	00:29:40,480	00:29:42,784	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	And it vibrates the sound
EDL	00:29:42,784	00:29:43,552	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Which cats
EDL	00:29:43,552	00:29:44,832	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Projected out
EDL	00:29:44,832	00:29:45,344	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	By the horn
EDL	00:29:45,856	00:29:47,136	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Wow that's amazing
EDL	00:29:47,136	00:29:48,160	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	It looks really
EDL	00:29:48,672	00:29:49,184	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	It's like
EDL	00:29:49,696	00:29:55,072	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	It would be the centerpiece of a steampunk Orchestra basically yeah there are there are
EDL	00:29:55,072	00:29:56,608	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Steampunk bands
EDL	00:29:56,608	00:29:57,888	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Bat that uses
EDL	00:29:59,424	00:30:01,472	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	I would love to
EDL	00:30:17,600	00:30:18,624	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	That's awesome
EDL	00:30:19,136	00:30:20,160	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	In a way
EDL	00:30:20,672	00:30:23,744	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	In its native state like in this room it kind of sounds like
EDL	00:30:24,256	00:30:29,632	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Like an old recording of a violin because it's going through that diaphragm and Hornet has a little bit of a
EDL	00:30:29,632	00:30:30,912	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Electro-acoustic
EDL	00:30:30,912	00:30:32,448	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Sort of seeming processing
EDL	00:30:32,448	00:30:36,032	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Yeah that's part of it is that like the reason why recording sound that weighs
EDL	00:30:36,032	00:30:37,056	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Because that's what
EDL	00:30:37,056	00:30:38,592	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	The old recording horns were like
EDL	00:30:38,592	00:30:39,360	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Able to pay
EDL	00:30:39,360	00:30:42,688	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Pick up and so what this was doing was actually
EDL	00:30:42,688	00:30:43,456	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Amplifying
EDL	00:30:43,968	00:30:45,504	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	The frequencies that
EDL	00:30:45,504	00:30:46,272	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Like the recording horns
EDL	00:30:47,040	00:30:48,832	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Right toe is sore design
EDL	00:30:49,344	00:30:50,880	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	To speak to
EDL	00:30:50,880	00:30:56,000	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	The horn that is doing the recording in some ways like it's the it's the analog to match on the other side of it
EDL	00:30:56,000	00:30:57,024	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	To make it even better.
EDL	00:30:57,792	00:31:00,096	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Another thing that it did was it actually like
EDL	00:31:00,864	00:31:01,888	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	The horn
EDL	00:31:01,888	00:31:05,984	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	It made the sound more directional because all of these musicians had to like
EDL	00:31:06,496	00:31:09,312	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Funnel their sounds like into this like one
EDL	00:31:09,312	00:31:12,896	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Christa corn in the corner of the room it was really helpful
EDL	00:31:12,896	00:31:18,784	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	When you can have a violin that would point it sound directly at the horn rather than like just radiating out into the room which is like
EDL	00:31:18,784	00:31:20,064	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	What the resident body usual
EDL	00:31:21,600	00:31:24,672	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Every little while it was a big deal on the recording industry
EDL	00:31:24,672	00:31:31,072	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	These designs replied all kinds of instruments Pro guitars Joe cello through mandolin Stroh ukulele
EDL	00:31:31,072	00:31:34,144	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Please and actually a lot of instruments that
EDL	00:31:34,144	00:31:37,472	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Like weren't under the Stroh name but there was just a lot of
EDL	00:31:37,472	00:31:39,776	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Different instruments like from different companies that
EDL	00:31:39,776	00:31:41,312	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Utilize this design
EDL	00:31:41,312	00:31:43,104	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Instro is the brand name
EDL	00:31:43,104	00:31:46,176	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Lasko is the name of the person who invented the first
EDL	00:31:47,200	00:31:51,296	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	John Matthias Augustus Stroh
EDL	00:31:51,296	00:31:56,416	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	And so were they all manufactured by the company that was destroyed company or is it just a design that was
EDL	00:31:56,416	00:31:57,440	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Excuse by anybody
EDL	00:31:57,440	00:31:59,744	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Astro violin company in them
EDL	00:31:59,744	00:32:01,280	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	They kept manufacturing them even pass

EDL	00:32:05,888	00:32:10,496	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Where you left off whenever a lot of articles that were speculating about where it fit in
EDL	00:32:11,008	00:32:15,616	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	To the broader world of music I like this one in strand Magazine from 1902 that I found
EDL	00:32:16,128	00:32:16,896	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	I was pushing
EDL	00:32:17,408	00:32:23,040	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Hard that these instruments were the future
EDL	00:32:23,040	00:32:25,088	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	But what is a great importance
EDL	00:32:25,088	00:32:26,368	| 289_Mini_Stories_Volume_3_pt01 |	Is an entire absence of
