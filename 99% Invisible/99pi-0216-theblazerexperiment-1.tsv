EDL	00:07:13,919	00:07:17,503	| 99pi-0216-theblazerexperiment-1 |	Because for so many years the people were ruled by

EDL	00:07:54,879	00:07:57,695	| 99pi-0216-theblazerexperiment-1 |	This included a quasi-military structure
EDL	00:07:58,207	00:07:59,743	| 99pi-0216-theblazerexperiment-1 |	And the goal of crime prevention
EDL	00:08:00,767	00:08:02,815	| 99pi-0216-theblazerexperiment-1 |	But there were still some problem
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:06,911	| 99pi-0216-theblazerexperiment-1 |	Most early police departments in the US Allied themselves
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:08,191	| 99pi-0216-theblazerexperiment-1 |	The rich and the powerful

EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:12,031	| 99pi-0216-theblazerexperiment-1 |	And you might be thinking
EDL	00:08:12,543	00:08:13,567	| 99pi-0216-theblazerexperiment-1 |	Still like that now
EDL	00:08:14,079	00:08:15,359	| 99pi-0216-theblazerexperiment-1 |	And you might be right
EDL	00:08:15,359	00:08:16,639	| 99pi-0216-theblazerexperiment-1 |	But it was worse than
EDL	00:08:16,639	00:08:22,015	| 99pi-0216-theblazerexperiment-1 |	Like a new mayor would get elected and then would appoint a hand-picked police chief
EDL	00:08:22,015	00:08:23,295	| 99pi-0216-theblazerexperiment-1 |	Chief with higher

EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:29,951	| 99pi-0216-theblazerexperiment-1 |	So very political in and obviously
EDL	00:08:30,463	00:08:33,791	| 99pi-0216-theblazerexperiment-1 |	True the police chief you sort of work for the mayor local politician

EDL	00:08:35,839	00:08:37,119	| 99pi-0216-theblazerexperiment-1 |	Purposes first
EDL	00:08:37,119	00:08:38,399	| 99pi-0216-theblazerexperiment-1 |	And the community Maybe
EDL	00:08:38,911	00:08:39,679	| 99pi-0216-theblazerexperiment-1 |	Secondarily
EDL	00:08:40,191	00:08:41,215	| 99pi-0216-theblazerexperiment-1 |	It was a patronage
EDL	00:08:41,983	00:08:45,823	| 99pi-0216-theblazerexperiment-1 |	And in most departments recruits didn't receive any special training
EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:47,871	| 99pi-0216-theblazerexperiment-1 |	They were just handed a badge
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:48,895	| 99pi-0216-theblazerexperiment-1 |	Animated stick
EDL	00:08:48,895	00:08:50,175	| 99pi-0216-theblazerexperiment-1 |	And sent out on patrol
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:56,831	| 99pi-0216-theblazerexperiment-1 |	Despite the spiffy new uniforms and their newly organized approach
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:08:58,623	| 99pi-0216-theblazerexperiment-1 |	Public trust in the police
EDL	00:08:58,623	00:08:59,391	| 99pi-0216-theblazerexperiment-1 |	Was
EDL	00:08:59,391	00:08:59,903	| 99pi-0216-theblazerexperiment-1 |	Dismal
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:03,231	| 99pi-0216-theblazerexperiment-1 |	So a reform movement begins to grow a
EDL	00:09:03,231	00:09:04,511	| 99pi-0216-theblazerexperiment-1 |	Across America
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:08,863	| 99pi-0216-theblazerexperiment-1 |	And then in 1929 President Herbert Hoover convenes a group
EDL	00:09:09,375	00:09:10,911	| 99pi-0216-theblazerexperiment-1 |	Called the Wickersham Commission
EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:14,751	| 99pi-0216-theblazerexperiment-1 |	They conducted the first national study of the American

EDL	00:09:16,543	00:09:18,591	| 99pi-0216-theblazerexperiment-1 |	They look at the system from Top

EDL	00:09:19,615	00:09:23,711	| 99pi-0216-theblazerexperiment-1 |	And they basically saw the infiltration of politics into
EDL	00:09:24,735	00:09:25,247	| 99pi-0216-theblazerexperiment-1 |	Huge profit
EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:27,295	| 99pi-0216-theblazerexperiment-1 |	And they said that
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:28,575	| 99pi-0216-theblazerexperiment-1 |	We need to change
EDL	00:09:28,575	00:09:29,087	| 99pi-0216-theblazerexperiment-1 |	How We Do
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:33,951	| 99pi-0216-theblazerexperiment-1 |	The Wickersham report shocked the country by exposing widespread police abuse
EDL	00:09:34,463	00:09:39,839	| 99pi-0216-theblazerexperiment-1 |	It described police routinely beating suspects in holding them illegally for like they questioning
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:40,607	| 99pi-0216-theblazerexperiment-1 |	And you might be psychic
EDL	00:09:41,119	00:09:42,399	| 99pi-0216-theblazerexperiment-1 |	It's still like that now
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:43,679	| 99pi-0216-theblazerexperiment-1 |	And you might be right
EDL	00:09:44,191	00:09:45,215	| 99pi-0216-theblazerexperiment-1 |	But it was worse than
EDL	00:09:45,727	00:09:48,031	| 99pi-0216-theblazerexperiment-1 |	The report included some pretty disturbing a
EDL	00:09:48,799	00:09:53,151	| 99pi-0216-theblazerexperiment-1 |	Like a suspect who was held by the ankles from a third-story window
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:58,015	| 99pi-0216-theblazerexperiment-1 |	And another who was forced to stand in the morgue with his hands on the body of a murderer
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:10:02,111	| 99pi-0216-theblazerexperiment-1 |	This report the Wickersham report really was sort of
EDL	00:10:02,111	00:10:04,927	| 99pi-0216-theblazerexperiment-1 |	Is turning point and we need to do something different in
EDL	00:10:05,951	00:10:06,975	| 99pi-0216-theblazerexperiment-1 |	I think that's what led into this
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:07,487	| 99pi-0216-theblazerexperiment-1 |	Professional air
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:13,119	| 99pi-0216-theblazerexperiment-1 |	This new professional era which continued up into the 1960s and 70s
EDL	00:10:13,119	00:10:16,703	| 99pi-0216-theblazerexperiment-1 |	Was characterized by the emphasis on policing as a skilled profession

EDL	00:10:50,495	00:10:53,567	| 99pi-0216-theblazerexperiment-1 |	And he helped her write the Wickersham report
