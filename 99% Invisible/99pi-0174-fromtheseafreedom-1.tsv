EDL	00:17:00,671	00:17:05,279	| 99pi-0174-fromtheseafreedom-1 |	And because we don't want to piss off China we also don't recognize Taiwan
EDL	00:17:05,279	00:17:05,791	| 99pi-0174-fromtheseafreedom-1 |	Estate
EDL	00:17:06,303	00:17:10,399	| 99pi-0174-fromtheseafreedom-1 |	Although the US government does send ambassadors to Taiwan
EDL	00:17:10,399	00:17:16,799	| 99pi-0174-fromtheseafreedom-1 |	We just technically make the ambassadors resign when we send them and then we reinstate them when they're transferred

EDL	00:17:17,823	00:17:21,151	| 99pi-0174-fromtheseafreedom-1 |	So if China says anything about it we can be like ambassador
EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:21,919	| 99pi-0174-fromtheseafreedom-1 |	What am I asking
EDL	00:17:22,431	00:17:24,479	| 99pi-0174-fromtheseafreedom-1 |	So many state has more a matter of degrees

EDL	00:17:38,815	00:17:41,375	| 99pi-0174-fromtheseafreedom-1 |	Not even tuvalu or Burkina Faso
EDL	00:17:44,447	00:17:46,239	| 99pi-0174-fromtheseafreedom-1 |	As for the population of Sealand

EDL	00:18:18,239	00:18:22,335	| 99pi-0174-fromtheseafreedom-1 |	Probably because doing so would be harder than just letting it keep being what it is
