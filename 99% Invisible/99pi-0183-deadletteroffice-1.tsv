EDL	00:02:30,272	00:02:30,784	| 99pi-0183-deadletteroffice-1 |	It has happened to you
EDL	00:02:31,552	00:02:35,392	| 99pi-0183-deadletteroffice-1 |	But what makes my story different is that I went looking for what I lost
EDL	00:02:36,416	00:02:37,952	| 99pi-0183-deadletteroffice-1 |	So you didn't come
EDL	00:02:38,976	00:02:41,024	| 99pi-0183-deadletteroffice-1 |	And the place I ended up was
EDL	00:02:41,024	00:02:41,792	| 99pi-0183-deadletteroffice-1 |	So strange
EDL	00:02:42,816	00:02:43,584	| 99pi-0183-deadletteroffice-1 |	To dream Lake
EDL	00:02:44,864	00:02:45,376	| 99pi-0183-deadletteroffice-1 |	Outside the box

EDL	00:02:49,472	00:02:50,496	| 99pi-0183-deadletteroffice-1 |	But let me backup app
EDL	00:02:51,520	00:02:53,312	| 99pi-0183-deadletteroffice-1 |	It was 2007
EDL	00:02:53,312	00:02:54,080	| 99pi-0183-deadletteroffice-1 |	August
EDL	00:02:54,080	00:02:57,408	| 99pi-0183-deadletteroffice-1 |	I was moving from Minnesota to Michigan to start grad school
EDL	00:02:57,920	00:03:02,016	| 99pi-0183-deadletteroffice-1 |	I packed whatever couldn't fit into my station wagon into three cardboard boxes
EDL	00:03:02,016	00:03:03,552	| 99pi-0183-deadletteroffice-1 |	And ship them parcel rate
EDL	00:03:03,552	00:03:04,320	| 99pi-0183-deadletteroffice-1 |	Books mostly
EDL	00:03:05,344	00:03:10,208	| 99pi-0183-deadletteroffice-1 |	The first box arrived at the leisurely Pace the book ship parcel rate usually do
EDL	00:03:10,720	00:03:11,744	| 99pi-0183-deadletteroffice-1 |	And then
EDL	00:03:11,744	00:03:12,256	| 99pi-0183-deadletteroffice-1 |	I waited
EDL	00:03:12,768	00:03:19,168	| 99pi-0183-deadletteroffice-1 |	Four weeks the second box never showed though when I say that it never showed
EDL	00:03:19,168	00:03:25,568	| 99pi-0183-deadletteroffice-1 |	I mean that most of the Box never showed a piece of it eventually did arrive it came in a large envelope
EDL	00:03:25,568	00:03:31,968	| 99pi-0183-deadletteroffice-1 |	I need rectangle of cardboard the box top where I had written my address someone had taken a razor
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:38,368	| 99pi-0183-deadletteroffice-1 |	Very carefully sliced it off the box and enclose note on Postal Service letterhead in Pharr
EDL	00:03:38,368	00:03:44,768	| 99pi-0183-deadletteroffice-1 |	Remind me that my address label had become detached from my box and so I was thrilled when I came home one day
EDL	00:03:44,768	00:03:51,168	| 99pi-0183-deadletteroffice-1 |	Months later and found my third box waiting for me on my doorstep my lost box was here
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:54,240	| 99pi-0183-deadletteroffice-1 |	But something about the box was different
EDL	00:03:54,752	00:03:59,360	| 99pi-0183-deadletteroffice-1 |	11 torn apart and then lashed back together with plastic zip ties
EDL	00:03:59,360	00:04:01,664	| 99pi-0183-deadletteroffice-1 |	When I cut it open the cookbook side
EDL	00:04:01,664	00:04:03,456	| 99pi-0183-deadletteroffice-1 |	Carefully packs were in disarray
EDL	00:04:03,968	00:04:10,368	| 99pi-0183-deadletteroffice-1 |	My 4 inch thick hardcover Joy of Cooking have been torn apart down the spine like a weightlifter and used it
EDL	00:04:10,368	00:04:11,648	| 99pi-0183-deadletteroffice-1 |	For some feat of strength
EDL	00:04:11,648	00:04:16,000	| 99pi-0183-deadletteroffice-1 |	The two halves were sandwiched around the cookbook I have never seen before
EDL	00:04:16,000	00:04:19,583	| 99pi-0183-deadletteroffice-1 |	Someone else's copy of Sophia Loren's recipes and memories
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:22,399	| 99pi-0183-deadletteroffice-1 |	Sophia leered at me from the cover
EDL	00:04:23,167	00:04:24,959	| 99pi-0183-deadletteroffice-1 |	Cleavage was distracting
EDL	00:04:24,959	00:04:27,007	| 99pi-0183-deadletteroffice-1 |	I was perplexed
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:28,543	| 99pi-0183-deadletteroffice-1 |	I told my mother about it
EDL	00:04:29,055	00:04:31,615	| 99pi-0183-deadletteroffice-1 |	Oh yes she said that's happened to me too
EDL	00:04:32,383	00:04:33,919	| 99pi-0183-deadletteroffice-1 |	She had shipped a box of books
EDL	00:04:33,919	00:04:35,967	| 99pi-0183-deadletteroffice-1 |	Come from Europe and when she opened it
EDL	00:04:35,967	00:04:40,063	| 99pi-0183-deadletteroffice-1 |	This box was filled with other people's things all from different countries
EDL	00:04:40,575	00:04:43,903	| 99pi-0183-deadletteroffice-1 |	It had a Bible that was in Russian
EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:45,439	| 99pi-0183-deadletteroffice-1 |	A magazine

EDL	00:04:55,423	00:04:56,191	| 99pi-0183-deadletteroffice-1 |	Astounded
EDL	00:04:56,191	00:04:58,495	| 99pi-0183-deadletteroffice-1 |	My friend Helen had mailed some boxes
EDL	00:04:58,495	00:05:00,031	| 99pi-0183-deadletteroffice-1 |	And she had a Story 2
EDL	00:05:00,543	00:05:01,567	| 99pi-0183-deadletteroffice-1 |	When I got the box
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:02,335	| 99pi-0183-deadletteroffice-1 |	Does open

EDL	00:05:06,431	00:05:07,199	| 99pi-0183-deadletteroffice-1 |	Dried
EDL	00:05:07,199	00:05:07,711	| 99pi-0183-deadletteroffice-1 |	Like the Box
EDL	00:05:08,223	00:05:08,735	| 99pi-0183-deadletteroffice-1 |	Verso mutilate
EDL	00:05:10,015	00:05:11,295	| 99pi-0183-deadletteroffice-1 |	And when I open them

EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:36,383	| 99pi-0183-deadletteroffice-1 |	My loss
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:40,735	| 99pi-0183-deadletteroffice-1 |	Helen and my mom shrug this off and they let things go
EDL	00:05:41,503	00:05:42,783	| 99pi-0183-deadletteroffice-1 |	But it's not that me
