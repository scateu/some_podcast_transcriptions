EDL	00:02:13,120	00:02:19,520	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	I'm here with a question from Isabelle Ave from Toronto Ontario she asked why does your food look different in the advertising
EDL	00:02:19,520	00:02:20,800	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	In what in the store
EDL	00:02:20,800	00:02:23,104	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	The great question Isabel we get off that a lot
EDL	00:02:23,616	00:02:27,712	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	And if you want to come with me I'm going to take you across the street we're going to find out a bit more
EDL	00:02:27,712	00:02:34,112	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	In 2012 McDonald's Canada put out this video about the process they go through to photograph one of
EDL	00:02:34,112	00:02:34,624	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	Their burgers
EDL	00:02:35,136	00:02:38,208	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	Let me introduce you now to Noah's Ark
EDL	00:02:38,208	00:02:38,720	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	Food stylist
EDL	00:02:39,232	00:02:42,304	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	I think it's important to note that all the ingredients
EDL	00:02:42,304	00:02:44,608	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	No uses are the exact same ingredients
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:53,056	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	The video follows food stylist Noah as he painstakingly selects the perfect slices of us
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:56,896	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	Onion and pickle pee places them on the burger with tweezers
EDL	00:02:56,896	00:02:58,688	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	And then precisely melt
EDL	00:02:58,688	00:03:00,736	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	The cheese just so
EDL	00:03:00,736	00:03:02,272	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	So if I'm jacked melting down
EDL	00:03:04,320	00:03:10,208	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	Then he picks up a plastic syringe filled with ketchup and applies it with surgical precision
EDL	00:03:10,208	00:03:10,720	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	Maybe I'll put
EDL	00:03:11,488	00:03:12,512	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	Mustard ketchup
EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:14,304	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	Actually catch up must
EDL	00:03:15,328	00:03:19,936	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	Then they photograph this fancy burger and Photoshop it to perfection
EDL	00:03:23,776	00:03:26,848	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	They place a picture of a real burger just ordered at McDonald's
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:29,664	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	Next to the image of this stylized Burger
EDL	00:03:30,176	00:03:31,200	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	And the difference
EDL	00:03:31,200	00:03:31,968	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	Is striking
EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:34,528	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	That's reporter Danny Lewis
EDL	00:03:34,528	00:03:37,600	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	I would like to eat the burger that Noah styled into symbol
EDL	00:03:37,600	00:03:39,136	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	The other one not so much
EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:44,256	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	The last hundred years or so of food advertising have been shaped by this one simple
EDL	00:03:45,280	00:03:46,560	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	Real food looks
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:47,584	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	Bad on camera
EDL	00:03:48,096	00:03:52,704	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	Shooting food and even photographing food is always been fiendishly difficult in that
EDL	00:03:53,472	00:03:55,264	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	This is Terry O'Reilly
EDL	00:03:55,264	00:03:56,032	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	Predict it
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:03:57,312	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	He was an ad man
EDL	00:03:57,312	00:03:59,616	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	And he now hosts a radio show about advertising
EDL	00:04:00,128	00:04:01,152	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	Called under the influence
EDL	00:04:01,664	00:04:04,736	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	Terry says the challenges of shooting food are obvious
EDL	00:04:05,248	00:04:09,088	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	First of all food is boring to look at when it's just sitting on a plane
EDL	00:04:09,088	00:04:11,136	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	Because food is he generally static
EDL	00:04:11,136	00:04:13,440	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	Then when you subjected to the Hot Lights of a
EDL	00:04:13,440	00:04:15,232	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	Studio the food starts to wilt
EDL	00:04:15,744	00:04:17,536	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	It's just simple science
EDL	00:04:18,047	00:04:23,167	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	And so advertisers have had to constantly walk this fine line between enhancement and faker
EDL	00:04:23,679	00:04:25,471	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	Find all kinds of tricks
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:27,263	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	To get food to look good
EDL	00:04:28,031	00:04:32,639	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	For the first half of the 20th century well after photography it was widely adopted
EDL	00:04:32,639	00:04:36,991	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	Advertisers in magazines and newspapers relied heavily on illustration
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:38,527	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	The reason illustration
EDL	00:04:38,527	00:04:42,367	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	What's the preferred method was because you can completely control an illustration
EDL	00:04:42,879	00:04:46,719	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	Another word just know lighting issues there's no wilting food issues
EDL	00:04:47,231	00:04:49,791	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	A marketer could really completely dick
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:54,143	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	Tate what that food would look like right down to the to the strand of pasta
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:55,167	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	With an illustrate
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:04:57,983	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	Then TV came along in the 1950s and 60s
EDL	00:04:58,495	00:05:01,567	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	And advertisers face a whole new set of challenges
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:04,895	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	I'm going to show you how McDonald's build a Big Mac sandwich
EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:09,759	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	A lot of them didn't really understand how to shoot food in a compelling way
EDL	00:05:09,759	00:05:13,343	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	In this add the hamburger just sits there on the counter
EDL	00:05:13,343	00:05:15,391	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	All the ingredients get piled on
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:18,463	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	It starts here with a lightly Toasted Bun
EDL	00:05:19,743	00:05:22,303	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	And then a pure beef hamburger
EDL	00:05:23,071	00:05:24,351	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	Sizzling hot
EDL	00:05:24,351	00:05:25,887	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	Without compelling visuals
EDL	00:05:25,887	00:05:27,423	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	Optavia voiceover
EDL	00:05:27,423	00:05:29,727	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	Just describing the hell out of the
EDL	00:05:29,727	00:05:30,495	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	The food
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:32,031	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	Listing ingredients
EDL	00:05:32,031	00:05:34,079	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	Telling you how good it tasted
EDL	00:05:34,079	00:05:36,383	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	A little more sauce just for good flavor
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:39,455	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	Crisp dill pickles
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:41,759	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	And the sesame seed crown
EDL	00:05:42,271	00:05:45,855	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	These early tv ads relied on relatively static shots
EDL	00:05:45,855	00:05:49,695	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	Advertisers would use a wide-angle lens mounted on a camera
EDL	00:05:49,695	00:05:52,767	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	Animated Superman and pain a little but that's about it
EDL	00:05:52,767	00:05:54,815	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	There were lots of shots of boxes
EDL	00:05:54,815	00:05:55,327	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	And labels
EDL	00:05:55,839	00:05:56,607	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	The food did
EDL	00:05:57,119	00:05:59,679	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	Just normal food stuff you might see
EDL	00:06:00,191	00:06:04,287	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	Something being ladled out of a pot you might see you know a spoon
EDL	00:06:04,799	00:06:09,151	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	Serving peas at a dinner table or serving cream corn at a dinner table
EDL	00:06:09,151	00:06:10,943	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	So that would be the extent of the motion
EDL	00:06:11,455	00:06:13,503	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	On top of the new challenges of television
EDL	00:06:13,503	00:06:19,903	| 99pi-0205-flyingfood-1 |	Food advertisers in the late 60s found themselves facing new scrutiny the Federal Trade Commission with keeping a close eye
