EDL	00:02:06,720	00:02:08,256	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	So I decided I'd

EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:12,512	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	And I asked about Madonna how he liked this game freak keeper like
EDL	00:03:12,512	00:03:13,792	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Working for her and
EDL	00:03:14,560	00:03:18,400	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	He said he loved his job and he thought Madonna was too

EDL	00:03:36,064	00:03:36,576	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	As I was

EDL	00:03:53,984	00:03:56,032	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	I'm going on in this was
EDL	00:03:57,312	00:03:58,080	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	This was

EDL	00:12:10,623	00:12:12,159	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	To do at the time
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:14,207	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Lake often Wilburys
EDL	00:12:14,207	00:12:14,719	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	On the head
EDL	00:12:15,231	00:12:17,791	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	So is a very very Motley Crue
EDL	00:12:17,791	00:12:18,303	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Pink
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:23,167	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	This Motley Crew of hikers gathered with their Berets and rucksacks at the base of the mountain
EDL	00:12:23,679	00:12:25,471	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Anthony Rothman gave a speech
EDL	00:12:25,471	00:12:29,823	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	About taking back the rights they lost during the enclosure acts of the 17 and 18
EDL	00:12:30,335	00:12:31,615	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Any emphasize
EDL	00:12:31,615	00:12:33,663	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	The trespass on Kinder Scout
EDL	00:12:33,663	00:12:34,943	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Was meant to be peaceful
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:38,015	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	And with that the group set off up the mountain
EDL	00:12:38,015	00:12:39,807	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	The other thing they did was sing
EDL	00:12:40,575	00:12:42,879	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	They quite often sang when they went a trembling
EDL	00:12:43,391	00:12:47,231	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	And then they were singing songs like be internationally and
EDL	00:12:47,231	00:12:47,999	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	That sort of thing
EDL	00:12:48,511	00:12:50,303	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	About course
EDL	00:12:50,303	00:12:52,607	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Show their political leanings
EDL	00:12:52,607	00:12:53,375	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	As well
EDL	00:12:53,887	00:12:54,655	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Communist
EDL	00:12:57,471	00:12:59,263	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	The Ramblers were in a good mood to say hi
EDL	00:12:59,775	00:13:00,799	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	The saying and talk
EDL	00:13:01,311	00:13:06,943	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	There was some police behind them keeping an eye on things and having to keep up with the pace of the young walkers
EDL	00:13:07,455	00:13:11,039	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	At one point a group of gamekeepers approach them wagging their sticks
EDL	00:13:11,039	00:13:12,319	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	And a small scuffle into
EDL	00:13:12,831	00:13:16,927	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	One gamekeeper going to rolls over and hurt his ankle that's the extent of the
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:17,695	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	A scuffle
EDL	00:13:18,207	00:13:20,255	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Eventually the Ramblers made their way back to
EDL	00:13:20,255	00:13:21,023	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	The bottom
EDL	00:13:21,023	00:13:22,303	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	The trespass have been
EDL	00:13:22,303	00:13:23,071	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Success
EDL	00:13:23,071	00:13:27,423	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	They openly walked on Kinder Scout and no one has been able to stop them
EDL	00:13:27,423	00:13:30,239	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	And it probably all would have ended right there
EDL	00:13:30,239	00:13:33,311	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	With nothing much gained or lost on either side
EDL	00:13:33,311	00:13:39,711	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	If the police hadn't decided to make some arrests
EDL	00:13:39,711	00:13:44,831	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Arrested at this time trespassing wasn't even an arrestable offense
EDL	00:13:44,831	00:13:49,439	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	So the police came up with another charge
EDL	00:13:49,951	00:13:50,463	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Assembly
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:52,511	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	1 Rambler got off
EDL	00:13:52,511	00:13:54,047	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	But the rest were convicted
EDL	00:13:54,047	00:13:55,583	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Prison Center
EDL	00:13:55,583	00:13:56,607	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	This is from
EDL	00:13:56,607	00:13:57,375	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	2 to 6 months
EDL	00:13:58,143	00:14:01,727	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	But when the sentences were handed down by the judge
EDL	00:14:02,239	00:14:05,055	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	But actually United the Rambler schools
EDL	00:14:05,055	00:14:07,615	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	And I also this was terrible you know
EDL	00:14:07,615	00:14:09,663	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Just for walking on the moon with paper being sent
EDL	00:14:10,687	00:14:15,295	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Suddenly there was this huge amount of awareness and the general public about walking rights
EDL	00:14:15,295	00:14:16,575	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	This was like
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:17,343	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	National
EDL	00:14:18,367	00:14:19,903	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Item at the time
EDL	00:14:19,903	00:14:21,695	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Sympathetic
EDL	00:14:23,231	00:14:24,255	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Set in motion
EDL	00:14:24,255	00:14:25,279	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Change

EDL	00:14:28,607	00:14:30,143	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	It's been described as
EDL	00:14:30,143	00:14:31,167	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	One of the most
EDL	00:14:31,167	00:14:32,447	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Successful
EDL	00:14:32,447	00:14:34,751	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Acts of civil disobedience
EDL	00:14:34,751	00:14:36,543	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Ever in the history of this country
EDL	00:14:37,311	00:14:39,359	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	The whole thing is even memorialized in song
EDL	00:14:40,127	00:14:42,687	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	There was a guy on the trespass name Jimmy Miller
EDL	00:14:42,687	00:14:47,807	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	He eventually became a pretty well-known folk singer in England and changed his name to you and McCall
EDL	00:14:47,807	00:14:49,599	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	And you and wrote the song
EDL	00:14:50,111	00:14:51,391	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Based on the mass trespass

EDL	00:14:53,183	00:14:53,695	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Another word
EDL	00:14:54,207	00:14:56,255	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	You're not going to ask me to sing it on you
EDL	00:14:56,767	00:14:57,535	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Kayak
EDL	00:14:57,535	00:14:58,303	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Yeah
EDL	00:14:58,815	00:14:59,327	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	I really want
EDL	00:15:01,119	00:15:02,399	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	I can sing the chorus
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:04,703	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	I think you should get a recording
EDL	00:15:04,703	00:15:05,215	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Really
EDL	00:15:06,495	00:15:10,079	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	I'm a rambler I'm a rambler from Manchester

EDL	00:15:30,303	00:15:31,327	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	For the trespasser
EDL	00:15:31,839	00:15:33,631	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	In this country and then
EDL	00:15:34,143	00:15:35,679	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	It'll be played at my funeral
EDL	00:15:41,311	00:15:41,823	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Nothing
EDL	00:15:44,383	00:15:45,663	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	After the trespass
EDL	00:15:45,663	00:15:48,735	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	The rambling groups continue to push for expanded access
EDL	00:15:48,735	00:15:49,503	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	There are more tests
EDL	00:15:50,271	00:15:53,599	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	In 1951 when Britain opened its first national park
EDL	00:15:54,111	00:15:57,183	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	It was in the Peak District for the Kinder Scout trespass 2
EDL	00:15:57,183	00:15:57,951	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Place
EDL	00:15:57,951	00:15:59,231	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	This was no accident
EDL	00:15:59,743	00:16:02,047	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Years of negotiations between the Ramblers
EDL	00:16:02,047	00:16:05,375	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	And the landowners and legislators in the area and pave the way
EDL	00:16:05,887	00:16:07,935	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	But it wasn't until the year 2000
EDL	00:16:07,935	00:16:10,239	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	But the Ramblers got within always wanted
EDL	00:16:10,751	00:16:12,543	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	An act of Parliament that opened up
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:13,567	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Huge swath
EDL	00:16:13,567	00:16:14,335	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Country
EDL	00:16:14,335	00:16:15,871	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Where people could roam free
EDL	00:16:15,871	00:16:18,943	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	The countryside and rights-of-way act
EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:20,991	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	And that opened up
EDL	00:16:20,991	00:16:21,759	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Mountain
EDL	00:16:21,759	00:16:22,271	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	More
EDL	00:16:24,063	00:16:26,879	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Stars are just kind of fancy English words for
EDL	00:16:26,879	00:16:28,927	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Unimproved grassland
EDL	00:16:29,439	00:16:30,463	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	And now
EDL	00:16:30,463	00:16:34,559	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	We do have the right to roam in Open Country which is what those lads
EDL	00:16:35,071	00:16:37,375	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	A1932 Worth Fighting For
EDL	00:16:39,423	00:16:45,823	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	The 2000 act opened up about 7% of the land in England and 21% in Wales
EDL	00:16:45,823	00:16:49,663	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	On which you are free to roam meaning you don't even have to stay in the trailer
EDL	00:16:49,663	00:16:50,943	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	You can truly just
EDL	00:16:50,943	00:16:52,479	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Wander around
EDL	00:16:52,479	00:16:54,783	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	And 10% may not sound like a lot
EDL	00:16:54,783	00:16:58,111	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Between that and other designated Trails where there are more worst
EDL	00:16:59,135	00:17:01,439	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	You can now pretty easily walk across England
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:03,231	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Just like days.
EDL	00:17:03,999	00:17:04,767	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Smallfoot
EDL	00:17:05,279	00:17:08,095	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	For my dad rambled across Madonna's
EDL	00:17:08,095	00:17:10,399	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Property she actually sued to keep
EDL	00:17:10,399	00:17:12,191	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	People from wandering around out there
EDL	00:17:12,703	00:17:19,103	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	The government ended up allowing her to close off a lot of her estate but did keep some small amount of it open
EDL	00:17:19,103	00:17:20,127	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Ramblers
EDL	00:17:20,127	00:17:23,199	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Madonna wasn't the only person with concerns about Ramblers
EDL	00:17:23,711	00:17:26,271	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	When the countryside and rights-of-way Act passed
EDL	00:17:26,783	00:17:28,063	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	A lot of land owners
EDL	00:17:28,063	00:17:28,831	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Fear the worst
EDL	00:17:29,343	00:17:31,135	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	You know everyone was worried about
EDL	00:17:32,159	00:17:35,487	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	People sniffing glue or the countryside in people
EDL	00:17:35,999	00:17:39,327	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Tractors at work
EDL	00:17:39,327	00:17:42,655	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Fornicating like this was all in the newspaper that people really worried but
EDL	00:17:43,167	00:17:44,191	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	None of that stuff
EDL	00:17:44,191	00:17:44,959	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Turned out
EDL	00:17:44,959	00:17:45,727	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	To be
EDL	00:17:45,727	00:17:46,239	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	True
EDL	00:17:48,031	00:17:53,151	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	In addition to Britain a bunch of other European countries also have partial right to roam

EDL	00:17:53,919	00:17:58,015	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Meaning some but not all private property is accessible to walkers
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:18:02,367	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	But then there are countries where the right is even further expanded
EDL	00:18:02,367	00:18:03,391	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Norway
EDL	00:18:03,391	00:18:03,903	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Finland

EDL	00:18:05,183	00:18:06,719	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Sweden has this thing called

EDL	00:18:28,223	00:18:29,503	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	And in some places
EDL	00:18:29,503	00:18:30,527	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	You might even get shot
EDL	00:18:31,551	00:18:34,623	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	The idea of opening up private land to the public
EDL	00:18:34,623	00:18:35,903	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Seems almost on America

EDL	00:18:52,543	00:18:54,079	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	In the early days of this country
EDL	00:18:54,079	00:18:58,943	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	It was common practice to hunt and fish on private land if it wasn't enclosed by a fence

EDL	00:19:09,439	00:19:10,975	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Nearly a century later
EDL	00:19:10,975	00:19:13,535	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	In an 1862 essay entitled walking

EDL	00:19:47,583	00:19:50,143	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Acknowledge the end of the war and they also do something else

EDL	00:19:53,215	00:19:56,799	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Now why would they do that right after the Civil War I think I know
EDL	00:19:56,799	00:20:00,639	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	They did that because now you had a whole bunch of

EDL	00:20:03,711	00:20:05,247	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	There were other reasons as well
EDL	00:20:05,759	00:20:08,319	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	As Native Americans were forced onto reservations

EDL	00:20:21,375	00:20:23,935	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	So you could put fences up for livestock

EDL	00:20:34,431	00:20:34,943	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	And fishing
EDL	00:20:35,711	00:20:36,479	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	And Gathering
EDL	00:20:36,479	00:20:38,015	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	As much as I used to so when
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:41,343	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	People start chipping away at access rights
EDL	00:20:41,855	00:20:42,623	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	You don't have

EDL	00:20:50,303	00:20:54,911	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	But kennel goodness thinks we should be fighting for recreational access in this country
EDL	00:20:55,423	00:20:59,775	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Where a lot of our public land is concentrated in places that are hard for most
EDL	00:20:59,775	00:21:00,543	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	People to get to
EDL	00:21:01,055	00:21:02,847	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	For instance Alaska has

EDL	00:21:05,663	00:21:08,223	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	That's 41% of all public
EDL	00:21:08,991	00:21:10,783	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	You look at the five states
EDL	00:21:10,783	00:21:12,319	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	With the highest percentages of public
EDL	00:21:12,831	00:21:13,343	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	That's Alaska

EDL	00:21:15,903	00:21:16,416	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Wyoming
EDL	00:21:17,184	00:21:19,488	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	All this all this land is in
EDL	00:21:19,488	00:21:21,792	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	States where there aren't that many people
EDL	00:21:22,304	00:21:27,168	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Guinness believes a right to roam system could help connect all these disparate pieces of

EDL	00:21:28,192	00:21:30,240	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	And give us a sense of ownership
EDL	00:21:30,240	00:21:31,776	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	I think if we bring in a system
EDL	00:21:32,288	00:21:33,312	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Like the right to roam
EDL	00:21:34,336	00:21:36,896	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	You know we're still going to look at the land as if
EDL	00:21:36,896	00:21:37,408	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	It's someone
EDL	00:21:38,688	00:21:41,248	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	But I think we'll also begin to look at it as if it's
EDL	00:21:41,760	00:21:42,784	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Sort of hours
EDL	00:21:43,552	00:21:46,368	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	And for what it's worth my dad agrees
EDL	00:21:46,368	00:21:48,160	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	He says there's something really special
EDL	00:21:48,160	00:21:50,208	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	About being able to walk wherever you want
EDL	00:21:50,208	00:21:53,280	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	I thought the whole concept of being
EDL	00:21:53,280	00:21:54,304	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Able to
EDL	00:21:54,816	00:21:57,376	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Walk respectfully across
EDL	00:21:57,376	00:21:58,656	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Private land
EDL	00:21:58,656	00:21:59,424	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Was
EDL	00:21:59,424	00:22:02,496	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Extraordinary and it was something that
EDL	00:22:02,496	00:22:03,776	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Just doesn't exist
EDL	00:22:05,056	00:22:07,872	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	We have a lot of public land where you can
EDL	00:22:07,872	00:22:09,664	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Walk in the US but
EDL	00:22:09,664	00:22:10,944	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	The same very different
EDL	00:22:11,456	00:22:14,016	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	So many routes and trails
EDL	00:22:14,016	00:22:14,784	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	To choose from
EDL	00:22:17,088	00:22:18,880	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Felt like the whole country was open
EDL	00:22:18,880	00:22:19,392	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	To you
EDL	00:22:21,696	00:22:26,560	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	These days if you ramble across the open grasslands of England or Wales
EDL	00:22:26,560	00:22:28,864	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	To see the remnants of enclosure
EDL	00:22:28,864	00:22:30,400	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Stone walls and fences
EDL	00:22:30,912	00:22:32,192	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	And you also see
EDL	00:22:32,192	00:22:34,240	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Things meant to help you get past these barriers
EDL	00:22:35,008	00:22:38,848	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	The Styles which are step ladders to help you get over fences

EDL	00:22:40,384	00:22:42,432	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	What are v-shaped openings that
EDL	00:22:42,432	00:22:43,712	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	People can walk through
EDL	00:22:43,712	00:22:44,736	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Livestock
EDL	00:22:44,736	00:22:45,248	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Cannot
EDL	00:22:45,760	00:22:48,064	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Because the fences aren't there to stop you anymore
EDL	00:22:48,832	00:22:49,856	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	You just hop over
EDL	00:22:50,368	00:22:51,904	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	And continue on your way
EDL	00:23:05,472	00:23:09,568	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Some places go beyond a right to roam an offer free shelter

EDL	00:25:15,776	00:25:18,080	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	They passed their own Land Reform Act
EDL	00:25:18,080	00:25:19,872	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	And it did a bunch of things but
EDL	00:25:19,872	00:25:21,152	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	First and foremost
EDL	00:25:21,152	00:25:23,712	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	It codified a long tradition of public Acts
EDL	00:25:24,736	00:25:26,784	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Basically if people are respectful
EDL	00:25:26,784	00:25:28,064	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Have other people and property

EDL	00:25:32,160	00:25:38,304	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	And it's part of a larger ethos about accessibility exemplified but he's a little building called body
EDL	00:25:38,304	00:25:41,120	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Original phenomenon that Kurt Kolstad is here until
EDL	00:25:42,144	00:25:45,472	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	So historically Abbasi was typically a small cottage

EDL	00:25:47,008	00:25:50,336	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	But World depopulation led to a lot of these being abandoned

EDL	00:25:52,896	00:25:53,664	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Started spending the night
EDL	00:25:54,688	00:25:57,504	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	To the first time I ever encountered the word bothy
EDL	00:25:57,504	00:26:03,904	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Was in Stirling Scotland and I ate at a place for lunch called but coffee body which I think is not these
EDL	00:26:03,904	00:26:10,048	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Sort of things but it's kind of like us saying that I ate a Pizza Hut last night

EDL	00:26:15,424	00:26:19,520	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	But yeah it is now it's sort of grown to have this larger meaning of also these places
EDL	00:26:21,824	00:26:23,104	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Hey I'm saying it
EDL	00:26:23,104	00:26:24,128	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Delta probably don't you
EDL	00:26:25,408	00:26:29,760	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	So bodies can be found across the British Isles but especially in the Scottish Highlands
EDL	00:26:29,760	00:26:32,832	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Father publicly-accessible most are still on private property
EDL	00:26:33,344	00:26:34,368	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	And the owners
EDL	00:26:34,368	00:26:38,976	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Just let Ramblers sleep on their land and Buffy's that they own they do
EDL	00:26:38,976	00:26:43,328	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Overtime a lot of these landowners who actually really embrace the tradition

EDL	00:26:45,632	00:26:49,984	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	What is a community effort to their volunteers who help take care of and manage bothy
EDL	00:26:49,984	00:26:52,032	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Please do the mountain bothy Association

EDL	00:27:08,160	00:27:12,000	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	There's actually pretty settings in the architecture
EDL	00:27:12,000	00:27:14,304	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Summer Inland others fell on the beaches
EDL	00:27:14,304	00:27:17,120	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Sonny's sweet things like post offices or schools
EDL	00:27:17,632	00:27:20,448	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	And there's this one out in the coastal Cliffs of Sky called
EDL	00:27:20,448	00:27:20,960	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	The lookout
EDL	00:27:21,472	00:27:23,008	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	That was actually built to be a coast
EDL	00:27:24,032	00:27:27,616	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	That has these big windows and he's a really awesome panoramic views
EDL	00:27:28,128	00:27:33,504	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	And it comes with binoculars Wildlife identification charts and this log book for people who want to watch

EDL	00:27:38,368	00:27:39,648	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	That's the idea
EDL	00:27:39,648	00:27:40,928	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	So you have to find them first
EDL	00:27:40,928	00:27:42,976	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Wasn't always easy to do
EDL	00:27:43,488	00:27:45,792	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	For decades it was mainly a word of mouth system
EDL	00:27:46,304	00:27:48,096	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	And then a few years back
EDL	00:27:48,096	00:27:50,912	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	The mountain bothy Association started putting Maps app online
EDL	00:27:50,912	00:27:51,936	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Making it easier for
EDL	00:27:51,936	00:27:52,704	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	People that point out there
EDL	00:27:53,984	00:27:55,776	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Nature you get views
EDL	00:27:56,288	00:27:57,056	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Free

EDL	00:27:59,360	00:28:03,456	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Will you don't have the beauty of it but I should warn you
EDL	00:28:03,456	00:28:06,016	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	These can be pretty minimalist set times
EDL	00:28:06,528	00:28:11,648	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Some have sleeping Platforms in stoves and little libraries things like that but they don't
EDL	00:28:11,648	00:28:12,672	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Typically have
EDL	00:28:12,672	00:28:14,720	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Running water or much insulation
EDL	00:28:15,744	00:28:18,560	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	It is a really impressive system and
EDL	00:28:18,560	00:28:21,120	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	A great way to repurpose old buildings that are not otherwise in use
EDL	00:28:21,888	00:28:23,936	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	And it works especially well in Scotland
EDL	00:28:23,936	00:28:27,008	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	We're really remote places can be accessed in part
EDL	00:28:27,008	00:28:28,544	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Thanks to really permissive
EDL	00:28:28,544	00:28:29,056	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Roman laws
EDL	00:28:29,568	00:28:32,896	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	How do I know I'm staying at a designated bothering on someone's land
EDL	00:28:32,896	00:28:33,664	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Rather than just

EDL	00:28:38,016	00:28:38,528	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Sure
EDL	00:28:40,576	00:28:43,648	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	I didn't see anything about this when I was reading about them
EDL	00:28:43,648	00:28:50,048	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Wonder Lake if you did just accidentally started right
EDL	00:28:50,048	00:28:51,584	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	That was sort of the origin of it
EDL	00:28:51,584	00:28:53,632	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Is this A system that unique to Scotland
EDL	00:28:53,632	00:28:54,912	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Not entirely
EDL	00:28:54,912	00:29:00,544	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	The US and Canada Australia New Zealand and actually a lot of northern European countries

EDL	00:29:02,336	00:29:05,408	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	That said in many places there even more rustic
EDL	00:29:05,408	00:29:09,504	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	And they're often owned and operated by government agencies and set up on public land
EDL	00:29:09,504	00:29:13,088	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Right and we have a much more divided system he republic versus

EDL	00:29:13,856	00:29:15,648	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	And when it comes to private property
EDL	00:29:15,648	00:29:18,208	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	You really have to watch out for those no trespass

EDL	00:29:19,232	00:29:20,256	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Keep their warning
EDL	00:29:20,256	00:29:21,024	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	Exactly
EDL	00:29:21,024	00:29:25,120	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	While in Scotland people really can just go out and wander
EDL	00:29:25,120	00:29:26,656	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	In the truest sense of the word
EDL	00:29:27,424	00:29:29,984	| 313_Right_to_Roam_pt1 |	And if they happen to come across a coffee along the way
