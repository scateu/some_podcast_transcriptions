EDL	00:03:06,112	00:03:07,392	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	A series of stories after that
EDL	00:03:07,392	00:03:12,000	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	And I went home and I had some wine and I was like drunk tweeting about how amazing would it be
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:13,280	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Just tell the stories of all these

EDL	00:03:14,816	00:03:15,840	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	And that's what happened
EDL	00:03:16,352	00:03:20,192	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Alexis decided to embark on an eight-part series called containers
EDL	00:03:20,192	00:03:21,728	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	About how the shipping container
EDL	00:03:21,728	00:03:23,520	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Has changed the global economy
EDL	00:03:23,520	00:03:26,848	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	We're going to feature one of the stories from that series on the show today but first
EDL	00:03:26,848	00:03:29,152	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	I wanted to talk a little with Alexis
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:31,968	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	About what the world was like before the container
EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:34,528	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	So like before the 1970s or so
EDL	00:03:35,040	00:03:36,064	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Starting with the ports
EDL	00:03:36,576	00:03:38,624	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	So if you want to think about what a port was like
EDL	00:03:39,136	00:03:39,904	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	In the old days
EDL	00:03:39,904	00:03:40,928	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Go just look at the
EDL	00:03:40,928	00:03:42,464	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Appears look at how they're shaped
EDL	00:03:42,464	00:03:44,512	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Are these long fingers coming off
EDL	00:03:44,512	00:03:45,280	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	The shoreline
EDL	00:03:45,280	00:03:47,584	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Will the ships would have pulled up into what those are
EDL	00:03:47,584	00:03:48,096	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Finger piers
EDL	00:03:48,608	00:03:52,704	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	And then we would have unloaded their stuff they would have probably hundreds of people running around
EDL	00:03:53,216	00:03:56,800	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	And they would have unloaded their stuff directly onto this. Which would have been gone into cargo
EDL	00:03:57,824	00:04:02,176	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	So you got guys working winches you know, like little Mini Cranes on the boat
EDL	00:04:02,688	00:04:06,016	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	And you got all the stuff stored inside the hull of the ship
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:06,784	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	That was
EDL	00:04:06,784	00:04:07,552	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Container
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:09,088	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	They're dropping it onto the docks
EDL	00:04:09,088	00:04:11,904	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Other people are forklifting around trucks are pulling out there's all these
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:13,184	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Is Cruz running everywhere
EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:15,488	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	And so that the notion of the docs
EDL	00:04:15,488	00:04:16,000	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Like the water
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:17,280	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Charismatic play
EDL	00:04:18,303	00:04:19,839	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	The people know understand
EDL	00:04:19,839	00:04:21,119	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	It's because they were
EDL	00:04:21,119	00:04:23,167	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	All these people from all over the world
EDL	00:04:23,167	00:04:27,775	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	And the goods themselves literally the stuff coming from all these places is visible to your view
EDL	00:04:28,287	00:04:29,311	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	So
EDL	00:04:29,311	00:04:31,103	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	You can smell the coffee
EDL	00:04:31,103	00:04:33,407	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	When the spaceships come in you'd smell the cardamom
EDL	00:04:33,919	00:04:38,015	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	When there was something that was disgusting like hides that was being worked
EDL	00:04:38,015	00:04:40,063	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	You smell green hide being handled by
EDL	00:04:40,831	00:04:42,623	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	You have seen big rolls of newsprint
EDL	00:04:44,415	00:04:45,951	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Way the world worked
EDL	00:04:45,951	00:04:46,719	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Was actually served
EDL	00:04:47,231	00:04:50,047	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Boast you before it got reput into factories
EDL	00:04:50,047	00:04:50,559	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Simpatico
EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:52,863	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	It was actually it's incredible
EDL	00:04:53,375	00:04:54,911	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Citing an old longshoreman
EDL	00:04:54,911	00:04:56,191	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	When you graduate high school
EDL	00:04:56,191	00:04:56,703	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	But only High School

EDL	00:05:00,287	00:05:01,311	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Just looking at the goods
EDL	00:05:01,311	00:05:02,079	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	They were sitting on the docks
EDL	00:05:02,591	00:05:07,455	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	When people started shipping things in containers Goods could be loaded in offloaded more easily
EDL	00:05:07,455	00:05:10,783	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	The container is full of stuff could go directly from the ship
EDL	00:05:11,295	00:05:12,319	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Two trucks and trains
EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:13,855	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	And everything was standard
EDL	00:05:14,367	00:05:15,647	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	All over the world
EDL	00:05:15,647	00:05:18,207	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Containers unlimited a lot of inefficiency
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:18,719	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	She's from the system
EDL	00:05:19,231	00:05:19,999	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Imports
EDL	00:05:19,999	00:05:21,023	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Completely change

EDL	00:05:23,071	00:05:24,863	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Long flat bursts
EDL	00:05:24,863	00:05:26,143	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	The ships come in they dock
EDL	00:05:26,655	00:05:27,679	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	And then you at least
EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:28,703	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Largely White
EDL	00:05:28,703	00:05:30,495	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Container cranes drop over them
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:36,127	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Those cranes are really a wild thing when you think about it the reason their necks are so long that called The Boom
EDL	00:05:36,127	00:05:37,663	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Because the ships are so wide
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:40,223	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	And they go out over the whole ship
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:40,991	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	And then a little
EDL	00:05:40,991	00:05:43,807	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Person in a little cab
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:44,831	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Go out
EDL	00:05:44,831	00:05:46,111	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	All the way
EDL	00:05:46,111	00:05:48,927	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Across the ship they look down through their legs
EDL	00:05:48,927	00:05:49,695	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Drop this
EDL	00:05:49,695	00:05:50,975	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Then call the spreader
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:51,743	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Auntie Dee's
EDL	00:05:51,743	00:05:55,839	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	For locking mechanisms on the box they pull it up and bring it they drop it onto a
EDL	00:05:56,351	00:05:58,655	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Intermediate truck that takes it into the holding yard
EDL	00:05:59,167	00:06:05,567	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Venom Rio Drayage truck comes in drive-thru West Oakland spraying diesel all over the community and then takes it out to it District
EDL	00:06:05,567	00:06:09,407	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	You should Center in Tracy or wherever it is you know and that's kind of a pretty normal flow
EDL	00:06:09,919	00:06:12,479	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	But container is didn't just have an effect on Imports
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:15,039	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Band effect on port cities
EDL	00:06:15,039	00:06:15,807	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	All over the world
EDL	00:06:16,319	00:06:17,599	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Oakland included
EDL	00:06:17,599	00:06:19,647	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Cuz absolutely
EDL	00:06:19,647	00:06:22,463	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Everything about the way that cities work and global trade War
EDL	00:06:23,231	00:06:25,279	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Was changed by the system of containers
EDL	00:06:25,279	00:06:26,559	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	They should not just the Box
EDL	00:06:26,559	00:06:28,095	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	But everything that went along with
EDL	00:06:28,095	00:06:29,631	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	The locking mechanism
EDL	00:06:29,631	00:06:32,959	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	The operations of the yard the ships that had to be developed
EDL	00:06:32,959	00:06:34,495	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	In order to carry more containers
EDL	00:06:36,287	00:06:38,335	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	In a one way that I have thought about it
EDL	00:06:38,847	00:06:40,127	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Is there were computers
EDL	00:06:40,127	00:06:41,663	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Before and it was networking before
EDL	00:06:41,663	00:06:44,223	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Then there's this thing called the Internet Protocol that allowed
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:47,039	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Like a package to be moved around no matter what was inside them
EDL	00:06:47,039	00:06:48,063	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	And that allows for the sick
EDL	00:06:48,063	00:06:49,087	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Explosion of networking
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:51,391	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	That's essentially what containers do
EDL	00:06:51,391	00:06:52,159	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	For Stuff
EDL	00:06:52,671	00:06:53,439	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	You can just
EDL	00:06:53,439	00:06:57,023	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Put NEX thing into a box and it can go to any port
EDL	00:06:57,535	00:06:59,327	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	And as I was reading this
EDL	00:06:59,839	00:07:01,887	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Defining work on this process
EDL	00:07:01,887	00:07:02,911	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Containerization called The Box
EDL	00:07:03,423	00:07:04,959	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Canon Mark Levinson is in the series

EDL	00:07:19,039	00:07:21,599	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	And that was so fascinating to me
EDL	00:07:21,599	00:07:23,391	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Particular because almost immediately
EDL	00:07:23,903	00:07:25,695	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	They go to Vietnam to

EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:37,983	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	This dominant mode

EDL	00:07:42,335	00:07:44,895	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	And it's coming from these three you know

EDL	00:08:04,095	00:08:05,631	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Had on cities
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:07,423	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	And it continues to have on cities
EDL	00:08:08,191	00:08:09,215	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	The first wave of
EDL	00:08:09,215	00:08:10,239	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Containerization
EDL	00:08:10,239	00:08:11,775	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Wipes out so many jobs

EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:20,223	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	For a lot of cities
EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:22,271	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Like you know that empty Warehouse Brooklyn aesthetic
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:25,343	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Like that was the warehouse that used to before we Goods
EDL	00:08:25,343	00:08:31,231	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	And then containerization came along and wiped out all the warehouses and that's what created the ability to have these kinds of
EDL	00:08:31,231	00:08:36,863	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Creative workspaces that you have now that's your leader in the energy in the carcass of the old system of trade
EDL	00:08:37,375	00:08:38,399	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	When you're in one of those space
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:43,007	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	That was what I didn't I just had no idea that this happened all over the world in London and New York

EDL	00:08:44,799	00:08:48,639	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Even though the invention of the container wiped out shipping jobs all over the world
EDL	00:08:48,639	00:08:51,199	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	There are still a lot of people working in the industry
EDL	00:08:51,711	00:08:57,599	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	What those people do and whether they will be able to hold on to their jobs as the shipping industry continues to change
EDL	00:08:58,111	00:09:01,439	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Is what Alexis Explorer is in episode 3 of

EDL	00:09:02,463	00:09:03,487	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	And you have all these

EDL	00:09:11,167	00:09:12,447	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	To be in place
EDL	00:09:12,447	00:09:13,215	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	It's like

EDL	00:09:37,023	00:09:37,791	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	How those

EDL	00:09:39,327	00:09:40,095	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	I like the point

EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:04,671	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	I met during my time reporting
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:05,183	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	On the waterfront
EDL	00:10:05,695	00:10:09,791	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	And I thought to myself well I'll go in this career in this industry and kind of see what
EDL	00:10:10,303	00:10:12,863	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	I'm not thinking that this is my dream
EDL	00:10:13,375	00:10:14,911	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	To grow up and be a ship captain
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:15,935	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	This is Lynn Court watch
EDL	00:10:16,447	00:10:20,031	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	She became the first female captain of an American cargo ship
EDL	00:10:20,031	00:10:20,799	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Under remark
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:22,079	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Circumstance
EDL	00:10:22,591	00:10:25,663	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	And during those first years I had the opportunity to sale
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:26,943	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Initially as a
EDL	00:10:26,943	00:10:28,735	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	I made on an oil tanker
EDL	00:10:28,735	00:10:31,039	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	And was in Southern California when a tanker blew up
EDL	00:10:31,551	00:10:34,879	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Inside me and maybe this is really not
EDL	00:10:35,647	00:10:36,927	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	The gig that I want
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:39,487	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	So she joined the master mates & Pilots Union
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:42,303	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	And began selling on all kinds of ships around the world
EDL	00:10:42,303	00:10:45,375	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	I quickly kind of decided that you know going to places like
EDL	00:10:45,375	00:10:46,143	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	The Far East
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:53,055	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	And South America was a little bit more of a challenge you know in the 1970s and early 80s they had never seen

EDL	00:10:59,967	00:11:01,247	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	And that the men had to listen to her
EDL	00:11:02,015	00:11:02,783	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	The stuff work
EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:06,879	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	So she decided to try to work her way up at the American shipping line mat
EDL	00:11:07,391	00:11:08,159	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Wood Randa
EDL	00:11:08,159	00:11:08,671	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	It still runs
EDL	00:11:09,183	00:11:10,463	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Ship from Oakland to Hawaii
EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:13,279	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	I have the opportunity over the years to advance
EDL	00:11:14,047	00:11:18,655	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	To the chief mates position at Mattson they were very good to me
EDL	00:11:19,167	00:11:19,679	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	And
EDL	00:11:20,447	00:11:24,543	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	When an opportunity came up to be promoted on a temporary basis to Captain
EDL	00:11:25,055	00:11:26,335	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	When did turn it down
EDL	00:11:26,335	00:11:27,359	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Yeah of course not
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:30,687	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Why would you he never knew when that opportunity was going to come along again
EDL	00:11:30,687	00:11:34,015	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Only one hitch so despite the fact that
EDL	00:11:34,015	00:11:37,087	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	I was 8 months pregnant there's no doctor on board a container ship
EDL	00:11:37,599	00:11:39,903	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Let alone OB or Midwife or a doula
EDL	00:11:40,415	00:11:41,439	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	I said God
EDL	00:11:41,439	00:11:42,975	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	You know I think I got to do this
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:46,303	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	And who knows you can appreciate being pregnant is not handicapped
EDL	00:11:46,815	00:11:47,839	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Or
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:50,655	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	You know something that should limit your opportunities it's
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:53,215	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	It's just something that happens and you kind of carry on with life
EDL	00:11:53,727	00:11:54,751	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	So that's what happened
EDL	00:11:54,751	00:11:56,543	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	I was 8 months pregnant
EDL	00:11:56,543	00:11:58,335	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Probably more than 8 months pregnant
EDL	00:11:58,847	00:12:00,127	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	And said yes
EDL	00:12:00,127	00:12:00,895	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Let's go
EDL	00:12:00,895	00:12:02,687	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	What's your plan if you got into labor
EDL	00:12:02,687	00:12:06,015	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	It was kind of funny because my chief made at the time
EDL	00:12:06,527	00:12:09,599	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Had recently delivered his own baby in his car
EDL	00:12:10,111	00:12:15,231	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	So he was delighted with the idea that all man I get to do this and won't that be really fun
EDL	00:12:15,743	00:12:18,303	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	You needless to say it didn't turn into a reality
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:19,839	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	But what
EDL	00:12:19,839	00:12:23,935	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Did kind of complicate the situation was after I got off the ship
EDL	00:12:24,959	00:12:27,263	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	About five days later I did go into labor
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:29,311	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	And found out
EDL	00:12:29,311	00:12:30,847	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	15 RMB notes to me
EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:33,151	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	My son was breech that means feet first
EDL	00:12:33,151	00:12:34,943	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Which makes for substantially more dangerous labor
EDL	00:12:35,711	00:12:41,855	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	So should I have gone into labor on the ship it would have been a much bigger challenge than I think any of us ever into the
EDL	00:12:42,623	00:12:43,903	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	And to link or watches
EDL	00:12:44,927	00:12:47,743	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Down-to-earth groundbreaking woman in the field of shipping
EDL	00:12:48,255	00:12:50,559	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	And the longtime part of the bay is maritime economy
EDL	00:12:51,327	00:12:53,375	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	She's respected by all for her toughness
EDL	00:12:53,887	00:12:54,399	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	IntelliJ
EDL	00:12:55,423	00:12:59,775	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Her track record made her natural fit to become the head of the San Francisco Marine Exchange
EDL	00:12:59,775	00:13:03,103	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Which may be the oldest institution in all of California
EDL	00:13:03,615	00:13:09,503	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	So the Marine Exchange is an organization that was founded back in 1849 to really kind of track
EDL	00:13:09,503	00:13:12,575	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	And monitor ships as they arrived in San Francisco Bay
EDL	00:13:12,575	00:13:14,879	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	We put the telegraph on Telegraph
EDL	00:13:14,879	00:13:18,719	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Kill in order to communicate that information down to our Maritime partners
EDL	00:13:18,719	00:13:19,743	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	We had several
EDL	00:13:19,743	00:13:21,279	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Relay stations around the bay
EDL	00:13:22,047	00:13:23,327	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	You know I'm primarily
EDL	00:13:23,327	00:13:24,351	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Yeah we were
EDL	00:13:25,119	00:13:26,655	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Moving that information around
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:27,423	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	There was
EDL	00:13:27,423	00:13:28,447	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	The trading floor
EDL	00:13:28,447	00:13:31,007	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	So that when we pass this information down to our
EDL	00:13:31,519	00:13:32,031	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Our membership
EDL	00:13:32,543	00:13:35,871	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	You know they were traded Commodities right then and there on the floor
EDL	00:13:35,871	00:13:37,407	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	They knew that the shipping
EDL	00:13:37,407	00:13:38,431	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Coming from
EDL	00:13:38,431	00:13:39,455	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	South America

EDL	00:13:41,759	00:13:42,271	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Because that would be

EDL	00:13:46,367	00:13:48,415	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	It's not a stretch to say that San Francisco
EDL	00:13:48,927	00:13:50,975	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	And all the surrounding towns exist
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:51,743	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Basically
EDL	00:13:52,255	00:13:53,279	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Because the bay had a good poor
EDL	00:13:54,303	00:13:57,631	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	San Francisco became a part of the global archipelago
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:13:59,167	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Important cities

EDL	00:26:21,056	00:26:22,336	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	It also put pressure

EDL	00:29:42,528	00:29:45,088	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Think of it almost like a watershed for cargo

EDL	00:29:55,840	00:29:57,120	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	So the port officials
EDL	00:29:57,120	00:29:58,912	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Want to expand on that strength
EDL	00:29:59,424	00:30:01,728	| 99pi-0254-containers-1 |	Building a huge refrigerated facility
