EDL	00:04:16,512	00:04:19,839	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Since the beginning of underground mining
EDL	00:04:19,839	00:04:21,887	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	One of the biggest dangers in the
EDL	00:04:21,887	00:04:23,167	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Has been the darkness
EDL	00:04:24,959	00:04:26,239	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Wood shutters
EDL	00:04:34,943	00:04:36,479	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Open flame
EDL	00:04:39,551	00:04:45,951	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	The darkness makes accents more likely and even though technology has improved to make Minds brighter and safer
EDL	00:04:45,951	00:04:49,023	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Still an issue the culture of mining to a certain degree
EDL	00:04:49,023	00:04:51,071	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Has been shaped by the level of risk involved
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:52,863	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	What cultures
EDL	00:04:52,863	00:04:54,399	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Have very strong cultures
EDL	00:04:54,399	00:04:55,423	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Especially
EDL	00:04:55,423	00:04:57,727	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	I want that face Danger
EDL	00:04:57,727	00:05:01,823	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Like mining of firefighting police work
EDL	00:05:01,823	00:05:02,847	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	The military
EDL	00:05:03,359	00:05:05,151	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Deep sea fishing Etc
EDL	00:05:05,151	00:05:06,687	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	This is a lame Cullen
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:08,479	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	She's an occupational if not
EDL	00:05:08,479	00:05:11,295	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	And she spent a lot of time with minors
EDL	00:05:11,295	00:05:13,599	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Like actually down in the mines with them
EDL	00:05:13,599	00:05:15,647	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Money has a very strong cultural
EDL	00:05:15,647	00:05:17,439	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	I think the reason is
EDL	00:05:17,439	00:05:23,327	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Because people who work underground are well aware of the fact that every day you go in you don't know if you're coming out
EDL	00:05:23,839	00:05:26,399	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	The first time Colin went down into a mine
EDL	00:05:26,399	00:05:29,215	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	She was told that she had to have something reflective on her
EDL	00:05:29,215	00:05:29,983	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Hard hat
EDL	00:05:29,983	00:05:32,031	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	There's a lot of heavy machinery move
EDL	00:05:32,031	00:05:32,799	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Nothing around
EDL	00:05:32,799	00:05:33,823	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Trump buses
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:36,383	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	To the shears roof bolters and other tools
EDL	00:05:36,383	00:05:37,407	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Yeast extract
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:42,271	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Cole people get hit do they get run over they get crushed by mobile equipment
EDL	00:05:42,271	00:05:46,623	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	And so reflective material increases the visibility of the people underground
EDL	00:05:47,135	00:05:48,927	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	We put a strips of
EDL	00:05:48,927	00:05:50,975	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Reflective tape on the back of a hard hats
EDL	00:05:51,743	00:05:56,351	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	But then it became pretty obvious that other people had other things on their hard hats
EDL	00:05:56,351	00:05:57,887	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	And these were stickers
EDL	00:05:59,423	00:06:04,031	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	The stickers had originally been little advertisements that the manufacturers

EDL	00:06:22,719	00:06:25,791	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	In a mine companies themselves started printing stickers for their workers
EDL	00:06:26,559	00:06:29,631	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	They went from simple ads to signaling and identity

EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:45,151	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	As he gained more experience he got stickers commemorating his accomplishments
EDL	00:07:45,663	00:07:51,039	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	She worked at a company early on that counted the amount of coal mined by the number of cars feel during a shift
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:53,343	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Something like a hundred cars with
EDL	00:07:53,343	00:07:54,111	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Was okay
EDL	00:07:54,111	00:07:57,951	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	But Ronnie has a sticker that says his team mind 150

EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:22,271	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	How many Senate
EDL	00:08:24,063	00:08:28,927	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	In the 1960s and 70s a number of major mine safety laws were passed in the US
EDL	00:08:28,927	00:08:35,071	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Anna Lane Cullen started working at a new agency that was responsible for studying and enforcing safety in the mine
EDL	00:08:35,839	00:08:38,143	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	For years she researched mining culture
EDL	00:08:38,655	00:08:42,751	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	In the 2000s the National Institute for occupational safety and health a federal agency
EDL	00:08:43,263	00:08:46,335	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Heard her to develop a safety training program for coal miners
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:47,871	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	By that time
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:49,407	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	She knew who she was dealing with
EDL	00:08:49,919	00:08:54,527	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	So she knew she might be facing some skepticism from the minors she was trying to reach
EDL	00:08:54,527	00:08:55,551	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	I don't look like a minor
EDL	00:08:56,575	00:08:57,855	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	I'm a woman and
EDL	00:08:58,623	00:08:59,903	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Most of them are not
EDL	00:08:59,903	00:09:00,415	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	So
EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:07,071	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Getting them to work with me especially when I was a representative of the federal government and you know they
EDL	00:09:07,071	00:09:08,607	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Our little Leary to
EDL	00:09:08,607	00:09:09,887	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Going to work with government
EDL	00:09:10,399	00:09:13,727	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Maryland had seen that the miners were really into the stickers
EDL	00:09:14,239	00:09:16,031	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	And she figured she could use them
EDL	00:09:16,031	00:09:16,799	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	To gain their trust
EDL	00:09:17,311	00:09:19,615	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	And to convey messages about safety
EDL	00:09:20,127	00:09:23,455	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	But you knew just putting work safe on a sticker wouldn't cut it
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:26,015	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	She needed something to grab the miners attention
EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:28,575	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	We were working out and
EDL	00:09:28,575	00:09:29,343	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Eastern Kentucky
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:31,903	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	It was a money in community with the
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:32,927	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Cultural ties to coal
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:34,463	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	And she started to notice
EDL	00:09:34,975	00:09:37,023	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	She be walking along with the safety guy
EDL	00:09:37,023	00:09:37,535	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	And
EDL	00:09:38,047	00:09:40,351	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	As we would approach another minor
EDL	00:09:40,351	00:09:41,631	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	He would squeal like a pig
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:43,935	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	I finally asked him I said Jessie
EDL	00:09:44,447	00:09:48,799	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	What's going on here why are they doing that and he said oh they're just saying they know I'm a Cole Haan
EDL	00:09:49,567	00:09:51,615	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	What is a Quahog annies
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:52,895	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Quahog is hungry
EDL	00:09:52,895	00:09:54,431	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Call Greedy for call
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:09:55,199	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Can't ever get enough
EDL	00:09:55,967	00:09:56,991	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Meaning
EDL	00:09:56,991	00:09:58,015	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	But you're ugly minor
EDL	00:09:58,527	00:10:02,623	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Took the idea and design a sticker with a big muscular pig with a
EDL	00:10:02,623	00:10:04,159	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Hard hat on and it says
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:06,207	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Coal Hogs work safe
EDL	00:10:06,207	00:10:07,487	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	So what we were doing
EDL	00:10:07,487	00:10:09,535	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Putting those two ideas together
EDL	00:10:09,535	00:10:11,583	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	That's you can be a Quahog
EDL	00:10:11,583	00:10:12,863	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	But you can also work safe
EDL	00:10:13,375	00:10:14,911	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	The miners loved it
EDL	00:10:15,423	00:10:17,983	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Oh gosh I think we printed 3002
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:19,519	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	To begin with and I have
EDL	00:10:19,519	00:10:22,335	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	One little packet left that I'm kind of keeping as a
EDL	00:10:22,335	00:10:23,103	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	You know
EDL	00:10:23,103	00:10:23,615	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Keepsake
EDL	00:10:24,383	00:10:26,431	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Semicolons other designs were dead
EDL	00:10:26,431	00:10:28,479	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	13 made one with a dead Canary
EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:32,063	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Canaries were once used to check for bad air in a mine
EDL	00:10:32,063	00:10:34,111	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	But that was a long time ago
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:35,391	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	And the younger miners
EDL	00:10:35,391	00:10:36,415	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Didn't get it
EDL	00:10:36,415	00:10:39,743	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Other stickers catering to the raunchy humor in the mines
EDL	00:10:39,743	00:10:43,071	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Didn't pass muster with her bosses in the federal government
EDL	00:10:43,071	00:10:46,399	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	For example they designed one sticker to remind minors to check
EDL	00:10:46,399	00:10:47,423	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Check for gas in the mines
EDL	00:10:47,935	00:10:50,495	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	So what the this one was a
EDL	00:10:50,495	00:10:52,031	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	The back end of a donkey
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:54,591	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	And have the donkey kind of looking back
EDL	00:10:54,591	00:10:55,871	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Back at you
EDL	00:10:55,871	00:10:56,639	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	And it said
EDL	00:10:57,663	00:10:58,943	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Don't be an ass
EDL	00:10:58,943	00:10:59,711	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Check for gas
EDL	00:11:01,759	00:11:03,807	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	I kind of have this little Cloud coming out
EDL	00:11:04,575	00:11:06,879	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Gas can be really dangerous Underground
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:09,951	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	And donkeys were once used to carry coal out of the mines
EDL	00:11:09,951	00:11:10,975	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	NOAA weather
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:11,999	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Thea
EDL	00:11:12,767	00:11:16,863	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Folks in Washington didn't like that one but the miners loved it
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:23,263	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Unless Elaine visit your mind it be hard to get one of these stickers
EDL	00:11:23,263	00:11:27,871	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	A lot of the stickers were Specialized or localized depending on what organization or company design them
EDL	00:11:28,383	00:11:30,431	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	That's part of what made collecting them fun
EDL	00:11:30,431	00:11:31,455	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	I have
EDL	00:11:31,967	00:11:34,015	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Over 26000

EDL	00:11:36,319	00:11:40,159	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	And I've I've kind of come to believe that you either are collector or you're not
EDL	00:11:40,671	00:11:45,535	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	And if you're not a collector you just don't get it and if you are a collector you just really can't help yourself
EDL	00:11:46,559	00:11:47,839	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	This is Lenny Hanner

EDL	00:18:19,775	00:18:21,823	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	I decided we're going to turn this into a fraction
EDL	00:18:21,823	00:18:23,615	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	So they made it a museum they made
EDL	00:18:23,615	00:18:24,383	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Theme park
EDL	00:18:24,383	00:18:25,407	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	You go down there
EDL	00:18:25,407	00:18:26,175	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	And like
EDL	00:18:26,175	00:18:29,759	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Boat around on this water and the pictures are just sort of Mesmer
EDL	00:18:30,271	00:18:34,367	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	They really let this place up so you can go down and really get a sense of the geology but also
EDL	00:18:35,647	00:18:36,671	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Experience Underground
EDL	00:18:36,671	00:18:38,463	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Cool are there any in the US
EDL	00:18:38,463	00:18:39,999	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Yeah in Kansas there's a
EDL	00:18:39,999	00:18:40,767	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Data Center
EDL	00:18:40,767	00:18:44,863	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	A little less exciting but it a little more functional
EDL	00:18:44,863	00:18:46,143	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Does that I sent you the
EDL	00:18:46,143	00:18:46,911	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Uses
EDL	00:18:46,911	00:18:47,935	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	The natural
EDL	00:18:47,935	00:18:51,263	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	You don't even temperatures in the protection of this mindspace
EDL	00:18:51,263	00:18:52,543	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Old Limestone mines
EDL	00:18:53,311	00:18:54,335	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Thousand servers

EDL	00:18:59,711	00:19:00,735	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Doing any kind of weather
EDL	00:19:01,247	00:19:02,271	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	The perfect place is just
EDL	00:19:04,831	00:19:06,879	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	And there's also
EDL	00:19:06,879	00:19:08,159	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	A research facility
EDL	00:19:08,671	00:19:11,999	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	That is doing experiments on dark matter
EDL	00:19:11,999	00:19:16,095	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Far underground in South Dakota in an old gold mine it's about a mile deep
EDL	00:19:16,095	00:19:17,119	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	And
EDL	00:19:17,631	00:19:18,399	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	It turns out
EDL	00:19:18,399	00:19:19,935	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	That there's a lot of particles that
EDL	00:19:19,935	00:19:24,287	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	So just float through space and Bombardier atmosphere on a pretty regular basis
EDL	00:19:24,287	00:19:28,639	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	And getting below the surface they can get away from a lot of that noise and a lot more
EDL	00:19:28,639	00:19:29,919	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Chemiclean experiment
EDL	00:19:29,919	00:19:31,967	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Yeah totally
EDL	00:19:32,479	00:19:33,503	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Unethical
EDL	00:19:34,015	00:19:36,575	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	And you know if they decide to destroy the universe
EDL	00:19:36,575	00:19:38,111	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	At least they're a mile Underground
EDL	00:19:38,111	00:19:42,207	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Yeah I mean yeah right hope the hope the hope is that they'd only just destroy their lab in the mountains
EDL	00:19:43,999	00:19:45,791	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	So what's your favorite
EDL	00:19:46,303	00:19:49,119	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	My favorite is probably the Louisville Mega Cavern
EDL	00:19:49,119	00:19:49,887	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Which is this
EDL	00:19:50,655	00:19:51,423	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Huge
EDL	00:19:51,423	00:19:52,703	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Huge underground space
EDL	00:19:53,215	00:19:53,983	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	In Louisville Kentucky
EDL	00:19:54,495	00:19:55,263	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	If you
EDL	00:19:55,263	00:19:57,823	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Buy the argument that it's now a building
EDL	00:19:57,823	00:20:01,407	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	It's the largest building in Kentucky at about 4 million square feet
EDL	00:20:02,175	00:20:02,687	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	And
EDL	00:20:03,455	00:20:08,063	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Basically this mine opened in the 1930s The Dugout Limestone for decades
EDL	00:20:08,063	00:20:09,599	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Ali Karver this thing out
EDL	00:20:09,599	00:20:11,391	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	In the 1960s
EDL	00:20:11,391	00:20:13,951	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Actually talked about using it as a fallout shelter
EDL	00:20:13,951	00:20:18,303	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	In case it the Cuban Missile Crisis went the wrong way they were paying it back
EDL	00:20:18,303	00:20:19,071	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	10 mm
EDL	00:20:19,071	00:20:20,095	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	The people in there
EDL	00:20:20,095	00:20:22,143	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	And then eventually it sort of fell into disuse
EDL	00:20:22,655	00:20:23,423	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	And
EDL	00:20:23,423	00:20:25,727	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Tamiya investors can long to hey
EDL	00:20:25,727	00:20:26,495	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	We could do something
EDL	00:20:27,263	00:20:28,031	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	And they did
EDL	00:20:28,031	00:20:29,823	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Basically they bought this thing
EDL	00:20:29,823	00:20:33,407	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	And they started you know putting businesses in there they started using it for
EDL	00:20:33,407	00:20:35,967	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	For storage because it started yet temperature Stables good place
EDL	00:20:35,967	00:20:36,479	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Extra storage
EDL	00:20:37,247	00:20:38,015	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	And then
EDL	00:20:38,015	00:20:42,111	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Ladies in the kind of weird and they started adding all of these kind of theme park element
EDL	00:20:42,111	00:20:42,879	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Stuit

EDL	00:20:48,255	00:20:49,791	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	At the heart of it all
EDL	00:20:49,791	00:20:51,583	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	One of the biggest functions is this
EDL	00:20:52,095	00:20:55,167	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	Huge huge 300000 + square foot

EDL	00:21:10,271	00:21:12,063	| 99pi-0275-coalhogsworksafe-1 |	And they can make entirely new course
