EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:55,679	| 35-Elegy-for-WTC |	I guess I guess
EDL	00:04:55,679	00:04:58,495	| 35-Elegy-for-WTC |	Ultimately the responsibility for
EDL	00:05:01,823	00:05:06,431	| 35-Elegy-for-WTC |	The criteria for the Trade Center that was mine those were my decisions
EDL	00:05:07,967	00:05:08,991	| 35-Elegy-for-WTC |	And
EDL	00:05:12,063	00:05:14,367	| 35-Elegy-for-WTC |	The fact that they stood up as long as they did
EDL	00:05:15,647	00:05:17,951	| 35-Elegy-for-WTC |	Was because we had
EDL	00:05:17,951	00:05:20,255	| 35-Elegy-for-WTC |	Design the project for the impact of the
EDL	00:05:21,023	00:05:25,631	| 35-Elegy-for-WTC |	707 aircraft and and we had a great team working on the project in
EDL	00:05:26,655	00:05:29,471	| 35-Elegy-for-WTC |	And they did what they were supposed to do
EDL	00:05:29,471	00:05:31,263	| 35-Elegy-for-WTC |	They stood up under the impaction
EDL	00:05:32,799	00:05:38,687	| 35-Elegy-for-WTC |	And while it's true that the the plane that hit it was a bit heavier in a flying a whole lot faster and therefore
EDL	00:05:39,455	00:05:41,503	| 35-Elegy-for-WTC |	A lot more energy was put into the building
EDL	00:05:46,623	00:05:51,231	| 35-Elegy-for-WTC |	I think it's a tribute to the people worked on the project at that they did as well as they did
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:56,095	| 35-Elegy-for-WTC |	And yet I know as well as I'm here right this moment that
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:06:02,239	| 35-Elegy-for-WTC |	That the village could have been made more sour shrimp that could have been made stronger and it could have
EDL	00:06:03,007	00:06:04,543	| 35-Elegy-for-WTC |	They could have stood up longer
EDL	00:06:06,335	00:06:07,359	| 35-Elegy-for-WTC |	And
EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:11,967	| 35-Elegy-for-WTC |	And that was my decision and I just
EDL	00:06:14,527	00:06:19,903	| 35-Elegy-for-WTC |	I thinking that since I can't be faulted
EDL	00:06:21,183	00:06:23,999	| 35-Elegy-for-WTC |	Is performed in many ways admirably
EDL	00:06:25,535	00:06:30,143	| 35-Elegy-for-WTC |	But there's always that nagging thought that maybe you should have done something else
EDL	00:06:31,167	00:06:31,935	| 35-Elegy-for-WTC |	American
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:35,519	| 35-Elegy-for-WTC |	Just push that out of my head
