EDL	00:03:30,432	00:03:36,832	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	Supermarkets particular if you got to go to the deli counter and get a number
EDL	00:03:36,832	00:03:39,904	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	And then you start walking around and doing the regular shopping and you watch all the numbers
EDL	00:03:41,184	00:03:43,488	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	And then as soon as it gets close to yours then you go back
EDL	00:03:43,488	00:03:44,256	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	So that's a

EDL	00:03:48,608	00:03:50,400	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	Like this dr. Q

EDL	00:04:07,296	00:04:12,160	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	That people can be happy waiting 40 minutes in line for a 4 minute ride I think
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:12,672	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	It's fantastic
EDL	00:04:16,256	00:04:18,047	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	Disney is very serious

EDL	00:04:26,239	00:04:27,263	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	The golden rules
EDL	00:04:28,031	00:04:31,871	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	Q design the first is to keep your customers entertained while I wait in line
EDL	00:04:32,383	00:04:32,895	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	Their guests
EDL	00:04:33,663	00:04:36,991	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	Think that the amusement has started before they actually sit in the ride
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:40,063	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	Don't have video screens along the Q route with
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:44,159	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	Games and if the lines are getting really ugly a park manager will

EDL	00:04:46,975	00:04:50,815	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	Yeah it so they're entertained and they're amused while they're waiting in line
EDL	00:04:50,815	00:04:51,839	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	The second rule
EDL	00:04:51,839	00:04:52,863	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	Manage expectation
EDL	00:04:53,375	00:04:55,679	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	Always manage your expectations such that you'll deliver

EDL	00:04:57,471	00:04:58,239	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	You say so
EDL	00:04:58,239	00:04:59,519	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	Prince and sip the wine says
EDL	00:05:00,031	00:05:02,335	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	You can anticipate 45-minute wait for
EDL	00:05:02,335	00:05:03,103	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	If the line is out
EDL	00:05:03,103	00:05:03,615	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	To this point
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:05,919	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	But really it might be only 35
EDL	00:05:06,943	00:05:07,967	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	So therefore if you
EDL	00:05:07,967	00:05:08,991	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	Look at your watch
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:12,575	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	In 35 minutes to get it on the line and then the dad and the mom and the
EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:14,879	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	Go to kids at Hayward 10 minutes ahead of schedule
EDL	00:05:15,647	00:05:20,511	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	That's great you waited 35 minutes and you say we just save 10 minutes because we thought we're going to have to wait
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:21,279	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	For 45 minutes
EDL	00:05:23,839	00:05:25,887	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	Q series about a hundred years old now
EDL	00:05:26,399	00:05:28,703	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	But it wasn't until the 1950s.
EDL	00:05:28,703	00:05:29,215	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	Set the profession
EDL	00:05:29,727	00:05:32,799	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	Really came into its own after World War II they were saved

EDL	00:05:36,127	00:05:38,687	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	High-rise hotels and offices and all of a sudden
EDL	00:05:38,687	00:05:40,479	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	Owners of these buildings are getting
EDL	00:05:40,479	00:05:43,039	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	Complaints about rush hour delays for elevators
EDL	00:05:43,551	00:05:46,111	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	In those days of course they didn't have microprocessors to
EDL	00:05:46,623	00:05:47,903	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	Go to optimized
EDL	00:05:47,903	00:05:51,743	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	The movement of the elevators been available babies actually had humans as operators
EDL	00:05:51,743	00:05:52,255	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	Pilots
EDL	00:05:55,327	00:06:01,727	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	The professor University of Pennsylvania sent one of his research age to New York City to check out these complaints about elevator delays
EDL	00:06:01,727	00:06:07,359	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	And indeed he found out that there were rush hours for elevator like 8 to 9 in the morning or 5 to 6 at night
EDL	00:06:07,359	00:06:08,639	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	Just like rush hour for cars
EDL	00:06:08,639	00:06:11,455	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	So is the traditional engineering approach
EDL	00:06:11,967	00:06:18,367	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	Dynamite this building it start over again with twice as many Elevator Shaft because you've got more demand than you have capacity
EDL	00:06:18,367	00:06:19,135	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	When is rush hours
EDL	00:06:19,135	00:06:22,719	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	Am I experienced Engineers are a lot more crafty than that but let's just go with it
EDL	00:06:24,511	00:06:26,303	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	But then in our stroke of Genius
EDL	00:06:26,815	00:06:28,351	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	He said maybe the
EDL	00:06:28,351	00:06:33,727	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	Problem is frame the wrong way maybe the problem isn't the 90 seconds of wait for the elevators
EDL	00:06:33,727	00:06:36,543	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	Maybe the problem is the complaints about the noise
EDL	00:06:38,591	00:06:44,223	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	If we can reduce the complaints substantially maybe we'll solve the problem and then another stroke of Genius
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:47,295	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	What if you give somebody a distraction and diversion
EDL	00:06:47,295	00:06:49,343	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	Let's try floor-to-ceiling mirror
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:51,391	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	Next to all the elevators in an experimental build
EDL	00:06:51,903	00:06:53,951	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	They got the money with the mirrors in
EDL	00:06:54,463	00:06:55,999	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	Watch for a month and guess what
EDL	00:06:55,999	00:06:58,047	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	The complaints drop to near-zero
EDL	00:06:58,047	00:07:04,191	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	Men who are wearing ties could have just their ties that women could make sure their hair was organized okay or vice versa
EDL	00:07:04,191	00:07:04,959	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	Sometimes

EDL	00:08:32,511	00:08:33,023	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	Is changing
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:37,119	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	More and more we're encountering cues that are designed so that
EDL	00:08:37,119	00:08:39,679	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	Different levels of service can be provided to
EDL	00:08:39,679	00:08:40,959	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	Two different groups of people

EDL	00:08:45,567	00:08:46,591	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	You can see it in
EDL	00:08:47,359	00:08:48,895	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	Amusements like
EDL	00:08:48,895	00:08:50,175	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	Like Disney but more seriously
EDL	00:08:50,687	00:08:52,991	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	It occurs in some life-and-death situation
EDL	00:08:52,991	00:08:53,759	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	Like

EDL	00:08:57,087	00:08:57,855	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	My hypothesis
EDL	00:08:58,367	00:09:01,183	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	Is that this design change is connected to the
EDL	00:09:01,183	00:09:01,695	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	Cure
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:04,255	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	It's becoming more and more commonplace
EDL	00:09:04,767	00:09:07,583	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	And available to watch for free on YouTube
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:11,423	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	And I also believe that understanding this new Q Theory
EDL	00:09:11,423	00:09:13,983	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	Will better help us understand the enemy
EDL	00:09:13,983	00:09:15,775	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	Quality Inn disparity
EDL	00:09:15,775	00:09:17,055	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	It's on the rise in this
EDL	00:09:20,127	00:09:22,687	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	Why should somebody with a lot of frequent flyer miles
EDL	00:09:22,687	00:09:23,967	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	Automatically bumped up
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:24,479	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	The first class
EDL	00:09:24,991	00:09:26,783	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	Cuz I found out I recently was
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:27,807	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	Hudson flights
EDL	00:09:28,319	00:09:30,623	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	And therefore have to escape

EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:35,743	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	And I feel a little bit guilty about that
EDL	00:09:36,255	00:09:38,047	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	And it just yesterday I did this twice
EDL	00:09:38,815	00:09:42,911	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	And and I felt a little guilty because they're like 30 people in line and I went right to the front of it
EDL	00:09:44,703	00:09:48,543	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	Why is this fair just because I flywheel but want more than the others do
EDL	00:09:48,543	00:09:52,639	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	I think your question is is a deep one and requires some more
EDL	00:09:52,639	00:09:53,407	| 49-Queue-Theory-and-Design |	More thought in the sky
