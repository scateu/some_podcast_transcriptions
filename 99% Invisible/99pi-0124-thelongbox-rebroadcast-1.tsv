EDL	00:02:07,232	00:02:11,328	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Be provocative right from the start I'm going to say that REM out of time

EDL	00:02:34,112	00:02:34,624	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Packaging
EDL	00:02:35,136	00:02:39,744	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	The box out of time originally came in led to a bill being passed in Congress

EDL	00:02:43,584	00:02:45,120	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Let's go back to 1985
EDL	00:02:45,632	00:02:47,680	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	The pop charts were full of Prince

EDL	00:02:59,712	00:03:03,296	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	They put pressure on the creators and Distributors of quote on quote

EDL	00:03:05,088	00:03:07,136	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Musicians and labels called the censorship
EDL	00:03:07,648	00:03:09,184	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	There were Senate hearings about this
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:13,536	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	And eventually those little black and white Parental Advisory sticker started appearing on albums
EDL	00:03:14,304	00:03:16,096	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	This set off a wave of sensors
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:17,120	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Step across the country
EDL	00:03:17,120	00:03:22,752	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	In 1990 a federal district judge in South Florida ruled that the rap group 2 Live Crew album
EDL	00:03:22,752	00:03:23,776	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	As nasty as they wanna be
EDL	00:03:24,544	00:03:28,640	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Was so obscene that it couldn't be sold or performed within his jurisdiction
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:41,184	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	3 days after the ruling 2 Live Crew played a show in Broward County Florida
EDL	00:03:41,696	00:03:44,256	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	And after the show two members of the group got arrest
EDL	00:03:44,256	00:03:45,792	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	And it was a live performance
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:50,144	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	That they found obscene with you know girls doing what would be
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:51,936	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Like what
EDL	00:03:51,936	00:03:55,008	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Twerking I think it would be a very early version of the
EDL	00:03:55,008	00:03:55,776	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Twerking
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:04:00,128	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Jeff ayeroff wasn't there he saw it on TV and I just it was just
EDL	00:04:00,128	00:04:00,896	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	So offensive
EDL	00:04:01,408	00:04:03,456	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Jeff was an executive at Virgin Records
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:07,040	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	And to be clear he wasn't offended by the raunchy lyrics or
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:07,808	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	The twerking
EDL	00:04:07,808	00:04:09,344	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	He was offended by the arrest
EDL	00:04:09,344	00:04:11,392	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	And a blatant censorship of the artist work
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:15,744	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Just spend the next couple days mulling this over and then he had a revelation
EDL	00:04:16,256	00:04:17,536	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	One of the reasons why
EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:19,583	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Politicians get away with things
EDL	00:04:19,583	00:04:21,375	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Because there isn't an anti constituent
EDL	00:04:22,143	00:04:24,191	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	There was never anything to lose by
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:25,215	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Baiting
EDL	00:04:25,983	00:04:28,543	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Rock and roll because there was this
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:31,615	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Canard that young people didn't vote
EDL	00:04:32,127	00:04:36,991	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	And you know within the next two days the idea came to me like fully formed in some way
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:38,527	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	And I came up with the

EDL	00:04:43,391	00:04:47,231	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Get young people to vote for politicians who wouldn't censor music

EDL	00:05:38,687	00:05:40,479	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	And one of his major project of the time
EDL	00:05:40,991	00:05:42,015	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Was trying to figure out
EDL	00:05:42,015	00:05:43,295	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	How to package CDs
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:49,183	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Compact disc packaging was the Hot Topic in the record world in the late eighties and early nineties
EDL	00:05:50,207	00:05:52,511	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	CDs have been around for a few years at this point
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:54,815	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	But record stores still didn't have a good way to display them
EDL	00:05:55,327	00:05:56,095	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Here's Jeff gold
EDL	00:05:56,607	00:05:57,375	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	When

EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:01,471	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Record retailers
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:03,263	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Were kind of angry about
EDL	00:06:03,263	00:06:06,079	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Got them because their stores were formatted
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:08,639	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	To display
EDL	00:06:08,639	00:06:11,711	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	12 and 1/2 inch for 12 and 1/4 inch squares album
EDL	00:06:12,223	00:06:16,319	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	In other words they didn't have any stands or display cases for these new CDs
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:19,135	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	So somebody in the record industry said look
EDL	00:06:19,135	00:06:24,511	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	If you put a CD jewel case inside of a cardboard box that's as long as a vinyl album
EDL	00:06:24,511	00:06:26,303	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	And only half as wide
EDL	00:06:26,303	00:06:27,071	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	You can fit
EDL	00:06:27,071	00:06:30,911	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Two of these longbox CDs side-by-side in an LP rack
EDL	00:06:31,423	00:06:32,703	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Problem solved
EDL	00:06:32,703	00:06:35,007	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Retailer set flying perfect
EDL	00:06:35,519	00:06:39,103	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	So millions of these things out of nowhere started getting made
EDL	00:06:40,127	00:06:42,943	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Record people loved the long box
EDL	00:06:42,943	00:06:44,479	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	They thought it was the future
EDL	00:06:45,247	00:06:51,647	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	A head honcho at am I wrote this opinion piece in billboard magazine in 1989 entitled why we should
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:52,927	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Keep the CD longbox
EDL	00:06:53,695	00:06:54,975	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Your rights quote
EDL	00:06:54,975	00:07:00,863	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	I want to see the music industry continue to thrive and prosper as one of the cornerstones of entertainment
EDL	00:07:01,631	00:07:07,775	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	And I think making full use of the 6 by 12 CD carton is one way to help us do just that
EDL	00:07:07,775	00:07:08,799	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	But not everyone
EDL	00:07:10,591	00:07:11,359	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Artist
EDL	00:07:11,359	00:07:12,127	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	I said wait a minute
EDL	00:07:12,895	00:07:14,943	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	We don't want you cutting down millions of
EDL	00:07:14,943	00:07:15,711	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Trees
EDL	00:07:15,711	00:07:16,735	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	To put
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:18,271	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Are CD's in
EDL	00:07:18,271	00:07:20,575	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	And then having people throw these things away it's
EDL	00:07:21,087	00:07:22,367	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Incredibly wasteful
EDL	00:07:22,367	00:07:22,879	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	And bad things
EDL	00:07:24,159	00:07:25,439	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Because the thing about the longbox
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:27,743	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Is that it was never meant to be collected
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:30,047	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Had the feel of a big Mike and Ike
EDL	00:07:30,815	00:07:32,607	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	When you bought a CD in a longbox
EDL	00:07:33,119	00:07:33,887	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	You open it up
EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:35,167	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	It take out the
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:38,239	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	The jewel case which had the actual CD in the album art in it
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:39,519	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	And you toss a long
EDL	00:07:40,031	00:07:41,567	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	There's no reason to keep it around
EDL	00:07:42,335	00:07:44,383	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	So Re Mi record coming out
EDL	00:07:44,895	00:07:45,663	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	In 1990
EDL	00:07:46,175	00:07:47,199	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	And they're saying
EDL	00:07:47,711	00:07:50,271	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	To me and to Warner Brothers there's no way our record
EDL	00:07:50,783	00:07:51,551	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Long box
EDL	00:07:52,319	00:07:54,367	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	We're sensitive to the environment
EDL	00:07:54,367	00:07:56,671	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	This is a ridiculous thing forget it
EDL	00:07:57,695	00:07:58,975	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	And where better sales Park
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:08:00,255	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Singing absolutely
EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:01,023	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Ask about a long box
EDL	00:08:01,535	00:08:02,559	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Or record retailers
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:05,631	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	And that's when Jeff gold got this idea
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:08,191	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	He could merge the two projects He was working on
EDL	00:08:08,959	00:08:12,031	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	They could use the CD longbox to advance The Rock the vote camp
EDL	00:08:12,799	00:08:15,871	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	But first he needed a concrete political, so connected
EDL	00:08:16,639	00:08:19,199	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	And Jeff are all fat found just the thing
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:22,271	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	We were sitting there looking for a raise on death row to get us
EDL	00:08:22,271	00:08:24,831	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Send a political situation
EDL	00:08:24,831	00:08:26,367	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	I'm reading this week
EDL	00:08:26,367	00:08:28,415	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	The time and there's this column article
EDL	00:08:28,415	00:08:30,207	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	About the Motor Voter bill
EDL	00:08:30,207	00:08:31,743	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	We just said
EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:34,559	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	We're going to help these people from the Motor Voter bill
EDL	00:08:34,559	00:08:40,703	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	This was going to be our first thing we're going to do but so there's this Motor Voter bill that's been bouncing around Congress since the 1970s
EDL	00:08:41,215	00:08:46,079	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	If past
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:52,735	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	It also allowed you to register by mail or when you apply for social services like welfare or unemployment
EDL	00:08:52,735	00:08:55,039	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Basically making it easier for lots of people
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:58,111	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Including Rock living young people
EDL	00:08:58,111	00:08:59,391	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	The register to vote
EDL	00:08:59,391	00:09:01,951	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	By 91 a few States had already adopted it
EDL	00:09:01,951	00:09:04,767	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	But Congress has never been able to get it passed nationally
EDL	00:09:04,767	00:09:08,607	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Jeff gold went to a political event in Hollywood about the Motor Voter bill
EDL	00:09:08,607	00:09:12,447	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	And one of the speakers was Columbia sociologist and political activist
EDL	00:09:12,447	00:09:13,471	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Richard cloward
EDL	00:09:13,471	00:09:16,543	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	He said that writing to elected officials could help sway them on the issue
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:20,127	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	After clouds talk Jeff gold went up and spoke with
EDL	00:09:20,639	00:09:21,407	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	What happened I started
EDL	00:09:23,711	00:09:27,039	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	What amount of letters would a senator of Congress
EDL	00:09:27,039	00:09:27,807	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Richmond take note of
EDL	00:09:29,343	00:09:31,391	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	650 200
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:32,927	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	That would really have an empath
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:34,463	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Really that
EDL	00:09:34,463	00:09:35,231	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Few
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:37,535	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	You said yeah that people don't write so
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:40,351	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Getting 150-200 letters
EDL	00:09:40,863	00:09:43,935	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	About an issue would would definitely make them sit up in
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:44,447	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Take notice
EDL	00:09:44,959	00:09:48,031	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	That weekend Jeff gold was riding his bike around Santa Monica
EDL	00:09:48,031	00:09:49,823	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Can I have this moment where
EDL	00:09:49,823	00:09:52,383	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	It rushed into my mind this fully formed idea that
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:54,431	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	We could
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:09:55,967	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Take care of REM
EDL	00:09:55,967	00:09:58,527	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	By turning their long box into a positive
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:10:02,111	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	If we put a petition on the back of the long box
EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:06,207	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	That would go to Rock the vote saying I support the Motor Voter bill
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:08,767	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	And we could distribute it to
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:10,047	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Their respective senators
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:11,839	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	And I knew
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:14,655	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	We could generate an unbelievable amount of mail.
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:17,727	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Jeff gold got on the phone with Jeff Tara
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:19,519	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	And they agreed that this would be the strategy
EDL	00:10:20,287	00:10:23,615	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	They would turn the album long box into a piece of political machinery
EDL	00:10:24,127	00:10:26,943	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	And they would flood congress with support for the Motor Voter bill
EDL	00:10:27,711	00:10:30,783	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	That Monday Jeff called Ariana's manager with the plan
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:32,063	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	It's alright Lily call the guys
EDL	00:10:32,831	00:10:33,599	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	I'll call you back
EDL	00:10:33,599	00:10:34,879	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	I probably heard back from him
EDL	00:10:34,879	00:10:35,647	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Within an hour
EDL	00:10:35,647	00:10:37,951	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Bernie said great idea they're totally into it let's do it
EDL	00:10:38,463	00:10:41,535	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	So out of time hit the record stores on March 12th 1991
EDL	00:10:42,047	00:10:44,351	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	And then the petition started rolling in
EDL	00:10:44,351	00:10:46,911	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Can I remember vividly
EDL	00:10:47,679	00:10:48,959	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Beef for 5 days
EDL	00:10:48,959	00:10:50,751	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	After the record come out
EDL	00:10:50,751	00:10:52,031	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	I mean a very short period of time
EDL	00:10:52,031	00:10:53,311	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	And they had bags
EDL	00:10:54,591	00:10:56,383	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	It was really incredible
EDL	00:10:56,383	00:11:00,223	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Nobody can seem to put their hand on what the exact number of
EDL	00:11:00,223	00:11:03,039	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	That we got of these were but I remember thinking
EDL	00:11:03,039	00:11:09,439	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Well after 3 weeks we buy 10,000 I mean that's that's
EDL	00:11:09,439	00:11:11,999	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Already half of what Richard cloward said would make an impact
EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:16,607	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	And he sings just kept coming in and drove their canvas bags full of them coming in
EDL	00:11:17,887	00:11:23,775	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	About a month after REM release the album Rock the vote political director plus two members of the hip hop group KMD
EDL	00:11:24,287	00:11:28,895	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Will the shopping cart full of these first ten thousand petitions into a senate hearing
EDL	00:11:29,663	00:11:32,735	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	And they just left them there for senators window Ford
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:34,783	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	And a very young looking Mitch McConnell
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:39,647	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	It may have 1992 after thousands of petitions and
EDL	00:11:39,647	00:11:40,671	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Senate testimony
EDL	00:11:40,671	00:11:42,207	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	The Motor Voter bill passed
EDL	00:11:42,207	00:11:42,719	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Congress
EDL	00:11:43,231	00:11:45,023	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	But then president HW Bush vetoed
EDL	00:11:45,791	00:11:48,863	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	This was in July right in the middle of Bush's re-election campaign
EDL	00:11:49,375	00:11:52,959	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Bush's opponent Bill Clinton took up Motor Voter as a talking point
EDL	00:11:52,959	00:11:54,239	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Bashing Bush over here
EDL	00:11:54,239	00:11:55,007	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Is Vito
EDL	00:11:55,007	00:11:56,543	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	And the rest is basically history
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:11:58,335	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Clinton wins 92
EDL	00:11:58,335	00:12:03,455	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	The bill comes back before the house is actually the second bill that the house takes up in January of 93
EDL	00:12:03,967	00:12:06,527	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Motor Voter passed the house and passes the Senate

EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:35,967	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Clinton at the signing talks about how Rock the vote really help to make the difference
EDL	00:12:35,967	00:12:36,479	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	To get this built
EDL	00:12:37,247	00:12:38,271	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	As I said I have
EDL	00:12:38,271	00:12:40,319	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Long supported the idea of

EDL	00:12:44,415	00:12:46,975	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	But I would sign hr2 and fight for its Passage
EDL	00:12:47,743	00:12:50,303	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	I'm pleased to be able to keep the promise today

EDL	00:13:02,079	00:13:03,615	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	It was really one of the most surreal
EDL	00:13:04,127	00:13:05,151	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Moments of my life
EDL	00:13:11,295	00:13:14,367	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	I want to stop a Minit in point out just how bizarre this scene is
EDL	00:13:14,879	00:13:21,279	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Remember Rock the vote had formed an open protest against the censorship group that was started by the new Vice
EDL	00:13:21,279	00:13:22,047	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	President's wife

EDL	00:13:22,815	00:13:27,167	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	You know those little black and white parental advisory stickers those were nickname
EDL	00:13:27,679	00:13:30,751	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Tipper Gore's husband was now praising Rock the vote
EDL	00:13:31,519	00:13:36,639	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	And it's a tribute to one group whose voice and organization was apps
EDL	00:13:36,639	00:13:38,175	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Absolutely unprecedented
EDL	00:13:38,175	00:13:39,967	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	America's young people

EDL	00:13:45,087	00:13:46,367	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Was really one of the most
EDL	00:13:46,367	00:13:47,135	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Surreal
EDL	00:13:47,135	00:13:48,159	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Moments of my life
EDL	00:13:48,671	00:13:51,487	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Yeah I think so real is probably the right word
EDL	00:13:53,023	00:13:55,071	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	What's interesting here is that this campaign
EDL	00:13:55,583	00:13:58,911	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Really could have only happened during a very brief period of time
EDL	00:13:59,423	00:14:02,495	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Because before Clinton that even signed the Motor Voter bill
EDL	00:14:02,495	00:14:06,079	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Jeff gold at actually found a way to kill off the long box for good
EDL	00:14:07,359	00:14:11,711	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	He hatched a plan and he went to talk about it with the Chief Financial Officer at Warner Brothers
EDL	00:14:11,711	00:14:12,223	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Murrieta
EDL	00:14:12,735	00:14:14,783	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	It's Mari how many of these things do we make a year
EDL	00:14:17,599	00:14:19,135	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	I don't know 90 million between the
EDL	00:14:19,647	00:14:20,159	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Something like that
EDL	00:14:21,183	00:14:22,463	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Niacin how much do they cost
EDL	00:14:23,743	00:14:24,511	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	$0.25
EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:25,791	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	I said Okay so

EDL	00:14:27,583	00:14:30,399	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	20 to 25 million dollars a year were music
EDL	00:14:30,399	00:14:31,167	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Expense on lombok
EDL	00:14:31,679	00:14:32,447	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	He said yeah
EDL	00:14:33,215	00:14:35,519	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	I said so what if we stopped making long box
EDL	00:14:36,543	00:14:40,895	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	And we took that 25 million dollars and gave it in the form of rebates
EDL	00:14:41,919	00:14:42,943	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Trek retailers
EDL	00:14:43,967	00:14:46,271	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Just to pay for them to reconfigure
EDL	00:14:47,039	00:14:47,551	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	There been
EDL	00:14:49,087	00:14:51,135	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	And we did it as a one-time
EDL	00:14:51,135	00:14:52,415	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Yo Discounters payment
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:56,511	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	And they got all the money we saved for the first year
EDL	00:14:57,279	00:14:57,791	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	And then
EDL	00:14:58,815	00:15:00,351	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	For the rest of time
EDL	00:15:00,863	00:15:02,399	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	We're saving 25 million dollars
EDL	00:15:03,935	00:15:07,519	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	A jackal tell that the other Warner Brothers Executives liked his idea
EDL	00:15:08,031	00:15:09,567	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	They took it to the distributor
EDL	00:15:10,079	00:15:11,103	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Distributor went for it
EDL	00:15:11,615	00:15:13,407	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	And that was the end of the long box
EDL	00:15:13,919	00:15:17,503	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Some stores got new racks to accommodate the long box for Jewel cases
EDL	00:15:18,271	00:15:20,319	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Others held onto their 12 inch bins
EDL	00:15:20,319	00:15:23,647	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Started putting CDs inside of these reusable plastic
EDL	00:15:23,647	00:15:24,159	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	The cartridges
EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:27,999	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	And record companies have been profitable and solvent ever since
EDL	00:15:29,279	00:15:30,047	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	So long boxes
EDL	00:15:30,815	00:15:31,839	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	The Motor Voter bill
EDL	00:15:31,839	00:15:35,423	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Which after it passed became the national voter registration Act of 1993
EDL	00:15:36,191	00:15:37,215	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	That's still very much a thing
EDL	00:15:37,727	00:15:41,567	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Between 1995 when the law went into effect in 2012
EDL	00:15:41,567	00:15:45,919	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	The percentage of the voting age population that is registered to vote went up more than 10 points
EDL	00:15:46,431	00:15:48,735	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	From 69.5%
EDL	00:15:48,735	00:15:49,759	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	279.9
EDL	00:15:50,271	00:15:56,159	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	And in that same time span more than a hundred and fifty million voter registrations have been filled out at the DMV
EDL	00:15:56,159	00:16:00,511	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	That doesn't even include mailing registrations or registrations through Social Services
EDL	00:16:00,511	00:16:01,535	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	As for what's the law also
EDL	00:16:02,559	00:16:06,911	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	So I think that proves it know album is as important to politics in the US
EDL	00:16:07,423	00:16:08,959	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	As REM out of time
EDL	00:16:09,471	00:16:14,079	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	But we lie their most important album important of other things that actually really matter
EDL	00:16:14,591	00:16:15,359	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Is murmur
EDL	00:16:15,359	00:16:19,967	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Musically of course it's not their best album automatic for the people their best musical album
EDL	00:16:19,967	00:16:20,991	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	What how old are you

EDL	00:17:19,871	00:17:26,271	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	The reason I'm presenting the story again is that is nearly time to vote and I think that this election represents the most
EDL	00:17:26,271	00:17:27,807	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Important we've ever had
EDL	00:17:27,807	00:17:31,903	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Currently over 40% of the voting age population does not vote
EDL	00:17:31,903	00:17:32,927	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	And this is a
EDL	00:17:32,927	00:17:33,439	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	Tragedy
EDL	00:17:33,951	00:17:37,279	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	That 40% and set the entire agenda for the whole country
EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:38,559	| 99pi-0124-thelongbox-rebroadcast-1 |	And they don't
