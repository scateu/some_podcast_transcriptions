EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:16,864	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Few days

EDL	00:03:37,088	00:03:40,160	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	We have pretty strict laws around the reproduction of US currency

EDL	00:05:06,175	00:05:07,199	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Okay so
EDL	00:05:07,199	00:05:11,551	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	The ban on any photographic representation of money was in place for about
EDL	00:05:11,551	00:05:14,623	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Century and this was a problem for advertisers and talk
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:19,231	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	By the letter of the law they were specifically barred from taking
EDL	00:05:19,231	00:05:20,255	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Pictures of money
EDL	00:05:20,255	00:05:24,607	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	The law was written before the invention of motion pictures but when movies came along
EDL	00:05:24,607	00:05:29,471	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	It was generally assumed that filmmakers would follow the same rules as photographers
EDL	00:05:29,471	00:05:31,775	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	No money on camera
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:37,151	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	I'm so in the early days of Cinema when money was needed in a film producers had to get
EDL	00:05:37,151	00:05:37,663	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Creative
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:39,455	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	3095
EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:46,111	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	That's a scene from the 1943 Hitchcock film shadow of a doubt
EDL	00:05:46,623	00:05:48,159	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	And if you watch a movie and look closed
EDL	00:05:48,671	00:05:51,743	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	You can see that the bills in the scene aren't American dollars
EDL	00:05:52,255	00:05:53,791	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	There Mexican pesos
EDL	00:05:53,791	00:05:55,071	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	God entails
EDL	00:05:55,583	00:05:57,119	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	I'm glad to see that you're a man of understanding

EDL	00:06:03,007	00:06:05,567	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	I remember seeing it movies all the way from
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:08,895	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	The twenties in the thirties and forties up into the 7th
EDL	00:06:09,407	00:06:12,991	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	This is Peter Huntoon he's an author and expert on America
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:16,831	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Concurrency and he says you can see pesos in a lot of old movies
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:20,415	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	The reason for this is that after the Mexican Revolution ended
EDL	00:06:20,415	00:06:21,695	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Around 1920
EDL	00:06:21,695	00:06:26,047	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Regional Mexican money that was created during the revolution locked value
EDL	00:06:26,047	00:06:27,327	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	And whistle for cheap
EDL	00:06:27,327	00:06:30,143	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	The notes from the Mexican state of Chihuahua or punch
EDL	00:06:30,143	00:06:32,703	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Sophia Health power or some of the most widely used
EDL	00:06:33,727	00:06:37,055	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	They were absolutely gorgeous because they were multicolored
EDL	00:06:37,055	00:06:39,871	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	They had gold backs black Print
EDL	00:06:39,871	00:06:42,943	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	But the idea was is that these things look like
EDL	00:06:42,943	00:06:44,735	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Money they were real nice looking
EDL	00:06:44,735	00:06:46,783	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	And so the studios bottom up
EDL	00:06:46,783	00:06:51,647	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	The studios weren't trying to pass pesos off as American dollars it was just all they had
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:54,207	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Nobody's ever fooled by it if you see this
EDL	00:06:54,207	00:07:00,351	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Does that money go by in a movie you know whether it's American or not because of course you'd see that a block away
EDL	00:07:03,423	00:07:09,055	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	In the second half of the 20th century the government began relaxing restrictions on the rules around photographing currency
EDL	00:07:09,567	00:07:12,639	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	And it eventually became legal to film real money
EDL	00:07:13,151	00:07:16,479	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	And real money is great for scenes where you need close-up shots
EDL	00:07:16,991	00:07:20,063	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Like this scene from the 1995 movie Dead Presidents
EDL	00:07:20,575	00:07:22,111	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	But I can forgive me for this one
EDL	00:07:23,647	00:07:24,671	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	I'll tell you what man
EDL	00:07:25,439	00:07:26,207	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	This kind of money
EDL	00:07:27,999	00:07:29,023	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	In this scene
EDL	00:07:29,023	00:07:31,327	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Or of the characters have robbing armored truck
EDL	00:07:31,327	00:07:32,351	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	And are splitting up the cat
EDL	00:07:33,119	00:07:35,423	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	The camera pans slowly over stacks
EDL	00:07:40,287	00:07:44,383	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	But it can also be risky to have real money floating around on Sat
EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:45,919	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Especially if you need a bunch of it
EDL	00:07:46,431	00:07:48,735	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	It's a lot of producers prefer to use fake money
EDL	00:07:49,503	00:07:53,599	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	These days the government does allow for some reproductions of US currency
EDL	00:07:54,111	00:07:56,927	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	It's just not very clear how real
EDL	00:07:56,927	00:07:57,695	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Fake money
EDL	00:07:57,695	00:07:58,463	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Can look
EDL	00:07:58,463	00:08:04,607	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	It depends it's it's very subjective if it's the same size as a current US
EDL	00:08:04,607	00:08:05,887	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Currency note
EDL	00:08:06,399	00:08:11,263	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	And it's front and back and it's made in the likeness of our US currency
EDL	00:08:11,263	00:08:13,055	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Then we view it as counterfeit
EDL	00:08:13,055	00:08:14,591	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	That's Trent Everett
EDL	00:08:14,591	00:08:19,711	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	I am an assistant to the special agent in charge for our criminal investigative division of the
EDL	00:08:19,711	00:08:20,223	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Secret Service
EDL	00:08:20,735	00:08:24,831	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	And I currently oversee our counterfeit operation section
EDL	00:08:24,831	00:08:27,903	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Over the years prop money and movies has begun to look more like
EDL	00:08:27,903	00:08:28,671	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Actual money
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:29,951	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Sometimes
EDL	00:08:29,951	00:08:31,743	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Too much like actual money
EDL	00:08:32,255	00:08:36,351	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Some companies did and still do turn out bills that run afoul of the law
EDL	00:08:36,863	00:08:38,143	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Because to look good on
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:41,727	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Screen fake money has to be pretty close to the real thing
EDL	00:08:41,727	00:08:46,591	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	He's moving companies like to have things look as real as possible and then that's where they start running into issues
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:50,175	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Some people make bills that are the same size as real money
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:55,807	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	But with one or two small design changes like maybe it's as in dog we trust instead of In God We Trust
EDL	00:08:55,807	00:08:57,855	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	What has Benjamin Franklin making a weird face
EDL	00:08:58,367	00:09:00,927	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Order of bills that look exactly like a real thing
EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:02,975	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	It's up there stamp the small disclaimer
EDL	00:09:03,487	00:09:05,791	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	All of these would probably be
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:07,071	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	The Secret Service
EDL	00:09:07,071	00:09:09,887	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Remember Greg Bilson from Rush Hour 2
EDL	00:09:09,887	00:09:13,983	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	He thought they had made their fake bills look different enough from the real thing
EDL	00:09:13,983	00:09:20,383	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	There's probably 25 or 26 separate things that are not but a real $100 bill has on it
EDL	00:09:20,383	00:09:23,455	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	But it was still too close to the reality for them to accept
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:27,551	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Wilson had to turn over all of his prop money to the Secret Service 2
EDL	00:09:28,063	00:09:33,439	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	And then They confiscated and destroyed all the electronic files that were used in creating this money
EDL	00:09:33,951	00:09:36,255	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Feel so lost a lot of money
EDL	00:09:36,255	00:09:42,655	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Not just a fake money but the real money it took to produce the fake money
EDL	00:09:42,655	00:09:45,215	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Thousand dollars just a Paper Stock alone to buy
EDL	00:09:45,727	00:09:49,311	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Enough paper to produce a billion dollars worth $77,000
EDL	00:09:49,823	00:09:53,919	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	In the end all Bilson really lost with money he didn't have to go to jail
EDL	00:09:53,919	00:10:00,319	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	These days he mostly trying to avoid using fake money at all it's just too hard to please both the Seeker
EDL	00:10:00,319	00:10:02,367	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Service and the movie producers
EDL	00:10:02,367	00:10:06,975	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	It's not worth it I'm not going to break the law for a TV show a feature film or a producer that I don't even
EDL	00:10:09,535	00:10:14,143	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	But movies are definitely not the only way fake money is making it into the marketplace
EDL	00:10:14,655	00:10:16,703	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Is Trent Everett again from the Secret Service
EDL	00:10:17,215	00:10:17,983	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	That's not
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:20,287	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	But it's just leaking out of production companies
EDL	00:10:20,799	00:10:24,127	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	But that's being sold on the Internet or anybody can purchase it
EDL	00:10:24,127	00:10:26,431	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	You can actually buy prop money right now on Amazon
EDL	00:10:26,431	00:10:28,479	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Steven on Prime free two-day shipping
EDL	00:10:28,479	00:10:29,247	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	So of course
EDL	00:10:30,271	00:10:30,783	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	We ordered
EDL	00:10:32,063	00:10:35,135	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	The producer Katie mingle opening up the package
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:36,671	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Okay so it's a little stack
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:38,975	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	About half an inch thick
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:40,511	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	It does look
EDL	00:10:41,023	00:10:43,327	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	A good bit like money from a distance
EDL	00:10:44,095	00:10:44,863	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	It doesn't
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:47,935	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Feel that much like money though it feels like just regular
EDL	00:10:47,935	00:10:48,447	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Paper to me
EDL	00:10:49,215	00:10:51,775	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Benjamin Franklin is making a really strange
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:52,287	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Face
EDL	00:10:52,799	00:10:54,079	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	It's like they took his mouth
EDL	00:10:55,103	00:10:55,615	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Shrunk it
EDL	00:10:56,383	00:10:59,199	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	And it says for motion picture use only
EDL	00:10:59,711	00:11:02,527	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	But yeah let me see if I can pull any of my coworker
EDL	00:11:04,575	00:11:10,719	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Katie has about ten hundred dollar bills in her hands which she's going to say a fan sent us in the mail
EDL	00:11:16,351	00:11:18,143	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Note with all this money in it
EDL	00:11:18,655	00:11:20,447	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Who did
EDL	00:11:26,079	00:11:27,871	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Deer 99ci
EDL	00:11:27,871	00:11:31,711	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Love your words

EDL	00:11:34,527	00:11:35,807	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	People
EDL	00:11:35,807	00:11:37,087	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	How much money is it
EDL	00:11:38,111	00:11:38,879	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Real
EDL	00:11:38,879	00:11:39,903	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	It doesn't
EDL	00:11:40,927	00:11:41,951	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Promotion
EDL	00:11:41,951	00:11:42,719	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Picture use only
EDL	00:11:44,255	00:11:45,535	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Shut up
EDL	00:11:47,327	00:11:50,655	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Okay so Delaney could see it was fake as soon as it was in your hands
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:54,239	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	But from a couple feet away the money does look really convincing
EDL	00:11:54,751	00:11:59,103	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Antron Everett told me they're actually investigating some fake money that looks
EDL	00:11:59,103	00:12:01,663	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	A lot like the stuff you guys bought from Amazon
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:03,199	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Currently we are invest
EDL	00:12:03,199	00:12:07,551	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Instigating the motion picture note that has been popping up all over e-commerce sites
EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:13,695	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	But it's two-sided it is similar size it is in the likeness of a $100 US
EDL	00:12:14,207	00:12:14,975	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Notes
EDL	00:12:14,975	00:12:19,583	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	And the only difference on it is that says motion picture you saw me
EDL	00:12:19,583	00:12:24,703	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	So don't be surprised if some secret service agent show up at the 99 Pi office
EDL	00:12:25,471	00:12:29,311	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	No charges necessarily brought on the person for purchasing it
EDL	00:12:29,311	00:12:32,383	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	They just aren't legally able to possess it
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:33,407	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Okay just for the record
EDL	00:12:33,407	00:12:34,175	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Personal purchases
EDL	00:12:34,687	00:12:35,711	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Katie Mingle

EDL	00:12:42,367	00:12:45,183	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Given how difficult it is to make money that looks real but
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:49,535	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	It's hard to imagine who still wants to be in the business of
EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:51,583	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Creating and applying fake money for the movie
EDL	00:12:52,351	00:12:56,959	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	But there are a few people still doing it including RJ Rappaport

EDL	00:13:21,791	00:13:27,167	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Futuristic machine with lots of knobs and buttons and control panels like this
EDL	00:13:27,167	00:13:29,471	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Blue light spinning across

EDL	00:13:39,199	00:13:41,503	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	It's almost like he's a kid playing pretend

EDL	00:13:55,839	00:13:58,143	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	When we step into the room with the prop money
EDL	00:13:58,143	00:14:00,191	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	It's like seeing a bunch of movie cliches
EDL	00:14:01,983	00:14:07,103	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	There are Stacks and stacks of bills wrapping paper bands like they just came from the bank

EDL	00:14:33,727	00:14:37,055	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	That kind of guidance isn't something the Secret Service normally provide
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:37,823	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	By the way
EDL	00:14:37,823	00:14:40,127	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	RJ managed to finagle an exception
EDL	00:14:40,127	00:14:42,175	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	We work with the Secret Service
EDL	00:14:42,687	00:14:44,991	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	And we went over all the laws

EDL	00:14:47,295	00:14:48,831	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	All of the changes

EDL	00:15:04,703	00:15:09,055	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	And even then sometimes the Secret Service will end up asking you to destroy
EDL	00:15:09,055	00:15:10,591	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Everything you made
EDL	00:15:10,591	00:15:14,175	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	It's so much hassle that ironically there's no money in it
EDL	00:15:14,175	00:15:16,991	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	And it's not a big money maker

EDL	00:15:18,783	00:15:20,319	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	It's not the way that we

EDL	00:16:01,535	00:16:02,815	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	It's a fun plot device
EDL	00:16:03,327	00:16:06,655	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	But behind all this cash is someone like RJ
EDL	00:16:06,655	00:16:12,031	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Who is been through a meticulous design process and years of back and forth with the Secret Service

EDL	00:18:47,423	00:18:49,215	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	But the idea of seeing
EDL	00:18:49,727	00:18:50,495	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Circulating
EDL	00:18:50,495	00:18:51,263	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	In the United States
EDL	00:18:51,775	00:18:52,799	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Wasn't actually
EDL	00:18:52,799	00:18:54,079	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	All that new
EDL	00:18:54,079	00:18:54,591	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Krazybee
EDL	00:18:55,103	00:18:57,407	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Yeah in fact from the late 1700s
EDL	00:18:57,407	00:19:00,991	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	All the way up to 1857 pieces for legal tender in the United States
EDL	00:19:01,759	00:19:04,319	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Around the same time that Congress officially approved their use
EDL	00:19:04,831	00:19:05,855	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	The dollar sign started to
EDL	00:19:08,415	00:19:11,231	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Well nobody's really sure who first designed the dollar sign
EDL	00:19:11,231	00:19:14,047	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	There's a lot of them about how it came up
EDL	00:19:14,815	00:19:16,863	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Some people have speculated that the s
EDL	00:19:16,863	00:19:21,983	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	With the double lines those two vertical lines over it is actually a you superimposed on an S
EDL	00:19:22,495	00:19:24,031	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	At the bottom of the you remove
EDL	00:19:24,031	00:19:26,079	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Oh so it's supposed to be US citizen
EDL	00:19:26,079	00:19:26,591	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	US currency
EDL	00:19:27,103	00:19:29,919	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Right and that's an appealing.
EDL	00:19:29,919	00:19:30,687	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Theory
EDL	00:19:30,687	00:19:34,783	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Makes the dollar sign seem distinctly American like a national symbol
EDL	00:19:36,319	00:19:36,831	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Leafly fault
EDL	00:19:37,855	00:19:39,135	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	I guess that's one
EDL	00:19:39,135	00:19:40,927	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Hypothesis on what's your
EDL	00:19:40,927	00:19:42,207	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Favorite version of
EDL	00:19:42,207	00:19:42,719	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	How the dollar sign
EDL	00:19:43,743	00:19:47,071	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Well there's this rather epic theory that the dollar sign traces back
EDL	00:19:47,071	00:19:49,887	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	To the pillars of Hercules on either side of the Strait of Gibraltar
EDL	00:19:50,655	00:19:55,519	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	This famous Strait is effectively a threshold between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean
EDL	00:19:55,519	00:20:01,151	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	And according to Legend the flanking pillars were once inscribed with the Latin words non plus Ultra
EDL	00:20:01,151	00:20:02,687	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Translate says nothing further
EDL	00:20:03,199	00:20:03,967	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	So is in
EDL	00:20:04,479	00:20:05,759	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Once you leave Mediterranean Sea
EDL	00:20:06,271	00:20:07,807	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	There is nothing beyond their just
EDL	00:20:07,807	00:20:08,575	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	The endless
EDL	00:20:08,575	00:20:12,159	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Write this is the end of the world as we know it and that motto
EDL	00:20:12,159	00:20:13,439	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Ended up on old Spanish currency
EDL	00:20:14,463	00:20:17,279	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	It was later changed from Christopher Columbus reach America
EDL	00:20:17,279	00:20:20,095	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	I actually dropped the non part and then it's loose Ultra
EDL	00:20:20,607	00:20:21,375	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Meaning further Beyond
EDL	00:20:22,143	00:20:24,191	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Reflect this new realization that in fact
EDL	00:20:24,191	00:20:25,471	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	There was a lot more to the world out there
EDL	00:20:26,239	00:20:29,567	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	And I'm Spanish coinage the model was shown on banners that rapped
EDL	00:20:29,567	00:20:30,847	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Flanking pair
EDL	00:20:30,847	00:20:31,615	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Corny pillar
EDL	00:20:32,383	00:20:34,431	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	So you have this kind of s shaped Banner
EDL	00:20:34,431	00:20:36,223	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	That wind down around a vertical column
EDL	00:20:36,735	00:20:39,551	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Turn the words with a pillar and a banner wrapped around it it looks like
EDL	00:20:40,319	00:20:41,087	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Single line
EDL	00:20:42,111	00:20:45,951	| 285_Money_Makers_pt_01 |	Pretty much and it's a fun story but the prevailing theory is actually
