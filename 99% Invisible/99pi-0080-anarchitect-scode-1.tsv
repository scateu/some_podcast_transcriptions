EDL	00:06:44,735	00:06:46,527	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	Solitary can bring on a break
EDL	00:06:47,295	00:06:51,391	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	Now again there is no universally accepted definition of solitary confinement
EDL	00:06:51,903	00:06:56,511	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	And like the law reporter Nancy MacLean it says that compared to other prisons she has visited
EDL	00:06:57,023	00:07:00,351	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	There are actually some good design elements in the Pelican Bay shu
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:04,447	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	Inmates can get natural light from skylights outside of their cells
EDL	00:07:04,447	00:07:07,007	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	What's drifts into the doors made of perforated metal
EDL	00:07:07,519	00:07:10,335	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	These Forest doors allow for inmates to communicate with
EDL	00:07:10,335	00:07:12,383	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	Each other even though there are no lines of sight
EDL	00:07:12,895	00:07:14,943	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	To any prisoner from within the cell
EDL	00:07:15,455	00:07:17,247	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	But on the other hand cells don't have Windows
EDL	00:07:17,759	00:07:19,807	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	Inmates never get to see the horizon
EDL	00:07:20,319	00:07:23,903	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	The only time prisoners get to leave the cell is to visit the shower
EDL	00:07:23,903	00:07:24,671	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	Or the exercise.
EDL	00:07:25,183	00:07:28,511	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	And the exercise yard is an empty windowless room
EDL	00:07:28,511	00:07:30,303	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	Not much bigger than a cell
EDL	00:07:30,303	00:07:32,095	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	20 foot high concrete walls
EDL	00:07:32,607	00:07:34,911	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	Animal many prisoners in the shoe have a cellmate
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:36,447	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	Terry Cooper
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:39,775	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	Says sharing a cell is often worse than being alone
EDL	00:07:40,287	00:07:43,615	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	So if that's not solitary confinement per se
EDL	00:07:43,615	00:07:44,895	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	You could call it a kind of
EDL	00:07:44,895	00:07:45,407	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	Binary
EDL	00:07:46,431	00:07:47,711	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	And all of this taken together
EDL	00:07:48,479	00:07:49,759	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	Some people call torture
EDL	00:07:50,271	00:07:54,879	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	In 2011 Juan Mendez the UN special rapporteur on torture
EDL	00:07:54,879	00:07:57,183	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	Said anything over 15 days
EDL	00:07:57,183	00:08:00,511	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	15 days in solitary confinement is a human rights abuse
EDL	00:08:01,023	00:08:04,351	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	Not various other commentators have said that means it's torture
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:06,143	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	15 days says the UN
EDL	00:08:06,655	00:08:10,495	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	Is the point at which people in solitary can begin to have a reputable
EDL	00:08:10,495	00:08:11,263	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	Psychological.
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:16,639	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	I don't actually like the 15-day standard some people fall apart in two days
EDL	00:08:16,639	00:08:18,687	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	And what Terry Cooper's calls torture
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:23,807	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	Happens in buildings specifically designed to maximize the isolation or
EDL	00:08:23,807	00:08:25,343	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	Quote unquote segregation
EDL	00:08:25,855	00:08:28,671	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	Of prisoners for the duration of their time in the shoe
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:31,231	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	So if it is the ethical code of Ark text
EDL	00:08:31,231	00:08:32,255	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	Promote human rights
EDL	00:08:33,023	00:08:36,351	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	What is their responsibility to the people who are incarcerated
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:37,119	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	And they're building
EDL	00:08:37,631	00:08:41,471	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	Did Argentina the military regime torture people in a former Auto Body
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:42,751	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	That was one of their big torture
EDL	00:08:43,519	00:08:44,287	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	I'm not going
EDL	00:08:44,287	00:08:48,639	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	Nobody's going to say that the architecture design the auto body shop or somehow responsible
EDL	00:08:48,639	00:08:50,943	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	Are you at the car mechanics we just own it or no
EDL	00:08:51,455	00:08:53,503	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	This is Raphael Sperry but
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:54,015	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	When
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:55,807	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	Solitary confinement
EDL	00:08:56,319	00:08:59,647	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	I practice that requires a certain kind of space and when your
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:03,487	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	Specifying the space exactly for that and making sure
EDL	00:09:03,487	00:09:08,095	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	And all the doors can be operated without you know seeing another human being that the outdoor space
EDL	00:09:08,095	00:09:10,655	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	This is going to be one that occupied by one person at a time
EDL	00:09:10,655	00:09:11,423	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	There's nowhere
EDL	00:09:11,935	00:09:13,215	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	What group of people tax
EDL	00:09:13,215	00:09:14,239	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	Be together
EDL	00:09:14,239	00:09:14,751	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	What happened
EDL	00:09:15,263	00:09:16,287	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	Then that is
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:17,311	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	It's the design at 10
EDL	00:09:17,311	00:09:18,847	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	When used as intended
EDL	00:09:18,847	00:09:20,895	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	Human rights violations will result
EDL	00:09:20,895	00:09:23,967	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	Raphael Sperry is an architect here in San Francisco
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:29,855	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	And he's the president of a group called a DPS are Architects designers and planners for social responsibility
EDL	00:09:30,367	00:09:34,463	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	A few years back Raphael have been following the news from Guantanamo Bay
EDL	00:09:34,463	00:09:37,023	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	And reading up on mass incarceration in the US
EDL	00:09:37,535	00:09:39,327	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	Not necessarily as an architect
EDL	00:09:39,327	00:09:42,399	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	Per se just as a civic-minded social justice oriented
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:42,911	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	Kind of guy
EDL	00:09:43,679	00:09:48,287	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	And then one day in 2010 he saw an article in the San Francisco Chronicle
EDL	00:09:48,287	00:09:49,567	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	About the we design
EDL	00:09:49,567	00:09:51,615	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	San Quentin prison in California
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:57,247	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	So yeah the chronicle actually ran a picture that was supplied by the Corrections Department that was the cad model
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:09:58,783	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	A kind of three-dimensional floor plan
EDL	00:09:59,807	00:10:01,599	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	The execution chamber
EDL	00:10:01,599	00:10:02,111	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	Suite of rooms
EDL	00:10:03,135	00:10:03,903	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	Sounds like
EDL	00:10:03,903	00:10:04,927	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	They're using the same tools
EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:06,207	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	That I use
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:07,231	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	To make
EDL	00:10:07,743	00:10:10,303	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	Residential additions for people to make schools
EDL	00:10:11,071	00:10:12,607	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	Only this product is going to kill people
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:13,375	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	That was totally
EDL	00:10:14,399	00:10:20,799	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	Seen the remodel of the death chamber was the catalyzing event but you could argue that there's a difference between designing a death room and does
EDL	00:10:20,799	00:10:21,567	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	Designing a shoe
EDL	00:10:22,335	00:10:27,455	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	But Sperry views both as a moral and in violation of the human rights that architect
EDL	00:10:27,455	00:10:28,223	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	Swear to uphold
EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:30,783	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	Raphael Sperry wants architect
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:33,855	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	Extend the profession of architecture as a whole at least in the US
EDL	00:10:34,367	00:10:37,951	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	To stop building shoes or any structures that are designed

EDL	00:10:42,303	00:10:42,815	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	People to death
EDL	00:10:43,583	00:10:49,471	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	He's not talking about all prisons or jails just the ones were isolation is baked into the physical structure
EDL	00:10:49,983	00:10:52,287	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	Like the AIA architect design shoe
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:53,567	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	At Pelican Bay prison
EDL	00:10:53,567	00:10:54,847	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	Pelican Bay State Prison is
EDL	00:10:54,847	00:10:57,919	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	Way up in Northern California near the Oregon border

EDL	00:11:05,855	00:11:08,671	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	And people who are seen to pose the greatest threat
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:09,695	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	The officers
EDL	00:11:09,695	00:11:10,207	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	Another inmate
EDL	00:11:10,719	00:11:14,815	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	It was modeled after prison in Arizona and has since inspired design
EDL	00:11:14,815	00:11:16,351	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	Other prisons across the country
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:18,655	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	Even buildings in Guantanamo Bay
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:24,543	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	Life the laws Nancy MacLean head corrections officer lieutenant

EDL	00:11:35,295	00:11:36,831	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	Is it is not just
EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:38,623	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	The design of it
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:39,391	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	But how it's managed
EDL	00:11:40,671	00:11:44,255	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	And historically Pelican Bay is is done a very good job of managing

EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:48,607	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	This
EDL	00:11:48,607	00:11:50,143	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	Prison was designed and built
EDL	00:11:50,143	00:11:50,911	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	To manage

EDL	00:12:11,903	00:12:13,695	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	Prison management could decide that Shu prisoners
EDL	00:12:14,207	00:12:20,351	| 99pi-0080-anarchitect-scode-1 |	Could be allowed to go outside of the building and secure gated area or the exercise yard could be repurposed as a communal.
