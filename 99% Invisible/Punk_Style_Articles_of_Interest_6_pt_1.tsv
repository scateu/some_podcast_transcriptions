EDL	00:33:20,128	00:33:21,152	| Punk_Style_Articles_of_Interest_6_pt_1 |	Let me know your thoughts
EDL	00:33:21,152	00:33:26,272	| Punk_Style_Articles_of_Interest_6_pt_1 |	I'm on Twitter at troubleman 1f and at articles of interest on Instagram
EDL	00:33:27,296	00:33:32,160	| Punk_Style_Articles_of_Interest_6_pt_1 |	And a final thought we're celebrating this podcast with a big clothing swap
EDL	00:33:32,160	00:33:38,560	| Punk_Style_Articles_of_Interest_6_pt_1 |	If you've never been to one of these before it's where a bunch of people gather somewhere and everyone brings their clothes that they don't want anymore
EDL	00:33:38,560	00:33:40,608	| Punk_Style_Articles_of_Interest_6_pt_1 |	And then trade them all up with each other for free
EDL	00:33:40,608	00:33:44,448	| Punk_Style_Articles_of_Interest_6_pt_1 |	I find it's the most sustainable and most interesting way to dress
EDL	00:33:44,448	00:33:47,264	| Punk_Style_Articles_of_Interest_6_pt_1 |	Consider throwing a clothing swap with your own sometime
EDL	00:33:47,776	00:33:49,312	| Punk_Style_Articles_of_Interest_6_pt_1 |	If you have to wear clothes anyway
EDL	00:33:49,312	00:33:49,824	| Punk_Style_Articles_of_Interest_6_pt_1 |	Right

EDL	00:34:18,752	00:34:23,616	| Punk_Style_Articles_of_Interest_6_pt_1 |	You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie
EDL	00:34:24,896	00:34:28,224	| Punk_Style_Articles_of_Interest_6_pt_1 |	What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath
EDL	00:34:28,224	00:34:32,320	| Punk_Style_Articles_of_Interest_6_pt_1 |	Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like a dad

EDL	00:34:55,616	00:34:59,968	| Punk_Style_Articles_of_Interest_6_pt_1 |	Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it
EDL	00:34:59,968	00:35:00,992	| Punk_Style_Articles_of_Interest_6_pt_1 |	Now
EDL	00:35:00,992	00:35:03,296	| Punk_Style_Articles_of_Interest_6_pt_1 |	I need to clear my name
EDL	00:35:03,296	00:35:09,184	| Punk_Style_Articles_of_Interest_6_pt_1 |	Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes to find them
