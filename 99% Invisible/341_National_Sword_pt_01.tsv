EDL	00:03:23,776	00:03:26,848	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	In 2016 when I was younger and things were simpler
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:28,640	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	I'm quite grasp
EDL	00:03:28,640	00:03:29,664	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	The simple fact
EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:34,016	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Actually recycling anyting
EDL	00:03:34,528	00:03:38,112	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Do not turning the paper into pulp or melting down the plastic and appellate

EDL	00:03:40,160	00:03:41,696	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Simply sorting and
EDL	00:03:41,696	00:03:42,976	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Cleaning all the materials
EDL	00:03:43,488	00:03:44,768	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	They were loading bales
EDL	00:03:44,768	00:03:46,560	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Clean recycling onto shipping container
EDL	00:03:47,072	00:03:51,168	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	So they could sell them to millswood then pulp the paper and melt the plastic
EDL	00:03:51,680	00:03:53,216	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	And I was just like okay cool
EDL	00:03:53,728	00:03:55,008	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	And left well enough alone
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:03:59,360	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	I just figured all those Mills and plants would always be there
EDL	00:03:59,360	00:04:00,384	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Wherever they were
EDL	00:04:00,384	00:04:01,920	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Waiting to accept our stuff
EDL	00:04:02,688	00:04:04,224	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	How could I have known
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:05,504	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	But in the near future
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:07,552	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	This Global Recycling system
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:08,832	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Would go off the rails
EDL	00:04:09,344	00:04:11,136	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	It happened right under our noses
EDL	00:04:11,648	00:04:12,672	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	And most people
EDL	00:04:12,672	00:04:14,464	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Macleamy don't marry recently
EDL	00:04:14,464	00:04:15,744	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Had no idea
EDL	00:04:16,256	00:04:19,327	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	The industry has been using the phrase the end of recycling as we know it
EDL	00:04:20,095	00:04:25,471	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Kate O'Neill is an associate professor in the department of environmental science policy and management at UC Berkeley
EDL	00:04:26,239	00:04:27,263	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	And she kinda freaked me out
EDL	00:04:27,775	00:04:30,591	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Yeah you know I would say for a lot of
EDL	00:04:30,591	00:04:33,407	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Stuff that we turn to the recycling it's not happening
EDL	00:04:34,175	00:04:36,223	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	A lot of recycling is no longer
EDL	00:04:36,735	00:04:38,271	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Actually getting recycled
EDL	00:04:38,783	00:04:41,855	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	The list of accepted materials are shrinking in some cities
EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:48,511	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Depending on where you live certain types of plastic are being collected anymore maybe certain kinds of paper or cardboard
EDL	00:04:49,023	00:04:50,303	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	In many communities
EDL	00:04:50,303	00:04:52,607	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Barack Obama sister picking up recycling
EDL	00:04:52,607	00:04:55,423	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Does in the general trash
EDL	00:04:55,935	00:04:57,471	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Even if they do collect it
EDL	00:04:57,471	00:05:00,031	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Without a hard time finding places to ship it
EDL	00:05:00,031	00:05:05,151	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Instead of making money selling recycling recycling companies are losing money on it
EDL	00:05:05,151	00:05:07,967	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Now that someone take it
EDL	00:05:07,967	00:05:12,831	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Skip the store it yes because they lost their biggest buyer
EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:19,231	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	The place America and much of Australia and Europe in Canada huge amount

EDL	00:05:20,255	00:05:26,143	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	This magical land where your empty plastic bottles in Old Soup cans went to be reincarnated
EDL	00:05:26,911	00:05:28,191	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Was China
EDL	00:05:28,191	00:05:29,471	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	They will taking most of the wealth
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:33,311	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	China has been taking most of the world scrap since about
EDL	00:05:33,311	00:05:36,639	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	2001 which is around the time China joined the World Trade Organization
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:40,479	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	That's only really ramped up selling Goods all over the world
EDL	00:05:40,479	00:05:42,015	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	In massive shipping containers
EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:43,295	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:05:43,295	00:05:45,343	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Rather than send the containers back empty
EDL	00:05:45,855	00:05:47,135	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	We sent them back
EDL	00:05:47,135	00:05:47,903	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Filled with
EDL	00:05:47,903	00:05:48,415	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Recycling
EDL	00:05:48,927	00:05:50,719	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Which was actually really cost-effective
EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:52,511	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	What's cheaper to ship
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:56,607	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Trip from California to China than California to even Arizona potentially
EDL	00:05:57,119	00:05:58,655	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	And the system seemed to work well
EDL	00:05:59,423	00:06:02,239	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Cities could subsidize their recycling pickup program
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:03,775	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	From the money they made
EDL	00:06:03,775	00:06:05,311	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Selling these materials to China
EDL	00:06:05,823	00:06:08,639	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	And then they didn't need to process the materials themselves
EDL	00:06:09,151	00:06:10,431	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Capitalism at work
EDL	00:06:10,431	00:06:12,991	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	We basically assholes we gave up on even trying to
EDL	00:06:13,503	00:06:15,807	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Improve infrastructure here because witches
EDL	00:06:15,807	00:06:16,319	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	China
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:18,111	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	And it seemed like a logical
EDL	00:06:18,879	00:06:21,951	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	As long as China kept wanting to buy a recycle
EDL	00:06:23,743	00:06:24,255	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	But then
EDL	00:06:25,023	00:06:27,839	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	China pulled a move that no one saw coming
EDL	00:06:28,863	00:06:30,655	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Operation National

EDL	00:08:49,919	00:08:51,711	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	A lot of work to do
EDL	00:08:51,711	00:08:56,319	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	I need more than enough stuff to recycle without taking on more from other countries
EDL	00:08:56,319	00:08:59,391	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	So they decided to stop accepting our recyclables
EDL	00:08:59,903	00:09:00,415	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	What I mean
EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:02,975	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Turn up it's a good move for them
EDL	00:09:03,487	00:09:06,559	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	I think China was no longer interested in being
EDL	00:09:06,559	00:09:08,095	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	But never really wanted to be but
EDL	00:09:08,095	00:09:10,911	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Felt like it was being seen as the garbage dump

EDL	00:09:53,919	00:09:55,711	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	And reading waste dive
EDL	00:09:55,711	00:09:57,759	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	It's like reading the news from the upside down
EDL	00:09:58,527	00:10:02,879	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	It's a parallel world where the things we do in the realm of the shiny and new
EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:04,415	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Are perfectly reflected
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:05,951	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	In the grimy and used
EDL	00:10:06,463	00:10:09,535	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Because we systems are affected by so many fans

EDL	00:10:16,191	00:10:17,983	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	It's a whole complex system
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:19,519	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Especially in the US
EDL	00:10:19,519	00:10:23,359	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Super complicated so more complicated than it ought to be
EDL	00:10:23,359	00:10:24,639	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	In the United States
EDL	00:10:24,639	00:10:26,431	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Recycling programs very
EDL	00:10:26,431	00:10:28,223	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Depending on individual cities
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:29,503	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Counties in States
EDL	00:10:29,503	00:10:30,783	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	We don't have a national
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:32,575	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Recycling policy other countries
EDL	00:10:32,575	00:10:34,623	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Dune the right away sir in the US we do not
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:37,951	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	So in the wake of national sword it's been up to
EDL	00:10:37,951	00:10:39,999	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Each individual recycling program
EDL	00:10:39,999	00:10:41,279	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Find new buyers
EDL	00:10:41,279	00:10:41,791	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Wherever they can
EDL	00:10:42,559	00:10:44,351	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Summer started selling the recyclables
EDL	00:10:44,351	00:10:45,119	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Southeast Asia
EDL	00:10:45,631	00:10:47,679	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Countries like Vietnam and Malaysia and Thailand
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:49,983	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Others are finding domestic Market
EDL	00:10:50,495	00:10:51,775	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	At least for certain material
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:56,383	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	With a woman with plastic and paper mills you know there's there are places in the US
EDL	00:10:56,383	00:10:58,943	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Descendants that will buy this material to making products
EDL	00:10:59,711	00:11:00,479	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	And so
EDL	00:11:00,991	00:11:05,343	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	With that in mind areas of the country that have an End Market and reasonable distance
EDL	00:11:05,855	00:11:06,623	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	They doing okay
EDL	00:11:07,391	00:11:11,999	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	And now there's a big push to invest more in domestic recycling infrastructure
EDL	00:11:11,999	00:11:12,767	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Which is good
EDL	00:11:12,767	00:11:14,815	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	There's over a dozen announcements of either
EDL	00:11:15,327	00:11:17,631	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	New expanded paper towels happening in the US
EDL	00:11:18,143	00:11:19,167	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	But here's the thing
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:23,519	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	All these new plastic glass and paper mills will not save us
EDL	00:11:24,287	00:11:27,359	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Because now they are getting so inundated with recyclables
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:31,711	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	That they're increasingly putting their own restrictions on what kind of materials they are willing to accept
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:36,575	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	And there's a good reason why all these places started turning away our recycling
EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:42,975	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	The stuff we've been sending them was too dirty so much of what we
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:48,863	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Throw into the recycling bin is filthy contaminated with liquids or food waste oil
EDL	00:11:49,375	00:11:52,703	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	And this kind of contamination just ruins material
EDL	00:11:52,703	00:11:59,103	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	So if you're the anal one in your house was renting the yogurt out of the yogurt containers before you throw them out you are right
EDL	00:11:59,103	00:12:00,127	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	You are doing it right
EDL	00:12:00,895	00:12:03,455	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	But most people haven't been doing it right
EDL	00:12:03,967	00:12:08,063	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	I've been pretty high in the Risen in the past 10 years or so
EDL	00:12:08,831	00:12:14,975	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	As a result a lot of the stuff we were throwing in the recycling bin was never truly recyclable material in the first place
EDL	00:12:15,487	00:12:16,511	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	It was just
EDL	00:12:16,511	00:12:17,023	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Trash
EDL	00:12:17,535	00:12:21,375	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	A lot of time it just ended up in landfill or incineration
EDL	00:12:24,191	00:12:27,263	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Operation national sword didn't create these problems
EDL	00:12:28,031	00:12:28,799	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	I just revealed them
EDL	00:12:29,567	00:12:30,591	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	And then through the back
EDL	00:12:31,615	00:12:32,383	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Well
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:33,663	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Mostly through them at the Murph
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:36,479	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	They're the ones with the heaps and heaps
EDL	00:12:36,479	00:12:38,015	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Useless recycling piling up
EDL	00:12:38,527	00:12:39,807	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Wondering where to put it
EDL	00:12:40,319	00:12:42,111	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	It's been a minute since we spoke last
EDL	00:12:42,623	00:12:44,159	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Happened

EDL	00:13:24,607	00:13:25,119	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Which means
EDL	00:13:25,631	00:13:27,935	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	They bought more Optical sorters
EDL	00:13:28,447	00:13:30,751	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	As we speak we're installing
EDL	00:13:30,751	00:13:31,519	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	State-of-the-art
EDL	00:13:32,031	00:13:33,567	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Optical sorters
EDL	00:13:33,567	00:13:34,591	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	In our plants
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:35,871	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	It came from France
EDL	00:13:36,383	00:13:37,919	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	They now have seven
EDL	00:13:37,919	00:13:40,735	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	High-speed computer-controlled Optical sorters
EDL	00:13:41,759	00:13:43,039	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Big machines
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:45,087	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Do the work that we don't want to do
EDL	00:13:45,855	00:13:52,255	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	But also the murph's want us there consumers to send them cleaner recycling which would make recycling
EDL	00:13:52,255	00:13:54,559	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Less expensive and more efficient for everyone
EDL	00:13:55,071	00:13:56,863	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	We're doing things to encourage
EDL	00:13:56,863	00:13:57,631	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	The public
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:13:58,143	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	To help us
EDL	00:13:58,655	00:14:00,447	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Make cleaner bales of recycle
EDL	00:14:00,447	00:14:06,847	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	And so we've launched a new initiative in October called better at the bin
EDL	00:14:06,847	00:14:09,407	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	All of us doing a better job at sorting are recyclable
EDL	00:14:09,919	00:14:10,943	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	We call this initiative
EDL	00:14:11,711	00:14:12,735	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Better at the Ben
EDL	00:14:13,503	00:14:14,783	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Recology postings
EDL	00:14:14,783	00:14:18,879	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	High production value videos on their social media and on better at the ben.com
EDL	00:14:19,391	00:14:22,463	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	To try to convince everyone to take these little steps to be better recyclers
EDL	00:14:23,231	00:14:26,559	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	A point hostel bottle or can get stuff in the recycling bin
EDL	00:14:26,559	00:14:28,351	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	The liquid can ruin the whole lot
EDL	00:14:29,887	00:14:32,191	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Remember reduce reuse recycle
EDL	00:14:32,191	00:14:33,727	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Somewhere along the way
EDL	00:14:33,727	00:14:38,079	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	We totally lost track of reduce and reuse and focused too much
EDL	00:14:38,079	00:14:39,359	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	On Recycle
EDL	00:14:39,359	00:14:41,151	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Refuse single-use plastic
EDL	00:14:42,431	00:14:48,575	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Plastic bags and plastic coffee cup lids don't buy plastic water bottles carry a metal water
EDL	00:14:49,087	00:14:49,599	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Replace
EDL	00:14:50,111	00:14:50,879	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Yes
EDL	00:14:50,879	00:14:52,671	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	This is 100% true
EDL	00:14:53,183	00:14:56,511	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	We definitely have got to get better about generating less waste
EDL	00:14:57,023	00:14:58,559	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	And cleaning what we do recycle
EDL	00:14:59,327	00:15:00,351	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	But this alone is
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:02,655	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Simplifying the real complexity of the problem
EDL	00:15:03,423	00:15:05,215	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	For example at the end of the interview
EDL	00:15:05,727	00:15:09,055	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Robert Reed pulled out a totally normal-looking tube of toothpaste
EDL	00:15:09,823	00:15:11,359	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	You can't recycle this container
EDL	00:15:11,871	00:15:15,967	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Do you still have the metal on the inside the soft plastic on the outside the hard plastic neck
EDL	00:15:15,967	00:15:19,039	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Can tap into residual toothpaste on the inside not to mention the
EDL	00:15:20,063	00:15:22,111	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Four five materials here
EDL	00:15:22,111	00:15:23,647	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Do they all go to landfills are in
EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:27,231	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	And then he pulled up the small aluminum can
EDL	00:15:27,999	00:15:30,047	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	And I'm opening it up and inside there's a
EDL	00:15:30,047	00:15:30,559	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Hake
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:32,351	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Toothpaste
EDL	00:15:32,351	00:15:33,119	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	What's a dry cake
EDL	00:15:33,631	00:15:36,191	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	It last for 45 days
EDL	00:15:36,959	00:15:38,751	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	And at the end of those 45 days
EDL	00:15:39,263	00:15:41,055	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	You just drop another cake
EDL	00:15:41,055	00:15:42,079	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Into
EDL	00:15:42,079	00:15:43,615	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	The aluminum jar
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:45,919	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	I mean can you buy them in the states
EDL	00:15:47,711	00:15:51,295	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	I haven't been able to find them in the states yet
EDL	00:15:51,295	00:15:52,319	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	This one
EDL	00:15:52,319	00:15:54,111	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Was purchased in
EDL	00:15:54,111	00:15:54,623	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	France
EDL	00:15:55,135	00:15:56,671	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	This struck me as
EDL	00:15:56,671	00:15:57,183	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Fairly ridiculous
EDL	00:15:57,951	00:15:58,719	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	How
EDL	00:15:58,719	00:16:01,791	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Are we supposed to buy cakes of toothpaste from France that we don't know exist
EDL	00:16:02,559	00:16:06,399	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	I don't like shipping toothpaste across the Atlantic is exactly environmentally friendly
EDL	00:16:07,423	00:16:07,935	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Again
EDL	00:16:08,447	00:16:11,263	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Absolutely true we need to get better at using less
EDL	00:16:11,263	00:16:13,823	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Recycling and researching what are local systems will except
EDL	00:16:14,591	00:16:15,103	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Definitely
EDL	00:16:15,871	00:16:16,383	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Like
EDL	00:16:17,151	00:16:19,199	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	We throw out a lot of junk
EDL	00:16:19,199	00:16:20,735	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Because we are sold
EDL	00:16:20,735	00:16:21,503	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	A lot of junk
EDL	00:16:22,783	00:16:23,807	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	So much
EDL	00:16:23,807	00:16:24,575	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Problem
EDL	00:16:24,575	00:16:27,391	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Is about the products we are sold and have access to
EDL	00:16:28,159	00:16:31,743	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	I just getting fed up with the way that we talk about our pollution problem
EDL	00:16:31,743	00:16:33,791	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Matt Wilkins is a biologist
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:37,375	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	You are a piece for Scientific American about our current recycling
EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:42,751	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	We should not have to fight as individuals against this constant onslaught of plastic
EDL	00:16:43,263	00:16:45,567	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Take for example the term litter box
EDL	00:16:45,567	00:16:47,103	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	You don't want to be a litterbug right
EDL	00:16:47,615	00:16:49,151	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	The problem
EDL	00:16:49,151	00:16:51,967	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	It's not the fact that we have this unfettered production of
EDL	00:16:51,967	00:16:56,575	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Billions of containers happening at all times and no infrastructure to reclaim this
EDL	00:16:56,575	00:16:57,343	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Materials
EDL	00:16:57,343	00:16:58,623	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	And that nickname
EDL	00:16:58,623	00:16:59,135	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Litterbug
EDL	00:16:59,647	00:17:01,951	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	It was popularized in large part
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:04,511	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	My group called keep America beautiful
EDL	00:17:04,511	00:17:07,327	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Lobbying group keep America beautiful
EDL	00:17:07,327	00:17:08,351	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Founded by
EDL	00:17:08,351	00:17:09,375	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Pepsi and Coke
EDL	00:17:09,375	00:17:10,911	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	And Philip Morris
EDL	00:17:10,911	00:17:11,935	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Among others
EDL	00:17:12,447	00:17:15,263	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Keep America beautiful was formed in 1953
EDL	00:17:16,031	00:17:19,615	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Around the same time Vermont was creating legislation way ahead of its time
EDL	00:17:20,127	00:17:24,223	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	It would have made it illegal to bottle anything in a non-refillable container
EDL	00:17:24,735	00:17:25,503	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Of course
EDL	00:17:25,503	00:17:27,039	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	The beverage industry was against it
EDL	00:17:27,551	00:17:29,599	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	They wanted to frame the problem of waste
EDL	00:17:29,599	00:17:31,135	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	A something that should be dealt with
EDL	00:17:31,135	00:17:32,159	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Not by companies
EDL	00:17:32,671	00:17:33,695	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	But by consumers
EDL	00:17:34,463	00:17:35,231	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	You know
EDL	00:17:35,231	00:17:35,743	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Schlitterbahn
EDL	00:17:37,023	00:17:39,327	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Keep America beautiful was essentially a lobbying group
EDL	00:17:39,839	00:17:41,375	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	But it's masterstroke
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:43,935	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	In consumer Shaymin came in 1971
EDL	00:17:44,447	00:17:45,215	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	When they rolled out
EDL	00:17:45,727	00:17:46,239	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	A very
EDL	00:17:46,751	00:17:47,263	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Persuasive
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:49,055	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Advertising campaign
EDL	00:17:49,823	00:17:50,847	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Yeah the crying
EDL	00:17:50,847	00:17:51,871	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Indian ad
EDL	00:17:51,871	00:17:52,639	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Was
EDL	00:17:53,407	00:17:59,807	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Basically they're there is a Native American canoeing through like a pristine Forest which is apparently right next
EDL	00:17:59,807	00:18:00,319	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Dual Highway
EDL	00:18:00,831	00:18:01,855	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	And he
EDL	00:18:02,367	00:18:08,767	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	He paddles right up to the bank of the highway and climbs out and then people are speeding by and then
EDL	00:18:08,767	00:18:13,119	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Motorists Life as we had some with a bag of trash and then the camera pans up
EDL	00:18:13,119	00:18:14,911	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	There's a tear rolling down his
EDL	00:18:14,911	00:18:15,423	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Cheek
EDL	00:18:15,935	00:18:16,959	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	The sad witch
EDL	00:18:18,239	00:18:20,799	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Featured an Italian actor playing a Native American
EDL	00:18:20,799	00:18:22,079	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Became iconic
EDL	00:18:22,847	00:18:26,687	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	But it's basic lesson wasn't exactly wrong
EDL	00:18:33,599	00:18:35,135	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	But the ad made it seem that
EDL	00:18:35,135	00:18:37,183	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	The longest consumer stop littering
EDL	00:18:37,183	00:18:38,975	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	All of our garbage Rosewood besaw
EDL	00:18:39,743	00:18:40,767	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Which of course is not true
EDL	00:18:41,535	00:18:45,375	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	It let the corporations that we're making all those disposable items off the hook
EDL	00:18:46,143	00:18:49,215	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Although to be fair this is not exactly their stance anymore
EDL	00:18:49,215	00:18:51,775	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Only a few years after the crying Indian ad
EDL	00:18:51,775	00:18:54,335	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Keep America beautiful change their tune
EDL	00:18:54,335	00:18:55,871	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	So they actively
EDL	00:18:56,383	00:19:01,247	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Bought this legislation in a public way I think up until the early 80s
EDL	00:19:01,247	00:19:02,783	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	And then they kind of switch tactics
EDL	00:19:02,783	00:19:05,087	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	And have basically since then
EDL	00:19:05,087	00:19:08,415	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Just been kind of getting in on the Earth Day push and
EDL	00:19:08,415	00:19:10,463	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	You're telling people to recycle and
EDL	00:19:10,463	00:19:12,255	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Organizing cleanups and stuff
EDL	00:19:12,255	00:19:14,815	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Representatives from keep America beautiful told me that
EDL	00:19:14,815	00:19:16,095	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	They now advocate
EDL	00:19:16,095	00:19:16,863	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Recycling legislation
EDL	00:19:17,375	00:19:19,423	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	And that their corporate Partners want to do their part
EDL	00:19:20,703	00:19:21,215	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Jesus

EDL	00:19:29,151	00:19:30,431	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	A very public way

EDL	00:19:54,495	00:19:58,591	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Which is why we are thrilled to have representatives from nearly every aspect
EDL	00:19:58,591	00:20:00,127	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Of the materials economy
EDL	00:20:00,127	00:20:01,663	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Gathered here today
EDL	00:20:01,663	00:20:03,455	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	At this little round table
EDL	00:20:03,455	00:20:06,015	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	All the biggest names in the recycling world
EDL	00:20:06,527	00:20:08,319	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	From Waste Management to Walmart

EDL	00:20:19,583	00:20:20,607	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Covering it for waste.
EDL	00:20:21,119	00:20:25,727	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Tennessee Phi Beta be so flippant about that maybe it does
EDL	00:20:26,239	00:20:27,263	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Happy quote
EDL	00:20:27,263	00:20:33,151	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Basically each representative had like less than one minute to speak and everyone mentioned a million different problems with our recycling system
EDL	00:20:34,431	00:20:34,943	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	But
EDL	00:20:35,711	00:20:36,991	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	There was a butterfly
EDL	00:20:36,991	00:20:38,015	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	At the bottom of Pandora's Box
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:42,623	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	The common refrain at companies recyclers and municipalities alike
EDL	00:20:43,391	00:20:44,671	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	All mentioned
EDL	00:20:44,671	00:20:50,815	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Consumers look for us to give them sustainable products
EDL	00:20:51,327	00:20:52,095	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Design the right way
EDL	00:20:53,887	00:20:58,239	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Yes dear listener one of the most important solutions to our recycling woes
EDL	00:20:58,239	00:21:00,031	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Actually laying
EDL	00:21:00,543	00:21:01,055	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Design
EDL	00:21:02,079	00:21:08,479	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	At the EPA meeting the representatives from Procter & Gamble talked about their award-winning container made out of plastic
EDL	00:21:08,479	00:21:08,991	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Cleaned up from the beach
EDL	00:21:09,503	00:21:13,087	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	What we do with a head and shoulders bottle as we took the iconic white bottle
EDL	00:21:13,087	00:21:15,903	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Will use plastic collected from beaches
EDL	00:21:15,903	00:21:17,184	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	And it became Gray
EDL	00:21:17,696	00:21:19,744	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	But we sold it that way and consumers bought it
EDL	00:21:20,512	00:21:23,072	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Okay so this was a limited edition product
EDL	00:21:23,072	00:21:24,352	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	And I could you not
EDL	00:21:24,352	00:21:25,888	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Is only available in France
EDL	00:21:26,400	00:21:27,424	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Dammit France
EDL	00:21:27,424	00:21:28,192	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	But
EDL	00:21:28,192	00:21:28,704	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Appointed
EDL	00:21:29,472	00:21:31,520	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	That kind of packaging is possible
EDL	00:21:32,288	00:21:34,336	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	These companies have the capacity
EDL	00:21:34,336	00:21:35,104	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	And the technology
EDL	00:21:36,128	00:21:37,152	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Wechat ask for it
EDL	00:21:37,920	00:21:42,016	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	I think another thing that we can do is demand better design of
EDL	00:21:42,528	00:21:43,296	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Everything
EDL	00:21:43,296	00:21:44,064	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	With
EDL	00:21:44,064	00:21:45,344	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	The end of life
EDL	00:21:45,344	00:21:46,368	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Planned from the beginning
EDL	00:21:46,880	00:21:48,928	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Matt Wilkins the biologist again
EDL	00:21:48,928	00:21:51,232	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	And better design Camina couple of things
EDL	00:21:52,000	00:21:56,864	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Jessica means finding new ways to use recycled materials like that gray Head and Shoulders bottle
EDL	00:21:56,864	00:21:59,936	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Or at the very least it can be making products
EDL	00:21:59,936	00:22:01,472	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Really easy and efficient
EDL	00:22:01,984	00:22:03,008	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	To recycle
EDL	00:22:03,008	00:22:04,800	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Everything should be able to
EDL	00:22:04,800	00:22:07,616	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Break down into its composite materials and separate them
EDL	00:22:07,616	00:22:11,200	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	In a way that doesn't introduce impurities so they can be used to
EDL	00:22:11,968	00:22:15,040	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	And designers can and should visit murph's and Mills
EDL	00:22:15,552	00:22:18,368	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	They should know how their products and packaging sort
EDL	00:22:18,368	00:22:18,880	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Weirdo
EDL	00:22:19,648	00:22:20,928	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	What is a breakdown
EDL	00:22:20,928	00:22:21,696	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Or don't break down
EDL	00:22:22,208	00:22:25,280	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Designers can also use biodegradable materials
EDL	00:22:25,280	00:22:28,096	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Or materials like aluminum that recycle more easily than plastic
EDL	00:22:29,120	00:22:30,144	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	The ideal thing
EDL	00:22:30,656	00:22:31,936	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Is to design products
EDL	00:22:32,448	00:22:33,216	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Or even parts
EDL	00:22:33,216	00:22:33,728	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	The products
EDL	00:22:34,240	00:22:37,056	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	But don't need to be thrown away at all
EDL	00:22:37,056	00:22:38,336	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	The sound
EDL	00:22:39,360	00:22:40,640	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	And that you design
EDL	00:22:40,640	00:22:42,176	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Things that can be repaired
EDL	00:22:42,176	00:22:43,200	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Let your toothbrushes
EDL	00:22:43,968	00:22:46,528	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Yeah
EDL	00:22:47,040	00:22:48,576	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Cell phone
EDL	00:22:48,576	00:22:51,392	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	That you can swap components in and out of
EDL	00:22:51,392	00:22:53,696	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	The Berkeley Professor Kate O'Neill says yes
EDL	00:22:54,208	00:22:56,256	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Companies have to design Greener products
EDL	00:22:57,024	00:23:00,352	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	But then the next step is that this shouldn't just be specialty items
EDL	00:23:00,864	00:23:02,400	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	That should be the norm
EDL	00:23:02,400	00:23:05,216	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	I guess people have the label on it so people who are
EDL	00:23:05,216	00:23:06,752	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Environmentally conscious will buy it
EDL	00:23:07,776	00:23:10,592	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Turns out it might mean the people who don't care what by
EDL	00:23:11,360	00:23:14,688	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	What do it seems like a kind of paradox where were saying like
EDL	00:23:14,688	00:23:20,320	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	You know don't blame the consumer there's a whole world of influences but also like it's up to us
EDL	00:23:20,832	00:23:23,136	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	To harness the power of capitalism
EDL	00:23:23,136	00:23:27,488	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	And to send the market to our our will as as people who
EDL	00:23:27,488	00:23:28,256	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	We spend money
EDL	00:23:28,256	00:23:32,352	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Yep which also it would also seems like it's putting the onus kind of back on the consumer now
EDL	00:23:32,864	00:23:34,656	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Welsummers that was a thing
EDL	00:23:34,656	00:23:36,704	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Not just consumers but how we Act
EDL	00:23:36,704	00:23:37,472	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	The citizens
EDL	00:23:39,008	00:23:39,520	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	So listen
EDL	00:23:40,288	00:23:42,336	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	In the course of researching the story
EDL	00:23:42,336	00:23:43,616	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	I had various freak-outs
EDL	00:23:44,640	00:23:48,224	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	At one point I was defiantly tossing my aluminum cans in the trash like
EDL	00:23:48,224	00:23:50,272	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Wake up sheeple recycling isn't real
EDL	00:23:51,552	00:23:52,320	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	True
EDL	00:23:53,344	00:23:54,112	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Don't do what I did
EDL	00:23:55,136	00:23:56,160	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Instead
EDL	00:23:56,160	00:23:56,928	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Ask around
EDL	00:23:57,440	00:24:00,256	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	And find out what is happening to the recycling where you live
EDL	00:24:01,536	00:24:04,864	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	This is a system that has been kept deliberately invisible
EDL	00:24:04,864	00:24:06,144	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	For the sake of our convenience
EDL	00:24:06,912	00:24:08,192	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	We need to learn how to notice it
EDL	00:24:08,704	00:24:09,984	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Really think
EDL	00:24:10,496	00:24:12,288	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	About how our stuff is made
EDL	00:24:13,568	00:24:14,080	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Going
EDL	00:24:14,592	00:24:15,360	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	When we throw it
EDL	00:24:15,872	00:24:16,640	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Away
EDL	00:24:17,664	00:24:20,992	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Operation national sword could be a wake-up call
EDL	00:24:21,504	00:24:23,296	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	But only if everyone
EDL	00:24:23,808	00:24:24,320	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Can hear it
EDL	00:24:33,280	00:24:39,680	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Okay you might be skeptical that design can really make a difference and recycling but I assure you it can not just product
EDL	00:24:39,680	00:24:41,472	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Design but systems design
EDL	00:24:41,984	00:24:43,520	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Take for example Taipei
EDL	00:24:43,520	00:24:44,800	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	The capital of Taiwan
EDL	00:24:44,800	00:24:48,896	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	They became one of the cleanest cities in the world in only a few years
EDL	00:24:48,896	00:24:49,664	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	By using
EDL	00:24:50,176	00:24:51,712	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Singing garbage trucks
EDL	00:24:52,224	00:24:53,248	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	MapleStory
EDL	00:24:53,760	00:24:54,528	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	After this
EDL	00:25:03,488	00:25:04,512	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Between the beats
EDL	00:25:04,512	00:25:06,816	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Bongs and chatter of our devices
EDL	00:25:06,816	00:25:10,144	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	We're immersed in a cluttered world of man made sound
EDL	00:25:10,656	00:25:11,424	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	If
EDL	00:25:11,424	00:25:17,824	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife isn't
EDL	00:25:17,824	00:25:21,920	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	All hearing. Voice
EDL	00:25:21,920	00:25:22,688	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Technology
EDL	00:25:22,688	00:25:23,200	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	She talked to us
EDL	00:25:23,968	00:25:25,504	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	It is a creation of Sonic trash
EDL	00:25:26,016	00:25:28,832	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	That's Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer
EDL	00:25:28,832	00:25:32,416	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology
EDL	00:25:32,416	00:25:33,952	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	To make them more human
EDL	00:25:36,768	00:25:38,048	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Turn the living room lights on
EDL	00:25:39,328	00:25:39,840	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Okay
EDL	00:25:40,352	00:25:42,400	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Dim the living room lights to 50%
EDL	00:25:43,680	00:25:44,448	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Okay
EDL	00:25:44,960	00:25:50,848	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

EDL	00:26:41,280	00:26:44,352	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Written by Ludwig van Beethoven in 1810
EDL	00:26:44,352	00:26:48,192	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Maybe it reminds you of piano lessons you took when you were a kid
EDL	00:26:48,192	00:26:52,032	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	In my town it was also the song the ice cream truck used to play
EDL	00:26:53,312	00:26:55,360	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	That's pretty sure Avery truffle
EDL	00:26:56,128	00:26:57,664	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	But if you live in Taiwan
EDL	00:26:57,664	00:27:00,480	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	And you hear a truck rumbling down the street playing Fearless
EDL	00:27:00,992	00:27:03,040	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	It doesn't mean it's time to buy a popsicle

EDL	00:27:21,472	00:27:24,288	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Although it is also supposed to be cute and fun
EDL	00:27:24,288	00:27:25,824	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	The singing garbage trucks
EDL	00:27:25,824	00:27:32,224	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Are all a part of a completely different way of thinking about waste disposal completely different.
EDL	00:27:32,224	00:27:35,808	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	That is from the way that we think about it in the United States
EDL	00:27:35,808	00:27:39,392	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	In the late 1990s Taiwan recycled only 5% of its waste

EDL	00:27:45,536	00:27:50,144	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	And what changed in this. Has a lot to do with the way that the trash is collected
EDL	00:27:51,936	00:27:55,264	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Okay Fearless isn't the only song the trucks play
EDL	00:27:55,264	00:27:57,568	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	In Taipei the capital of Taiwan the trucks

EDL	00:28:28,800	00:28:30,080	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Since I was a child
EDL	00:28:30,080	00:28:32,384	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	I knew that every time when the garbage truck
EDL	00:28:32,896	00:28:35,968	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Cubs
EDL	00:28:35,968	00:28:40,576	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Now the singing garbage trucks are such a part of life it's hard to imagine a time before then
EDL	00:28:41,088	00:28:43,648	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	But that time actually wasn't too long ago
EDL	00:28:43,648	00:28:46,720	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	We used to have a lot of a big dumpster
EDL	00:28:46,720	00:28:50,816	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	So there was a lot of rats mosquitoes and
EDL	00:28:50,816	00:28:52,864	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Despite that and it's not good for our house
EDL	00:28:53,376	00:28:59,008	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Just a couple of decades ago type a residence through their trash into massive smelly dumpsters on the street
EDL	00:28:59,520	00:29:02,336	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Garbage would end up in piles on the sidewalk and then Park

EDL	00:29:04,384	00:29:05,664	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	It was just nasty
EDL	00:29:05,664	00:29:09,504	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Then taiwan's democratization accelerated in the mid-1980s
EDL	00:29:09,504	00:29:11,808	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	And created this desire to tidy up
EDL	00:29:12,320	00:29:15,136	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Modern country means being a clean country
EDL	00:29:15,136	00:29:19,488	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	And when you have foreign visitors coming and visiting your Capital they shouldn't think

EDL	00:32:47,616	00:32:50,688	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Who can help instruct you about which item goes where
EDL	00:32:51,456	00:32:56,320	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	So Aaron her housemates and I got all of her bags of trash and different kinds of recycling sorted out
EDL	00:32:56,832	00:32:59,904	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	And then we walked about a block down the street to wait with the rest of her neighbor
EDL	00:33:00,672	00:33:02,976	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Who are all clutching official blue garbage
EDL	00:33:03,488	00:33:04,768	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Quite a lot of people gathered
EDL	00:33:05,280	00:33:06,560	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Genesis Maybe
EDL	00:33:06,560	00:33:08,096	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Larger than your average
EDL	00:33:09,120	00:33:09,888	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Then
EDL	00:33:09,888	00:33:11,424	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	The moment we were waiting for
EDL	00:33:14,240	00:33:20,384	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	There was this Mad Dash of people swarming to the school bus yellow garbage
EDL	00:33:20,896	00:33:22,176	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	And the white recycling truck
EDL	00:33:22,688	00:33:25,504	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Okay that's not passing it in
EDL	00:33:26,016	00:33:31,648	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Swiftly tossing their separate recyclables in the bins tossing their blue bags and the garbage truck and running away
EDL	00:33:32,160	00:33:33,184	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	It was Madness
EDL	00:33:33,184	00:33:33,952	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Like
EDL	00:33:33,952	00:33:36,000	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Greenlee well-organized Madness
EDL	00:33:36,000	00:33:37,024	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	I was so chaotic
EDL	00:33:37,536	00:33:40,608	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	And this system for all its chaos has been working
EDL	00:33:40,608	00:33:45,216	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Taipei City used to produce 3296 tons of trash a day
EDL	00:33:45,728	00:33:48,288	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Today the city produces about 1000
EDL	00:33:48,800	00:33:51,104	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	What's a day that is according to Chadwick
EDL	00:33:51,872	00:33:53,408	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	When it's 65 official
EDL	00:33:53,408	00:33:54,944	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Who supervised the garbage trucks
EDL	00:33:54,944	00:33:55,456	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	And the rocks
EDL	00:33:55,968	00:33:57,504	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	I met him at a garbage pickups
EDL	00:33:58,016	00:34:00,576	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Where Jasmine Wong acted as interpreter
EDL	00:34:01,088	00:34:07,232	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Eveready listen to mr. 10 and he's his supervisor
EDL	00:34:08,512	00:34:12,352	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	In his district 10 overseas 20 garbage truck routes
EDL	00:34:12,352	00:34:16,448	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	And all those trucks have to make sure that citizens are sorting properly
EDL	00:34:16,448	00:34:20,544	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	If it's a fly the garbage tree in the recycling bag
EDL	00:34:20,544	00:34:24,384	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	The people here will tell them that you cannot do that
EDL	00:34:24,896	00:34:27,712	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	One more Thai otherwise see you I get tickets
EDL	00:34:27,712	00:34:33,856	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	And how much is the ticket 200 US dollars
EDL	00:34:34,880	00:34:35,904	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	You might think
EDL	00:34:35,904	00:34:37,440	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	This is such a drag
EDL	00:34:37,440	00:34:41,536	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	There must be some people who Buck the system by tossing their trash into public trash can
EDL	00:34:42,304	00:34:45,376	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Well there are hardly any public trash cans in Taipei
EDL	00:34:45,888	00:34:48,192	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	They're only in train stations or at bus stop
EDL	00:34:48,704	00:34:49,728	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	And those are little
EDL	00:34:49,728	00:34:51,008	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Play come up just below your knees
EDL	00:34:51,520	00:34:53,312	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	So in Taipei for the most part
EDL	00:34:53,312	00:34:55,360	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	If you eat a candy or buy a coffee
EDL	00:34:55,360	00:34:56,640	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	You just take your empty coffee
EDL	00:34:57,152	00:34:58,176	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Candy wrapper
EDL	00:34:58,688	00:35:00,224	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Put in your pocket and bring it home
EDL	00:35:00,736	00:35:01,504	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Your trash
EDL	00:35:02,016	00:35:03,808	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	That you put in your blue bag
EDL	00:35:03,808	00:35:04,832	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	I can bring out to the truck
EDL	00:35:05,600	00:35:06,112	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Yourself
EDL	00:35:07,136	00:35:09,952	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	It's hard to imagine a system like this working here in the US
EDL	00:35:10,464	00:35:13,536	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Every city here has a different method of trash pickup
EDL	00:35:13,536	00:35:14,560	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	But across-the-board
EDL	00:35:14,560	00:35:19,424	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Uniting factor is that our American trash pickup system strive to be invisible
EDL	00:35:20,448	00:35:25,056	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	The trucks made great efforts to come when we're working or sleeping or trying to sleep
EDL	00:35:25,568	00:35:29,152	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Keeping out of the way of traffic and not disturbing the flow of the city
EDL	00:35:29,664	00:35:34,784	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	We take our trash and recycling out to Benz or down the Chute or to a dumpster
EDL	00:35:34,784	00:35:36,320	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	And it's gone
EDL	00:35:36,320	00:35:37,344	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	We don't have to think about
EDL	00:35:38,112	00:35:39,392	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	According to the EPA
EDL	00:35:39,392	00:35:42,976	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Americans recycle and compost about 34% of their trash
EDL	00:35:43,744	00:35:45,280	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Which is less than most rich country
EDL	00:35:46,304	00:35:48,096	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	But some American cities
EDL	00:35:48,096	00:35:48,864	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Do a lot better
EDL	00:35:49,632	00:35:51,168	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	San Francisco has
EDL	00:35:51,168	00:35:52,448	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Probably the most forward
EDL	00:35:52,448	00:35:55,776	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Recycling program in North America this is Robert Reed
EDL	00:35:55,776	00:35:57,568	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Is the representative of Recology
EDL	00:35:58,080	00:36:01,152	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	The company that takes care of San Francisco's waste recycling and comp
EDL	00:36:01,920	00:36:05,248	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Unlike type A which has a public trash pickup system
EDL	00:36:05,248	00:36:08,576	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Mini waste pickup services in the US are private companies
EDL	00:36:08,576	00:36:09,856	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	And we are the customers
EDL	00:36:10,368	00:36:12,672	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	That's how it works with ecology which means
EDL	00:36:12,672	00:36:14,720	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	They got to keep their customers happy
EDL	00:36:14,720	00:36:16,000	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Number one Focus
EDL	00:36:16,512	00:36:17,536	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Provide Superior

EDL	00:36:20,864	00:36:22,400	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Do as much recycling is
EDL	00:36:22,400	00:36:23,168	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Is possible
EDL	00:36:23,168	00:36:25,984	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	And to make recycling easy and convenient
EDL	00:36:25,984	00:36:26,752	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	For customers
EDL	00:36:26,752	00:36:28,032	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Recology has set up
EDL	00:36:28,032	00:36:30,080	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Similar incentives to the system in Taipei
EDL	00:36:30,592	00:36:33,920	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	What trash pickup is way more expensive than recycling or compost
EDL	00:36:34,944	00:36:36,480	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	For example in San Francisco
EDL	00:36:36,480	00:36:39,808	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Recycling and compost cost about $2 a month
EDL	00:36:39,808	00:36:40,576	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Corbin
EDL	00:36:40,576	00:36:42,624	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Trash is about $26 a month
EDL	00:36:43,904	00:36:45,184	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Above all
EDL	00:36:45,184	00:36:46,976	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Ecology system is meant to be
EDL	00:36:46,976	00:36:47,744	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Simple
EDL	00:36:47,744	00:36:48,256	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	And stress
EDL	00:36:49,024	00:36:49,536	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	It has to
EDL	00:36:50,048	00:36:51,072	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	If you want people to keep
EDL	00:36:51,072	00:36:51,840	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Paying for your service
EDL	00:36:52,352	00:36:53,120	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	People
EDL	00:36:53,120	00:36:56,704	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	I have a lot of demands in their lives we understand that you don't
EDL	00:36:56,704	00:36:59,520	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Recycling might not be the very first thing they got the guy
EDL	00:36:59,520	00:37:01,824	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Make the boss happy to go to pay their mortgage
EDL	00:37:01,824	00:37:04,896	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Garbage and recycling and composting might not always be the top of the list
EDL	00:37:05,408	00:37:06,432	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	We understand that
EDL	00:37:06,432	00:37:12,832	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Basically instead of putting the onus on the citizens to separate the different kinds of compost and recycling for themselves
EDL	00:37:12,832	00:37:14,624	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Recology does the brunt of the work
EDL	00:37:15,136	00:37:16,672	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Sorting so we don't have to
EDL	00:37:17,440	00:37:21,280	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	San Francisco like a lot of other American cities that collect recycling
EDL	00:37:21,280	00:37:23,584	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Uses one catch-all recycling bin
EDL	00:37:24,096	00:37:27,424	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	So you tell your cans or bottles are cardboard all in the same place
EDL	00:37:28,192	00:37:31,520	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	And then all those different materials end up in a facility
EDL	00:37:31,520	00:37:32,800	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Like recycle center
EDL	00:37:34,080	00:37:35,360	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Recycle Central
EDL	00:37:36,896	00:37:37,664	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Large
EDL	00:37:37,664	00:37:39,712	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Recycling plant on pier 96
EDL	00:37:40,736	00:37:43,808	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Where we sort all the materials from the blue bin to bottle
EDL	00:37:43,808	00:37:44,576	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Cans with paper
EDL	00:37:46,368	00:37:47,904	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Going to go inside now
EDL	00:37:49,184	00:37:50,464	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	The facility is massive
EDL	00:37:50,976	00:37:54,048	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	That's where ecology process is most of San Francisco's recycle
EDL	00:37:56,352	00:37:57,120	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Scrapy
EDL	00:37:57,120	00:37:58,912	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Pile of recycling
EDL	00:37:58,912	00:37:59,680	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	This is
EDL	00:37:59,680	00:38:00,704	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	From this morning
EDL	00:38:01,472	00:38:02,240	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	From one day
EDL	00:38:02,752	00:38:03,776	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	And we're going to get the
EDL	00:38:03,776	00:38:04,544	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Started out
EDL	00:38:05,056	00:38:06,336	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Because we got another big
EDL	00:38:06,336	00:38:09,152	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Pyle coming in tomorrow so we do 600
EDL	00:38:09,152	00:38:09,664	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Tons a day here
EDL	00:38:10,176	00:38:14,016	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	That 600 ton pile will wind its way up a huge
EDL	00:38:14,016	00:38:15,552	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Surreal web of conveyor belt
EDL	00:38:16,064	00:38:22,464	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Where some of the 173 people on staff will separate the recyclables into 16 categories
EDL	00:38:22,464	00:38:22,976	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Materials
EDL	00:38:23,488	00:38:25,536	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	With the help of some Modern Recycling equip
EDL	00:38:26,304	00:38:31,680	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	So we've got a magnet's and we have fish ladders that separate bottles and cans
EDL	00:38:32,192	00:38:32,704	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Sandpaper
EDL	00:38:33,216	00:38:36,032	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	They're on their on an angle and they temporarily
EDL	00:38:36,032	00:38:37,056	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Suspend gravity
EDL	00:38:37,056	00:38:42,176	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Make sure everything gets precisely sorted there's some real state-of-the-art technology
EDL	00:38:42,176	00:38:46,016	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Like this apparatus that separates clear plastic from color plastic with

EDL	00:38:47,552	00:38:48,320	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	Rainier

EDL	00:38:58,304	00:38:59,072	| 341_National_Sword_pt_01 |	And you can hear it
