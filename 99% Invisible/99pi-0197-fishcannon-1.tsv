EDL	00:02:28,480	00:02:30,528	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	It's what's known as a wildlife corridor
EDL	00:02:31,296	00:02:37,696	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Wildlife corridors can link to extremely large habitats like to National Parks or to National Forest

EDL	00:02:51,008	00:02:56,640	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	She's chair of the Department of landscape architecture and environmental planning at the University of California Berkeley
EDL	00:02:57,408	00:02:58,432	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	And she says
EDL	00:02:58,432	00:03:03,040	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	The wildlife Corridor doesn't have to be a massive Greenway for Europe
EDL	00:03:03,040	00:03:05,344	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Tubidy is something as simple as our
EDL	00:03:05,344	00:03:09,440	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Concrete pipe or a small kind of vegetated ditch under
EDL	00:03:09,440	00:03:10,464	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Freeway
EDL	00:03:10,464	00:03:14,304	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Wildlife corridors might be the most critical in urban areas
EDL	00:03:14,816	00:03:15,584	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Because
EDL	00:03:15,584	00:03:20,192	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Sprawling cities and highways have fragmented a lot of wildlife habitat
EDL	00:03:20,704	00:03:23,008	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	And if forced animals into isolated pockets
EDL	00:03:23,776	00:03:24,544	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	What is the problem
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:26,848	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Because animals need to move around
EDL	00:03:26,848	00:03:28,640	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	In order to find different food sources
EDL	00:03:30,176	00:03:32,736	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	In Southern California in abandoned highway underpass
EDL	00:03:33,248	00:03:37,600	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Began to link two important pieces of habitat in an otherwise industrial area
EDL	00:03:38,880	00:03:40,672	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	What they found is that
EDL	00:03:40,672	00:03:45,792	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Both of these habitats zones actually were able to support much larger populations than expected
EDL	00:03:45,792	00:03:46,816	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Because this
EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:49,632	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Relatively small concrete underpass
EDL	00:03:49,632	00:03:52,192	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Was able to connect the two habitats ranges
EDL	00:03:52,704	00:03:53,984	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	And so you had
EDL	00:03:53,984	00:03:58,080	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Even very large a predator species like mountain lions being able to be seen
EDL	00:03:58,080	00:03:58,848	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Supported
EDL	00:03:58,848	00:03:59,616	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Buy these
EDL	00:03:59,616	00:04:02,944	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Fragments of habitat in a very urbanized situation
EDL	00:04:04,480	00:04:07,808	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Today the abandoned underpasses purposely protected
EDL	00:04:08,320	00:04:10,112	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	And maintained as a wildlife corridor
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:14,208	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	But Wildlife corridors don't technically have to be court ordered
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:19,583	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	They can be any piece of design the facilitators the safe passage of animals through the human built environment
EDL	00:04:20,095	00:04:22,143	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	From one piece of habitat to another
EDL	00:04:22,655	00:04:23,423	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	And they're not
EDL	00:04:23,423	00:04:25,727	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Always a product of accident and neglect
EDL	00:04:26,495	00:04:28,031	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Sometimes they're very intention
EDL	00:04:28,543	00:04:29,567	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	And carefully designed
EDL	00:04:30,079	00:04:36,479	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	One of the oldest examples of humans designing a passageway for Animals is the fish ladder which helps mug
EDL	00:04:36,479	00:04:42,879	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Dory species of salmon and steelhead trout get over dams that block their annual migrations up river to spawn
EDL	00:04:42,879	00:04:46,975	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	First patented by a Canadian lumber mill owner in 1837
EDL	00:04:46,975	00:04:49,791	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	The standard fish ladder is a series of Terrace pool
EDL	00:04:50,303	00:04:54,911	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	With just enough space between them
EDL	00:04:54,911	00:04:57,983	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Slowly climbing the ladder to the other side of the dam
EDL	00:04:58,495	00:05:02,847	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	The design takes a natural ability to swim upstream

EDL	00:05:07,711	00:05:11,039	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	7 babies hatch in the upper reaches of a river and immediately
EDL	00:05:11,039	00:05:16,159	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Are making their way down the river to the ocean they hang out at sea for a few years and then
EDL	00:05:16,671	00:05:23,071	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Miraculously swim their way back up the exact same river to lay their eggs using magnetic fields
EDL	00:05:23,071	00:05:24,095	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Can smell to navigate
EDL	00:05:24,863	00:05:26,655	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	But in the early 20th century
EDL	00:05:26,655	00:05:29,471	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Company started building giant hydroelectric Dam
EDL	00:05:29,983	00:05:31,519	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	On almost every major river
EDL	00:05:31,519	00:05:32,287	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	In the United States
EDL	00:05:32,799	00:05:35,359	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	And they were way too big for a salmon to jump over
EDL	00:05:36,383	00:05:40,223	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	And so at some of these dams Engineers installed fish ladders
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:41,503	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	To help the salmon out
EDL	00:05:41,503	00:05:43,551	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	And fish water temp worked well over the years
EDL	00:05:44,319	00:05:46,623	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Part of the problems with fish ladders is that they
EDL	00:05:46,623	00:05:47,903	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	They tend to be very expensive
EDL	00:05:47,903	00:05:49,695	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	To build that's Todd delegan

EDL	00:06:23,487	00:06:23,999	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	We estimate

EDL	00:06:28,095	00:06:28,863	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	At all
EDL	00:06:28,863	00:06:29,887	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Because of the barriers that
EDL	00:06:29,887	00:06:30,655	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Exist
EDL	00:06:30,655	00:06:32,703	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	And that's where Todd's company
EDL	00:06:32,703	00:06:33,471	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Whoosh
EDL	00:06:33,471	00:06:33,983	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Comes in
EDL	00:06:36,287	00:06:40,383	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Becoming flying fish
EDL	00:06:40,383	00:06:42,687	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	The whoosh
EDL	00:06:43,199	00:06:49,087	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Fish Cannon
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:53,439	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	The salmon
EDL	00:06:53,439	00:06:56,511	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Cannon & Cannon actually started out as an apple
EDL	00:06:57,023	00:06:59,327	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	The founder of the company Vince Bryan
EDL	00:06:59,327	00:07:02,143	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Owens Orchards along the Columbia River in Eastern Washington
EDL	00:07:02,655	00:07:04,447	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Any notice that the pickers were
EDL	00:07:04,447	00:07:07,263	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	We're spending a lot of their time carrying fruit from the tree to
EDL	00:07:07,263	00:07:08,031	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	The storage bin
EDL	00:07:08,031	00:07:09,567	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	What's in the center of the orchard
EDL	00:07:09,567	00:07:10,335	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	It was inefficient
EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:13,151	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	So Vince and Todd built this softube
EDL	00:07:13,663	00:07:14,431	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Kind of like a fire
EDL	00:07:15,199	00:07:16,479	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Inside the tube
EDL	00:07:16,479	00:07:21,343	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	They generated a pressure differential capable of sucking an apple hundreds of feet
EDL	00:07:21,343	00:07:23,391	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	And depositing it gently in a storage bin
EDL	00:07:23,903	00:07:26,719	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	So they have this effective device for apple picking
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:28,255	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	But pretty soon they're thinking
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:29,023	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Bigger
EDL	00:07:29,023	00:07:30,303	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	In the Pacific Northwest
EDL	00:07:30,303	00:07:31,839	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Nothing is bigger
EDL	00:07:31,839	00:07:32,351	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Insane
EDL	00:07:32,863	00:07:35,679	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	The Columbia was once one of the world's great Salmon Run
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:38,495	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	But today 14 Dam
EDL	00:07:38,495	00:07:39,775	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Block the fishes path home
EDL	00:07:40,543	00:07:43,615	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	And the Columbia salmon migration is a thing of the past
EDL	00:07:44,895	00:07:46,431	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	We were
EDL	00:07:46,943	00:07:51,551	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Working in the or apple orchards in Eastern Washington right along the Columbia River
EDL	00:07:51,551	00:07:57,951	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Visit Todd could actually see two of Columbia's dams from The Orchard and Wheatley serve looked at each other and said will what if you could
EDL	00:07:57,951	00:07:59,487	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Put a salmon in the tube
EDL	00:07:59,487	00:08:01,279	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	The idea seems ridiculous
EDL	00:08:01,279	00:08:02,047	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	The first
EDL	00:08:02,047	00:08:03,071	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	But they couldn't let it go
EDL	00:08:03,583	00:08:06,143	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	So Benton Todd head back home to their shop
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:08,447	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	We set up a fruit tube in our shop and it was about
EDL	00:08:08,447	00:08:09,727	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	25 Ft Lauderdale
EDL	00:08:10,239	00:08:12,287	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	And we went to the store and bought it
EDL	00:08:12,287	00:08:13,055	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	A dead salmon
EDL	00:08:14,335	00:08:15,871	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Small dead salmon in a couple dead trout
EDL	00:08:16,383	00:08:18,431	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Did they put the fish in the tube
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:20,479	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Popped out on the other side
EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:23,551	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	And then we went out and bought some live tilapia
EDL	00:08:24,575	00:08:30,975	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	To see if he was transported through our old agriculture or air filter tube would cause any effects
EDL	00:08:30,975	00:08:32,767	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	The fish are the fish going to live
EDL	00:08:33,279	00:08:34,559	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	And attitude was about 22
EDL	00:08:34,559	00:08:35,839	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	25 feet long also
EDL	00:08:35,839	00:08:37,375	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Hawaii floppy anma
EDL	00:08:37,375	00:08:39,679	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Went flying into a tank of water and they just
EDL	00:08:39,679	00:08:41,471	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Slammer and immediately and had no issues
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:42,495	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Use I in a WeChat I-5
EDL	00:08:44,287	00:08:45,567	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	It was it was great
EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:49,407	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	So from there they said about retrofitting there apple tube
EDL	00:08:49,407	00:08:50,175	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	To transport fish
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:54,015	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	And a few months later the salmon Cannon was born
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:55,551	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	But
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:56,575	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Okay it's not

EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:33,951	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Step
EDL	00:09:34,975	00:09:36,511	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	And literally they will
EDL	00:09:37,023	00:09:42,399	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Speak directly guided right into our tube itself once inside the tube

EDL	00:09:45,471	00:09:47,007	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	So that fish then

EDL	00:10:00,831	00:10:01,343	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Say slippy slide
EDL	00:10:02,367	00:10:04,671	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	And see some videos where the Fisher actually
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:07,743	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Almost swimming they're doing their natural

EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:13,631	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Then they find themselves
EDL	00:10:13,631	00:10:15,167	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Right back and right back in the river
EDL	00:10:15,935	00:10:16,959	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	So they can continue their jaw

EDL	00:10:20,031	00:10:22,335	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	The salmon Cannon is still pretty new

EDL	00:10:29,503	00:10:35,391	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	A lot of scientists who have tested the system seemed excited particularly because it seems to cause that's little stress
EDL	00:10:35,391	00:10:36,159	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	For the fish
EDL	00:10:36,159	00:10:37,951	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	But not everyone who cares about
EDL	00:10:38,975	00:10:39,487	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	It's so gung-ho
EDL	00:10:39,999	00:10:41,279	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	It seems like if your
EDL	00:10:41,279	00:10:43,327	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Need to resort to a cannon
EDL	00:10:43,327	00:10:44,351	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	To get a fish

EDL	00:10:47,423	00:10:52,031	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	That maybe there's something more fundamental wrong with the infrastructure along the river system
EDL	00:10:52,031	00:10:53,567	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	This is David Montgomery

EDL	00:11:18,143	00:11:19,423	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Just look at the Columbia River

EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:08,063	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	On some Rivers
EDL	00:12:08,575	00:12:12,927	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	People have resorted to transporting baby salmon Downstream with boats and
EDL	00:12:13,951	00:12:16,255	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	David's not trying to single out the same thing
EDL	00:12:16,255	00:12:18,303	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	There's been a whole host of Technology
EDL	00:12:18,303	00:12:19,071	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	The people have experiment
EDL	00:12:21,631	00:12:26,239	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Really the underlying problem is that you've ecologically turned a mighty River into a series of lakes
EDL	00:12:30,079	00:12:36,479	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	The Washington state government spends millions of dollars every year on fish ladders and other efforts to get fish around
EDL	00:12:36,479	00:12:37,759	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Dams but the numbers
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:38,783	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Are still way down
EDL	00:12:39,295	00:12:42,623	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Around the Puget Sound where I live around Seattle
EDL	00:12:42,623	00:12:46,719	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	We're estimated to be down about 10% of the salmon that we had historically
EDL	00:12:46,719	00:12:53,119	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Throughout the region it's somewhere be like 5 or 8% in the Columbia River at his down to 2% by river
EDL	00:12:53,119	00:12:54,399	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Salmon decline is complicate
EDL	00:12:54,911	00:12:56,447	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	It has to do with several factors
EDL	00:12:56,447	00:12:58,239	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	You're such as overfishing and habitat
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:13:00,287	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	And I think that that's
EDL	00:13:02,079	00:13:06,175	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Characteristic of a lot of environmental systems they're actually more complex
EDL	00:13:06,175	00:13:12,063	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Then we realize and the worry is that many of these technological solutions to environmental problems
EDL	00:13:12,575	00:13:13,855	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Only saw the piece of the problem

EDL	00:13:17,695	00:13:19,999	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	You might be able to get the fish up the river
EDL	00:13:19,999	00:13:21,279	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	The river itself
EDL	00:13:21,279	00:13:21,791	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Is still broken
EDL	00:13:22,303	00:13:23,327	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	With that in mind
EDL	00:13:23,327	00:13:26,911	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	People have recently started calling on the government to remove old dance
EDL	00:13:26,911	00:13:28,447	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	And return entire Riverside

EDL	00:13:30,751	00:13:32,287	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	The idea that you
EDL	00:13:32,799	00:13:34,847	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Could actually take a major Dam out
EDL	00:13:35,359	00:13:36,895	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	20 years ago is crazy talk
EDL	00:13:37,407	00:13:40,479	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	I mean that was just not something that you would certify
EDL	00:13:40,479	00:13:45,087	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	That people would talk about as a serious political or social possibility
EDL	00:13:45,087	00:13:46,367	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	But now it's happening
EDL	00:13:47,135	00:13:48,927	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	After years of protest

EDL	00:13:56,863	00:13:59,167	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	And the salmon have begun to come back
EDL	00:13:59,167	00:14:01,983	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	We're not going to get rid of every damn damn in the country
EDL	00:14:01,983	00:14:06,847	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	But a lot of them are reaching the end of their structural lifetimes and some are just not
EDL	00:14:06,847	00:14:07,615	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Profitable anymore
EDL	00:14:08,127	00:14:13,247	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	And in those cases David wants us to look at each one on a case-by-case basis and ass
EDL	00:14:13,759	00:14:15,039	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	Well what about this damn

EDL	00:14:36,543	00:14:39,359	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	And that's a worry with Wildlife corridors more generally

EDL	00:14:59,583	00:15:05,727	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	And we need to preserve the ones that are functioning really well that are supported large and diverse

EDL	00:15:54,367	00:15:58,463	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	We can't fix every problem we created by building something new
EDL	00:15:58,463	00:16:04,863	| 99pi-0197-fishcannon-1 |	For a species like salmon to survive in the modern world it's going to take a patchwork approach of addition and
