EDL	00:03:33,248	00:03:36,576	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	To get this Granite Circle placed in the ground on University
EDL	00:03:36,576	00:03:39,648	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	The property I was kind of thrown into a little bit of a hornet's nest that I wasn't
EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:40,416	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	Prepared for it all
EDL	00:03:41,440	00:03:42,464	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	Here's what happened
EDL	00:03:42,464	00:03:46,048	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	Free Speech Monument was born out of an open design competition
EDL	00:03:46,048	00:03:48,096	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	Memory at the 25th anniversary of
EDL	00:03:48,096	00:03:48,608	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	The start of the
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:54,752	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	Free Speech movement a bunch of professors ask professors they called themselves the Berkeley art from
EDL	00:03:54,752	00:04:00,640	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	Put this competition together separate from the University they did it as an autonomous group
EDL	00:04:00,640	00:04:03,712	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	Because they knew if they tried to go through the university to commemorate the
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:06,016	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	Which movement it would go nowhere
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:07,040	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	Because of the time
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:09,088	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	The university did not want to
EDL	00:04:09,088	00:04:10,368	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	Commemorate the free speech
EDL	00:04:10,368	00:04:12,160	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	Movement in any way shape
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:14,976	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	The Free Speech movement started in the fall of 1960
EDL	00:04:14,976	00:04:16,256	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	Before when students set up a
EDL	00:04:16,256	00:04:19,839	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	The table in Sproul Plaza to recruit for an off-campus Civil Rights group
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:21,119	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	This was against
EDL	00:04:21,631	00:04:22,399	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	School policy at the
EDL	00:04:23,167	00:04:25,727	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	And everything escalated from there
EDL	00:04:25,727	00:04:26,751	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	The following months
EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:28,031	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	Wehrmacht by sit-ins
EDL	00:04:28,031	00:04:29,055	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	Strikes in a row
EDL	00:04:29,055	00:04:30,335	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	It was a pivotal moment
EDL	00:04:30,847	00:04:31,871	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	That defined
EDL	00:04:31,871	00:04:33,407	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	What we think of as the 6th
EDL	00:04:34,175	00:04:35,711	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	Monument seems appropriate
EDL	00:04:36,223	00:04:38,015	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	So anyway it's 1989
EDL	00:04:38,015	00:04:39,295	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	Calling out hundreds
EDL	00:04:39,295	00:04:40,831	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	Designs for consider
EDL	00:04:40,831	00:04:41,343	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	The 300
EDL	00:04:41,855	00:04:42,367	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	From all over the
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:44,159	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	They tweeted that down.
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:46,207	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	Define open.
EDL	00:04:46,207	00:04:48,511	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	Public discussion and voting that included
EDL	00:04:49,023	00:04:49,791	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	Publican
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:50,559	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	Art critics
EDL	00:04:50,559	00:04:53,119	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	All kinds of people outside of the Berkeley art project
EDL	00:04:53,631	00:04:59,007	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	That eventually selected Mark Pressman campins column of Earth and air as the Free Speech Monument
EDL	00:04:59,007	00:05:01,311	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	The Democracy doesn't always work with art thou
EDL	00:05:01,311	00:05:02,591	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	So I'm glad that it were
EDL	00:05:02,591	00:05:03,615	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	Work out this time
EDL	00:05:04,639	00:05:06,431	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	The people who would put the project together
EDL	00:05:06,943	00:05:10,015	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	Wanted to give the winning entry to the university as a gift
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:14,111	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	And then of course university did not want to accept it as a gift
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:19,999	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	And did everything that they could not do in the reason for the reluctance is that a lot of the Berkeley art project group
EDL	00:05:19,999	00:05:21,535	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	The once commissioned the monument
EDL	00:05:21,535	00:05:23,839	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	And the higher-ups at the University
EDL	00:05:23,839	00:05:30,239	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	We're the same people who are in the fight 25 years before and they were still very upset about it they still had
EDL	00:05:30,239	00:05:31,007	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	Very hurt feelings
EDL	00:05:31,007	00:05:33,823	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	So UC Berkeley did not want to memorialize the priest
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:37,407	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	Each movement in general and they hated this piece in particular
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:38,431	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	Yeah so
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:40,479	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	They did everything in their power
EDL	00:05:40,991	00:05:42,527	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	To not accepted
EDL	00:05:43,295	00:05:45,599	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	Which is kind of hard to do when still seem like a good guy
EDL	00:05:46,111	00:05:47,391	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	And after this big
EDL	00:05:47,391	00:05:48,415	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	Public selection process
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:50,207	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	They didn't have
EDL	00:05:50,207	00:05:51,231	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	Too much of a choice
EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:52,767	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	So University decided to
EDL	00:05:52,767	00:05:53,279	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	SEPTA stop
EDL	00:05:54,047	00:05:55,071	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	Under one condition
EDL	00:05:55,839	00:06:00,959	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	They said okay will accept this commemoration to free speech as long as the press release that goes out
EDL	00:06:00,959	00:06:02,239	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	Does not contain
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:03,007	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	Any reference
EDL	00:06:03,007	00:06:04,543	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	To the Free Speech movement
EDL	00:06:05,567	00:06:06,079	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	That's right
EDL	00:06:06,591	00:06:07,615	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	Free Speech Monument
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:08,895	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	What sensor
EDL	00:06:09,407	00:06:10,431	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	And the unintended side of a
EDL	00:06:11,199	00:06:11,967	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	Is that it made
EDL	00:06:11,967	00:06:13,247	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	A piece of conceptual art
EDL	00:06:13,759	00:06:14,783	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	Conceptually better
EDL	00:06:16,063	00:06:19,135	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	Ironically it wasn't just the University Administration
EDL	00:06:19,135	00:06:19,903	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	Batman had a problem with
EDL	00:06:20,415	00:06:21,439	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	Column of Earth and Air
EDL	00:06:21,951	00:06:24,255	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	Probably early Free Speech movement leaders
EDL	00:06:24,255	00:06:26,559	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	Express their misgivings about the monument as well
EDL	00:06:35,007	00:06:38,591	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	I remember having a conversation with Mario Savio
EDL	00:06:43,199	00:06:44,735	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	He didn't like the peace at all
EDL	00:06:45,247	00:06:50,367	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	And not put words in his mouth but I did kind of get the impression that he wanted something that was a little bit more specific
EDL	00:06:50,879	00:06:51,647	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	Do the free speech
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:53,183	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	Movement
EDL	00:06:53,183	00:06:54,207	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	In the sixties
EDL	00:06:54,207	00:06:55,487	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	And I
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:07:01,119	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	Specifically didn't want to do that it seemed more relevant to me to use a
EDL	00:07:01,119	00:07:02,143	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	Real person
EDL	00:07:02,655	00:07:05,471	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	Speaking freely about something that they
EDL	00:07:05,471	00:07:08,287	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	Felt strongly about at that moment as a monument
EDL	00:07:08,287	00:07:11,103	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	Capri speech rather than a statue or something like that
EDL	00:07:14,175	00:07:15,967	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	The piece itself remains unfinished
EDL	00:07:15,967	00:07:17,759	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	The goal is to completely liberate this
EDL	00:07:18,527	00:07:19,295	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	Circle of soil
EDL	00:07:20,063	00:07:21,087	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	From any jurisdiction
EDL	00:07:21,599	00:07:27,999	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	And to do that it would have to go through all the jurisdictions you know the private property owners to the Board of Regents
EDL	00:07:27,999	00:07:34,399	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	The city of Berkeley County of Alameda the state there have to be an act of Congress
EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:40,799	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	You also have to get International treaties because you don't want France coming in and taking that little piece of land so
EDL	00:07:40,799	00:07:42,847	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	You know it'll probably never be completely finished
EDL	00:07:43,359	00:07:47,967	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	After several attempts he made it only to the city jurisdiction level before getting bored
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:50,527	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	And now twenty years after it was installed
EDL	00:07:50,527	00:07:52,831	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	I'm standing in a noisy Sproul Plaza
EDL	00:07:53,343	00:07:54,879	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	If my breasts been camping
EDL	00:07:54,879	00:07:56,159	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	We run our hands
EDL	00:07:56,159	00:07:56,927	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	Through the column

EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:00,511	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	Formula
EDL	00:08:01,023	00:08:01,791	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	I asked him if he
EDL	00:08:01,791	00:08:02,303	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	I feel something

EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:12,031	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	I grew up in Utah
EDL	00:08:12,543	00:08:13,311	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	And I
EDL	00:08:13,311	00:08:19,711	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	Would go to Southern Utah Lot in the four corners area that's the only place the United States where 4 States come together at
EDL	00:08:19,711	00:08:20,223	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	At one point
EDL	00:08:20,735	00:08:22,783	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	I remember very specifically
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:27,903	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	Jumping from state-to-state from Arizona to Colorado to Utah to New Mexico
EDL	00:08:27,903	00:08:31,231	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	It's also fun to lie down spread eagle in all four states at once
EDL	00:08:31,231	00:08:35,071	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	And really having a visceral feeling about that invisible line
EDL	00:08:35,071	00:08:36,095	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	Obviously
EDL	00:08:36,095	00:08:37,631	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	Psychological
EDL	00:08:37,631	00:08:40,191	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	But those spaces are very real I mean you commit
EDL	00:08:40,703	00:08:42,751	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	Certain acts in one space and you
EDL	00:08:42,751	00:08:45,311	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	You can do it you can make certain act in another space
EDL	00:08:45,311	00:08:50,943	| 22-Free-Speech-Monument |	And you might be killed so even though they're imaginary to certain extent they're very real
