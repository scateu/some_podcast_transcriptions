EDL	00:06:04,031	00:06:06,591	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	The light bulb was escorted with red lights and siren
EDL	00:06:07,103	00:06:08,639	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	We had a special box
EDL	00:06:08,639	00:06:09,151	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	Built
EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:10,687	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	Not only that
EDL	00:06:10,687	00:06:12,223	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	But the box was painted red
EDL	00:06:12,223	00:06:13,759	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	Which even made it more special
EDL	00:06:14,271	00:06:16,319	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	When they got the light bulb to the new station
EDL	00:06:16,319	00:06:19,903	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	The electrician set it up so that the light bulb could be screwed in immediately
EDL	00:06:20,671	00:06:22,463	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	Climbed up the ladder with the light bulb
EDL	00:06:23,487	00:06:27,583	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	Screwed up the wires together so that everything would go on

EDL	00:06:28,607	00:06:29,375	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	And made the connection
EDL	00:06:30,399	00:06:31,679	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	The light bulb didn't come on
EDL	00:06:32,191	00:06:32,703	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	And we
EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:33,983	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	Gas
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:38,335	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	Oh my gosh oh my goodness what did we do this world famous light bulb
EDL	00:06:39,103	00:06:40,127	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	And now it's
EDL	00:06:40,127	00:06:40,895	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	Gone
EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:43,455	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	But then electrician jiggled somewheres around
EDL	00:06:43,455	00:06:44,735	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	The light came back on
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:47,807	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	Everybody made a big sigh
EDL	00:06:52,671	00:06:59,071	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	Meanwhile as a lightbulb is becoming more more thing as it was impossible for people not to start wondering about what it was made of and how it could
EDL	00:06:59,071	00:07:00,607	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	Still possibly be working
EDL	00:07:01,119	00:07:02,911	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	The obvious way to solve the mystery
EDL	00:07:03,423	00:07:08,543	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	Would be the crack of light bulb open and examine it but obviously no one wanted to do that it was just too precious
EDL	00:07:08,543	00:07:09,567	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	I am Deborah Katz
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:14,687	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	I'm a physics professor at the US Naval Academy in Annapolis Maryland
EDL	00:07:14,687	00:07:17,759	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	Dr. Katz did some tests on similar light bulbs
EDL	00:07:17,759	00:07:20,831	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	Light bulbs made by the same company in the same time.
EDL	00:07:21,343	00:07:27,231	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	She measured the thickness of the bulbs filament which is that tiny piece of wire in the bulb that can break really easily
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:31,327	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	And I did that using a laser so I didn't have to break the bulb
EDL	00:07:31,327	00:07:32,095	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	To get in there
EDL	00:07:32,095	00:07:34,143	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	She figured out that the filament
EDL	00:07:34,143	00:07:37,983	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	In the Livermore Bob was 8 times thicker than a regular bulb
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:40,287	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	And made from carbon instead of tungsten
EDL	00:07:40,287	00:07:41,567	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	What I figured out just
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:42,079	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	Don't tell me
EDL	00:07:42,591	00:07:44,639	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	Why the filament shouldn't have bro
EDL	00:07:44,639	00:07:45,151	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	Broken by now
EDL	00:07:46,943	00:07:47,967	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	That's Tuff
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:50,527	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	Pretty incredible I think it still is a mess
EDL	00:07:50,527	00:07:56,927	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	Stree what she does know is that in 1924 a bunch of light bulb companies got together and formed a cartel
EDL	00:07:56,927	00:07:57,951	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	Called Phoebus
EDL	00:07:57,951	00:08:03,839	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	The goal of the cartel was for all the light bulb companies that stop making bulbs that lasted so long
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:05,887	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	So that everyone can sell more light bulbs
EDL	00:08:06,655	00:08:11,775	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	Members of the cartel were actually charged fines if their bulb is burned for too many hours
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:13,311	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	And in two years the company
EDL	00:08:13,823	00:08:16,639	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	Light bulbs went from lasting 2500 hours
EDL	00:08:17,151	00:08:18,943	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	Delta 1500 hours
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:20,223	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	By the 1940s
EDL	00:08:20,735	00:08:22,783	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	They actually made their goal of
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:23,807	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	Bulbs that only last
EDL	00:08:23,807	00:08:24,831	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	2000 hours
EDL	00:08:24,831	00:08:31,231	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	The Shelby company which manufactured Chili's ball pad already gone out of business by the time the Phoebus cartel had been formed
EDL	00:08:31,231	00:08:34,815	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	But I'd like to think that they wouldn't have been involved with that nonsense
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:38,911	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	I think that I think they were trying to make a quality product rather than a product
EDL	00:08:38,911	00:08:40,191	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	With built-in obsolescence
EDL	00:08:40,703	00:08:47,103	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	And a quality product it was of course the Bold was just hanging there and continuing the glow
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:50,175	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	Turn away at story was taking on this air of magical realism
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:56,063	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	In 2001 a group of locals decided Livermore ought to have a hundredth birthday party for the light bulb
EDL	00:08:56,575	00:09:01,951	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	They formed the Centennial bulb committee and started planning what they thought would be a small get-together at
EDL	00:09:01,951	00:09:04,767	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	The firehouse that June Indian 600 people showed up

EDL	00:09:14,751	00:09:19,871	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	By then responsibility for the party was the first fireman become interested in
EDL	00:09:20,383	00:09:23,455	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	To one of the firefighters who served under him Lynn Owens

EDL	00:09:30,623	00:09:37,023	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	I'll be by this point by the time the Bold turn the hundred he was already a retired division chief he was grinning Asian guy with

EDL	00:10:00,319	00:10:01,087	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	Reminders
EDL	00:10:01,599	00:10:02,367	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	More than once
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:10,303	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	I should not tell a lot of people end up talking about the lightbulb though
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:13,119	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	People write letters to the committee
EDL	00:10:13,119	00:10:16,447	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	And they say things like the light bulb gives them hope
EDL	00:10:16,447	00:10:22,847	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	Or they call it quote a reassuring reminder of faithfulness and service in a letter President George W bush
EDL	00:10:22,847	00:10:24,383	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	Bush called the lightbulb quote
EDL	00:10:24,383	00:10:28,223	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	An enduring symbol of the American Spirit of invention in quote
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:33,087	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	For a lot of people at all so ironically symbolizes another great American invention

EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:36,159	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	I like the label because
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:41,535	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	It's this little speck of continuity you know it's something that started more than a century ago
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:44,095	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	And it keeps going so it sort of connects us to that time
EDL	00:10:44,607	00:10:48,703	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	You can almost imagine it like these this little Amber of a campfire that was lit back then
EDL	00:10:49,215	00:10:50,495	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	How many still going
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:52,543	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	And it kind of in the same way

EDL	00:11:48,607	00:11:49,631	| 99pi-0144-there-salightthatnevergoesout-1 |	Steve told me that
