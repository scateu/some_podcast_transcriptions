EDL	00:02:24,384	00:02:26,176	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	I think so many airports
EDL	00:02:26,176	00:02:27,456	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	We're not designed for the
EDL	00:02:29,248	00:02:30,016	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	And so
EDL	00:02:30,784	00:02:34,624	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	It is all fixing as you go there if there wasn't some great mask
EDL	00:02:35,904	00:02:42,304	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	So when it comes to the ugliness in general dysfunction of airports are a little bit off.
EDL	00:02:42,304	00:02:43,072	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	Improvement
EDL	00:02:43,072	00:02:49,472	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	An area of about the design of air
EDL	00:02:49,472	00:02:50,496	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	Airport she said to me
EDL	00:02:51,008	00:02:56,128	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	If all airports simply play Brian Eno's album music for airports over the speakers
EDL	00:02:56,640	00:02:58,432	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	Every airport would be better
EDL	00:02:58,944	00:03:00,736	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	My name is Alison Arias
EDL	00:03:00,736	00:03:02,272	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	And I read about design and

EDL	00:03:03,040	00:03:03,808	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	The New York Times
EDL	00:03:03,808	00:03:09,952	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	I say this to serve not only as an introduction to Allison area but also so that you'll know that she is someone
EDL	00:03:10,464	00:03:11,744	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	Who is Judgement
EDL	00:03:11,744	00:03:13,536	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	Is perfectly true
EDL	00:03:13,536	00:03:16,096	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	Antarctic Iceberg to said nothing is
EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:18,912	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	More quickly obsolete than an airport built
EDL	00:03:18,912	00:03:19,936	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	Technology
EDL	00:03:20,448	00:03:21,728	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	Changing so fast
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:28,128	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	Anything at all airports are still trying to catch up to now the thing that forced airports to change the most
EDL	00:03:28,128	00:03:28,896	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	The fastest
EDL	00:03:29,664	00:03:30,432	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	Was 9/11
EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:34,784	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	Security screen has come to dominate all aspects of airport design
EDL	00:03:34,784	00:03:36,320	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	We're going to focus on just too fat
EDL	00:03:37,088	00:03:43,488	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	The verses that because the unpredictability and time required to go through security you no longer dawdle on what is called the land
EDL	00:03:43,488	00:03:48,864	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	And side of the airport landside is basically a curb appeal part of the airport parking in store
EDL	00:03:48,864	00:03:55,264	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	Ticketing area so considered landside the wonderful lines that you have to wait in TSA
EDL	00:03:55,264	00:04:01,664	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	Play what you're also changing by the way most airports of course have had to make room for those lines so all of that in landside
EDL	00:04:01,664	00:04:08,064	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	So when do you want yourself to the pleasant experience that is security you are on the airside but people responsible for Bill
EDL	00:04:08,064	00:04:08,832	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	Airports
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:11,136	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	Really kind of followed the bus station model
EDL	00:04:11,136	00:04:11,904	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	Where
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:13,184	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	It was like a holding pen
EDL	00:04:13,696	00:04:20,095	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	We just got you here as long as we put you on Amtrak or put you on Greyhound and airports were so tough on that model T because he asked
EDL	00:04:20,095	00:04:21,887	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	Assumption was you were just passing through
EDL	00:04:21,887	00:04:28,287	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	Now the assumption is that you are absolutely not just passing through the assumption is that you were going to be staying
EDL	00:04:28,287	00:04:28,799	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	A while
EDL	00:04:29,311	00:04:31,615	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	So newer airports are designed with that in mind
EDL	00:04:34,175	00:04:38,527	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	And a good example of this new thinking described in a recent New York Times article by area
EDL	00:04:38,527	00:04:42,623	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	Is the new T2 terminal design by Gensler Architects at Sanford
EDL	00:04:42,623	00:04:43,903	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	Cusco International airport
EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:45,951	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	T2 is the new
EDL	00:04:45,951	00:04:46,719	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	Terminal 5
EDL	00:04:46,719	00:04:48,255	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	American Airlines
EDL	00:04:48,255	00:04:49,279	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	And Virgin America
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:50,559	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	At Sanford
EDL	00:04:50,559	00:04:51,583	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	Beijing International Airport
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:54,399	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	And it's one of the
EDL	00:04:54,399	00:04:54,911	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	The first
EDL	00:04:55,423	00:04:56,191	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	Terminal
EDL	00:04:56,191	00:04:56,959	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	To be designed
EDL	00:04:57,471	00:04:58,239	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	911
EDL	00:04:58,239	00:05:01,567	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	The last terminal constructed the 42 at SFO
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:04,639	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	Was the international terminal that opened in December of two
EDL	00:05:05,151	00:05:06,687	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	It still feels pretty new
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:08,479	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	But you can tell right away
EDL	00:05:08,479	00:05:14,111	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	The trajectory of airport is on was going in a very different direction in the year 2000
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:18,463	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	Then what is prioritize today San Francisco International Terminal for example
EDL	00:05:18,463	00:05:19,487	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	Is all about
EDL	00:05:19,487	00:05:21,023	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	Ticketing area you walking answers
EDL	00:05:21,535	00:05:22,559	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	Massive
EDL	00:05:22,559	00:05:27,167	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	Amount of space it's open and Airy and actually pretty wonderful to experience but
EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:29,471	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	In the new world of TSA
EDL	00:05:29,471	00:05:31,519	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	All that building doesn't make any sense
EDL	00:05:31,519	00:05:32,287	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	If you actually
EDL	00:05:32,287	00:05:33,823	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	Think about it you realize that
EDL	00:05:34,335	00:05:37,663	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	All the exciting stuff is on the land side
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:40,223	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	Eating your shopping apps that are all that
EDL	00:05:42,015	00:05:44,575	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	In the new T2 all the good stuff is saved
EDL	00:05:44,575	00:05:47,391	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	Security because as we all know everyone should
EDL	00:05:47,391	00:05:48,415	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	Russian today
EDL	00:05:48,415	00:05:49,439	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	I'm going to want to leave her at all
EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:51,743	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	So while there is a very generous
EDL	00:05:53,023	00:05:54,047	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	Ticketing area
EDL	00:05:54,815	00:05:56,095	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	Did you giving way more
EDL	00:05:57,119	00:05:57,887	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	1000 mm
EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:01,727	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	Coming to the gate
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:07,615	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	What's also different about T2 is that they're really incorporating the security procedures in the design from the get-go
EDL	00:06:08,127	00:06:11,967	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	When you look at security Now it often looks like the TSA
EDL	00:06:11,967	00:06:14,015	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	Just set up shop yesterday
EDL	00:06:14,015	00:06:18,111	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	With retractable barriers and then it spits you out to a couple of folding chairs
EDL	00:06:18,111	00:06:19,647	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	To put on your shoes in
EDL	00:06:19,647	00:06:20,671	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	Stole your laptop
EDL	00:06:20,671	00:06:24,255	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	The new T2 actually has what they call a recompose own which is
EDL	00:06:24,255	00:06:28,095	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	Like a lounge for putting your clothes back on after you get through TSA with
EDL	00:06:28,095	00:06:29,375	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	Sculpture in
EDL	00:06:29,887	00:06:31,935	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	Lots of natural light in sky lights
EDL	00:06:31,935	00:06:35,519	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	And once you are at that spot putting your shoes in your bowel phone
EDL	00:06:37,311	00:06:38,847	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	Jewelry my Roth back on
EDL	00:06:38,847	00:06:40,639	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	You can see everything that you're about

EDL	00:06:46,015	00:06:50,879	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	I've never given much thought to shops or restaurants in airports but the thing I need not want
EDL	00:06:50,879	00:06:54,207	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	I need when I travel is a place to plug in my phone
EDL	00:06:54,207	00:06:55,231	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	Or laptop
EDL	00:06:55,231	00:06:56,511	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	And probably both
EDL	00:06:56,511	00:07:02,143	| 32-Design-for-Airports |	There are many many more Banks about let's cuz again you think even back to
