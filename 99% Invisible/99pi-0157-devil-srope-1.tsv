EDL	00:01:46,496	00:01:49,056	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	As they rode North they saw more Buffalo
EDL	00:01:49,056	00:01:51,360	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Mostly small Bunches of 20 or 30

EDL	00:02:00,832	00:02:03,392	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	And two or three Prairie wolves hanging around
EDL	00:02:03,392	00:02:04,928	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Waiting for them to leave the carcass
EDL	00:02:05,696	00:02:07,232	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	It was a beautiful morning
EDL	00:02:07,232	00:02:09,024	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Chris for an hour or two
EDL	00:02:09,024	00:02:10,560	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	And then sunny and warm
EDL	00:02:11,584	00:02:13,120	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	The country rolled onto the North
EDL	00:02:13,632	00:02:14,400	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Has it had four
EDL	00:02:14,400	00:02:15,424	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	4000 to miles
EDL	00:02:15,936	00:02:16,960	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Brown in the distance
EDL	00:02:17,728	00:02:20,288	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	The prairie grasses waving in the breeze
EDL	00:02:20,288	00:02:24,128	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	The book which is fiction takes place in the 1870s
EDL	00:02:24,640	00:02:25,920	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	And the reason we're talking about
EDL	00:02:26,432	00:02:31,552	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Is that basically everything about that scene was about to become impossible
EDL	00:02:32,576	00:02:35,136	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	The whole premise of the book really
EDL	00:02:35,136	00:02:36,672	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Was about to become impossible
EDL	00:02:36,672	00:02:38,208	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	In just a few years
EDL	00:02:38,208	00:02:40,000	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Cattle drives would come to an end
EDL	00:02:40,512	00:02:44,352	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	The West will become populated with people in towns and Railway
EDL	00:02:44,864	00:02:46,656	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	And almost all of the Buffalo
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:47,424	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Would be gone
EDL	00:02:48,192	00:02:50,752	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	This change would come about incredibly
EDL	00:02:50,752	00:02:52,544	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	And a lot of it
EDL	00:02:52,544	00:02:58,688	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Would be brought about by one very simple invention that would come to be known as the devil's real
EDL	00:03:03,552	00:03:05,088	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	But let's back up just a tad
EDL	00:03:05,600	00:03:10,464	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	In the mid-1800s not many non-native Americans had ever been west of the Mississippi
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:14,304	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	When Frederick Law Olmsted visited the West in the 1850s
EDL	00:03:14,304	00:03:17,376	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	He remarks that it was like a sea of grasses
EDL	00:03:17,376	00:03:20,192	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Batman and swells after a great storm
EDL	00:03:21,728	00:03:23,520	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	And they were so tall that
EDL	00:03:23,520	00:03:24,800	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	In order to
EDL	00:03:24,800	00:03:28,384	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	See where you are going to get your bearings you have to stand on a horse's back
EDL	00:03:29,920	00:03:31,456	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	That's Joanne Liu
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:36,832	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Hi my name is Joanne Liu I am a texas-based writer and editor
EDL	00:03:36,832	00:03:43,232	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	You had to go far west you had to go to the West Coast of Washington Oregon California to Seymour
EDL	00:03:43,232	00:03:44,000	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Said it was out there
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:50,400	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	The middle of the country was divided into territories in apart from Texas
EDL	00:03:50,400	00:03:51,168	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Summit
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:56,800	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	On the maps up until I would say about 1850s 1840s
EDL	00:03:56,800	00:03:58,592	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	They just label that whole region
EDL	00:03:59,104	00:04:00,896	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	As a great American desert
EDL	00:04:00,896	00:04:04,736	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	They later change the maps to say the Great American Plains
EDL	00:04:04,736	00:04:05,504	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	But still
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:08,064	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	The middle of the country was a vast unknown
EDL	00:04:08,576	00:04:10,368	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	It was sparsely populated
EDL	00:04:10,368	00:04:15,744	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Mostly by Native Americans and by Cattlemen who are supplying beef to the people on the East Coast
EDL	00:04:15,744	00:04:18,047	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	And then in the mid-1800s
EDL	00:04:18,047	00:04:20,863	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	People in the East start thinking about manifest destiny
EDL	00:04:21,375	00:04:22,655	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	And about settling the West
EDL	00:04:23,167	00:04:25,215	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	The American government
EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:27,519	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Wanted to settle the American West
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:29,567	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	And they didn't view Cattlemen
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:32,127	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	And Native Americans are suitable Settlers of the West
EDL	00:04:32,639	00:04:34,943	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	What they wanted out there were people who would actually
EDL	00:04:35,455	00:04:36,223	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Farm tallinn
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:40,319	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Put down the roots improve the land with buildings and communities
EDL	00:04:40,831	00:04:42,879	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	And they look to the Yeoman farmer to do that
EDL	00:04:43,391	00:04:45,183	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Ye Olde Yeoman farmer
EDL	00:04:46,975	00:04:50,559	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	So in 1862 President Lincoln signs the Homestead Act
EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:53,631	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Which basically says if you move west
EDL	00:04:53,631	00:04:55,679	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Settle on a piece of land that
EDL	00:04:55,679	00:04:57,983	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Other people and farm it
EDL	00:04:57,983	00:04:59,775	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	And you do that for 5 years
EDL	00:04:59,775	00:05:01,055	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	The land is yours
EDL	00:05:01,055	00:05:02,591	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	160 Acres
EDL	00:05:02,591	00:05:03,871	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Free for the taking
EDL	00:05:03,871	00:05:07,199	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Of course the young man you know us common Folk
EDL	00:05:07,199	00:05:08,479	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Started heading west
EDL	00:05:08,479	00:05:10,783	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Free land that can't be hard right
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:11,295	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Right
EDL	00:05:12,319	00:05:13,087	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Guys
EDL	00:05:13,087	00:05:14,623	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	It seemed like a great idea
EDL	00:05:14,623	00:05:15,391	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Stayed
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:18,719	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Really didn't think about how difficult that would be for
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:19,999	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	People going out there
EDL	00:05:19,999	00:05:23,583	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	No toy stores no schools
EDL	00:05:26,655	00:05:27,935	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	And of course no
EDL	00:05:27,935	00:05:29,215	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	No fencing material
EDL	00:05:29,727	00:05:32,799	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	And it turns out fences were crucial to Farmers
EDL	00:05:32,799	00:05:34,847	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	But that sea of grasses
EDL	00:05:34,847	00:05:37,663	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Was not a sea of fencing material
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:38,687	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	In other words
EDL	00:05:39,199	00:05:41,503	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	There weren't many trees to use for lumber
EDL	00:05:41,503	00:05:46,879	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Yeah this other start going out there and what they found was that the land was fertile it was great for farming
EDL	00:05:47,903	00:05:48,671	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	But
EDL	00:05:48,671	00:05:52,255	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	There was cattle everywhere and so when they start to plant their crops
EDL	00:05:52,767	00:05:57,375	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	The cattle just simply wander onto the field trampled and Destroy every all their efforts
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:06:04,287	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	To keep cattle out of their cross the farmers tried using these really thick and thorny Osage orange edges
EDL	00:06:04,287	00:06:05,055	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Is for fencing
EDL	00:06:05,055	00:06:10,943	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	They work pretty well but they took five years to grow and if you had to move the boundaries of your property
EDL	00:06:10,943	00:06:11,967	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Tough luck
EDL	00:06:11,967	00:06:16,831	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Butler's also tried smooth wire fencing but the cattle could just bust right through it
EDL	00:06:17,343	00:06:23,743	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Everyone was getting really frustrated lot of settlers they move west and found that they had this
EDL	00:06:23,743	00:06:26,559	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	This problem on their hands and there was nothing they could do about
EDL	00:06:26,559	00:06:27,583	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	And then they left
EDL	00:06:27,583	00:06:33,983	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Fencing became an issue of much discussion there was talk about everywhere you went among farmers of
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:40,383	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Course but also in newspapers agricultural Publications and in the US government
EDL	00:06:40,383	00:06:45,247	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Department of Agriculture that I think was the land office did a study in 1870
EDL	00:06:45,759	00:06:48,063	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	And they basically determined that
EDL	00:06:48,575	00:06:49,599	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	It was
EDL	00:06:49,599	00:06:50,623	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Not feasible
EDL	00:06:51,135	00:06:52,927	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	To settle the West
EDL	00:06:52,927	00:06:54,719	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Because there was no fencing
EDL	00:06:54,719	00:06:55,487	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	What's impossible
EDL	00:06:55,999	00:07:00,351	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Our destiny could not be manifested without solving the fencing problem
EDL	00:07:01,631	00:07:02,911	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	And the solution
EDL	00:07:03,679	00:07:04,703	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Barbed wire
EDL	00:07:09,311	00:07:14,175	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	There were a lot of different patents filed for barbed wire like fences around this time
EDL	00:07:14,687	00:07:19,039	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Twitter attempted to replicate the deterrent properties of the thorn bush
EDL	00:07:19,807	00:07:24,159	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Ultimately the barbed wire design that prevailed was from a guy named Joseph Glidden
EDL	00:07:24,159	00:07:29,023	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	In 1873 Glidden was at a County Fair in his hometown of DeKalb Illinois
EDL	00:07:29,023	00:07:32,607	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	When he saw a fence that inspired him
EDL	00:07:32,607	00:07:33,631	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Strip of wood
EDL	00:07:33,631	00:07:35,423	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Withnail like spikes on it
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:39,263	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	The strip of wood was meant to be attached to a smooth wire fence
EDL	00:07:39,263	00:07:41,311	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	And he realize he could he can improve on that
EDL	00:07:42,079	00:07:46,175	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Glenwood home and created what we now know as Barb Wire
EDL	00:07:46,687	00:07:50,015	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Sharp metal barbs twisted around a strand
EDL	00:07:50,015	00:07:51,039	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Smooth wire
EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:54,879	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	And from then he intertwine a second smooth piece of wire
EDL	00:07:55,391	00:07:56,159	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	So that
EDL	00:07:56,159	00:07:57,695	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	The Twisted bar could not
EDL	00:07:57,695	00:07:58,207	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Slide around
EDL	00:07:58,719	00:08:05,119	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Gwen went into business with a guy named Isaac Ellwood and they said about trying to get barbed wire into the hands of Western
EDL	00:08:05,119	00:08:11,519	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Settlers but people were skeptical that barbed wire would work against the kind of cattle they were raising in the west at the time
EDL	00:08:11,519	00:08:13,567	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	The Texas Longhorn
EDL	00:08:15,359	00:08:18,687	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Texas Longhorns for the most unruly
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:19,711	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Belligerent cattle
EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:24,319	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	And so the idea that this little piece of barbed wire could
EDL	00:08:24,319	00:08:25,343	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Keep them out of
EDL	00:08:25,343	00:08:26,111	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Anywhere
EDL	00:08:26,111	00:08:26,879	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Laugh
EDL	00:08:27,647	00:08:28,927	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	So The Story Goes
EDL	00:08:28,927	00:08:35,327	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	That Gooden in Elwood sent a fast-talking salesman and compulsive Gambler known as John bed
EDL	00:08:35,327	00:08:36,351	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Add a million Gates
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:37,887	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Down to San Antonio
EDL	00:08:37,887	00:08:43,263	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	To sell barbed wire and bet a million Gates basically tells all the farmers and cowboys
EDL	00:08:43,263	00:08:48,639	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Together up there most unruly cattle and stick them inside this barbed wire enclosure
EDL	00:08:48,639	00:08:50,175	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	But she built in the Town Square
EDL	00:08:50,687	00:08:51,967	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	By the other day
EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:53,247	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	There's a huge crowd
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:56,831	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	They put the cattle in the enclosure and they got them all riled up
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:08:58,879	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	And the cattle just went crazy
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:09:01,439	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	They rushed up against the defense
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:02,719	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	And immediately we are back
EDL	00:09:03,231	00:09:05,279	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Cuz they met up with a barbed wire
EDL	00:09:05,279	00:09:11,423	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Eventually the cattle all just kind of meekly settled down better Mill and gate start taking orders
EDL	00:09:11,423	00:09:12,191	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Right then and there
EDL	00:09:12,191	00:09:16,287	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Word spread and so did the barbed wire all over the West
EDL	00:09:17,055	00:09:20,895	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	1874 when Glendon Elwood first started they produce
EDL	00:09:20,895	00:09:22,943	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	10000 lb of barbed wire
EDL	00:09:23,711	00:09:27,807	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	1876 was the same year that Betty Milton Gates went on San Antonio
EDL	00:09:28,575	00:09:29,343	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	They
EDL	00:09:29,343	00:09:31,391	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	We're producing nearly 3 million pounds
EDL	00:09:34,463	00:09:36,255	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Before barbed wire hit the West
EDL	00:09:36,255	00:09:40,607	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	The Cattleman had just been kind of watching and laughing as that Yeoman farmers
EDL	00:09:40,607	00:09:41,887	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Struggle with their
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:43,423	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Fence shrubs
EDL	00:09:43,423	00:09:44,959	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Remember the West
EDL	00:09:44,959	00:09:45,983	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	For the Homestead Act
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:47,775	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Was in large part
EDL	00:09:47,775	00:09:51,359	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Populated by Cattlemen and the various Native American tribes
EDL	00:09:51,871	00:09:56,479	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Has been made of the animosity between Cowboys and Indians
EDL	00:09:56,991	00:10:00,575	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	They have this one kind of striking thing in common
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:05,183	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Neither really believed in fencing off the land and hanging no trespassing signs
EDL	00:10:05,183	00:10:08,511	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	The west of the American Cowboy before the Homestead Act
EDL	00:10:09,023	00:10:15,423	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Was governed by something called The Law of the Open Range now I'd always thought that the Open Range
EDL	00:10:15,423	00:10:17,215	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	It was a figure of speech
EDL	00:10:17,215	00:10:19,775	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Like it just meant big open pastures
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:23,615	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	It was like the way things were done
EDL	00:10:24,383	00:10:26,431	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	It was a big deal in the West
EDL	00:10:26,431	00:10:27,199	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	So
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:27,967	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	It just
EDL	00:10:27,967	00:10:28,735	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Became practice
EDL	00:10:28,735	00:10:31,295	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Common practice that became Unwritten code of law
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:33,855	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	I don't need to rearrange Farm why to fatten up
EDL	00:10:34,367	00:10:38,207	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	And for cattle to get the grazing lands they needed the land had to
EDL	00:10:38,207	00:10:38,719	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	To be open
EDL	00:10:39,231	00:10:42,815	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	So you can probably guess who was about to ruin
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:43,583	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Everything
EDL	00:10:43,583	00:10:47,167	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	ELD Yeoman farmer and their barbed wire fences
EDL	00:10:48,703	00:10:55,103	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	It was in direct contradiction of the law of the Open Range apart from that people also thought that barbed wire
EDL	00:10:55,103	00:10:56,639	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Water was cruel
EDL	00:10:56,639	00:11:03,039	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	A lot of the cattle you know they would be injured by the barbed wire and they would their wounds would become infested with screw bar MN
EDL	00:11:03,039	00:11:03,807	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Double die
EDL	00:11:04,319	00:11:07,903	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	A whole side business of elixirs for wounded cattle sprung up
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:11,999	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Briefly people try designing more Humane barbed wire fences
EDL	00:11:11,999	00:11:15,327	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	They were made to be easier for the cattle to see and avoid
EDL	00:11:15,327	00:11:16,607	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	But they didn't catch on
EDL	00:11:16,607	00:11:17,375	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	In any case
EDL	00:11:17,375	00:11:19,423	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	The Cattleman weren't happy
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:22,239	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	If you ever seen the musical Oklahoma and
EDL	00:11:22,239	00:11:23,007	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Oh I have
EDL	00:11:23,775	00:11:29,151	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	You might remember this little ditty called the farmer and the Cowman should be friends
EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:36,063	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	I'd like to say a word.
EDL	00:11:37,599	00:11:40,415	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	D, Weston field a lot of fences
EDL	00:11:41,439	00:11:47,583	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	I'm right across. Cattle range
EDL	00:11:48,095	00:11:53,215	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	The chorus of the song and floors all territory folks to stick together
EDL	00:12:05,503	00:12:09,855	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	But in reality Cowboys and Farmers wouldn't become friends for a while
EDL	00:12:09,855	00:12:13,951	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Cattlemen resented the farmers as they put up more and more fences
EDL	00:12:14,463	00:12:15,487	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	And that's what's up
EDL	00:12:15,487	00:12:17,023	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Yeah defense carnivores
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:19,327	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	The fence cutting Wars
EDL	00:12:19,839	00:12:21,631	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	They started around 1881
EDL	00:12:22,143	00:12:28,543	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	It began with Cowboys cutting down illegal fences the people were putting up around land that they didn't
EDL	00:12:28,543	00:12:30,335	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	I'm even have a rightful claim on
EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:34,175	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	What happened was as this sort of momentum built
EDL	00:12:34,175	00:12:37,759	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	I'm a lot of people start joining in a lot of Outlaws and
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:39,551	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Rustlers and they started
EDL	00:12:39,551	00:12:40,319	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Cutting
EDL	00:12:40,319	00:12:41,855	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Illegal and legal fund
EDL	00:12:42,623	00:12:44,159	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Anytime and followed suit
EDL	00:12:44,671	00:12:45,951	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	And it just it just
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:47,231	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Erupting chaos
EDL	00:12:47,743	00:12:49,279	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Starting in Texas
EDL	00:12:49,279	00:12:51,583	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	And it spread northward all the way up to Montana
EDL	00:12:52,607	00:12:54,911	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	The Cowboys cut fences at night
EDL	00:12:54,911	00:12:55,935	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	With masks on
EDL	00:12:55,935	00:12:59,519	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	But even had fans cutting gangs with names like the owls
EDL	00:12:59,519	00:13:00,543	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Blue Devils
EDL	00:13:00,543	00:13:01,567	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	And the land League
EDL	00:13:02,079	00:13:04,127	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	This all went on for about 4 years
EDL	00:13:04,639	00:13:07,455	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Most of the damage was in property value
EDL	00:13:07,455	00:13:10,015	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	But there are a few dots on record
EDL	00:13:10,015	00:13:16,415	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Eventually the Texas state government and the FEDS got involved and the fence cutting finally died down
EDL	00:13:16,415	00:13:17,695	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Around 1885
EDL	00:13:21,279	00:13:26,143	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	During the 1800s the Buffalo that roamed the American West died off in huge numbers
EDL	00:13:26,143	00:13:28,959	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Partly because settlers were killing them for their hides
EDL	00:13:28,959	00:13:31,519	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	But also because of fences
EDL	00:13:31,519	00:13:34,591	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Buffalo needed large areas for their migration
EDL	00:13:34,591	00:13:40,991	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	And just like it did for the cattle barbed wire and peaden's Buffalo's access to grazing lands and water
EDL	00:13:40,991	00:13:46,111	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	Poor white people live in the west it's estimated that 65 million buffalo live there
EDL	00:13:46,111	00:13:48,159	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	But by the end of the 1800s
EDL	00:13:48,159	00:13:49,439	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	There were less than 1000
EDL	00:13:52,255	00:13:54,303	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	By the time Barb Wire hit the West
EDL	00:13:54,815	00:13:58,911	| 99pi-0157-devil-srope-1 |	A lot of Native American tribes had already been forced onto reservations
