EDL	00:02:19,264	00:02:23,360	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	How did he end up being the Unlucky passenger that United decided to remove

EDL	00:02:31,808	00:02:33,856	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	But the answer to how he was chosen
EDL	00:02:33,856	00:02:34,368	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Was actually
EDL	00:02:34,880	00:02:35,648	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	An algorithm
EDL	00:02:36,160	00:02:36,928	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Computer program
EDL	00:02:37,696	00:02:38,976	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	It runs through a bunch of data
EDL	00:02:39,488	00:02:45,120	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Looking at stuff like how much each passenger I pays their ticket what time they checked into off Nicky one United
EDL	00:02:45,120	00:02:47,424	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	And whether they were part of a rewards program
EDL	00:02:47,936	00:02:53,056	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	The algorithm likely determined that dr.dao was one of the least valuable customers on the Fly
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:53,568	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	I got the time

EDL	00:03:17,120	00:03:20,704	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	The goal is to replace objective judgments with objective measurements
EDL	00:03:21,216	00:03:22,752	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	But it doesn't always work out like that
EDL	00:03:23,520	00:03:24,032	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	The subject
EDL	00:03:24,544	00:03:26,848	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Huge I think algorithm design Maybe
EDL	00:03:26,848	00:03:29,664	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	The big design problem of the 21st Century
EDL	00:03:29,664	00:03:31,968	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	And that's why I wanted to interview Cathy O'Neil
EDL	00:03:32,736	00:03:38,112	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Okay thank you so much so cuz when we start can you give me one of them sort of npr-style
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:40,928	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Introductions in to say your name and what you do
EDL	00:03:40,928	00:03:41,440	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Sure
EDL	00:03:41,952	00:03:45,024	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	I'm Cathy O'Neil I'm a mathematician data scientist
EDL	00:03:45,024	00:03:51,424	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Activist an author I wrote the book weapons of math destruction how big did it increases in equality and threatens to
EDL	00:03:51,424	00:03:56,288	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Call Krissy O'Neal studied number Theory and then left Academia to build predictive algorithms for a hedgehog
EDL	00:03:57,056	00:04:01,664	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	But she got really disillusioned by the use of mathematical models in the financial industry
EDL	00:04:01,664	00:04:04,224	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	I wanted to like have more impact in the world
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:08,064	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	But I didn't really know that that impact could be really terrible I was very naive
EDL	00:04:08,576	00:04:11,136	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Every. O'Neill work as a data scientist.
EDL	00:04:11,136	00:04:11,648	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Couple of startups
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:13,440	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	And through these experiences
EDL	00:04:13,952	00:04:16,256	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	She started to get worried about the influence of
EDL	00:04:16,256	00:04:17,536	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Poorly designed algorithm
EDL	00:04:18,303	00:04:20,351	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	So we'll start with the most obvious question
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:21,119	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	What is an algorithm
EDL	00:04:22,399	00:04:23,423	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	As most basic
EDL	00:04:23,423	00:04:26,495	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	An algorithm is a step-by-step guide to solving a problem
EDL	00:04:27,007	00:04:28,543	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	It's a set of instructions like a recipe
EDL	00:04:29,055	00:04:32,127	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Cooking dinner for my family
EDL	00:04:32,895	00:04:36,223	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Do in this case the problem is how to make a successful dinner
EDL	00:04:36,735	00:04:38,783	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	O'Neill starts with a set of ingredients
EDL	00:04:38,783	00:04:40,575	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	She's creating the meal
EDL	00:04:40,575	00:04:46,207	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	You constantly making choices about what ingredients are healthy enough to include in her dinner algorithm
EDL	00:04:46,207	00:04:52,607	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Accurate that data because those ramen noodle packages
EDL	00:04:52,607	00:04:55,167	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Exclude
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:04:59,263	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	And therefore imposing my agenda on this algorithm
EDL	00:04:59,263	00:05:01,567	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	In addition to curating the ingredients
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:06,175	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	O'Neal as the cook also defines what a successful outcome looks like
EDL	00:05:06,175	00:05:10,527	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	I'm also defining success right I'm in charge of success success
EDL	00:05:11,039	00:05:13,599	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	If my kids eat vegetables at that meal
EDL	00:05:13,599	00:05:16,415	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	We know different cock my define success differently
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:19,743	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Define success to be like
EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:24,863	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Impose
EDL	00:05:24,863	00:05:26,399	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Origin.
EDL	00:05:28,447	00:05:31,519	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	O'Neil's main point here is that our them aren't we object
EDL	00:05:31,519	00:05:33,311	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Even when they're carried out by computers
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:37,663	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	This is relevant because the companies that build them like to Market them as a jacket
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:42,271	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Claiming they remove human error infallibility from complex decision-making
EDL	00:05:42,271	00:05:45,343	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	But every algorithm reflects the priorities and judgments
EDL	00:05:45,343	00:05:46,367	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	David human designer
EDL	00:05:47,135	00:05:50,463	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Of course that doesn't necessarily make algorithms bad
EDL	00:05:50,463	00:05:53,279	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Right so I mean it's very important to me that I don't
EDL	00:05:53,279	00:05:55,071	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Get the reputation of hating allowed
EDL	00:05:55,583	00:05:58,911	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	I actually like algorithms I think algorithms could really help
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:06:02,495	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Brunilda single out a particular kind of algorithm for scrutiny
EDL	00:06:03,007	00:06:04,799	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	These are the ones we should worry about
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:07,871	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Are characterized by three properties
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:12,735	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	That's very widespread and important so it's like they make important decisions about a lot of
EDL	00:06:12,735	00:06:16,831	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Number to that their secret that the people don't understand how they're being scored
EDL	00:06:17,343	00:06:20,415	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	I never treated their destructive like one bad mistake
EDL	00:06:20,927	00:06:23,999	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	In the in the design if you
EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:27,071	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Will actually not only make it unfair for individuals butts
EDL	00:06:27,071	00:06:30,911	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Categorically unfair enormous populations As It Gets
EDL	00:06:30,911	00:06:31,423	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Scaled-up
EDL	00:06:32,447	00:06:34,239	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	O'Neill has a shorthand for these algorithms
EDL	00:06:34,751	00:06:37,311	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	The widespread mysterious and destructive
EDL	00:06:38,079	00:06:39,103	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	She calls them
EDL	00:06:39,103	00:06:40,639	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Weapons of math destruction
EDL	00:06:42,943	00:06:45,503	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	To show how one of these destructive algorithms work
EDL	00:06:46,015	00:06:47,807	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	O'Neal points to criminal justice
EDL	00:06:48,575	00:06:51,391	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	For hundreds of years key decisions in the legal process
EDL	00:06:51,903	00:06:53,183	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Like a mountain belt
EDL	00:06:53,183	00:06:55,743	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Sentence and likelihood of parole
EDL	00:06:55,743	00:06:59,071	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	I've been in the hands of fallible human beings Guided by their instinct

EDL	00:07:04,959	00:07:08,543	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	And that racism can produce very different outcomes for defendants
EDL	00:07:08,543	00:07:13,663	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	For example the ACLU has found that sentences imposed on black men in the federal system
EDL	00:07:13,663	00:07:17,759	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Are nearly 20% longer than those four white men convicted of similar crimes
EDL	00:07:18,271	00:07:23,903	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	And Studies have shown that prosecutors are more likely to seek the death penalty for African Americans that for whites convicted
EDL	00:07:23,903	00:07:24,927	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	The same charges
EDL	00:07:24,927	00:07:29,791	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	So you might think that computerized models fed by data would contribute to more even-handed treatment
EDL	00:07:30,303	00:07:32,607	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Criminal Justice System think so too
EDL	00:07:32,607	00:07:35,423	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	It is increasingly try to minimize human bias
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:36,703	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	By turning to risk
EDL	00:07:36,703	00:07:37,983	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Assessment algorithm
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:42,079	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Like crime risk what is a chance of someone coming back to prison after leaving it
EDL	00:07:42,079	00:07:45,919	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Many of these risk algorithms look at a person's record of arrest and conviction
EDL	00:07:46,431	00:07:47,455	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	The problem is
EDL	00:07:47,455	00:07:50,271	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	That data is already skewed by some social realities
EDL	00:07:50,783	00:07:55,647	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Take for example the fact that white people and black people use marijuana at roughly equal rates
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:07:58,207	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	And yet there's five times as many
EDL	00:07:58,207	00:08:00,767	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Blacks getting arrested for smoking pot as whites
EDL	00:08:01,535	00:08:02,559	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	5 times as many
EDL	00:08:03,071	00:08:06,399	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	This may be because black neighborhoods tend to be more heavily policed than white nearby
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:09,727	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Which means black people get arrested for certain crimes more often than white
EDL	00:08:10,495	00:08:13,823	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Risk algorithms detect these patterns and apply them to the Future
EDL	00:08:14,335	00:08:17,151	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	So the past is shaped in part by racism
EDL	00:08:17,151	00:08:18,687	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	The future will be to
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:21,247	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	The larger point is we have terrible date
EDL	00:08:22,527	00:08:24,063	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	For the statisticians
EDL	00:08:24,063	00:08:29,439	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Involve the data scientist are like bliley going forward and pretending that our data is good
EDL	00:08:29,951	00:08:33,279	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	And they were using it to actually make important decisions
EDL	00:08:33,279	00:08:39,423	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Risk assessment algorithm is also look at defendants answers to a questionnaire that supposed to tease out certain risk
EDL	00:08:39,423	00:08:42,239	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Understand questions like you know did you grow up in high-crime neighborhood
EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:46,847	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Are you on welfare do you have a mental health problem do you have addiction problems
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:48,383	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Did your father go to prison
EDL	00:08:48,383	00:08:50,431	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Eproxies for racing class
EDL	00:08:51,199	00:08:54,015	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	What is embedded in the scoring system and the judge is
EDL	00:08:54,015	00:08:56,831	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Given the score and it's called objective what is
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:08:58,111	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	What is a
EDL	00:08:58,111	00:09:03,743	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Judge take away from it or you know how is it used if you have a high risk to send you to prison for longer
EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:04,767	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Incessant
EDL	00:09:04,767	00:09:09,887	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Is also it's also used in bail hearings and parole hearings you have a high recidivism score
EDL	00:09:09,887	00:09:10,911	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	You don't get girl
EDL	00:09:12,447	00:09:14,751	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	And presumably you can take all that bias
EDL	00:09:14,751	00:09:15,519	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Import data
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:16,799	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	And say
EDL	00:09:17,311	00:09:18,847	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	This High chance recidivism
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:20,639	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Means that we should
EDL	00:09:20,639	00:09:21,663	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Rehabilitate
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:27,295	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	I mean that you can take that pill that same stuff and choose to do a completely different thing with the result of the algorithm
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:29,855	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	That's exactly my point exactly my point
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:35,743	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Say oh I wonder why people who have this characteristic have so much worse recidivism well
EDL	00:09:35,743	00:09:38,303	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Let's try to help them find a job that'll help
EDL	00:09:38,815	00:09:41,631	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	We could use those algorithms those risk scores
EDL	00:09:42,143	00:09:45,471	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	To try to account for our society
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:52,383	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Instead O'Neill says in many cases were effectively penalizing people for societal and structural issues that they have live
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:53,407	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Little control over
EDL	00:09:53,407	00:09:55,455	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	And we're doing it at a massive scale
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:09:57,759	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Using these new technological tools
EDL	00:09:57,759	00:10:03,903	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	We're Shifting the blame if you will from the society which is the one that should only has problems to the individual and
EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:10,559	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	It should be said that and some cases algorithms are helping to change elements of the criminal justice system for the better
EDL	00:10:11,071	00:10:13,887	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	For example New Jersey recently did away with their cash bail system
EDL	00:10:14,399	00:10:16,447	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Which disadvantage low-income defendant
EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:19,263	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	They now rely on predictive algorithms instead
EDL	00:10:19,775	00:10:21,311	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Data shows that the states
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:25,151	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Pretrial County Jail populations are down by about 20%
EDL	00:10:27,711	00:10:31,295	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	But still algorithms like that one remain unaudited and unregulated
EDL	00:10:31,807	00:10:34,623	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	And it's a problem when algorithms are basically black boxes
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:39,487	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	In many cases they're designed by private companies who sell them to other companies
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:40,767	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Any exact details
EDL	00:10:40,767	00:10:41,279	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	And how they work
EDL	00:10:41,791	00:10:42,559	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Secret
EDL	00:10:42,559	00:10:46,399	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Not only the public in the dark even the companies using these things
EDL	00:10:46,399	00:10:49,215	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Might not understand exactly how the data is being processed
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:53,055	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	This is true of many of the problematic algorithms that O'Neill has looked at
EDL	00:10:53,567	00:10:55,871	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Whether they use for sorting loan applications
EDL	00:10:55,871	00:10:56,895	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	We're assessing teacher before
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:11:00,735	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Is there some kind of weird thing that happens to people
EDL	00:11:00,735	00:11:02,527	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	In mathematical scores are trotted out
EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:04,319	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	They just start
EDL	00:11:04,831	00:11:07,647	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Closing their eyes and believing it because it's math
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:11,231	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	And they do I feel like I know I'm not an expert of math so
EDL	00:11:11,743	00:11:12,767	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	I can't push back
EDL	00:11:13,535	00:11:19,423	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	And that's not something you just see time and time again you're like why didn't you question that this doesn't make sense
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:20,959	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Oh well it's math and I don't understand it
EDL	00:11:21,727	00:11:22,751	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Right now it seems like
EDL	00:11:23,263	00:11:25,311	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Because of algorithms in math
EDL	00:11:25,823	00:11:27,615	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	It's just a new place
EDL	00:11:27,615	00:11:28,383	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	2
EDL	00:11:28,383	00:11:29,407	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Place blame
EDL	00:11:30,175	00:11:32,223	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	So that you do not have to think about
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:34,015	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Your decisions as natural company
EDL	00:11:35,295	00:11:39,391	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Because he's things are just so powerful and so you know mesmerizing to us
EDL	00:11:39,903	00:11:40,927	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Especially right now
EDL	00:11:41,439	00:11:42,463	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Making music
EDL	00:11:42,463	00:11:42,975	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	All kinds of
EDL	00:11:43,487	00:11:45,535	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Nefarious way almost magical
EDL	00:11:46,559	00:11:47,071	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Yeah
EDL	00:11:48,095	00:11:49,119	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Hatsune
EDL	00:11:49,119	00:11:50,399	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Scary
EDL	00:11:50,399	00:11:55,007	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	It's scary and I think I think I'm going to like I would go one step further than that I feel like
EDL	00:11:55,519	00:11:58,079	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Just an observation that these algorithms
EDL	00:11:58,079	00:12:03,711	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	They don't show up randomly they show up when there's a really difficult conversation that people want to avoid
EDL	00:12:07,551	00:12:08,575	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	They're like oh
EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:14,207	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	We don't know what it's what makes a good teacher and different people have different opinions about that
EDL	00:12:14,975	00:12:15,487	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Siletz
EDL	00:12:15,999	00:12:20,607	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Just bypasses conversation by having an algorithm score teachers or
EDL	00:12:20,607	00:12:23,679	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	We don't know what prison is really for
EDL	00:12:23,679	00:12:27,775	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Let's have a way of deciding how long to sentence up
EDL	00:12:28,287	00:12:33,407	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	We introduced these Silver Bullet mathematical algorithms because we don't want to have a cover
EDL	00:12:33,407	00:12:33,919	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Station
EDL	00:12:36,991	00:12:39,807	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	In a news book she writes about this young guy named Kyle B
EDL	00:12:40,319	00:12:43,391	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Who takes some time off college to get treated for bipolar disorder
EDL	00:12:43,903	00:12:48,511	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	When's he's better and ready to go back to school supplies for a part-time job at Kroger
EDL	00:12:48,511	00:12:49,535	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	The big grocery store chain
EDL	00:12:50,047	00:12:52,095	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	His friend works there who offers to vouch for
EDL	00:12:52,607	00:12:56,703	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Kyle was such a good student that he figured the application would be just a formality
EDL	00:12:56,703	00:12:58,239	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	But he didn't get called back for an interview
EDL	00:12:58,751	00:13:00,543	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Is application was Redline
EDL	00:13:00,543	00:13:03,871	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	By the personality test be taken when he applied for the job
EDL	00:13:04,383	00:13:06,687	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	The test was part of an employee selection algorithm
EDL	00:13:07,199	00:13:10,015	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Developed by private Workforce company called Kronos
EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:16,671	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	70% of job applicants in this country take personality test before they get an interview so this is a very common practice
EDL	00:13:17,439	00:13:21,791	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Kyle had that screening and he found out because his friend worked at Kroger's
EDL	00:13:21,791	00:13:24,863	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	But he has failed the test so most people never find that other just don't hear back
EDL	00:13:25,631	00:13:29,471	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	And the other thing that was unusual about Kyle is that his dad is a lawyer
EDL	00:13:29,471	00:13:31,263	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	So his dad was like what
EDL	00:13:31,263	00:13:33,055	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	What were the questions like on this test
EDL	00:13:33,567	00:13:38,175	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	And he said well there's some of them are a lot like the questions I got at the hospital the mental health assessment
EDL	00:13:38,687	00:13:41,759	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	The Tesco got at the hospital was called the five Factor model

EDL	00:13:51,999	00:13:54,303	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Potential employees answers to the test
EDL	00:13:54,303	00:13:56,863	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Are then plugged into an algorithm that decides whether to
EDL	00:13:56,863	00:13:58,143	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	The person should be hired

EDL	00:14:02,239	00:14:04,799	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Does father and he's figured out together
EDL	00:14:04,799	00:14:09,919	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	But something very fishy had been going on in his father's actually filed class action lawsuit against Krogers for the
EDL	00:14:10,431	00:14:15,807	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	The suit is still pending but arguments are likely to focus on whether the personality test can be considered a medical exam
EDL	00:14:16,319	00:14:16,831	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	If it is

EDL	00:14:29,887	00:14:30,911	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Which makes it a classic
EDL	00:14:31,423	00:14:32,703	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Weapon of math destruction
EDL	00:14:33,215	00:14:39,615	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	In certain jobs you wouldn't want neurotic people or introverted people like if you're at a call center

EDL	00:14:42,687	00:14:43,711	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	That might be a problem
EDL	00:14:44,223	00:14:46,015	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	In which case it is
EDL	00:14:46,015	00:14:48,063	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Actually legal if you get
EDL	00:14:48,063	00:14:50,623	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	An exception for your company
EDL	00:14:50,623	00:14:57,023	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	The problem is that these personality tests are not carefully designed for each business
EDL	00:14:57,023	00:15:00,863	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	But rather what happens if these companies just sell the same personality test
EDL	00:15:00,863	00:15:02,655	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	To all the businesses that will buy them
EDL	00:15:05,727	00:15:09,311	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	A lot of the algorithms that O'Neill explores in her book are largely hidden
EDL	00:15:09,311	00:15:10,591	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	They don't get a lot of attention
EDL	00:15:11,103	00:15:14,431	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	We as consumers and job applicants and employees
EDL	00:15:14,431	00:15:15,711	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	May not even be aware that

EDL	00:15:18,271	00:15:20,063	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Piles in categories
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:24,927	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	But there is one kind of algorithm has gotten a lot of attention in the news lately
EDL	00:15:24,927	00:15:29,279	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Social media has been able to infiltrate
EDL	00:15:29,279	00:15:30,303	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Politics
EDL	00:15:32,095	00:15:38,495	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Social media is a technology
EDL	00:15:38,495	00:15:42,847	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Title is all depends on our conversation started talking about
EDL	00:15:42,847	00:15:47,967	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	The recent election and the complex ways that social media algorithms shape the news that we receive
EDL	00:15:48,735	00:15:54,623	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Facebook shows the stories and ads based on what they think we want in a horse what they think we want is based on algorithms
EDL	00:15:55,135	00:15:59,487	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	These algorithms look at what we clicked on before and then he has more content we like
EDL	00:15:59,999	00:16:01,023	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	The result is that
EDL	00:16:01,023	00:16:03,327	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	We've Ended up in these information silos
EDL	00:16:03,327	00:16:08,191	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Increasingly polarized and oblivious to what people of different political Persuasions might be seen
EDL	00:16:08,703	00:16:15,103	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	I do think this is a major problem you know it's the start of the sky's the limit we have built the internet in the internet
EDL	00:16:15,103	00:16:16,383	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Is a propaganda machine
EDL	00:16:16,895	00:16:18,175	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	It's propaganda
EDL	00:16:18,175	00:16:20,479	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Delivery device
EDL	00:16:20,479	00:16:21,247	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	If you out
EDL	00:16:21,247	00:16:22,527	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	And that's not
EDL	00:16:22,527	00:16:24,319	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	I don't see how that's going to stop
EDL	00:16:24,831	00:16:25,599	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Yeah
EDL	00:16:25,599	00:16:27,391	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Especially if every moment
EDL	00:16:27,391	00:16:28,159	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Optimized

EDL	00:16:32,255	00:16:37,119	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Right let's go to Facebook's Optimizer algorithm that's not optimizing
EDL	00:16:37,119	00:16:37,887	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Chartreuse
EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:39,423	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Optimizing for profit
EDL	00:16:40,447	00:16:42,239	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	And then they claim to be neutral
EDL	00:16:43,007	00:16:44,287	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	But of course nothing's neutral
EDL	00:16:45,311	00:16:47,615	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	And we have seen the result
EDL	00:16:47,615	00:16:49,151	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	We've seen what it's actually optimized
EDL	00:16:50,943	00:16:57,343	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	This kind of data-driven political micro-targeting means conspiracies and misinformation can gain surprising traction on
EDL	00:16:57,343	00:16:58,111	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Online
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:17:01,183	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Stories claiming that Pope Francis endorse Donald Trump
EDL	00:17:01,183	00:17:03,487	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	And that Hillary Clinton sold weapons to Isis
EDL	00:17:03,999	00:17:05,791	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Game millions of viewers on Facebook
EDL	00:17:06,303	00:17:07,071	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Neither of those two
EDL	00:17:07,583	00:17:08,095	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Betrayal
EDL	00:17:12,447	00:17:18,847	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Fixing the problem of these destructive algorithms is not going to be easy especially when they're insinuating themselves and then more
EDL	00:17:18,847	00:17:20,127	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	And more parts of our lives
EDL	00:17:20,127	00:17:24,479	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Romeo thinks that measurement and transparency is one place to start
EDL	00:17:24,991	00:17:28,575	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Like what that Facebook algorithm and the political ads that it serves to its users
EDL	00:17:29,087	00:17:30,879	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	If you were to talk to Facebook about
EDL	00:17:31,903	00:17:32,671	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	How to
EDL	00:17:32,671	00:17:35,231	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Inject some ethics into their optimization
EDL	00:17:36,511	00:17:37,791	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	What would you
EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:44,191	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Do would you make a case for the bottom line of Truth being a like a longer tail way to make more
EDL	00:17:44,191	00:17:45,471	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Money or would you just say
EDL	00:17:45,983	00:17:48,543	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	This is about ethics and you should be thinking about ethics
EDL	00:17:49,311	00:17:52,383	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	To be honest if I really had their attention I would ask them to
EDL	00:17:52,895	00:17:53,919	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Voluntarily
EDL	00:17:54,431	00:17:59,039	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Find a space on the web to just put every political
EDL	00:17:59,039	00:17:59,807	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Add
EDL	00:17:59,807	00:18:02,367	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	And actually every ad just have a way for
EDL	00:18:02,367	00:18:03,135	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	For journalists
EDL	00:18:03,647	00:18:06,719	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	And people interested in the concept of the informed citizenry
EDL	00:18:06,719	00:18:10,303	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	To go through all the ads that they have on Facebook at a given time
EDL	00:18:10,303	00:18:15,423	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Because even if that article about Hillary Clinton and Isis with shared thousands of times
EDL	00:18:15,423	00:18:17,471	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Lots of people never saw it at all
EDL	00:18:17,983	00:18:20,287	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Just show us what you're showing other people
EDL	00:18:20,287	00:18:22,847	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Because I think one of the most pernicious issues is
EDL	00:18:22,847	00:18:24,895	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	The fact that we don't know what other people are saying
EDL	00:18:25,407	00:18:26,943	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	I'm not waiting for Facebook to like
EDL	00:18:27,711	00:18:28,991	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Actually go against their interest
EDL	00:18:29,503	00:18:34,623	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	I'd like changed their profit goal but I do think this kind of transparency can be given
EDL	00:18:35,647	00:18:39,487	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	O'Neill also says it's important to measure the broad effects of these algorithms
EDL	00:18:39,487	00:18:41,535	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Can't understand who they most impact
EDL	00:18:42,047	00:18:43,839	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Everyone should start measuring it
EDL	00:18:43,839	00:18:45,375	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	And what I mean by that
EDL	00:18:45,375	00:18:47,935	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	It is relatively simple and it's
EDL	00:18:47,935	00:18:49,727	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	This might not be a complete
EDL	00:18:49,727	00:18:51,519	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Start but it's a pretty good for
EDL	00:18:51,519	00:18:52,287	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Stop witches
EDL	00:18:52,799	00:18:53,823	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Measure
EDL	00:18:53,823	00:18:55,103	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Perfume this fails
EDL	00:18:55,615	00:18:57,407	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Meaning which population
EDL	00:18:57,407	00:19:00,991	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Are most negatively impacted by the results of these acronyms
EDL	00:19:00,991	00:19:03,039	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	What is the harm that befalls those
EDL	00:19:04,831	00:19:06,879	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	And how are the failures distribute
EDL	00:19:06,879	00:19:07,391	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Across the pond
EDL	00:19:08,415	00:19:10,463	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	So if you see a hiring algorithm
EDL	00:19:10,463	00:19:11,231	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Feel
EDL	00:19:11,231	00:19:12,511	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Much more often for women
EDL	00:19:13,791	00:19:14,559	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	That's a problem
EDL	00:19:15,071	00:19:17,375	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	Especially if the failure is
EDL	00:19:17,375	00:19:18,911	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	They don't get hired when they should get
EDL	00:19:19,423	00:19:21,471	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	I really do think that a study
EDL	00:19:21,471	00:19:24,031	| 99pi-0274-theageofthealgorithm-1 |	A close examination of the distribution of failures
