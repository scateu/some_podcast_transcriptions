EDL	00:02:17,472	00:02:18,240	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Which county
EDL	00:02:18,240	00:02:19,520	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Have entrusted us
EDL	00:02:19,520	00:02:21,056	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	To voice their right
EDL	00:02:21,824	00:02:22,592	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Pate and their governor

EDL	00:02:26,944	00:02:27,712	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Presidential elect
EDL	00:02:28,224	00:02:32,064	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	The election was close
EDL	00:02:32,064	00:02:33,856	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	But tonight after account
EDL	00:02:33,856	00:02:37,696	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	And yet another manual recount secretary and I are honored and humbled
EDL	00:02:38,464	00:02:39,488	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	The one the state of Florida
EDL	00:02:40,512	00:02:42,816	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Which gives us needed electoral votes
EDL	00:02:43,840	00:02:50,240	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	As a quick refresher the 2000 presidential race between Republican George W bush and Democrat Al Gore
EDL	00:02:50,240	00:02:51,776	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	14 down two contested
EDL	00:02:51,776	00:02:52,544	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	What's in Florida
EDL	00:02:52,544	00:02:56,384	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	And one of the four counties at the center of the controversy with Palm Beach County
EDL	00:02:56,896	00:03:02,272	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Voters were using paper ballots where you indicate your choice by punching out holes with a metal stick
EDL	00:03:02,272	00:03:08,416	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Palm Beach County's ballot known as the butterfly ballot had choices of candidates spread over two pages with the hoe
EDL	00:03:08,928	00:03:10,208	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	The punch out in between them
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:12,768	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	But some found a layout confusing
EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:19,680	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Voters who wanted to cast their vote for George W bush had no problem it was clear that the correct hole to punch
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:20,704	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Was the very first
EDL	00:03:20,704	00:03:21,472	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Right at the top
EDL	00:03:21,984	00:03:27,360	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	But there is some ambiguity about which was the right hole to punch to indicate a vote for Al Gore
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:29,664	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Was it the second one down right after bush
EDL	00:03:29,664	00:03:31,200	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Or was it the third one down
EDL	00:03:31,200	00:03:33,504	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Gore was actually the third one
EDL	00:03:34,016	00:03:40,160	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	The way the ballot was set up some voters who believe they were voting for Al Gore actually cast a vote for Patrick bikini
EDL	00:03:40,928	00:03:44,512	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Buchanan being extremely conservative Reform Party candidate
EDL	00:03:45,024	00:03:48,096	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	And there's also a problem with the physical balance themselves
EDL	00:03:48,096	00:03:48,864	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Namely
EDL	00:03:48,864	00:03:49,376	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	The chat
EDL	00:03:49,888	00:03:56,032	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	When you punch a hole in something the Chad is the little piece of paper or cardboard of whatever it is that gets punched out
EDL	00:03:56,544	00:04:00,640	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	And in theory it should be completely punch out but sometimes it
EDL	00:04:00,640	00:04:01,664	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	This doesn't happen
EDL	00:04:01,664	00:04:03,712	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Sometimes the Chad's hang on
EDL	00:04:03,712	00:04:05,504	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	In the case of the 2000 election
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:07,552	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	If the Chad was still hanging on
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:10,624	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	The ballot counting machine couldn't always read the ballot
EDL	00:04:11,136	00:04:14,208	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	And for the people who would eventually count them by hand in the recount
EDL	00:04:14,720	00:04:15,744	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	The auditors
EDL	00:04:15,744	00:04:17,024	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Had to interpret
EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:19,327	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	The intent of the voter
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:22,399	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	And the hanging Chads
EDL	00:04:22,399	00:04:22,911	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Became
EDL	00:04:23,423	00:04:25,727	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	White Infamous as well because
EDL	00:04:25,727	00:04:27,519	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	INRI tabulating the vote
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:28,543	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	You had to make
EDL	00:04:28,543	00:04:30,591	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Assumptions about whether a hanging chad
EDL	00:04:31,103	00:04:33,407	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Was a vote for a particular candidate
EDL	00:04:33,919	00:04:34,431	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Or
EDL	00:04:34,943	00:04:35,711	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	It was a mistake
EDL	00:04:35,711	00:04:42,111	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	That's Eric Heron Mine is Eric Heron and I'm the Everly family professor of political science at West Virginia University
EDL	00:04:42,111	00:04:42,879	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Varsity
EDL	00:04:42,879	00:04:49,279	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	And I focus my research on elections electoral systems and so because of this faulty ballot in Palm Beach County
EDL	00:04:49,279	00:04:50,047	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	My grandma Jeannie
EDL	00:04:50,559	00:04:54,911	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	A dyed-in-the-wool new deal Democrat from the Jewish tenements of New York City
EDL	00:04:55,423	00:04:58,751	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Might have accidentally endorsed a third-party candidate
EDL	00:04:58,751	00:05:00,287	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Who Embraces all the things that
EDL	00:05:01,311	00:05:02,847	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	And then we were told
EDL	00:05:02,847	00:05:03,871	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	I was really
EDL	00:05:04,639	00:05:05,151	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Embarrass
EDL	00:05:05,663	00:05:07,455	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	We felt cheated we felt guilty
EDL	00:05:08,223	00:05:09,503	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	I felt guilty
EDL	00:05:09,503	00:05:11,039	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	That I voted for the wrong person
EDL	00:05:11,551	00:05:13,599	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Retirement community Century Village
EDL	00:05:13,599	00:05:17,183	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Was actually called out by salon.com and other news Outlet
EDL	00:05:17,183	00:05:20,511	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Has pulling unusually high for Pat Buchanan
EDL	00:05:21,023	00:05:23,583	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	There is extensive research to show that
EDL	00:05:23,583	00:05:26,143	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	The votes cast for Buchanan
EDL	00:05:26,143	00:05:27,423	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	In Palm Beach County
EDL	00:05:27,423	00:05:28,959	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Extraordinarily High
EDL	00:05:29,471	00:05:31,775	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	They were anomalous in
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:32,543	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	The region
EDL	00:05:33,567	00:05:34,079	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Engine
EDL	00:05:34,591	00:05:36,383	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	And the best explanation
EDL	00:05:36,383	00:05:37,151	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	4
EDL	00:05:37,151	00:05:40,223	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	The spike in support for Patrick Buchanan
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:41,759	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Was the design of the ballot
EDL	00:05:42,271	00:05:46,879	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Even Pat Buchanan himself admitted that his high numbers were probably due to an error
EDL	00:05:47,391	00:05:53,023	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Now the butterfly ballot was only one small piece of the debacle that was the 2000 election in
EDL	00:05:53,023	00:05:53,535	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Florida
EDL	00:05:54,047	00:05:55,583	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Absentee ballot

EDL	00:06:00,191	00:06:05,311	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	And later it would come out of the state of Florida wrongfully denied the right to vote to at least
EDL	00:06:05,311	00:06:07,103	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	12000 people
EDL	00:06:07,103	00:06:09,919	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	A disproportionate number of whom or people of color
EDL	00:06:10,687	00:06:13,759	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	All of this in an election where the margin of victory was

EDL	00:06:16,063	00:06:17,343	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	There were a number of incidents
EDL	00:06:17,343	00:06:17,855	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	In Florida in

EDL	00:06:25,791	00:06:27,839	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	But the design of the butterfly ballot
EDL	00:06:28,607	00:06:29,631	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Is much more likely
EDL	00:06:30,143	00:06:30,911	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	A case of malpractice

EDL	00:06:32,447	00:06:35,007	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	It was a classic design fail
EDL	00:06:35,007	00:06:37,055	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	It's a poorly designed
EDL	00:06:37,055	00:06:38,591	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Valid it is a ballad
EDL	00:06:38,591	00:06:40,895	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	That does not take into account
EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:42,943	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	The way that a voter
EDL	00:06:42,943	00:06:44,479	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Would look at the balance
EDL	00:06:44,991	00:06:45,759	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	And
EDL	00:06:45,759	00:06:47,807	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Use the particular technology
EDL	00:06:47,807	00:06:50,111	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	In place at the time punch card technology
EDL	00:06:50,111	00:06:50,879	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Decoster
EDL	00:06:51,391	00:06:57,791	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	The ballot is a designed object that is critically important for democracy but in the United States it's almost
EDL	00:06:57,791	00:07:00,863	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Never designed by an actual design professional
EDL	00:07:01,375	00:07:02,143	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	And as such
EDL	00:07:02,655	00:07:07,007	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Are Liberty is being infringed upon by the tyranny of bad design
EDL	00:07:09,055	00:07:14,943	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	One of the oldest recorded instances of a vote is from the ancient Greek play the eumenides by aeschylus
EDL	00:07:14,943	00:07:18,271	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	In the story arrestees is on trial for the murder of his mother

EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:29,279	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	And there's no teeth of the stone as a marker of a vote
EDL	00:07:30,047	00:07:32,607	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	It's an image that stuck and the Greek word
EDL	00:07:32,607	00:07:35,679	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Sephos which means small stone or pebble
EDL	00:07:35,679	00:07:36,703	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Is the root

EDL	00:07:38,239	00:07:39,263	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Or the study of election
EDL	00:07:39,775	00:07:42,847	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	And as Eric Heron tells it himself a psephologist
EDL	00:07:43,359	00:07:49,503	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	The whole Stone in the urn setup was not too different than how elections in the United States
EDL	00:07:50,015	00:07:53,855	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	So in the early us elections you will find voters
EDL	00:07:53,855	00:08:00,255	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Casting a Voice vote they physically had to make their way to the polling place and announce their vote and one of the things
EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:04,863	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Things you do sacrifices the privacy of your vote individuals know who you are voting for
EDL	00:08:04,863	00:08:08,959	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	And what that can engender is pressure on voters to support
EDL	00:08:08,959	00:08:10,495	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	One candidate or another
EDL	00:08:10,495	00:08:16,639	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	In the polls were not calm places with orderly lines you could be battered and pressured into voting a certain way
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:20,735	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Burley elections in the United States often featured
EDL	00:08:20,735	00:08:22,527	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Liquor and violence
EDL	00:08:22,527	00:08:23,039	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	And fraud
EDL	00:08:23,807	00:08:25,599	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Voters would have to
EDL	00:08:25,599	00:08:29,439	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Push or shove or be physical to express
EDL	00:08:29,439	00:08:29,951	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	There
EDL	00:08:30,463	00:08:31,231	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Right to vote
EDL	00:08:32,255	00:08:38,399	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	In fact an election could be so rock is it served as an argument for some against women's suffrage
EDL	00:08:38,911	00:08:42,495	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Elections were deemed inappropriate for women
EDL	00:08:42,495	00:08:44,287	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Then in the late 1800s
EDL	00:08:44,287	00:08:50,431	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Election supervisors realize that having people by speaking their choices allowed was a terrible idea
EDL	00:08:51,199	00:08:53,503	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	The lack of privacy could lead to coercion
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:57,343	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	And had no way to verify that their vote
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:08:58,623	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Is being recorded accurately
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:02,463	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Called a ticket
EDL	00:09:02,463	00:09:04,511	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	But unlike a ballot we have today
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:08,095	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	These were printed not by the government but by political parties
EDL	00:09:08,095	00:09:10,143	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Political parties would print
EDL	00:09:10,143	00:09:10,911	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Their own ballot
EDL	00:09:11,423	00:09:13,983	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	That voters would take with them to the polling
EDL	00:09:15,007	00:09:20,895	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Now these could be printed in newspapers that could be printed by the parties themselves and distributed
EDL	00:09:20,895	00:09:21,407	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	And
EDL	00:09:21,919	00:09:24,479	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	The voter would turn in that party ticket
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:27,551	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	The party tickets with generally only have the candidates
EDL	00:09:27,551	00:09:31,391	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	From that party on them so if say you wanted mostly Republicans
EDL	00:09:31,903	00:09:35,231	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	You go get a Republican party ticket and then you cross out the
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:36,511	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	The candidates that you don't want
EDL	00:09:37,023	00:09:38,559	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	And then either write in
EDL	00:09:38,559	00:09:40,607	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Or literally cut and paste
EDL	00:09:40,607	00:09:43,167	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Pieces of paper with your kids names
EDL	00:09:43,167	00:09:44,447	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Onto that ticket
EDL	00:09:44,447	00:09:46,239	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	And this is the origin of the
EDL	00:09:46,239	00:09:47,007	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Term
EDL	00:09:47,007	00:09:48,543	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	The cast of split ticket
EDL	00:09:48,543	00:09:49,311	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Or a Straight Talk
EDL	00:09:49,823	00:09:52,127	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	But this system also had problems
EDL	00:09:52,127	00:09:56,479	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	1 parties could make tickets that look like those of their opponents
EDL	00:09:56,479	00:09:58,271	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	But actually had their own candidates listed
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:10:01,343	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Duping voters into voting for the wrong party
EDL	00:10:01,343	00:10:04,927	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Non-standard ballets also created other opportunities for shenanigans
EDL	00:10:04,927	00:10:06,463	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Like racketeering scheme
EDL	00:10:06,463	00:10:10,047	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Which facilitated a whole Black Market of buying and selling votes
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:12,351	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Answer the party ticket system
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:16,703	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Wasn't creating Fair elections either in the late 19th century there is
EDL	00:10:16,703	00:10:21,567	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	An innovation that is imported from abroad is called the Australian ballot
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:23,615	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	The Australian ballot
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:24,383	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Is
EDL	00:10:24,383	00:10:25,663	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Government printed ballot
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:29,247	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	That is distributed to voters who come to a polling place
EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:30,783	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	And they
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:31,551	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Cast their ballot
EDL	00:10:32,063	00:10:32,575	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	In
EDL	00:10:33,087	00:10:37,439	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Private and this Australian ballot system was a game-changer
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:39,487	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	First of all we started treating ballots
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:40,511	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	More like currency
EDL	00:10:41,023	00:10:42,047	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Administrator
EDL	00:10:42,047	00:10:43,327	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	How to store them securely
EDL	00:10:44,351	00:10:49,727	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Store them safely they have to maintain a clear chain of custody over them to maintain the
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:50,239	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Integrity
EDL	00:10:50,751	00:10:51,519	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Of the election prop
EDL	00:10:52,031	00:10:54,079	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	They're often printed on special paper
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:55,615	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	To undermine counterfeiting
EDL	00:10:55,615	00:10:56,383	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Or efforts to
EDL	00:10:56,895	00:10:57,663	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Nick fraud
EDL	00:10:57,663	00:11:04,063	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	And with the Australian ballot as a Point of Departure polling places in the US began to see new machines the interface
EDL	00:11:04,063	00:11:05,855	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	With the official government printed ballot
EDL	00:11:06,367	00:11:08,671	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	They were machines where you pull levers
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:11,487	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Or use a metal rod to punch holes out of an object
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:16,351	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Will scan ballot like we saw with a butterfly ballot in Palm Beach County Florida in the two Thousand Eleven
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:19,423	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	There is tremendous variation

EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:21,471	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	It's elections
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:27,103	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	If you move across the county line your polling place could use an entirely different balance
EDL	00:11:28,127	00:11:30,943	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Because here's the really crazy thing about elections
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:31,455	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	The US
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:34,015	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Unlike much of Western Europe

EDL	00:11:48,863	00:11:50,911	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Of election procedures

EDL	00:11:52,703	00:11:53,983	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	And it can vary
EDL	00:11:54,751	00:11:57,055	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	At the county level or even within some count
EDL	00:11:57,823	00:11:58,591	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	How ballot
EDL	00:11:58,591	00:11:59,871	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	What are counted
EDL	00:11:59,871	00:12:00,383	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	And process
EDL	00:12:00,895	00:12:04,223	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	We do this because that's what the Constitution tells us to do
EDL	00:12:04,223	00:12:06,783	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	It says that states shall conduct elections
EDL	00:12:06,783	00:12:10,623	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	And the states generally delegate elections down to Municipal governments
EDL	00:12:10,623	00:12:15,487	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Partly because voters have so many things to vote for that each municipal government
EDL	00:12:15,487	00:12:16,767	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Why are zits on ballet

EDL	00:13:49,695	00:13:52,767	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	So whatever recommendations is use lowercase letters
EDL	00:13:53,535	00:13:56,607	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Mixed case print is just easier to read
EDL	00:13:56,607	00:13:58,655	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	This is actually been proven in studies
EDL	00:13:58,655	00:14:03,263	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	We also say avoid Center type type is for wedding invitations in Wind Lake

EDL	00:14:06,847	00:14:08,127	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Especially when like this
EDL	00:14:08,127	00:14:10,431	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Other recommendations include using
EDL	00:14:10,431	00:14:11,711	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Type in New York
EDL	00:14:11,711	00:14:13,503	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	In 2012 I think

EDL	00:14:20,927	00:14:25,535	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	The center for civic design also recommends using one sans-serif font
EDL	00:14:26,047	00:14:29,631	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	If you look at some of these balance their kind of a they look like Ransom notes

EDL	00:14:32,959	00:14:33,471	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	The whole thing
EDL	00:14:34,495	00:14:35,007	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Screaming at
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:40,383	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	We can, that down quite a bit by just going with one
EDL	00:14:40,895	00:14:41,663	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	San serif
EDL	00:14:42,943	00:14:48,319	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	The suggestion to the guide books for how to design a good ballot are akin to designing a good anything
EDL	00:14:48,319	00:14:50,367	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	When designers get ahold of these things are like
EDL	00:14:51,135	00:14:53,183	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	This is design 101
EDL	00:14:54,719	00:14:57,023	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	But election officials don't know this
EDL	00:14:57,023	00:14:59,583	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	And election officials unlike normal client
EDL	00:15:00,095	00:15:04,959	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Often have to uphold legislation requiring them to use bad design
EDL	00:15:04,959	00:15:07,007	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	If you go look at election code
EDL	00:15:07,007	00:15:08,799	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	In practically every state

EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:16,223	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	What's a typeface is what size it should be what the grid is
EDL	00:15:16,735	00:15:18,783	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	Bad designs

EDL	00:15:27,231	00:15:29,535	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	They also need to change laws
EDL	00:15:29,535	00:15:32,607	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	But one thing that might solve ballots for good is standardizing
EDL	00:15:33,375	00:15:37,471	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	It's actually a project with Dana chisnell and the center for civic design are also working on
EDL	00:15:38,239	00:15:40,543	| 99pi-0187-butterflyeffects-1 |	They built a prototype called the anywhere about
