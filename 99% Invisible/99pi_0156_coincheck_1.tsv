EDL	00:02:27,200	00:02:31,552	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	I told my housemate been about my coin and he was like oh yeah I have one of those

EDL	00:03:04,576	00:03:05,344	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	His
EDL	00:03:05,344	00:03:08,160	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	Avery and I figured out that these coins are called
EDL	00:03:08,160	00:03:09,184	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	Challenge coins
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:10,720	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	And they are coins
EDL	00:03:10,720	00:03:11,488	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	But they're not currency
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:13,280	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	And they're not quite metal
EDL	00:03:14,048	00:03:16,096	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	Challenge coins are something different
EDL	00:03:16,864	00:03:19,680	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	Everything that I say here today is my own
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:21,984	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	Personal opinion

EDL	00:03:30,688	00:03:35,552	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	She's encountered challenge coins many times throughout her career
EDL	00:03:35,552	00:03:38,880	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	Except for brand new
EDL	00:03:38,880	00:03:40,160	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	People coming in
EDL	00:03:40,160	00:03:42,208	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	Everybody will know that they exist
EDL	00:03:42,720	00:03:45,280	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	The degree to which they are used
EDL	00:03:46,048	00:03:47,840	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	Varies a great deal
EDL	00:03:47,840	00:03:51,680	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	This can depend on which military branch you serve in and your rank
EDL	00:03:51,680	00:03:53,216	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	But it goes further than that
EDL	00:03:53,216	00:03:55,776	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	There are so many different uses so many different
EDL	00:03:56,288	00:04:00,384	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	Kinds of things that the coins can symbolize depending on the context
EDL	00:04:00,384	00:04:01,152	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	Extinguisher
EDL	00:04:01,152	00:04:02,944	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	Looking at them or somebody is giving them
EDL	00:04:03,968	00:04:08,576	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	Carrie says that one of the meanings of the coins is made apparent in the act of giving or
EDL	00:04:08,576	00:04:09,088	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	Exchanging them
EDL	00:04:10,112	00:04:12,416	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	The coins are literal tokens of gratitude
EDL	00:04:12,928	00:04:14,464	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	Depreciation or love
EDL	00:04:14,976	00:04:15,488	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	Sympathy
EDL	00:04:16,512	00:04:22,911	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	There are powerful and tangible form of connection within an institution that is not known for being very touchy-feely
EDL	00:04:22,911	00:04:24,447	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	Billy can be difficult
EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:26,495	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	In certain context
EDL	00:04:27,007	00:04:27,519	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	2
EDL	00:04:28,031	00:04:30,591	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	Express emotion especially if it's across the ranks
EDL	00:04:31,615	00:04:32,383	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	Band
EDL	00:04:32,383	00:04:32,895	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	I do think
EDL	00:04:33,407	00:04:35,455	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	The coins are used in that way
EDL	00:04:35,455	00:04:38,015	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	It's a physical symbol of
EDL	00:04:38,015	00:04:43,903	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	Love affection or gratitude people might be given a coin for a job well done
EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:47,487	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	Because they're only so many ways to show appreciation within the military
EDL	00:04:47,487	00:04:50,559	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	You can't give a person a raise you can't give them a promotion
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:53,119	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	At least you can give them that symbolic
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:54,911	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	Indicator of our feelings about
EDL	00:04:56,447	00:04:56,959	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	What you're doing
EDL	00:04:57,727	00:05:02,079	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	Of course as Avery and I learned these coins are occasionally
EDL	00:05:02,591	00:05:04,383	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	Most of the time I would give
EDL	00:05:04,383	00:05:06,943	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	A coin just to say thank you for
EDL	00:05:06,943	00:05:07,711	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	You know helping me out
EDL	00:05:07,711	00:05:08,991	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	That's Chris McGrath
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:11,039	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	He's a chief petty officer in the Navy
EDL	00:05:11,551	00:05:12,319	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	And
EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:13,599	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	Collect and trade
EDL	00:05:13,599	00:05:14,111	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	Challenge coins
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:19,999	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	Chris says he gives coins out to co-workers old friends anyone who does a massage
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:26,911	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	And for that reason you end up finding these coins in places where you would not expect to find any connection to the military
EDL	00:05:26,911	00:05:29,727	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	Do you know like millions of wimpy podcasters like us
EDL	00:05:30,239	00:05:32,799	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	Unicorns are way to establish relationships
EDL	00:05:32,799	00:05:33,823	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	Outside of the inside

EDL	00:05:40,479	00:05:41,759	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	The fact that the military is
EDL	00:05:41,759	00:05:44,063	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	Is there but perhaps more importantly
EDL	00:05:44,575	00:05:46,367	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	That it's not some
EDL	00:05:46,367	00:05:46,879	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	Faceless
EDL	00:05:47,391	00:05:48,159	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	Monolithic

EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:54,559	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	There are human beings involved and they are human beings who can develop
EDL	00:05:55,071	00:05:58,143	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	A professional or personal relationship with somebody outside
EDL	00:05:58,143	00:05:58,655	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	The military
EDL	00:05:59,935	00:06:02,495	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	When I received my coin from the Pentagon tour guide
EDL	00:06:02,495	00:06:05,055	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	He just got of unceremoniously handed it to me
EDL	00:06:05,567	00:06:07,103	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	But within the military
EDL	00:06:07,103	00:06:10,687	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	What a sailor or Soldier or Pilot or Marine gives a coin

EDL	00:07:50,783	00:07:51,295	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	But

EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:36,863	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	As far as the history of challenge coins
EDL	00:08:37,375	00:08:40,703	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	There's sort of an apocryphal story that traces them back to World War 1
EDL	00:08:41,215	00:08:43,007	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	What an American army officers

EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:49,151	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	And then one of those men was captured by French soldiers
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:52,223	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	Who mistook him for a German and then he use his coin
EDL	00:08:52,223	00:08:53,247	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	To prove that he was in America
EDL	00:08:53,759	00:08:56,575	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	So the coins have also always been about identity
EDL	00:08:57,087	00:09:03,487	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	They do tell a story about how the union for the organization wants to be pursued

EDL	00:10:47,679	00:10:49,215	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	It's basically with the military.
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:54,847	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	Most of the time a unit gets together and talks about what they want on their coin and then gathers the money for it
EDL	00:10:54,847	00:10:55,615	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	Themselves
EDL	00:10:55,615	00:10:56,127	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	So we're not using tax

EDL	00:11:02,271	00:11:05,599	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	Because coins are not in the budget there's no set procedure for making
EDL	00:11:06,367	00:11:07,135	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	And no rules
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:09,183	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	Which means the design process
EDL	00:11:09,183	00:11:11,231	| 99pi_0156_coincheck_1 |	This is very informal
