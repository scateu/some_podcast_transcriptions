EDL	00:01:46,752	00:01:47,776	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	You could probably do it
EDL	00:01:47,776	00:01:48,544	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	No problem
EDL	00:01:49,312	00:01:50,848	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	Without having a button to push
EDL	00:01:50,848	00:01:51,872	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	You can close your eyes
EDL	00:01:52,384	00:01:54,432	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	And pretend to push a button
EDL	00:01:54,944	00:01:58,272	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	And that action would accurately reflect the action of pushing a real button
EDL	00:01:58,784	00:02:00,064	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	Same with flipping switch

EDL	00:02:08,768	00:02:11,328	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	Now if I asked you to do the same thing with a cars
EDL	00:02:11,328	00:02:12,096	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	Steering wheel
EDL	00:02:12,608	00:02:18,496	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	You think you'd be able to describe steering accurately and mine the correct movements with your hands in the air
EDL	00:02:19,008	00:02:20,288	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	But you'd be wrong
EDL	00:02:20,288	00:02:21,056	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	So wrong
EDL	00:02:21,568	00:02:23,360	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	You probably kill a bunch of imaginary people
EDL	00:02:24,128	00:02:25,408	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	But don't just take my word for
EDL	00:02:26,944	00:02:28,480	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	Even factors

EDL	00:02:34,624	00:02:35,904	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	And what was your research on
EDL	00:02:36,416	00:02:37,184	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	What's your mind
EDL	00:02:38,720	00:02:42,304	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	And that's Tristan cook and Thomas Nelson is also in the room they're asking
EDL	00:02:42,816	00:02:45,632	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	Steve Tristan and Tom run this awesome blog
EDL	00:02:45,632	00:02:46,400	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	Call humans and Design

EDL	00:02:48,192	00:02:49,728	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	Interests
EDL	00:02:49,728	00:02:50,496	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	Traffic behind
EDL	00:02:51,264	00:02:52,288	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	So here's the exercise
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:54,336	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	Put your hands up
EDL	00:02:54,336	00:02:56,384	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	And grip an imaginary steering wheel
EDL	00:02:56,384	00:03:00,736	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	Ellentube
EDL	00:03:01,760	00:03:02,784	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	Changing lanes
EDL	00:03:02,784	00:03:03,296	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	To the right
EDL	00:03:04,832	00:03:05,344	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	Have you tried it
EDL	00:03:06,624	00:03:07,904	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	All right if you like most
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:09,696	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	And according to Steve's research
EDL	00:03:09,696	00:03:12,000	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	We're talking the vast majority of people
EDL	00:03:12,512	00:03:15,584	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	You turned your imaginary wheel 45 degrees to the right or so
EDL	00:03:16,352	00:03:17,632	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	And then back to the center
EDL	00:03:18,400	00:03:20,192	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	And that's the action for changing lanes
EDL	00:03:20,704	00:03:21,216	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	But
EDL	00:03:21,984	00:03:22,752	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	That's not right
EDL	00:03:23,264	00:03:26,336	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	What you describe is actually the secrets of magnets that
EDL	00:03:26,848	00:03:27,872	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	Iroquois School
EDL	00:03:30,176	00:03:35,296	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	Do I actually change lanes you have to turn the steering wheel to the right then turn it back crossing the Centerline
EDL	00:03:35,808	00:03:39,392	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	Turning the wheel and equal amplitude to the left to correct your heading
EDL	00:03:39,392	00:03:40,672	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	And then back to the center
EDL	00:03:41,952	00:03:44,256	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	Knowing that this weird brain hiccup existed
EDL	00:03:44,768	00:03:48,096	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	Steve's team of the University of Queensland tested people in driving simulator
EDL	00:03:48,608	00:03:51,168	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	Turn off if you provided visual feedback
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:52,960	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	People could change lanes no problem
EDL	00:03:53,984	00:03:58,336	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	But as soon as you turned off the screen or blindfolded them and told them to change lanes
EDL	00:03:58,848	00:04:02,688	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	Even though they're only just moments ago successfully perform the correct action
EDL	00:04:03,712	00:04:04,480	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	They couldn't do it
EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:06,528	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	Buy produced pretty
EDL	00:04:06,528	00:04:07,552	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	Catastrophic errors
EDL	00:04:08,576	00:04:09,856	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	Given no other feedback
EDL	00:04:10,368	00:04:11,648	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	You can't change lanes
EDL	00:04:11,648	00:04:13,184	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	Using a steering wheel without vision
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:16,768	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	Recent cars are designed to be dreaming with your eyes open
EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:17,536	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	That's okay
EDL	00:04:18,047	00:04:21,119	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	And in fact this is a funky example that doesn't mean that a steering wheel
EDL	00:04:21,631	00:04:23,167	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	Is a bad interface design
EDL	00:04:23,679	00:04:27,519	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	You probably argue the opposite You could argue that a steering wheel is so well design
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:31,359	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	That anyone can use it with just a little bit of feedback in the real world
EDL	00:04:31,359	00:04:32,639	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	Even though they can't
EDL	00:04:32,639	00:04:34,687	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	Describe how they use it in the abstract
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:39,295	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	Data science
EDL	00:04:39,807	00:04:40,319	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	Expert

EDL	00:04:45,183	00:04:46,207	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	Size of the Earth
EDL	00:04:47,487	00:04:50,815	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	But Stephens researchers decided to test this in a real car
EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:52,095	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	So Steve got
EDL	00:04:52,607	00:04:55,167	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	I'm like 15 million dollars worth of insurance
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:04:58,751	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	It took people out in a real car and drove them down a test Road
EDL	00:04:59,263	00:05:01,311	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	And then took their Vision away
EDL	00:05:01,311	00:05:03,103	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	And ask them to change lanes
EDL	00:05:05,663	00:05:10,015	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	My friends Tristan to Tom where to the participants
EDL	00:05:11,295	00:05:14,111	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	It was absolutely terrifying
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:18,975	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	Little bit like when Obi-Wan Kenobi was teaching Luke Skywalker how to use a lightsaber without using his eyes
EDL	00:05:19,743	00:05:25,375	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	The blast shield down I can't even see in the first few runs people made the same mistake they did in the simile
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:27,423	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	Essentially they were told to change lanes
EDL	00:05:27,423	00:05:30,751	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	And they move the steering wheel in such a way that they turned a corner instead
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:33,311	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	Here's where things get really interesting
EDL	00:05:34,847	00:05:35,359	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	Straight Talk
EDL	00:05:39,455	00:05:44,319	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	People gradually started to improve and by the end of the real world blind trial
EDL	00:05:44,319	00:05:45,599	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	They were performing
EDL	00:05:45,599	00:05:46,367	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	Almost
EDL	00:05:46,367	00:05:47,135	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	Perfect
EDL	00:05:47,135	00:05:48,159	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	Laying chickens
EDL	00:05:55,327	00:05:57,375	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	In my experience there's no such thing as luck
EDL	00:05:58,143	00:05:59,679	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	When you driving

EDL	00:06:22,719	00:06:25,279	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	People learn how to perform the lane change
EDL	00:06:25,279	00:06:26,559	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	In a real car

EDL	00:06:27,839	00:06:28,863	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	But here's the crazy part
EDL	00:06:30,143	00:06:32,447	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	After it was over they asked the participants to
EDL	00:06:32,447	00:06:36,287	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	Mime a lane change with an imaginary steering wheel in their hands
EDL	00:06:36,799	00:06:37,823	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	And sure enough
EDL	00:06:37,823	00:06:42,431	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	They went right back to making the same mistake performing at corner turn in
EDL	00:06:42,431	00:06:43,199	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	Instead of a lane change
EDL	00:06:43,967	00:06:46,271	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	Just a ride bus this

EDL	00:06:56,767	00:06:58,815	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	Feedback to that our brain knows how to use it
EDL	00:07:02,655	00:07:04,447	| 37-The-Steering-Wheel |	Also I can't stress this enough people
