EDL	00:02:45,120	00:02:47,168	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	As a policy of good neighborliness
EDL	00:02:49,216	00:02:51,776	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	Apocalypse leaders like Hendrick forefoot
EDL	00:02:52,288	00:02:55,360	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	Claim that segregated cities were better for everyone

EDL	00:03:00,480	00:03:04,320	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	To make sure that white people and black people weren't living together
EDL	00:03:04,320	00:03:05,856	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	If you lived in a house
EDL	00:03:05,856	00:03:07,136	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	But come knocking on your door
EDL	00:03:08,160	00:03:13,024	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	But the apartheid system was never airtight and people found creative ways to slip through the cracks
EDL	00:03:13,536	00:03:15,328	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	If you lived in a high-rise building with

EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:31,456	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	Over the years many families like Louise
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:36,064	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	Disappeared into one high-rise apartment building in particular
EDL	00:03:36,064	00:03:41,696	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	The tower called Ponte City in Johannesburg
EDL	00:03:45,280	00:03:47,840	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	Everybody knows party
EDL	00:03:48,352	00:03:50,656	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	Even looking at joburg Skyline now

EDL	00:03:52,960	00:03:54,240	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	First of all it's
EDL	00:03:54,240	00:03:55,776	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	54 stories tall
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:03:59,616	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	That makes it the tallest apartment building on the entire African country
EDL	00:04:00,128	00:04:03,712	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	And it certainly makes a toilet than any of the other buildings around it
EDL	00:04:04,480	00:04:06,528	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	It's also completely secular
EDL	00:04:06,528	00:04:08,320	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	If you want to look at Ponte from above
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:12,672	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	You see that the center is Justice open hollow-core

EDL	00:04:16,768	00:04:17,536	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	The building looks
EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:19,839	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	Kind of like a massive concrete toilet roll
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:25,471	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	It's also got this glowing red billboard for a cell phone company wrapping around the top
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:26,239	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	Like a crown
EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:28,543	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	So wherever you are in the city
EDL	00:04:28,543	00:04:29,823	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	You can easily Spot It
EDL	00:04:30,591	00:04:34,943	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	Pontes larger-than-life architecture also comes with a larger-than-life reputation
EDL	00:04:35,711	00:04:38,015	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	So many the building symbolizes
EDL	00:04:38,015	00:04:38,527	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	Is Johannesburg
EDL	00:04:39,295	00:04:41,087	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	Because over the past four decades
EDL	00:04:41,599	00:04:43,903	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	Its fortunes have basically murdered the city
EDL	00:04:44,415	00:04:45,183	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	Because of its

EDL	00:05:17,183	00:05:18,975	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	But it's also been a laboratory
EDL	00:05:18,975	00:05:22,303	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	Place where the city seems to try out new versions of itself
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:26,655	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	Years before Ponte became a hideaway for interracial families like Louise
EDL	00:05:27,167	00:05:29,471	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	It attracted a much different clientele
EDL	00:05:29,983	00:05:32,031	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	I don't understand who first lived there and why
EDL	00:05:32,543	00:05:34,079	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	We have to go back to the 1960s
EDL	00:05:34,847	00:05:36,639	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	Before Ponte was even built
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:38,943	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	At the start of the 60s
EDL	00:05:38,943	00:05:42,783	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	The apartheid system had been firmly in place for more than 10 years
EDL	00:05:43,295	00:05:46,623	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	And South Africa's economy was a rising star in the world
EDL	00:05:47,135	00:05:52,767	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	It had just given birth to a new currency the Rand which was already stronger than the US dollar
EDL	00:05:52,767	00:05:57,887	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	The country's success was largely driven by its access to cheap black labour
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:05:59,167	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	And it's rich goldap
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:01,215	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	We were the major goal

EDL	00:06:03,007	00:06:06,847	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	And the feeling was that if we could continue being the magical

EDL	00:06:19,135	00:06:21,183	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	Foreign investments in South Africa doubled
EDL	00:06:21,695	00:06:24,255	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	But skilled workers were in short supply
EDL	00:06:24,255	00:06:28,863	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	Because the government had denied the majority of the population at decent education
EDL	00:06:29,375	00:06:34,239	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	It had to fill the Gap by recruiting single white men from all of Europe
EDL	00:06:35,007	00:06:40,127	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	The country's white population increased by over 50% between 1963

EDL	00:27:15,072	00:27:16,864	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	Films that are set in places where
EDL	00:27:16,864	00:27:19,424	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	There's something either kind of apocalyptic or just
EDL	00:27:20,704	00:27:22,496	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	Gritty and Messi going on
EDL	00:27:22,496	00:27:25,056	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	Right it has that Vibe it's not necessarily
EDL	00:27:25,056	00:27:26,848	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	Johannesburg by bits the
EDL	00:27:26,848	00:27:28,384	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	It's the vibe of apocalypse
EDL	00:27:28,384	00:27:29,408	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	Apps that it gives off
EDL	00:27:29,408	00:27:32,480	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	Yeah totally but you know you have to sort of wonder where it where did
EDL	00:27:32,480	00:27:38,880	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	Filmmakers get the idea that Punta would be the scene for the apocalypse and I think it's rooted in the kind of stereotypes that people have about the
EDL	00:27:38,880	00:27:39,648	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	Intercity of
EDL	00:27:39,648	00:27:40,416	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	Johannesburg
EDL	00:27:40,416	00:27:45,792	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	Which are then intern you know rooted and I think the fear is that a lot of South Africans have about the city in
EDL	00:27:45,792	00:27:47,072	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	And what it's become
EDL	00:27:47,072	00:27:48,096	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	Since the end of Apartheid
EDL	00:27:48,608	00:27:50,912	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	And there's also a number of films where
EDL	00:27:50,912	00:27:52,448	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	It's not it's early
EDL	00:27:52,960	00:27:55,776	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	Ponte works on esterly Johannesburg but there's this
EDL	00:27:56,288	00:27:57,312	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	The idea of
EDL	00:27:57,312	00:27:58,080	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	Tower
EDL	00:27:58,080	00:27:59,616	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	That's a city in of itself
EDL	00:28:00,128	00:28:01,408	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	That is its own sort of
EDL	00:28:01,408	00:28:02,432	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	Dark place
EDL	00:28:02,432	00:28:04,992	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	Dread for example reminds me of the way that
EDL	00:28:06,016	00:28:07,296	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	About Ponte city as well
EDL	00:28:07,296	00:28:12,928	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	Yeah exactly I know an interesting thing about dread is that the movie itself was filmed in Johannesburg

EDL	00:28:16,000	00:28:17,280	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	There's a sort of
EDL	00:28:17,280	00:28:18,304	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	Massive
EDL	00:28:18,304	00:28:21,632	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	Apartment Tower in in the in the Selma 200 story building
EDL	00:28:22,144	00:28:25,216	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	It has a hollow open course
EDL	00:28:25,216	00:28:27,520	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	So you have to wonder if you know where they got that idea
EDL	00:28:28,032	00:28:28,800	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	Right
EDL	00:28:28,800	00:28:31,360	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	Why do you think it's so evocative why do you think
EDL	00:28:31,360	00:28:32,384	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	Confused in this way

EDL	00:28:39,040	00:28:41,600	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	And I think the way it's come to be as a combination of
EDL	00:28:41,600	00:28:43,392	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	Two things and the one is that
EDL	00:28:43,392	00:28:45,184	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	Ponte has become the sort of
EDL	00:28:45,184	00:28:46,464	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	Metaphor for

EDL	00:28:55,168	00:28:57,472	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	Filmmakers have just picked up on that
EDL	00:28:57,472	00:28:58,496	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	And then the other thing is is
EDL	00:28:59,264	00:29:00,800	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	The aesthetic is to of the building is just
EDL	00:29:01,312	00:29:03,360	| 99pi-0277-pontecitytower-1 |	Pretty wild I mean it's just the sort of
