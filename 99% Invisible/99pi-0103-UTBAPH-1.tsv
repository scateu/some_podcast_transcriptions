EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:40,831	| 99pi-0103-UTBAPH-1 |	They're two Hallmarks of Pizza Hut Arkansas
EDL	00:04:41,855	00:04:43,647	| 99pi-0103-UTBAPH-1 |	One the whole thing is built out of traps
EDL	00:04:44,415	00:04:45,695	| 99pi-0103-UTBAPH-1 |	The windows are trapezoids
EDL	00:04:46,207	00:04:48,511	| 99pi-0103-UTBAPH-1 |	Enter frame for this kind of trapezoidal
EDL	00:04:48,511	00:04:49,535	| 99pi-0103-UTBAPH-1 |	Paneling on the exterior
EDL	00:04:50,047	00:04:54,399	| 99pi-0103-UTBAPH-1 |	If you remember your geometry you know that trapezoid is a four-sided figure with
EDL	00:04:54,399	00:04:57,471	| 99pi-0103-UTBAPH-1 |	Two parallel sides and two non parallel sides
EDL	00:04:57,471	00:04:58,751	| 99pi-0103-UTBAPH-1 |	It tends to look like a triangle
EDL	00:04:59,263	00:05:00,031	| 99pi-0103-UTBAPH-1 |	With the top chopped
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:03,615	| 99pi-0103-UTBAPH-1 |	I see the trapezoid windows then you know it's an old
EDL	00:05:03,615	00:05:04,127	| 99pi-0103-UTBAPH-1 |	Pizza Hut
EDL	00:05:05,151	00:05:08,735	| 99pi-0103-UTBAPH-1 |	And then there's the roof which often has oversized trapezoidal awnings
EDL	00:05:09,247	00:05:10,271	| 99pi-0103-UTBAPH-1 |	And were they all connected
EDL	00:05:10,271	00:05:13,087	| 99pi-0103-UTBAPH-1 |	The top is this big bump that just shoots into the air
EDL	00:05:13,599	00:05:15,135	| 99pi-0103-UTBAPH-1 |	Whole thing looks like a lid for the building
EDL	00:05:15,647	00:05:16,159	| 99pi-0103-UTBAPH-1 |	Bratz
EDL	00:05:16,671	00:05:17,439	| 99pi-0103-UTBAPH-1 |	Actually one of the
EDL	00:05:17,439	00:05:17,951	| 99pi-0103-UTBAPH-1 |	The kid I thought
EDL	00:05:18,463	00:05:18,975	| 99pi-0103-UTBAPH-1 |	Hot and Hot
EDL	00:05:19,743	00:05:20,255	| 99pi-0103-UTBAPH-1 |	Same thing
EDL	00:05:20,767	00:05:21,279	| 99pi-0103-UTBAPH-1 |	Thank you Pizza Hut
EDL	00:05:21,791	00:05:23,327	| 99pi-0103-UTBAPH-1 |	Now Pizza Hut Stone all look like
EDL	00:05:23,839	00:05:26,655	| 99pi-0103-UTBAPH-1 |	Franchise owners have a lot of freedom and how their stores look
EDL	00:05:27,167	00:05:29,215	| 99pi-0103-UTBAPH-1 |	Thought every Pizza Hut has the lid roof
EDL	00:05:29,215	00:05:31,775	| 99pi-0103-UTBAPH-1 |	And the trapezoid features and some might be
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:33,311	| 99pi-0103-UTBAPH-1 |	More distinctive than others
EDL	00:05:33,311	00:05:36,383	| 99pi-0103-UTBAPH-1 |	But there's still enough commonality in Pizza Huts
EDL	00:05:36,383	00:05:37,151	| 99pi-0103-UTBAPH-1 |	That
EDL	00:05:37,151	00:05:38,431	| 99pi-0103-UTBAPH-1 |	Once you've seen one
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:39,199	| 99pi-0103-UTBAPH-1 |	You can
EDL	00:05:39,199	00:05:42,015	| 99pi-0103-UTBAPH-1 |	Usually identify any other
EDL	00:05:42,015	00:05:44,831	| 99pi-0103-UTBAPH-1 |	The Pizza Hut School of Architecture is so distinctive
EDL	00:05:44,831	00:05:48,415	| 99pi-0103-UTBAPH-1 |	The even when a Pizza Hut goes under and gets converted into a different business
EDL	00:05:48,415	00:05:50,463	| 99pi-0103-UTBAPH-1 |	You can still totally tell
EDL	00:05:50,463	00:05:51,999	| 99pi-0103-UTBAPH-1 |	It used to be a Pizza Hut
EDL	00:05:54,303	00:05:56,351	| 99pi-0103-UTBAPH-1 |	And every town across the world
EDL	00:05:56,351	00:05:57,375	| 99pi-0103-UTBAPH-1 |	There used to be a pizza
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:06:02,495	| 99pi-0103-UTBAPH-1 |	Most of them are still standing in the most of them are not still Pizza Huts and so it's
EDL	00:06:03,007	00:06:06,079	| 99pi-0103-UTBAPH-1 |	It's this image that we just all happened when we're all so familiar with
EDL	00:06:06,591	00:06:08,639	| 99pi-0103-UTBAPH-1 |	Okay Mike is definitely overstaying in here
EDL	00:06:08,639	00:06:10,687	| 99pi-0103-UTBAPH-1 |	Not every town in the world has a form of
EDL	00:06:10,687	00:06:11,199	| 99pi-0103-UTBAPH-1 |	Pizza Hut
EDL	00:06:11,711	00:06:17,599	| 99pi-0103-UTBAPH-1 |	And I can get numbers on whether or not the majority of the old-school trapezoidal window Style Pizza Huts are still
EDL	00:06:17,599	00:06:18,367	| 99pi-0103-UTBAPH-1 |	Active Pizza Hut
EDL	00:06:19,135	00:06:19,903	| 99pi-0103-UTBAPH-1 |	But the fact remains
EDL	00:06:20,671	00:06:21,951	| 99pi-0103-UTBAPH-1 |	There's something really funny
EDL	00:06:22,719	00:06:28,095	| 99pi-0103-UTBAPH-1 |	A little sad but mostly funny about seeing a former Pizza Hut get turned into something else
EDL	00:06:28,095	00:06:30,655	| 99pi-0103-UTBAPH-1 |	The satirical newspaper the onion thought so too
EDL	00:06:30,655	00:06:32,447	| 99pi-0103-UTBAPH-1 |	They once had a headline that read
EDL	00:06:32,447	00:06:35,775	| 99pi-0103-UTBAPH-1 |	You can tell Area Bank used to be a pizza
EDL	00:06:37,055	00:06:38,335	| 99pi-0103-UTBAPH-1 |	It's funny to unvalidated
