EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:11,455	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	London Soho may have been first
EDL	00:06:12,223	00:06:16,063	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	But the American abbreviation of Soho and the birth of the acronym
EDL	00:06:16,063	00:06:18,111	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	Can be traced back to 1962
EDL	00:06:18,623	00:06:21,695	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	And a fellow by the name of Chester rapkin
EDL	00:06:21,695	00:06:25,023	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	He was an urban planner and
EDL	00:06:25,023	00:06:28,607	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	Eventually a member of the New York City Planning Commission
EDL	00:06:28,607	00:06:29,119	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	From the lake

EDL	00:06:32,447	00:06:33,471	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	And he was asked
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:36,287	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	To investigate the conditions
EDL	00:06:36,287	00:06:37,055	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	In what
EDL	00:06:38,079	00:06:41,663	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	He called or what the City Planning Commission called
EDL	00:06:41,663	00:06:42,687	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	The South
EDL	00:06:42,687	00:06:44,991	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	Houston industrial area
EDL	00:06:44,991	00:06:48,831	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	A lot of people think that the resulting paper known as the rapkin report
EDL	00:06:48,831	00:06:51,391	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	Invented the term Soho
EDL	00:06:51,391	00:06:52,159	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	I have
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:54,463	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	Recently read that report
EDL	00:06:54,463	00:06:58,047	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	And I do not believe that rapkin used
EDL	00:06:58,047	00:07:00,095	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	The term Soho
EDL	00:07:00,095	00:07:01,375	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	In that report
EDL	00:07:01,375	00:07:05,471	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	It's also been said that rapkin coined the term Soho in conversation
EDL	00:07:05,471	00:07:07,519	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	However it happened around this time
EDL	00:07:07,519	00:07:08,031	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	People
EDL	00:07:08,799	00:07:10,079	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	Seized upon
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:15,199	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	The term Soho has an abbreviation which is certainly better than the South Houston industrial area
EDL	00:07:15,711	00:07:16,479	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	But
EDL	00:07:16,479	00:07:19,551	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	Not nearly as badass as its previous name
EDL	00:07:19,551	00:07:20,575	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	Held Hundred Acre
EDL	00:07:21,855	00:07:26,463	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	In the 1950s and early 60s for industrial Manufacturing
EDL	00:07:28,767	00:07:30,815	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	At the time rabkin was writing the report
EDL	00:07:30,815	00:07:33,375	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	It was not the most Pleasant part of town
EDL	00:07:34,143	00:07:40,543	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	He mentioned in passing the Grim caverns of factory buildings in SoHo
EDL	00:07:40,543	00:07:42,079	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	That's absolutely true
EDL	00:07:42,079	00:07:45,407	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	The South Houston Industrial Area was threatened with demolition
EDL	00:07:46,175	00:07:50,783	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	Brick buildings with cast iron facades were seen as ugly outdated
EDL	00:07:50,783	00:07:51,295	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	Eyesores
EDL	00:07:52,063	00:07:53,599	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	I mean they were factories
EDL	00:07:54,111	00:07:58,463	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	Smack in the middle of downtown Manhattan there had been a major pressure
EDL	00:07:59,743	00:08:02,303	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	The part of city government as well as
EDL	00:08:02,303	00:08:04,351	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	Probably the real estate industry
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:05,631	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	To demolish these
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:06,655	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	Worthless building
EDL	00:08:07,423	00:08:08,959	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	And replace them
EDL	00:08:08,959	00:08:13,055	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	With one of the new residential projects
EDL	00:08:13,567	00:08:19,711	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	This was in the early sixties when New York City under the influence of Robert Moses was trying to tear down and rebuild
EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:21,759	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	They were wrecking ball happy
EDL	00:08:22,271	00:08:23,807	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	But the rap game report made
EDL	00:08:23,807	00:08:25,343	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	A plea to preserve
EDL	00:08:25,343	00:08:25,855	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	The factory
EDL	00:08:26,623	00:08:28,415	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	And the city held off on their plan
EDL	00:08:28,415	00:08:29,439	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	Rapkin
EDL	00:08:29,439	00:08:29,951	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	Said
EDL	00:08:30,463	00:08:34,559	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	The manufacturers in those buildings were viable
EDL	00:08:34,559	00:08:35,583	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	And it would be
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:37,119	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	Interesting
EDL	00:08:37,631	00:08:38,655	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	Maybe even great
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:41,727	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	If the manufacturing buildings

EDL	00:08:44,031	00:08:48,895	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	For manufacturing use nobody foresaw that the area
EDL	00:08:48,895	00:08:50,943	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	Would become colonized by artist
EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:56,831	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	Artist rented the manufacturing spaces for Studios
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:08:58,367	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	Soho
EDL	00:08:58,367	00:09:00,671	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	In the 1970s
EDL	00:09:00,671	00:09:01,951	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	Quickly gain

EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:17,567	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	For while the city skirted around this problem by classifying artists as
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:18,591	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	Machine
EDL	00:09:18,591	00:09:20,127	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	Who manufactured art

EDL	00:09:44,447	00:09:46,239	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	It was certainly the most
EDL	00:09:46,239	00:09:47,007	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	Prominent
EDL	00:09:47,007	00:09:48,031	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	In the media

EDL	00:09:59,551	00:10:00,319	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	Or as they called

EDL	00:13:03,871	00:13:10,271	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	So in the section of Philly most of the minority residents referred to as South Philly

EDL	00:13:14,879	00:13:21,279	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	Most commonly they use the name graduate hospital so named because of Hospital used to be in that neighborhood
EDL	00:13:21,279	00:13:25,375	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	Other people have referred to it as G so-so

EDL	00:13:40,735	00:13:43,295	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	But Jacqueline says the recent name in Russia
EDL	00:13:43,295	00:13:44,063	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	He's different
EDL	00:13:44,575	00:13:45,855	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	I would say that
EDL	00:13:45,855	00:13:48,927	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	There's an intention behind this and sort of a power

EDL	00:13:51,999	00:13:53,535	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	Yeah there's a group that's

EDL	00:14:07,871	00:14:12,991	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	Good for these neighborhoods they certainly needs investment but I think that idea that there is

EDL	00:14:25,535	00:14:26,815	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	This gets at the

EDL	00:14:41,919	00:14:42,943	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	Because it's specific
EDL	00:14:43,455	00:14:44,223	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	And it's efficient
EDL	00:14:44,735	00:14:50,879	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	I mean saying I live in Novi is obviously faster than saying I live at the border of North Oakland Berkeley and Emeryville

EDL	00:15:35,423	00:15:37,727	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	This is like the neighbors name is like
EDL	00:15:37,727	00:15:42,847	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	The old log in the woods and he looked up in a room and you see all the bugs underneath and that's the best interpretation

EDL	00:15:49,759	00:15:52,063	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	Acronyms are easy to Lampoon
EDL	00:15:52,063	00:15:55,391	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	They're ubiquitous to the point of parody and often
EDL	00:15:55,391	00:15:58,975	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	So we may see a shift away from these names

EDL	00:16:05,375	00:16:10,495	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	These names might sound more authentic like graduate Hospital in Philly or temascal in Oakland
EDL	00:16:11,007	00:16:13,311	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	But they're different names for the same thing

EDL	00:16:20,479	00:16:23,807	| 99pi-0204-thesohoeffect-1 |	I mean I feel like the bigger issues to respect the neighbors are moving into
