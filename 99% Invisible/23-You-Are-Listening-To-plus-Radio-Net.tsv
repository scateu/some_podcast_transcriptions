EDL	00:04:46,719	00:04:49,023	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	Sure that Taps into a remix and culture
EDL	00:04:49,535	00:04:51,071	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	Or new ideas can flourish
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:52,607	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	Since the site is launched and
EDL	00:04:53,631	00:04:56,191	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	It word gets around it's been very popular
EDL	00:04:56,191	00:04:59,007	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	I've been contacted by lots and lots of artists from SoundCloud
EDL	00:04:59,775	00:05:02,591	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	And they all want to be part of it they all think it's cool
EDL	00:05:02,591	00:05:05,407	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	And they're asking me can I have my music included on your site
EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:10,271	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	You know they're not getting anything out of it they're not getting paid there's no royalties there's nothing like that
EDL	00:05:10,271	00:05:12,319	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	But they are getting exposure I think these are people who
EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:15,647	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	Posted their music out there because they wanted to share it with people
EDL	00:05:15,647	00:05:18,463	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	And now they're finding their sharing with lot more people
EDL	00:05:18,463	00:05:18,975	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	So

EDL	00:06:48,575	00:06:49,855	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	And he brought up
EDL	00:06:49,855	00:06:56,255	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	Are old radio piece that I did until we're going to listen to his answer about these Revolution and things he wants to do

EDL	00:06:58,303	00:07:02,143	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	Then he going to mention something very special to me here at the end of this clip
EDL	00:07:02,911	00:07:03,423	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	Eagle
EDL	00:07:03,935	00:07:06,495	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	Moving forward I'd like to find a way for
EDL	00:07:06,495	00:07:08,031	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	People to be able to contribute to this
EDL	00:07:08,799	00:07:11,615	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	Some experiment with more apis more
EDL	00:07:11,615	00:07:13,919	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	Servicesonline that allow people to
EDL	00:07:13,919	00:07:17,247	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	Share audio post their thoughts in their writings about stuff
EDL	00:07:17,759	00:07:21,599	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	And then I want to find a way to be able to integrate those into the site into the audio stream
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:23,903	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	So then ultimately Maybe
EDL	00:07:23,903	00:07:24,927	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	You can choose between
EDL	00:07:25,439	00:07:26,719	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	Police radio or
EDL	00:07:27,487	00:07:33,631	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	Maybe like the audio equivalent of Twitter what did you have for breakfast what was the last thing that you watched on television before you went to bed
EDL	00:07:33,631	00:07:37,471	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	Because I think it's all those things mashed together would create an even more interesting kind of
EDL	00:07:37,471	00:07:39,775	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	Mashup of experiences and sounds
EDL	00:07:39,775	00:07:40,543	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	Textures
EDL	00:07:40,543	00:07:42,591	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	I was looking at your website
EDL	00:07:42,591	00:07:43,615	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	And one of the things was
EDL	00:07:43,615	00:07:44,383	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	The Sting radio net
EDL	00:07:45,407	00:07:46,175	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	Which
EDL	00:07:46,175	00:07:51,039	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	That kind of I'm like oh look someone's already done this and it with different technology 20 years ago
EDL	00:07:51,551	00:07:54,623	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	But that kind of was right where I was aiming which was like
EDL	00:07:55,135	00:07:57,183	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	Be able to take people's little short
EDL	00:07:57,183	00:07:58,463	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	Snippets of speech

EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:18,399	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	I have done so for most of
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:21,983	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	My adult life so the last
EDL	00:11:23,519	00:11:24,799	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	Almost 50 years
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:33,503	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	I was asked to do an interview radio interview

EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:37,855	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	And I thought
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:41,183	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	Rather than doing an interview why don't I try to do work that way
EDL	00:11:41,183	00:11:41,951	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	For the radio
EDL	00:11:42,463	00:11:43,743	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	This is a knife
EDL	00:11:43,743	00:11:48,863	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	66 at that time there were no radio call it shows for the idea of connecting the

EDL	00:11:53,215	00:11:54,495	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	Which I wanted to do
EDL	00:11:55,007	00:11:56,543	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	Make it to a space out of the radio

EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:05,503	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	Was unheard of and it was difficult to do in fact the engineer was so sure that we would have
EDL	00:12:06,015	00:12:06,783	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	So
EDL	00:12:06,783	00:12:08,575	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	So many bad words broadcast
EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:11,391	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	That he refused to consider
EDL	00:12:11,391	00:12:13,439	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	Project accept an interview
EDL	00:12:13,439	00:12:16,255	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	So he said in the end he would put the
EDL	00:12:16,255	00:12:18,815	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	A microphone in the studio for 2 hours
EDL	00:12:19,327	00:12:20,607	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	And what
EDL	00:12:20,607	00:12:22,655	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	I put into the microphone was up to me
EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:26,751	| 23-You-Are-Listening-To-plus-Radio-Net |	So I got 10 telephone lines installed into this
