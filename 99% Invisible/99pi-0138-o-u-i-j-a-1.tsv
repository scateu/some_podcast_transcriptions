EDL	00:12:21,375	00:12:22,143	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	It's just a game
EDL	00:12:22,655	00:12:24,191	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	Isn't it the new tagline
EDL	00:12:24,191	00:12:25,471	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	Do not play the Ouija board
EDL	00:12:28,799	00:12:33,919	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	The design is different to very long time the Ouija board

EDL	00:12:41,599	00:12:47,487	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	Older than the classic board it's brown and kind of weather and it looks like something you might find on a pirate ship
EDL	00:12:47,487	00:12:49,535	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	He will be gone for
EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:54,399	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	The older look just need because people assume these boards have been around for
EDL	00:12:54,399	00:12:55,935	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	Thousands of years which
EDL	00:12:55,935	00:12:57,215	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	I know isn't true
EDL	00:12:57,215	00:12:57,983	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	But
EDL	00:12:57,983	00:12:59,263	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	Belief is important
EDL	00:13:00,031	00:13:01,055	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	Belief is
EDL	00:13:01,055	00:13:04,895	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	Very important to the Ouija board especially subconsciously
EDL	00:13:05,663	00:13:07,967	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	Which brings us finally to
EDL	00:13:07,967	00:13:08,991	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	How these things work
EDL	00:13:10,527	00:13:13,343	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	Basically when it comes to the
EDL	00:13:13,343	00:13:14,111	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	Ouija board
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:15,647	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	The reason
EDL	00:13:15,647	00:13:16,159	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	That
EDL	00:13:16,671	00:13:17,951	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	It seems to work at
EDL	00:13:17,951	00:13:19,487	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	Feels as if it works
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:22,047	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	Is down to something called the ideomotor effect
EDL	00:13:22,559	00:13:25,119	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	I'm what that is essentially
EDL	00:13:25,119	00:13:27,423	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	Is non-conscious muscular moving
EDL	00:13:27,423	00:13:29,727	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	That's Professor Chris French
EDL	00:13:29,727	00:13:35,359	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	I am head of the anomalistic psychology Research Unit at goldsmiths University of London
EDL	00:13:36,895	00:13:38,687	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	Before you ask psychology
EDL	00:13:39,199	00:13:41,503	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	Is the psychology of
EDL	00:13:41,503	00:13:42,271	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	Weird stuff
EDL	00:13:43,807	00:13:50,207	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	The term ideomotor effect was first coined by an English physician and researcher named William Benjamin carpet
EDL	00:13:50,207	00:13:56,607	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	Back in 1852 right when spiritualism was starting to become popular both in Europe and the US
EDL	00:13:56,607	00:13:58,655	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	The ideomotor effect
EDL	00:13:58,655	00:14:00,703	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	Applies in the case of WeChat
EDL	00:14:00,703	00:14:07,103	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	In that our bodies are making small subconscious movements that are Guided by a suggestion or some subconscious
EDL	00:14:07,103	00:14:10,431	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	Knowledge of so particularly once the
EDL	00:14:10,431	00:14:16,831	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	So is lateral to husband has been made apparent and you kind of
EDL	00:14:16,831	00:14:18,623	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	Is going to come next so if it was
EDL	00:14:18,623	00:14:20,671	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	Spelling out a name
EDL	00:14:20,671	00:14:24,767	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	And it spells out the letter b and then I will be no trouble
EDL	00:14:25,791	00:14:29,631	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	And the ideomotor effect becomes magnified as more people play
EDL	00:14:29,631	00:14:32,703	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	I want very interesting things that happened
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:34,751	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	People who have played around with weave
EDL	00:14:34,751	00:14:35,519	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	Ouija board
EDL	00:14:35,519	00:14:37,311	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	Level very often
EDL	00:14:37,311	00:14:37,823	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	Claim
EDL	00:14:38,335	00:14:39,871	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	That they've got answers from the Ouija
EDL	00:14:41,151	00:14:42,175	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	Nobody around
EDL	00:14:42,175	00:14:42,943	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	Borat
EDL	00:14:42,943	00:14:45,503	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	Chile news out so that proves it was some
EDL	00:14:45,503	00:14:47,807	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	What kind of external agency
EDL	00:14:47,807	00:14:50,111	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	Professor French says that what's happening
EDL	00:14:50,111	00:14:53,439	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	Here is that our subconscious mind does actually know the
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:56,767	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	Answer our conscious mind just can't access the information
EDL	00:14:57,535	00:15:00,351	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	Researchers are so convinced of this
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:02,143	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	They've even used Ouija boards
EDL	00:15:02,143	00:15:02,655	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	To study
EDL	00:15:03,167	00:15:03,935	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	Subconscious
EDL	00:15:03,935	00:15:05,983	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	Super example in one of these studies
EDL	00:15:05,983	00:15:09,311	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	Participants were asked simple fact based questions like

EDL	00:15:13,663	00:15:14,175	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	Percent of the time
EDL	00:15:15,199	00:15:18,527	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	But when they used a Ouija board to help them answer the same
EDL	00:15:18,527	00:15:20,831	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	Ohio schools then
EDL	00:15:21,343	00:15:22,879	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	I got the answers right about

EDL	00:16:17,919	00:16:21,503	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	What's going on
EDL	00:16:23,039	00:16:26,623	| 99pi-0138-o-u-i-j-a-1 |	Another experience wasn't terribly strange or creepy
