EDL	00:08:39,935	00:08:41,471	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	The circuit is write letters of invitation

EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:56,575	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Uses the grueling

EDL	00:09:01,695	00:09:03,743	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	The test began pretty much right away
EDL	00:09:04,255	00:09:08,607	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	As soon as the Architects arrived at the fraternity house that I par had borrowed for the study
EDL	00:09:08,607	00:09:11,679	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	They had just 15 minutes of introduction before they took their first test
EDL	00:09:12,703	00:09:14,751	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	It was constant over the course of the weekend
EDL	00:09:14,751	00:09:19,103	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	The Architects would be asked to make mosaics to assess their aesthetic sensibilities
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:21,151	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Good in-depth interviews about their childhood
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:23,455	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	And even see if they could be hypnotized
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:28,319	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	And during the downtime they were still being observed by researchers with clipboard
EDL	00:09:28,319	00:09:30,111	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Even cocktails and dinner is it
EDL	00:09:30,623	00:09:31,647	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	It's the time of study
EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:32,415	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	It's a very very tights
EDL	00:09:33,183	00:09:35,487	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	But my favorite test The Architects did

EDL	00:09:41,119	00:09:45,727	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Groupon I like it because it deals with a question that comes up all the time or I could

EDL	00:10:39,231	00:10:41,791	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	The second character we're going to talk about in this group is

EDL	00:11:47,327	00:11:48,863	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	One fairly important aspect
EDL	00:11:49,375	00:11:55,775	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Basically the client would like to design altered in a specific way and says he will have to reject mr. B
EDL	00:11:55,775	00:11:57,055	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Brown's proposal if

EDL	00:12:18,303	00:12:19,071	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	The architect
EDL	00:12:19,071	00:12:20,095	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Then had to decide
EDL	00:12:20,863	00:12:22,655	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Should Brown accept the change
EDL	00:12:23,167	00:12:24,447	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	What is the project
EDL	00:12:24,447	00:12:28,287	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	No I would like you to discuss the issue candidly among yourselves and rejoin

EDL	00:12:39,039	00:12:42,111	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	So just sit back for a second and listen to the architect
EDL	00:12:42,623	00:12:43,647	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	And the ice

EDL	00:13:00,031	00:13:03,871	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Concerning says that since Brown doesn't have any other solution prepared
EDL	00:13:03,871	00:13:06,687	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	You should walk away
EDL	00:13:06,687	00:13:07,199	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	The job at this
EDL	00:13:14,879	00:13:18,207	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Let's fill up this regard to human beings Johnson butting in
EDL	00:13:18,719	00:13:21,023	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	It's a problem that's contrary to experience
EDL	00:13:21,535	00:13:23,839	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	It sounds very much like you've been reading iron rack
EDL	00:13:24,351	00:13:26,655	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	It sounds like you've been reading I am round
EDL	00:13:27,423	00:13:29,727	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Johnson is referencing the book The Fountainhead
EDL	00:13:29,727	00:13:32,543	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Where the main character is a fiercely independent architect
EDL	00:13:32,543	00:13:35,871	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	To blows up his own building rather than compromise with a client
EDL	00:13:36,895	00:13:40,223	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Make no mistake Johnson would also refuse the clients changes
EDL	00:13:40,223	00:13:42,271	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	But he just thinks this whole scenario is it
EDL	00:13:42,271	00:13:43,039	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Absurd
EDL	00:13:43,039	00:13:44,319	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	No good architect
EDL	00:13:44,319	00:13:45,343	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Would let this happen with a
EDL	00:13:46,111	00:13:48,671	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	I answered there that I would
EDL	00:13:56,351	00:13:57,375	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	And I never heard of it happening
EDL	00:13:58,911	00:14:03,263	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Have you actually seven and has been challenged by a client on a recent Commission

EDL	00:14:04,287	00:14:05,055	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Is threatening to quit
EDL	00:14:07,615	00:14:08,895	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Monday I have to get to
EDL	00:14:10,687	00:14:11,455	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Quit
EDL	00:14:11,455	00:14:14,271	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	You expect to win by quitting
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:15,039	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	I say that
EDL	00:14:15,551	00:14:16,575	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	The only part
EDL	00:14:19,391	00:14:19,903	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Yes
EDL	00:14:26,815	00:14:28,351	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Would you say that the case is
EDL	00:14:28,351	00:14:30,143	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Hopeless as intended
EDL	00:14:30,143	00:14:33,215	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Victor Lundy the Young Gun piping up
EDL	00:14:33,215	00:14:36,287	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	I confess that I have to admit the possibility of the
EDL	00:14:38,847	00:14:39,871	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Maybe there is a
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:41,151	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Something
EDL	00:14:41,151	00:14:42,943	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	And what the client is leading to
EDL	00:14:44,735	00:14:45,759	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Result in a better thing
EDL	00:14:46,271	00:14:47,551	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	The work of architecture
EDL	00:14:47,551	00:14:48,575	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Really really good
EDL	00:14:49,343	00:14:50,111	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Well then
EDL	00:14:50,111	00:14:51,135	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	The owner will say it

EDL	00:15:00,095	00:15:03,167	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Well know I'm young but I've seen some old thing
EDL	00:15:08,031	00:15:14,431	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	You Givin now the design can only get worse and worse than you worse for your reputation because of the function represented by
EDL	00:15:14,431	00:15:16,223	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	What is the future look
EDL	00:15:16,223	00:15:22,367	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	At the end of 35 minutes the group concluded that Mr Brown should reject the clients changes and walk away from the broad
EDL	00:15:22,879	00:15:27,487	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	This was the conclusion that all of the different architect groups ultimately came to
EDL	00:15:27,999	00:15:31,071	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Having this option is for the luxury of being a very famous architect
EDL	00:15:32,095	00:15:33,375	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	I hope in all of this that
EDL	00:15:33,887	00:15:34,655	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	John brown was right
EDL	00:15:41,055	00:15:43,615	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	After 3 grueling days of tests
EDL	00:15:43,615	00:15:47,455	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	After all the Architects went back to their respective practices all over the country
EDL	00:15:47,967	00:15:49,503	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	The state still wasn't quite over
EDL	00:15:50,015	00:15:52,575	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	The Architects were mailed surveys and questionnaires
EDL	00:15:53,855	00:15:55,391	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	To rank each other
EDL	00:15:55,391	00:15:58,719	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Some Architects refuse to rank themselves and their peers
EDL	00:15:58,719	00:15:59,487	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Others
EDL	00:15:59,487	00:16:00,511	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Jump Right In
EDL	00:16:00,511	00:16:03,327	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Philip Johnson rated himself number one
EDL	00:16:03,327	00:16:04,863	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Not surprisingly
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:07,423	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	But Saturday and Brady Johnson number 2
EDL	00:16:07,935	00:16:08,703	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	After himself
EDL	00:16:09,215	00:16:10,495	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Frontier number one
EDL	00:16:10,495	00:16:13,567	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	But the fact that people put themselves number one also talks about
EDL	00:16:14,079	00:16:14,591	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	The conception of
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:16,127	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Clearly
EDL	00:16:17,407	00:16:23,807	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	And The Architects conceptions of themselves messed with the findings from a lot of the other studies that iPod
EDL	00:16:23,807	00:16:24,831	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Far had done over the years
EDL	00:16:25,599	00:16:27,391	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	The researchers began to notice
EDL	00:16:27,391	00:16:28,415	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Certain patterns
EDL	00:16:28,415	00:16:30,719	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Cross creatives of all professions
EDL	00:16:30,719	00:16:31,487	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	All genders
EDL	00:16:31,999	00:16:32,767	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	WeChat
EDL	00:16:32,767	00:16:33,279	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Funding
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:37,631	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	But we got the same characteristics associated with a
EDL	00:16:37,631	00:16:41,727	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	People who were rated highest whether they would chemists or artists
EDL	00:16:41,727	00:16:43,007	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Another feels
EDL	00:16:43,519	00:16:47,359	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	It turns out all different kinds of creative people met similar descriptions
EDL	00:16:47,871	00:16:50,687	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Has an interesting interesting personality
EDL	00:16:50,687	00:16:55,039	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Is non-conforming and has high aspirations for self
EDL	00:16:55,807	00:17:00,159	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Also creatives preferred complexity and ambiguity over Simplicity in order
EDL	00:17:00,671	00:17:03,743	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Creative had the capacity to make unexpected connections
EDL	00:17:03,743	00:17:05,279	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Easy patterns in daily life
EDL	00:17:06,047	00:17:06,815	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	But
EDL	00:17:06,815	00:17:09,119	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Creative people didn't necessarily
EDL	00:17:09,119	00:17:11,167	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Have to have high IQs
EDL	00:17:11,167	00:17:13,471	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Intelligence isn't as important
EDL	00:17:13,471	00:17:14,751	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	The creativity is
EDL	00:17:15,263	00:17:16,543	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	People thought it was
EDL	00:17:18,847	00:17:20,895	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	So I guess that's another thing we found
EDL	00:17:20,895	00:17:22,943	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Average intelligence will do
EDL	00:17:22,943	00:17:28,575	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	And it's not as if this is directly related to intelligence but the school grade point average for the architect
EDL	00:17:29,087	00:17:30,111	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	What's a salad
EDL	00:17:30,111	00:17:31,135	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	B minor
EDL	00:17:31,135	00:17:33,183	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	So I par found that creative people
EDL	00:17:33,183	00:17:35,743	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	NTB non-conforming interesting
EDL	00:17:36,255	00:17:38,815	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Interested independent courageous
EDL	00:17:38,815	00:17:40,095	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	And self-centered
EDL	00:17:40,095	00:17:46,239	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Pretend to be they don't have to be a certain traits and they come up over and over again unless the creative person
EDL	00:17:47,263	00:17:50,079	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	But it doesn't mean that they're going to be exactly
EDL	00:17:50,079	00:17:52,639	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	I feel like I kind of couldn't guess all those right
EDL	00:17:53,663	00:17:55,711	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	I think it's a lot easier to
EDL	00:17:55,711	00:17:58,783	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	So we should have known that all along after weave
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:17:59,295	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Found it
EDL	00:17:59,807	00:18:03,903	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	This idea of the creative personality was remarkable at the time
EDL	00:18:04,415	00:18:06,975	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Ivar's findings were lauded and spread
EDL	00:18:06,975	00:18:08,255	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	But over the years
EDL	00:18:08,255	00:18:10,559	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	People began to think about personality differently
EDL	00:18:11,071	00:18:14,143	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	In the seventies an argument with emerging but maybe
EDL	00:18:14,143	00:18:16,191	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Personality wasn't something innate within us
EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:17,727	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Maybe
EDL	00:18:17,727	00:18:19,775	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Personalities are the results of our environment

EDL	00:18:24,127	00:18:24,895	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Called into question
EDL	00:18:25,407	00:18:27,455	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	The 1970s
EDL	00:18:27,455	00:18:28,479	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Was it

EDL	00:18:32,831	00:18:34,879	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	I should tell you about that
EDL	00:18:35,391	00:18:38,207	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	We had trouble getting grants we had trouble
EDL	00:18:38,207	00:18:40,255	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Getting Papers accepted and
EDL	00:18:40,767	00:18:44,095	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	And we had this horrible empty feeling ourselves

EDL	00:18:57,151	00:18:59,199	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	Beyond analyzing individuals
EDL	00:18:59,711	00:19:04,319	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	But just because people aren't using ipart's methods does not mean the study was all for not
EDL	00:19:04,831	00:19:08,927	| 99pi-0220-mindofanarchitect-1 |	I parred did proof that creativity wasn't this mysterious Untouchable thing
