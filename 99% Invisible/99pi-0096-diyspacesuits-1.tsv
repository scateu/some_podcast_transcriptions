EDL	00:01:47,008	00:01:50,848	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	This is Cameron Smith's ground-floor studio apartment in Portland Oregon
EDL	00:01:51,616	00:01:54,432	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	Let's do Lisa Pate also from Portland Oregon
EDL	00:01:54,432	00:01:58,528	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	To the creator of the public radio program and podcast called destination DIY
EDL	00:01:59,296	00:02:01,344	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	Do we have to say what DIY stands for
EDL	00:02:01,344	00:02:02,880	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	Sure it seems for do-it-yourself
EDL	00:02:03,392	00:02:09,792	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	You might think build your own space suit at home is a little extreme on the DIY Spectrum if you do I totally agree with you
EDL	00:02:09,792	00:02:12,096	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	Is pretty crazy we've talked about a lot of
EDL	00:02:12,096	00:02:16,960	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	Kind of do-it-yourself projects on destination DIY we have a very broad definition of
EDL	00:02:16,960	00:02:23,360	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	Do-it-yourself Way Beyond the cross and Home Improvement projects
EDL	00:02:23,360	00:02:26,432	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	That might first spring to mind when you hear the words do it yourself
EDL	00:02:26,944	00:02:31,808	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	And this is definitely up there with perhaps the most daunting of DIY projects that you could imagine
EDL	00:02:32,576	00:02:38,976	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	Sure there are commercial companies like Virgin Galactic and explore creating their own space gear and they are DIY
EDL	00:02:38,976	00:02:40,512	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	In the sense that they aren't NASA
EDL	00:02:41,024	00:02:42,560	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	But Cameron Smith is
EDL	00:02:42,560	00:02:44,096	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	Handcrafting his space suit
EDL	00:02:44,864	00:02:46,656	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	Under the suit I wear a
EDL	00:02:47,936	00:02:49,984	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	Pair of long johns
EDL	00:02:49,984	00:02:53,568	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	I showed some socks on to them so they don't slip up on my legs when I pee
EDL	00:02:53,568	00:02:54,080	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	I push my legs in
EDL	00:02:55,872	00:02:59,712	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	And I sewed I think I'm about 25 feet now of plastic
EDL	00:02:59,712	00:03:00,480	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	6 hose
EDL	00:03:00,480	00:03:03,552	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	It's sewn into the suit and ice water circulates
EDL	00:03:03,552	00:03:04,320	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	Do there and it keeps
EDL	00:03:04,320	00:03:04,832	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	McCool
EDL	00:03:05,600	00:03:10,464	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	And that's absolutely critical it gets so hot in the suit that you would pass out
EDL	00:03:10,464	00:03:12,000	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	I what's the temperature in their eyes
EDL	00:03:13,024	00:03:14,304	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	117 degrees
EDL	00:03:14,304	00:03:15,584	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	But it's
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:17,376	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	It's really crude you
EDL	00:03:17,376	00:03:17,888	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	See it
EDL	00:03:20,192	00:03:21,472	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	I don't have a sewing machine
EDL	00:03:22,496	00:03:24,032	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	So I just sit on my bed and I watch
EDL	00:03:25,568	00:03:28,128	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	The movie or something and just do it by hand
EDL	00:03:28,128	00:03:31,456	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	He's not kidding the sewing looks like something out of Frankenstein
EDL	00:03:31,456	00:03:32,992	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	The second layer of the suit
EDL	00:03:32,992	00:03:34,016	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	It's called the pressure bladder
EDL	00:03:34,528	00:03:38,112	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	It's basically forming a bubble around Cameron's body to hold the air in
EDL	00:03:38,624	00:03:41,952	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	The third layer goes over that and that's the
EDL	00:03:41,952	00:03:44,000	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	Pressure restraint clarinets made of
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:44,768	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	Panels
EDL	00:03:44,768	00:03:46,048	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	Of non-elastic
EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:47,328	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	Mesh
EDL	00:03:48,608	00:03:50,656	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	It looks like a like a cargo bags
EDL	00:03:51,424	00:03:52,448	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	So those are so.
EDL	00:03:52,960	00:03:54,496	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	Hoover the pressure bladder
EDL	00:03:54,496	00:03:55,264	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	Because
EDL	00:03:55,264	00:03:57,056	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	If you were to blow up just the pressure
EDL	00:03:57,056	00:03:57,568	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	Ship ladder
EDL	00:03:58,848	00:03:59,360	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	Contains the gas
EDL	00:04:00,640	00:04:02,944	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	It blows up into sort of like the Michelin Man
EDL	00:04:03,712	00:04:04,736	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	It in you you could
EDL	00:04:05,248	00:04:06,016	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	Survive
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:07,040	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	But you couldn't do anything
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:07,808	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	You can't bend your arm
EDL	00:04:08,576	00:04:10,880	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	You would be in kind of a spread eagle position

EDL	00:04:12,416	00:04:12,928	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	You couldn't do it
EDL	00:04:13,440	00:04:15,744	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	Total cost of Cameron Smith spacesuit
EDL	00:04:15,744	00:04:17,024	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	2000 bucks
EDL	00:04:17,024	00:04:19,839	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	Around 100 of 1% of the cost
EDL	00:04:19,839	00:04:20,607	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	Of the latest

EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:27,263	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	Become much cheaper and much more available and better
EDL	00:04:27,263	00:04:31,871	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	You can essentially build a do-it-yourself space program today and now luckily I'm
EDL	00:04:33,407	00:04:34,943	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	Cameron is not an astronaut
EDL	00:04:34,943	00:04:36,479	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	He's not even an engineer
EDL	00:04:36,479	00:04:38,271	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	He's actually an archaeologist
EDL	00:04:38,271	00:04:41,599	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	He's on faculty in the anthropology department at Portland State
EDL	00:04:42,623	00:04:44,415	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	But Cameron is an Explorer by Nature
EDL	00:04:44,927	00:04:46,975	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	He's been diving in Puget Sound
EDL	00:04:46,975	00:04:50,047	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	Survived Arctic Winters in Iceland and Alaska
EDL	00:04:50,047	00:04:52,863	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	And some of that Oregon's Mount Hood more times than he can count
EDL	00:04:53,631	00:04:55,935	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	The spacesuit is his latest and most
EDL	00:04:55,935	00:04:56,447	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	Ambitious
EDL	00:04:57,471	00:04:58,495	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	Showing their tits
EDL	00:04:58,495	00:04:59,263	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	Possible
EDL	00:04:59,263	00:05:00,543	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	To do it cheaply
EDL	00:05:00,543	00:05:03,871	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	Is I guess my part of this larger
EDL	00:05:03,871	00:05:04,895	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	Movement of
EDL	00:05:05,407	00:05:08,223	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	Opening space up too many rather than few
EDL	00:05:08,223	00:05:10,783	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	The spacesuit has been three years in the making
EDL	00:05:11,551	00:05:14,111	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	You only have to look around Cameron's tiny apartment
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:14,879	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	To see how committed he is
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:15,903	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	This project
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:17,695	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	Instead of hanging art on the wall
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:19,743	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	Cameron has each of the suits
EDL	00:05:19,743	00:05:21,791	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	Three layers hanging side-by-side neck
EDL	00:05:21,791	00:05:22,559	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	Odoo is bad
EDL	00:05:22,559	00:05:24,095	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	Which is surrounded by bookshelves
EDL	00:05:24,095	00:05:26,655	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	Crammed full of NASA patents and other research material
EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:32,543	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	His living room serves as the staging area for the gas canisters and the gondola where he test
EDL	00:05:32,543	00:05:33,311	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	The suit
EDL	00:05:33,311	00:05:35,871	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	Eventually he wants to connect that gondola
EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:40,735	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	And all of the life-support gear to a balloon that will take him 50,000 feet in the air
EDL	00:05:40,735	00:05:43,039	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	He is also showing the balloon himself
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:46,367	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	At 50000 feet above the surface of the Earth
EDL	00:05:46,879	00:05:48,159	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	Cameron will experience
EDL	00:05:48,159	00:05:49,183	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	Space like condition
EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:53,535	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	And that means he'll need his suit to protect him from extreme temperatures

EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:08,191	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	I got it
EDL	00:08:08,191	00:08:09,727	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	I have to almost run home
EDL	00:08:10,239	00:08:11,775	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	And build the thing and see if
EDL	00:08:12,543	00:08:13,311	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	So for me

EDL	00:08:30,207	00:08:31,231	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	He starts out on the

EDL	00:08:31,999	00:08:34,559	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	He has to Regal and shimmy his way into the

EDL	00:08:35,839	00:08:36,607	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	So right now
EDL	00:08:37,631	00:08:40,191	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	Put my leg up like that and Ben can start getting my

EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:47,103	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	You can inhale
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:47,871	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	But you can't exhale
EDL	00:08:48,639	00:08:50,943	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	It's a minor problem we will fix it

EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:54,271	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	What I mean
EDL	00:08:54,271	00:08:55,039	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	Is that
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:59,903	| 99pi-0096-diyspacesuits-1 |	The mechanism is so simple that I believe it can be fixed we just haven't got this
