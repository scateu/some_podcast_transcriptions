EDL	00:02:03,904	00:02:04,928	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	Broadcasting Company
EDL	00:02:15,424	00:02:21,824	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	For being only three tiny notes the NBC Chimes of had a colossal impact on media and culture for nearly
EDL	00:02:21,824	00:02:22,592	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	90 years
EDL	00:02:23,104	00:02:28,992	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	It was back in the late 1920s when NBC started using this for the first time to identify itself on the radio
EDL	00:02:34,624	00:02:36,672	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	WEA F New York
EDL	00:02:37,952	00:02:43,840	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	They became so iconic and so popular that they were the very first sound to ever be awarded a Nadia trademark
EDL	00:02:44,352	00:02:45,632	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	And that's hard to get
EDL	00:02:46,400	00:02:49,216	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	Take for example the Harley-Davidson engine sound
EDL	00:02:49,216	00:02:55,104	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	After six years of litigation and challenges from other companies they withdrew their application
EDL	00:02:55,616	00:02:58,688	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	Courts also denied Motorola's request to trade markets
EDL	00:02:58,688	00:02:59,456	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	Chirp
EDL	00:02:59,456	00:03:01,504	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	Saying that among other things
EDL	00:03:01,504	00:03:04,576	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	They didn't do a good enough job promoting it as an actual sound mark
EDL	00:03:05,344	00:03:09,952	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	Budweiser even tried to trademark the sound of an opening beer can
EDL	00:03:11,488	00:03:13,536	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	I think I'm going to go to the courts on this one
EDL	00:03:16,864	00:03:17,632	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	So
EDL	00:03:17,632	00:03:21,472	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	They're only about a hundred sounds that I've actually officially become us trademarks
EDL	00:03:21,472	00:03:23,776	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	And most of them are incredibly iconic
EDL	00:03:27,872	00:03:29,152	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	Ho ho ho
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:30,176	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	You got mail
EDL	00:03:34,784	00:03:39,136	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	The concept of the trademark is that it's something that's generally accepted
EDL	00:03:39,136	00:03:41,696	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	That can't be confused with something else
EDL	00:03:41,696	00:03:44,512	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	That you can make the case represents your Prada
EDL	00:03:45,024	00:03:46,304	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	That's Rick greenhut
EDL	00:03:46,304	00:03:52,192	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	Used to work for NBC and was actually the last person to ever officially play the Chimes on the NBC radio network
EDL	00:03:52,704	00:03:55,520	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	An audio trademark that doesn't have any lyrics in it
EDL	00:03:55,520	00:03:58,080	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	It's very hard to say will this represents my Prada
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:04:01,408	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	And the reason NBC could actually trademark that
EDL	00:04:01,408	00:04:02,688	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	Is they been doing it
EDL	00:04:02,688	00:04:05,248	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	For 40 years before anybody thought to trade market
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:10,624	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	Today whenever you think about branding you think about the visual Mark the visual logo
EDL	00:04:10,624	00:04:15,232	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	The back in the 1920s the most powerful form of mass communication was the radio
EDL	00:04:15,232	00:04:18,303	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	The only way you could brand yourself would be through sound
EDL	00:04:19,327	00:04:23,935	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	Everybody heard that in the 50s or 60s would instantly know it was NBC
EDL	00:04:24,447	00:04:29,311	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	The Chimes were everywhere they were so popular that they even appeared in some pop songs
EDL	00:04:35,967	00:04:41,343	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	This is announcers Blues recorded in 1936 by Paul Whiteman and his orchestra
EDL	00:04:42,111	00:04:48,255	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	The artist behind this next track NBC I love you remains a broadcasting mystery
EDL	00:04:59,263	00:05:03,103	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	To understand where the Chimes came from we have to go back nearly a century
EDL	00:05:03,615	00:05:10,015	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	Stations were using Chimes gonz all kinds of different musical devices to
EDL	00:05:10,015	00:05:12,319	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	To create a sound signature for themselves
EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:14,111	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	This is John Schneider
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:15,135	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	A radio historian
EDL	00:05:15,903	00:05:18,463	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	Chimes in particular would have been an easy choice
EDL	00:05:18,463	00:05:19,999	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	Due to how common they were
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:26,655	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	Dinner times were often used to summon guest to the table and it was also used to indicate the start-and-stop of intermission
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:35,615	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	NBC created a
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:42,015	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	7 note sequence in the idea was that at the end of each program the announcer is that the microphone
EDL	00:05:42,015	00:05:46,623	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	Who sang this is the National Broadcasting Company would strike a 7 note
EDL	00:05:46,623	00:05:51,487	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	Chime sequence on a set of hand chimes that he held next to the microphone
EDL	00:05:57,631	00:06:01,471	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	As you could imagine since this is being played live by the announcer
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:02,751	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	It was really hard to keep him
EDL	00:06:03,519	00:06:04,799	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	So they shortened it
EDL	00:06:04,799	00:06:05,567	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	3 notes
EDL	00:06:05,567	00:06:08,639	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	Originally the three notes were caf
EDL	00:06:11,199	00:06:14,783	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	Which had the same sound that we noted a chest in a different key
EDL	00:06:15,295	00:06:17,343	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	Eventually they use the notes
EDL	00:06:17,343	00:06:18,111	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	Gec
EDL	00:06:20,927	00:06:23,999	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	Would some people think stood for the General Electric Company
EDL	00:06:24,767	00:06:30,143	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	That would have been the coolest branding story having the gec chime stand for the General Electric Company
EDL	00:06:30,655	00:06:34,751	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	But the truth is General Electric didn't have much to do with NBC until later
EDL	00:06:35,519	00:06:37,567	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	Eventually because
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:42,687	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	It still wasn't being done uniformly on the hand chimes they went to an electronic device
EDL	00:06:43,199	00:06:49,599	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	I remember getting a tour of the technical facility
EDL	00:06:49,599	00:06:51,903	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	That's right green hat again it was the
EDL	00:06:51,903	00:06:53,439	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	Strange thing back in the rack
EDL	00:06:53,951	00:06:55,487	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	I said what's that they said
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:56,767	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	It's a Chimes machine
EDL	00:06:57,535	00:07:03,935	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	NBC hired an electronic Oregon Pioneer Captain Richard Wrangler to build more of an automated system for playing the show
EDL	00:07:03,935	00:07:04,447	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	Chimes
EDL	00:07:09,055	00:07:13,919	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	Not only did the Chimes server branding purpose but it also solved a really big technical challenge
EDL	00:07:14,431	00:07:16,479	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	When they would change Studios
EDL	00:07:16,479	00:07:19,807	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	They would be literally plugging and unplugging these patch cord
EDL	00:07:19,807	00:07:22,367	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	And it would make kind of clicks and pops on the air
EDL	00:07:22,879	00:07:25,439	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	Since we end each show with the Chimes
EDL	00:07:25,439	00:07:29,535	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	Each Studio would have a take control button and a chimes
EDL	00:07:30,559	00:07:36,959	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	When you push the x button it would take that studio off the air under the sound of the Chimes
EDL	00:07:36,959	00:07:38,495	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	I didn't hear the click
EDL	00:07:43,359	00:07:48,479	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	Aside from its iconic cultural status the NBC Chimes also played a really important role in history
EDL	00:07:49,247	00:07:53,855	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	Outside of radio the only other form of mass communication was through newspaper
EDL	00:07:54,367	00:07:56,927	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	There was no medium that
EDL	00:07:56,927	00:08:00,767	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	Past news or information or entertainment to the public
EDL	00:08:00,767	00:08:01,791	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	In real time
EDL	00:08:01,791	00:08:03,071	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	Again John Schneider
EDL	00:08:03,583	00:08:06,911	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	And all of the people who were Pioneers they had to invent
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:08,959	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	Techniques that we take for granted today
EDL	00:08:09,471	00:08:10,751	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	It must have been
EDL	00:08:10,751	00:08:13,823	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	Fascinating time to participate in birth
EDL	00:08:13,823	00:08:15,615	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	Modern Electronic media
EDL	00:08:20,735	00:08:24,319	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	One of radio's most important moments came during World War II
EDL	00:08:24,831	00:08:30,975	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	For the first time in history news from the front lines of War can become available to the Mass public in near real-time
EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:35,071	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	Radiohead discovered its importance
EDL	00:08:35,071	00:08:38,399	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	As a news medium and not just an entertainment medium
EDL	00:08:38,911	00:08:45,311	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	During the war NBC at 1/4 time to covertly notify announcers that important breaking news with eminent
EDL	00:08:45,311	00:08:48,127	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	If the normal chime was gec
EDL	00:08:48,127	00:08:52,223	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	At the end of a program they would buy the chime gec

EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:34,015	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	The NBC Chimes were not
EDL	00:11:34,015	00:11:35,295	| 99pi-0238-NBCCHIMES-1 |	Part of the sale
