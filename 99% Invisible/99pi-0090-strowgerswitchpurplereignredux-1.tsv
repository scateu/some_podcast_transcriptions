EDL	00:08:14,079	00:08:17,407	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Okay I designed a lot of apartment buildings
EDL	00:08:17,407	00:08:17,919	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	In Chicago
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:21,503	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	We're here to talk about the purple Hotel
EDL	00:08:21,503	00:08:25,855	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	I need you say I designed my name is Jonas. I'm an architect I designed to
EDL	00:08:25,855	00:08:26,367	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Purple

EDL	00:08:32,511	00:08:33,279	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Finally
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:37,375	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Now you have to understand that when I say the building is purple
EDL	00:08:37,375	00:08:40,447	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	I don't mean the kind of purple of saying Iris
EDL	00:08:40,447	00:08:41,215	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Score a plum
EDL	00:08:41,727	00:08:44,031	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	It's purple as an lavender
EDL	00:08:44,031	00:08:48,639	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Lavender purple glazed brick all over pretty much the entire thing
EDL	00:08:48,639	00:08:51,711	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Which needless to say makes it stand out
EDL	00:08:51,711	00:08:53,503	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Depending on how you look at it
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:55,039	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Like a prized Jewel

EDL	00:08:59,647	00:09:02,463	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	You single forever you can't feel
EDL	00:09:02,975	00:09:08,095	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	It is so purple that after it changed hands the new owners renamed it

EDL	00:09:14,495	00:09:17,055	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	I think that it's worth looking at
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:19,359	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Absent the break the brick I like
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:23,199	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	But I wish you could eat a little Plum last-second filter it out so you don't see
EDL	00:09:23,199	00:09:23,967	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	The Brick
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:25,503	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	At least in one trip
EDL	00:09:25,503	00:09:28,319	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	And really see how the building hold yourself together structure
EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:33,695	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Good the way that John was able to put the support to the outside of the hotel
EDL	00:09:33,695	00:09:38,559	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Get larger floor plates in the middle
EDL	00:09:39,071	00:09:41,631	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	And then I get a little mix of green space in the way back
EDL	00:09:42,143	00:09:47,263	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	So the buildings can I stick together with a lot of good things going on there
EDL	00:09:51,103	00:09:53,151	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	The thing that everybody notices first
EDL	00:09:53,151	00:09:54,175	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Including architects

EDL	00:09:56,479	00:10:00,063	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	I mean I think that if anybody saying that it's not the color that they're lying
EDL	00:10:00,063	00:10:01,087	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Because you can't really look
EDL	00:10:03,135	00:10:03,647	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Purple
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:06,463	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	So it's the only purple building
EDL	00:10:06,463	00:10:07,231	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Around but then
EDL	00:10:07,743	00:10:13,375	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	You know after that initial wave of color hits you you notice really what a great modern a structure that has
EDL	00:10:13,887	00:10:14,655	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Structure

EDL	00:10:20,031	00:10:20,799	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	I think it's a wonder

EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:53,311	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	The purple by the way the purple came
EDL	00:10:53,311	00:10:57,663	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Because one of the pritzkers A and the big man among the

EDL	00:12:37,503	00:12:38,271	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Do you think it worked
EDL	00:12:38,271	00:12:39,039	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Hotel
EDL	00:12:40,319	00:12:43,135	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	So you don't think the purple kept away the evil eye from the hotel
EDL	00:12:43,903	00:12:44,671	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Not really
EDL	00:12:45,183	00:12:45,951	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Because
EDL	00:12:45,951	00:12:49,535	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	And that was a murder in the hotel actually there were two
EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:50,303	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	But I digress
EDL	00:12:51,583	00:12:54,143	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	The beauty of that building is the exposed

EDL	00:13:07,711	00:13:10,783	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	That would be weird right now that's that's the
EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:12,831	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	The building is that column set

EDL	00:13:15,647	00:13:16,927	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Slightly pulled out
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:17,951	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	It's a Building B
EDL	00:13:18,463	00:13:21,023	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Reveals its structure
EDL	00:13:22,047	00:13:24,351	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	And that is architectural e
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:26,143	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	The interesting thing about

EDL	00:13:31,007	00:13:32,287	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	It could be green
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:32,799	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Okay
EDL	00:13:33,823	00:13:35,871	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	It would be the same good or bad built
EDL	00:13:36,895	00:13:38,943	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	So as an architect I have to ask you
EDL	00:13:40,479	00:13:43,039	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	This is a perfect example of
EDL	00:13:43,807	00:13:46,623	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	What the what the difference between what the public sees
EDL	00:13:47,391	00:13:48,159	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	And what the Arctic
EDL	00:13:49,183	00:13:49,951	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Absolute
EDL	00:13:49,951	00:13:52,255	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Because the public sees purple brick
EDL	00:13:52,255	00:13:55,839	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	The architect is sitting here saying the purple is so
EDL	00:13:56,351	00:13:57,375	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Unimportant
EDL	00:13:57,375	00:13:58,399	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	In the scheme of the building
EDL	00:13:58,911	00:14:00,191	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	It means nothing
EDL	00:14:00,191	00:14:03,519	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	It's just such a tiny thing but to the public that's all it is
EDL	00:14:04,287	00:14:06,335	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	That's right because the public is ignorant
EDL	00:14:09,407	00:14:11,199	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Truly ignorant
EDL	00:14:11,967	00:14:14,015	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Well you can't really argue with him there
EDL	00:14:14,015	00:14:16,575	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	But in our defense and I count myself is
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:18,623	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	One of the public in the scenario
EDL	00:14:18,623	00:14:25,023	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	It's really really purple white how far the purple Hotel fell from its original Glory.

EDL	00:14:29,631	00:14:31,423	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	It was not torn down
EDL	00:14:31,423	00:14:32,447	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Time passed
EDL	00:14:32,447	00:14:33,983	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Economy fell to pieces
EDL	00:14:33,983	00:14:36,031	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Mid-century architecture
EDL	00:14:36,031	00:14:37,823	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Slowly came back into Vogue
EDL	00:14:37,823	00:14:39,359	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Mad Men was on TV
EDL	00:14:39,871	00:14:46,015	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Purple brick was kind of retro cool however dim was starting to shine on the building and its future
EDL	00:14:46,783	00:14:52,927	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Then the purple Hotel was nominated for landmark status a place on the historic registry
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:59,839	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	There was talk of finding a buyer talk of renovation and then while I was searching and interviewing for this
EDL	00:14:59,839	00:15:00,863	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Dairy story

EDL	00:15:02,143	00:15:02,911	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Went up
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:06,751	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	For auction there was a lot of Pomp and Circumstance in the beginning of
EDL	00:15:07,263	00:15:10,079	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	You know the auctioneer yelling
EDL	00:15:10,079	00:15:10,847	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Saying
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:12,127	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Are you ready
EDL	00:15:14,175	00:15:15,199	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Booming voice
EDL	00:15:16,223	00:15:16,735	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	And then
EDL	00:15:17,759	00:15:18,527	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Really
EDL	00:15:18,527	00:15:19,807	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	There was only one bidder so
EDL	00:15:23,903	00:15:29,791	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	And that bitter was Jake Weiss of Weiss properties in Skokie which happens to be right next to Lincolnwood
EDL	00:15:30,303	00:15:32,351	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	He bought the purple Hotel
EDL	00:15:32,351	00:15:36,703	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	And why why is a shrewd businessman with a Keen Eye and good instincts
EDL	00:15:36,703	00:15:38,495	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	This particular purchase
EDL	00:15:38,495	00:15:39,519	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Was also
EDL	00:15:39,519	00:15:44,639	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	A labor of love when you have some of that really is just not realizing of the value and its potential
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:49,759	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	That is such a prime piece of property it bothers you you know it is part of your neighbors Carter community
EDL	00:15:50,271	00:15:53,855	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	And it's something that you really want to see be an asset to the community instead of a blight
EDL	00:15:53,855	00:15:55,903	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Here comes the love part
EDL	00:15:55,903	00:15:59,743	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Separately from that when my and more importantly I think
EDL	00:15:59,743	00:16:02,047	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	We almost lived at the purple hotel for a period of time
EDL	00:16:02,559	00:16:03,839	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Maya
EDL	00:16:03,839	00:16:07,423	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	When my grandfather passed away and my father was saying the traditional Thai Dish
EDL	00:16:07,423	00:16:09,215	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	That's the Jewish prayer for the Dead
EDL	00:16:09,215	00:16:13,311	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	There was no synagogue anywhere in close proximity to where he lived at the time
EDL	00:16:13,823	00:16:16,639	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	And because we're Orthodox when I drive on the Sabbath
EDL	00:16:16,639	00:16:19,199	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	That was a little bit prohibitive to say the kaddish
EDL	00:16:19,711	00:16:20,991	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	There's a very
EDL	00:16:22,015	00:16:28,415	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Convenient show right down the block so I'm
EDL	00:16:28,415	00:16:30,719	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Every single shop is 4 a year
EDL	00:16:30,719	00:16:33,023	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	How we would move into the purple Hotel
EDL	00:16:33,023	00:16:36,863	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Had to accommodate my father's responsibility to say the kaddish for his father
EDL	00:16:37,375	00:16:40,703	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	So we lived there for about a year every single weekend
EDL	00:16:41,215	00:16:44,799	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	And you know me and my sister at the hotel was our playground
EDL	00:16:45,311	00:16:50,943	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	And the architect Weiss has chosen to redesign the purple hotel and bring it back to its original luster

EDL	00:17:04,767	00:17:06,559	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Restoration of the building
EDL	00:17:06,559	00:17:12,703	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Especially since we have some of the old drawings the original drawings from the 60s
EDL	00:17:13,215	00:17:17,567	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	And there are a lot of pieces that are still left in the building such as this wonderful
EDL	00:17:17,567	00:17:23,967	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Monumental Terrazzo stair with this wood wall behind it I mean you can really see it as a
EDL	00:17:23,967	00:17:24,479	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Kind of
EDL	00:17:25,759	00:17:30,623	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	You know late 50s early 60s kind of Mad Men era

EDL	00:17:34,207	00:17:35,231	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	That really could
EDL	00:17:35,231	00:17:39,071	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Be very current in today's Hospitality environment
EDL	00:17:39,839	00:17:43,423	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	That culture today especially in the hospitality Market
EDL	00:17:43,423	00:17:49,823	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	For some reason purple is a predominant color not necessarily the color of the break but in order marketing I mean you'll look at the
EDL	00:17:49,823	00:17:54,431	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	The neon lights and the color of the key fob cards and the
EDL	00:17:54,431	00:17:56,735	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Brochures that get printed for some reason
EDL	00:17:57,247	00:17:59,295	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Purple is popping and I'm not quite sure why
EDL	00:18:02,623	00:18:04,415	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Have any of your buildings
EDL	00:18:04,415	00:18:04,927	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Had
EDL	00:18:05,439	00:18:06,463	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	This kind of
EDL	00:18:06,463	00:18:08,255	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	History this kind of life cycle
EDL	00:18:08,767	00:18:09,279	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	But you know
EDL	00:18:10,303	00:18:11,071	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	None of them
EDL	00:18:11,583	00:18:16,703	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	The same way that a person they go through life and you might go through different Cycles yourself and

EDL	00:18:20,543	00:18:24,127	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Ups and downs I think the same holds true for
EDL	00:18:24,127	00:18:28,479	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	A property like this that really was a character of itself the building was
EDL	00:18:28,991	00:18:32,575	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Really a product of the environment around it at any given time and
EDL	00:18:32,575	00:18:36,159	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	And I feel certain extent the fact that the building did change
EDL	00:18:36,159	00:18:36,927	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	With

EDL	00:21:56,352	00:21:57,888	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	5 months
EDL	00:21:57,888	00:21:58,656	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	To tear it down
EDL	00:21:59,168	00:22:01,984	| 99pi-0090-strowgerswitchpurplereignredux-1 |	Because 75% of it needs to be recycled
