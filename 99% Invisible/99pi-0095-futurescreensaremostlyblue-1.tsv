EDL	00:06:08,127	00:06:09,663	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	You know like on Star Trek
EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:11,455	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	And they said it has to open up like this
EDL	00:06:11,967	00:06:13,247	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	The Argonne Engineers just
EDL	00:06:13,247	00:06:14,527	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Expected the phone to open up work
EDL	00:06:15,039	00:06:16,319	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	My Captain Kirk's communicator

EDL	00:06:18,367	00:06:19,903	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	And they went back in
EDL	00:06:19,903	00:06:23,999	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	And made it open the right way and then and then the next

EDL	00:06:54,207	00:06:57,535	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	They didn't have the production budget just require tons of

EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:05,983	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	And as a cost-saving move they should have
EDL	00:07:05,983	00:07:08,799	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Develop this idea of what we can just print out film

EDL	00:09:59,551	00:10:02,367	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Basically making sense of the plot hole that surface when
EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:04,415	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Various religious stories
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:05,695	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Are stacked on top of

EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:10,047	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	If you just assume for the sake of arguing
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:12,863	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Everything in sci-fi is there for a reason
EDL	00:10:13,375	00:10:15,167	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	You can find some really interesting less
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:16,447	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Design
EDL	00:10:16,447	00:10:17,727	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	So let's consider Star Wars
EDL	00:10:18,239	00:10:21,823	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Name of that part when Luke and Han Solo or in the Millennium Falcon blowing up
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:37,439	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	If you really in space watching this ship
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:38,207	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Glow up
EDL	00:10:38,207	00:10:39,231	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Wouldn't hear anything
EDL	00:10:39,999	00:10:45,887	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	I mean really takes that that moment where you have to describe it you realise wait a minute they are fighting in the vacuum of space
EDL	00:10:46,399	00:10:48,959	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Where exactly is the sound propagated
EDL	00:10:48,959	00:10:52,543	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Because sound is how our brain interprets the vibration of air molecules
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:54,079	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Of which there aren't any
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:54,591	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	In space
EDL	00:10:55,103	00:10:56,895	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	So why do we hear these ships
EDL	00:10:56,895	00:10:57,663	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Exploding in the film
EDL	00:10:58,687	00:11:01,247	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	The easy answer would be oh that's just Lucas
EDL	00:11:01,247	00:11:03,039	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Trying to make something that feels right
EDL	00:11:03,039	00:11:04,063	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	People who were used to
EDL	00:11:04,575	00:11:05,855	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	World War II films
EDL	00:11:07,135	00:11:07,647	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	But in fact
EDL	00:11:08,159	00:11:10,719	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	If you imagine that scene without the audio
EDL	00:11:10,719	00:11:12,511	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	It's a lot more miserable of attack
EDL	00:11:13,023	00:11:15,071	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	To Nowhere In
EDL	00:11:15,071	00:11:17,119	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	3D space of these Tie fighters around me
EDL	00:11:17,631	00:11:18,911	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	How would I find them
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:23,519	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Sure you could give me a screen but that requires me that I take my eyes off of the action
EDL	00:11:23,519	00:11:24,543	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	You can give me a heads up to
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:26,079	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Display which might work but
EDL	00:11:26,591	00:11:27,615	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Audio is
EDL	00:11:27,615	00:11:31,711	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	360° much more than my what is 120 degrees of vision
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:34,527	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	So that if that audio wasn't there
EDL	00:11:35,039	00:11:36,575	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Then you would expect somebody to put
EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:39,391	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Sensors on the outside of the Millennium Falcon and provide
EDL	00:11:39,903	00:11:42,207	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	3D sound inside the gun ownership that would
EDL	00:11:42,207	00:11:43,743	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Put that audio there
EDL	00:11:43,743	00:11:45,023	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	So the so the sound is an interface
EDL	00:11:45,535	00:11:46,303	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	The sound is
EDL	00:11:46,303	00:11:47,327	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	But the main part of interphase
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:49,119	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Right at yes
EDL	00:11:49,119	00:11:52,703	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Luke can look at this TIE fighter but he's also aware that
EDL	00:11:52,703	00:11:55,263	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Coming over his right shoulder is another one
EDL	00:11:55,263	00:11:58,591	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	But as soon as he this one explode he's got to turn his gun into
EDL	00:11:59,359	00:12:00,127	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	That's
EDL	00:12:00,127	00:12:02,431	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	That's vital to that interface of working
EDL	00:12:02,431	00:12:03,711	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Are you going to get there by
EDL	00:12:04,479	00:12:05,503	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Trying to reconceive
EDL	00:12:06,015	00:12:07,295	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Why does that thing
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:08,319	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Seems broken
EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:09,343	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Would really work
EDL	00:12:09,343	00:12:11,647	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Okay so here's another one 2001 A Space Odyssey
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:13,183	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Directed by Stanley Cup
EDL	00:12:13,183	00:12:18,559	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	2001 Dr Floyd is on a satellite and making a video call to his daughter back on Earth
EDL	00:12:19,071	00:12:20,095	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Bad
EDL	00:12:20,095	00:12:20,863	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Hello
EDL	00:12:22,399	00:12:22,911	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Are you a square
EDL	00:12:24,191	00:12:24,703	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	What you doing
EDL	00:12:28,287	00:12:28,799	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Where is Bombay
EDL	00:12:29,823	00:12:31,359	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Country shopping
EDL	00:12:31,359	00:12:32,639	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	And then you see his daughter
EDL	00:12:32,639	00:12:33,919	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Start button mashing
EDL	00:12:33,919	00:12:34,943	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Controls on the video
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:37,759	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	But strangely you don't hear any of the button
EDL	00:12:38,271	00:12:39,295	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Now you can sing
EDL	00:12:39,295	00:12:41,599	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Hey that's wrong what was the sound designers
EDL	00:12:41,599	00:12:42,367	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Sleeping on the job
EDL	00:12:42,879	00:12:44,671	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	But with our apologetics hat on
EDL	00:12:44,671	00:12:45,439	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	But in fact
EDL	00:12:45,951	00:12:46,975	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	That's the way it is
EDL	00:12:46,975	00:12:47,743	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Thoughts to work
EDL	00:12:47,743	00:12:48,767	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	If you had a
EDL	00:12:49,279	00:12:52,095	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	System that was context aware and that would include awareness of
EDL	00:12:52,095	00:12:52,863	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	The identity of a
EDL	00:12:52,863	00:12:53,631	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	What's user
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:56,703	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	It would say I've looked at this conversation
EDL	00:12:56,703	00:13:01,823	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	No one has asked at this little girl to push a button she's a little girl of about 5 or 6 years old
EDL	00:13:01,823	00:13:03,615	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	And it's indiscriminate mashing
EDL	00:13:03,615	00:13:06,175	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	I can safely disregard this is input
EDL	00:13:06,175	00:13:07,199	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	It's not a crisis
EDL	00:13:07,199	00:13:07,967	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	It's not a select
EDL	00:13:08,479	00:13:12,831	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	So if you were designing a system that was truly context-aware that's exactly the way you would
EDL	00:13:13,343	00:13:14,367	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	And anyone with a
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:16,671	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	We had to have a telephone call with a kid would know this
EDL	00:13:16,671	00:13:18,207	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Is actually the way it should be built
EDL	00:13:18,207	00:13:19,487	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Into the inputs to the interface
EDL	00:13:19,999	00:13:21,535	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Or just not getting relay
EDL	00:13:21,535	00:13:22,303	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	The interface
EDL	00:13:22,303	00:13:23,071	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Is actively
EDL	00:13:23,583	00:13:24,607	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Russian five
EDL	00:13:24,607	00:13:27,167	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Interfaces should not just interpret
EDL	00:13:27,167	00:13:28,703	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	But but also report
EDL	00:13:28,703	00:13:29,471	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	That's
EDL	00:13:29,471	00:13:32,287	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Only broken if you presume that the
EDL	00:13:32,799	00:13:35,103	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Interface is a dumb capturing device
EDL	00:13:35,615	00:13:36,127	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Television
EDL	00:13:36,895	00:13:39,711	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	If instead you re conceive of it as sort of a real time
EDL	00:13:39,711	00:13:40,479	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Scanner
EDL	00:13:40,479	00:13:42,015	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Interpreter and
EDL	00:13:42,015	00:13:42,783	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Presenter
EDL	00:13:42,783	00:13:46,367	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	You got an opportunity there to actually interpret the information
EDL	00:13:46,367	00:13:47,391	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Let's do one more
EDL	00:13:47,391	00:13:49,439	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	This one's kind of tricky but stick with it
EDL	00:13:49,439	00:13:50,463	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Lesson 6
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:52,511	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Find the human factor
EDL	00:13:52,511	00:13:53,791	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	And technological shorts
EDL	00:13:54,815	00:13:56,607	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	For this lesson we go to a movie called Logan's
EDL	00:13:57,375	00:13:58,655	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Where there's this interface
EDL	00:13:58,655	00:13:59,423	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	It's called the circle
EDL	00:14:00,191	00:14:02,751	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Which people of this post-apocalyptic World used
EDL	00:14:02,751	00:14:03,263	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Define
EDL	00:14:05,055	00:14:07,615	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Ex-partner skits Craigslist it's
EDL	00:14:07,615	00:14:10,175	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Even weirder than crack it is so hot
EDL	00:14:10,175	00:14:11,199	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Energy audit sayings
EDL	00:14:13,247	00:14:14,783	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	So Logan is hanging out
EDL	00:14:14,783	00:14:15,807	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Department of the future
EDL	00:14:16,319	00:14:17,855	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Insurance on this thing called the circuit
EDL	00:14:18,367	00:14:20,671	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Which basically lets him tune in different
EDL	00:14:20,671	00:14:21,439	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	People who are
EDL	00:14:21,951	00:14:23,487	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Ostensibly available for
EDL	00:14:24,511	00:14:28,351	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Couple anyway the thing about the circuit is that it's a really clumsy piece of
EDL	00:14:28,351	00:14:29,119	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Technology
EDL	00:14:29,119	00:14:30,399	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	We can see that takes
EDL	00:14:30,399	00:14:32,703	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Kind of a long time to turn someone in
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:33,983	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Events at the Logan
EDL	00:14:33,983	00:14:36,287	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Decide quick yes or no as to whether he wants
EDL	00:14:36,287	00:14:37,055	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Pull that person
EDL	00:14:37,567	00:14:38,335	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Into his apartment
EDL	00:14:38,847	00:14:39,871	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Or send them back out
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:41,919	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Either as an interface
EDL	00:14:42,431	00:14:42,943	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	It's
EDL	00:14:43,455	00:14:44,223	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Unbelievably bad
EDL	00:14:44,991	00:14:46,015	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	For lots of rain
EDL	00:14:46,527	00:14:48,831	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Like the male gaze problem alone in this case
EDL	00:14:49,855	00:14:51,135	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Morally reprobate
EDL	00:14:51,135	00:14:51,647	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Isabel
EDL	00:14:52,159	00:14:53,695	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	But if you can get past that for second
EDL	00:14:53,695	00:14:56,511	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	I just noticed that the circuit only lets you tune in one person that
EDL	00:14:57,279	00:14:58,815	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Do you have to give a quick yes no answer
EDL	00:14:59,327	00:15:01,119	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	As to whether you want that person
EDL	00:15:01,119	00:15:02,143	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Coming into your apartment
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:05,215	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	If he's going along and he sort of suzhou
EDL	00:15:05,215	00:15:11,615	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Number one's not good number two is not good number three is not good number for okay maybe it was a two or one that was better
EDL	00:15:11,615	00:15:12,639	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Maybe I can go back but
EDL	00:15:12,639	00:15:14,431	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	You don't see a mechanism to go back
EDL	00:15:14,431	00:15:15,711	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	And to make things worse
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:18,527	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	There seems to be no ability to adjust the settings of
EDL	00:15:18,527	00:15:19,039	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	What
EDL	00:15:19,551	00:15:20,575	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Who you might want
EDL	00:15:21,599	00:15:25,695	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Like the first person that Logan Tunes in is a guy and you can see right away that our hero
EDL	00:15:26,207	00:15:28,255	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Triple him or any other dude
EDL	00:15:28,255	00:15:28,767	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Hinduism
EDL	00:15:29,535	00:15:30,815	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Pardon my
EDL	00:15:30,815	00:15:37,215	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Gender or sexuality binary here but one of the most fundamental things you would name is what's the gender of
EDL	00:15:37,215	00:15:37,983	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	My
EDL	00:15:37,983	00:15:39,007	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Possible partners
EDL	00:15:39,007	00:15:42,591	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	And that he didn't have a single preference setting on this interface
EDL	00:15:42,591	00:15:43,615	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	So it just seems horrible
EDL	00:15:44,127	00:15:44,895	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	But
EDL	00:15:44,895	00:15:45,919	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	There is evidence
EDL	00:15:45,919	00:15:47,967	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	If this design has some Merit
EDL	00:15:47,967	00:15:50,015	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	If you can think of an apologetic for it
EDL	00:15:50,527	00:15:52,575	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	I used to play this game with
EDL	00:15:52,575	00:15:53,343	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Friends of mine
EDL	00:15:53,343	00:15:54,879	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	I called the 11th Man game
EDL	00:15:55,391	00:15:56,927	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	An 11th Man game
EDL	00:15:56,927	00:15:59,231	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Or XI woman game depending on how you're playing with
EDL	00:15:59,743	00:16:01,791	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	I works as follows when
EDL	00:16:01,791	00:16:06,655	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	You're sitting in a public place you pick a doorway and you challenge that friend who say Okay want you
EDL	00:16:06,655	00:16:07,423	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	2Pac
EDL	00:16:07,423	00:16:08,191	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	One of the neck
EDL	00:16:08,191	00:16:11,007	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	10 people to walk through that doorway to

EDL	00:16:14,335	00:16:16,383	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	And or you will be forced
EDL	00:16:16,383	00:16:17,919	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	To do that same thing with XI
EDL	00:16:18,687	00:16:20,735	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Okay so you're with me is he person
EDL	00:16:20,735	00:16:21,759	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Yes or no you say
EDL	00:16:21,759	00:16:22,527	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	I know you can
EDL	00:16:22,527	00:16:23,807	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Yes or no
EDL	00:16:23,807	00:16:24,575	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	I know you
EDL	00:16:24,575	00:16:27,903	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Three you can't go back and pick a previous person no going back
EDL	00:16:28,415	00:16:31,231	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	And if you say no all the way up through the 10th person
EDL	00:16:31,231	00:16:32,767	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	You have to take the 11th
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:36,095	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	So according to Chris when you start off playing again
EDL	00:16:36,095	00:16:37,375	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Can you begin to play this
EDL	00:16:37,375	00:16:38,655	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	People are looking at negatives
EDL	00:16:39,423	00:16:40,191	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Oh well let's
EDL	00:16:40,703	00:16:43,519	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Pretending playing with a heterosexual man he be like I don't know she's
EDL	00:16:43,519	00:16:49,919	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Shih Tzu short or I don't like her hair color whatever I'm eventually would get to 11 and I didn't expect that I deal with a gram
EDL	00:16:49,919	00:16:51,967	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	And then he
EDL	00:16:51,967	00:16:52,479	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Freak out
EDL	00:16:52,991	00:16:54,271	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	But after playing for a while
EDL	00:16:54,271	00:16:55,807	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	There's the shift in strategy
EDL	00:16:56,319	00:16:58,111	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	I'm looking for reasons to reject someone

EDL	00:17:00,671	00:17:02,975	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Over time the strategy shifts from that
EDL	00:17:02,975	00:17:05,535	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Negative view Twitter positive language
EDL	00:17:05,535	00:17:06,815	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	What is wrong with this
EDL	00:17:07,583	00:17:08,095	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	But what is right
EDL	00:17:09,119	00:17:10,655	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	And then being satisfied with
EDL	00:17:10,655	00:17:11,423	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Choice
EDL	00:17:11,423	00:17:13,983	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	I'm in over time people begin to
EDL	00:17:13,983	00:17:15,007	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Adopt that
EDL	00:17:15,007	00:17:15,775	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Positive

EDL	00:17:22,943	00:17:24,735	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	And the limits of the technology
EDL	00:17:25,247	00:17:29,087	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Are such that Logan can we specify yes or no and can't go back to
EDL	00:17:29,087	00:17:33,439	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	The previous choice
EDL	00:17:33,439	00:17:35,999	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	More likely to find an acceptable Choice sooner
EDL	00:17:35,999	00:17:36,767	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Because
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:38,815	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	He's immediately Prime to look
EDL	00:17:38,815	00:17:40,351	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	For the positive attributes
EDL	00:17:40,351	00:17:42,911	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	In the candidates that follow
EDL	00:17:42,911	00:17:45,727	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	I'm at Super subtle in fact I think when I first started talking about this
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:47,263	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	I kept talking about how bad it was
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:51,615	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Ottoman stumbled across this goodness which is as good a way to get to apologetics is any
EDL	00:17:52,127	00:17:54,431	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	I love this game of design apologetic
EDL	00:17:54,431	00:17:57,503	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Because greater knowledge and awareness usually leads us down a path
EDL	00:17:58,015	00:17:59,295	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Of miserable nitpicking
EDL	00:18:00,063	00:18:03,647	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	And I'm over good criticism but if you can apply a design solution
EDL	00:18:03,647	00:18:05,439	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Two account for a bad design
EDL	00:18:05,439	00:18:06,207	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Decision
EDL	00:18:06,207	00:18:06,975	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	In a Sci-Fi movie
EDL	00:18:07,487	00:18:09,279	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	It uses the same
EDL	00:18:09,279	00:18:10,559	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Critical muscle
EDL	00:18:11,327	00:18:13,887	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	But in a different way and the Apologetics
EDL	00:18:13,887	00:18:14,911	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Are endless
EDL	00:18:14,911	00:18:18,751	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Like for example let's take lesson number three about bad gestural interface
EDL	00:18:19,263	00:18:21,311	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Maybe in The Minority Report world
EDL	00:18:21,311	00:18:22,335	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	People work
EDL	00:18:22,335	00:18:23,615	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Wheelie sedentary
EDL	00:18:23,615	00:18:26,175	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	And these types of interfaces where the way to get people
EDL	00:18:26,175	00:18:28,991	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Get some freaking exercise
EDL	00:18:28,991	00:18:31,807	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Gestural interfaces might be okay
EDL	00:18:31,807	00:18:33,087	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	And it leads us to our final
EDL	00:18:33,599	00:18:34,623	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Lesson 7
EDL	00:18:35,135	00:18:36,671	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Find your own design

EDL	00:18:38,463	00:18:40,511	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Who's talking sci-fi apologetics
EDL	00:18:40,511	00:18:41,023	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Chris and Nathan
EDL	00:18:41,535	00:18:43,327	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	I can't help it look for them everywhere now
EDL	00:18:44,095	00:18:44,863	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	I even found one.
EDL	00:18:46,399	00:18:48,447	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	We had gone off on some tangent about the Star Wars
EDL	00:18:49,215	00:18:52,031	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Queen Amidala has an interface for which we cannot
EDL	00:18:52,031	00:18:56,895	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Apologized which is ironic because I believe I deserve an apology for every aspect
EDL	00:18:56,895	00:18:58,175	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Of the Star Wars prequel
EDL	00:18:58,175	00:19:00,479	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	On her giant silvery spaceship
EDL	00:19:01,247	00:19:04,575	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	I'm and I'm sure it has a name somewhere in the Star Wars Canon but I can't remember
EDL	00:19:04,575	00:19:06,879	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	A shirt that serve big panel of controls
EDL	00:19:07,391	00:19:10,975	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	But when you review it the three times that she uses
EDL	00:19:10,975	00:19:12,511	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Uses an interface aboard the ship
EDL	00:19:13,023	00:19:16,095	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Are they are for routing a hologram or volumetric
EDL	00:19:16,095	00:19:17,119	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Projection across the Galaxy
EDL	00:19:18,143	00:19:19,423	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Second time she uses it is
EDL	00:19:19,423	00:19:21,215	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	For summoning a star chart of a
EDL	00:19:21,215	00:19:21,983	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Distant planet
EDL	00:19:23,263	00:19:25,055	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	And the third
EDL	00:19:25,055	00:19:27,871	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Is to land her spacecraft on corset
EDL	00:19:27,871	00:19:29,151	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	But when you look at those interface
EDL	00:19:29,663	00:19:31,455	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	The actual interaction she has it
EDL	00:19:31,455	00:19:33,503	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Did you press the exact same button
EDL	00:19:33,503	00:19:34,783	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	On the panel
EDL	00:19:34,783	00:19:35,807	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	On the ship
EDL	00:19:35,807	00:19:38,367	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	To do all three things and nothing else
EDL	00:19:38,367	00:19:41,439	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Is that you see her using the same single button
EDL	00:19:41,439	00:19:42,975	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Burberry different tasks
EDL	00:19:42,975	00:19:43,743	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Right
EDL	00:19:43,743	00:19:45,023	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	But I actually came up
EDL	00:19:45,023	00:19:46,047	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	With my very own app
EDL	00:19:46,047	00:19:46,815	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Apologetic
EDL	00:19:46,815	00:19:50,399	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	You know if she's the queen she probably has love underlings
EDL	00:19:50,399	00:19:52,191	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Probably someone
EDL	00:19:52,191	00:19:55,007	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Somewhere offscreen who does everything for her
EDL	00:19:55,007	00:20:00,639	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	And this is the make it sew button that I like that computer management
EDL	00:20:00,639	00:20:07,039	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Communications management room somewhere on the ship and they're just like oh she wants to do something but why I like that be hilarious as you press the button
EDL	00:20:07,039	00:20:11,903	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Annabelle ring in another room literally a little. LOL
EDL	00:20:14,207	00:20:15,743	| 99pi-0095-futurescreensaremostlyblue-1 |	Right
