EDL	00:02:15,168	00:02:17,472	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Construction project in providence's history
EDL	00:02:18,752	00:02:21,312	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Obviously this one building and
EDL	00:02:21,312	00:02:21,824	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	We
EDL	00:02:22,336	00:02:24,384	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	So does student all watching it
EDL	00:02:24,384	00:02:25,152	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Get built
EDL	00:02:27,200	00:02:31,808	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Michael townzen is an artist who live nearby when the mall was still under construction in the 1990s
EDL	00:02:32,320	00:02:34,624	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	The daily running route took him past the construction site
EDL	00:02:35,136	00:02:38,464	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	And Michael says that if he wants to go out he had an open mind about the
EDL	00:02:38,464	00:02:39,232	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Project
EDL	00:02:39,232	00:02:41,024	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	He was cautiously optimistic
EDL	00:02:41,024	00:02:42,816	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	That would be a welcome addition to the neighborhood
EDL	00:02:44,864	00:02:45,632	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Yeah yeah
EDL	00:02:45,632	00:02:47,168	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Itsfunneh
EDL	00:02:47,168	00:02:48,192	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Devotion
EDL	00:02:48,192	00:02:51,264	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	To a building like that doesn't really kick in until the skin gets put on
EDL	00:02:51,776	00:02:58,176	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	When something is in his Erector Set mode where you just sing the skeleton like I have a pretty full skeleton but as soon as
EDL	00:02:58,176	00:02:59,712	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	The Flash is there like
EDL	00:03:00,224	00:03:01,504	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Not Freddy
EDL	00:03:02,272	00:03:04,064	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Providence Place is going to be a big
EDL	00:03:04,064	00:03:05,344	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Boxy Soccer Shop
EDL	00:03:05,344	00:03:07,392	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Without much in the way of architectural nicety
EDL	00:03:08,160	00:03:14,048	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	And his runs Michael watched as that big box was slowly filled with the things that make them all Amal
EDL	00:03:14,048	00:03:15,328	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	As it's being built
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:17,376	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	I start to sort of
EDL	00:03:18,144	00:03:19,168	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Do mental Maps
EDL	00:03:20,448	00:03:21,216	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Spaces
EDL	00:03:21,216	00:03:25,056	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Does that seem to store that's me a storage space that's going to be parking
EDL	00:03:25,568	00:03:30,432	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	But amidst all the construction there was one part of the building that kept catching Michael die
EDL	00:03:30,432	00:03:36,832	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Weird space in the guts of the architecture that didn't make sense
EDL	00:03:36,832	00:03:43,232	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	It didn't seem to meet the profile of either sore space or parking space or store
EDL	00:03:43,232	00:03:46,560	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Space Michael wasn't sure what the spaces for
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:52,448	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	It seemed to exist only by virtue of the Wold intended for the more legitimate spaces around it
EDL	00:03:52,448	00:03:53,728	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	But the result was this
EDL	00:03:53,728	00:03:54,240	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Room
EDL	00:03:54,752	00:03:56,544	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	It was an accidental room
EDL	00:03:57,056	00:04:01,152	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	A remainder left over by the long division of the malls architecture
EDL	00:04:01,152	00:04:03,200	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	I've never seen anything like it
EDL	00:04:03,200	00:04:05,248	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Maritime Iran
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:08,064	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	It was something I would never think about
EDL	00:04:08,576	00:04:14,208	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Michael eventually put the strange room out of his mind he probably would have forgotten about it entirely
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:20,095	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Except that 4 years later a second group of developers encouraged by the success of Providence Place
EDL	00:04:20,095	00:04:22,655	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Set their sights even closer to Michael
EDL	00:04:23,167	00:04:27,519	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	This time they wanted to build right on top of the historic Mill District where Michael
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:32,383	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	And a dozen or so other artist lived and worked in an old industrial building they called
EDL	00:04:32,383	00:04:32,895	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Fort Thunder
EDL	00:04:33,663	00:04:40,063	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	The developers had to use the computer algorithm to figure out where to place a new Supermarket so that it wouldn't compete with others
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:41,343	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Supermarkets in the area
EDL	00:04:41,855	00:04:48,255	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	And I got to see this computer printout and it is it like a nuclear explosion map
EDL	00:04:48,255	00:04:52,351	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	The radius of each supermarket and their theoretical reach
EDL	00:04:52,863	00:04:53,631	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:04:53,631	00:04:57,215	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Indy Blank Spot that was our neighborhood
EDL	00:04:57,727	00:04:58,751	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	They put an X
EDL	00:04:58,751	00:05:00,799	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Directly on the building we were live
EDL	00:05:01,823	00:05:03,103	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	And that was just the start
EDL	00:05:03,615	00:05:06,175	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	The developers wanted to tear down all of the Old Mill
EDL	00:05:06,943	00:05:10,783	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	And replace them with yet more retail with little to no pedestrian
EDL	00:05:11,807	00:05:15,135	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	And it appears that they only Mantra they have is
EDL	00:05:16,159	00:05:17,439	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	If you see a space at
EDL	00:05:17,439	00:05:18,207	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Underdeveloped
EDL	00:05:18,975	00:05:19,999	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	You have a
EDL	00:05:19,999	00:05:22,303	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	God-given responsibility to development
EDL	00:05:23,071	00:05:24,863	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	That it was basically like having
EDL	00:05:25,631	00:05:27,423	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	A complete stranger
EDL	00:05:28,191	00:05:29,215	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Women thinking about it
EDL	00:05:29,983	00:05:31,519	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	And we think we want to knock your house down
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:37,151	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	And and make it a parking lot of it
EDL	00:05:37,151	00:05:37,663	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	It's cool with you
EDL	00:05:39,199	00:05:43,807	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Normally this would be the part of the story we tell you that Michael and the other residents of Fort Thunder
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:47,903	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Banded together to save their home in the face of the Relentless March of capital
EDL	00:05:48,415	00:05:49,183	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	But
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:50,719	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	No it's not that kind of story
EDL	00:05:50,719	00:05:53,023	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	When did they did save some buildings
EDL	00:05:53,023	00:05:54,559	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	But as for Fort Thunder
EDL	00:05:54,559	00:05:57,375	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Or actual home
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:06:00,447	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	They came out with bulldozers and crane and knock that sucker
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:00,959	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Are flat
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:03,263	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Fort Thunder was gone
EDL	00:06:03,263	00:06:06,591	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	The reason we're telling you this story is because of what happened next
EDL	00:06:07,359	00:06:10,431	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Because when I see something like that on my ho ho ho
EDL	00:06:11,199	00:06:17,599	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Really game on Michael and his friend
EDL	00:06:17,599	00:06:19,647	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	And have lost their home and in their mind
EDL	00:06:19,647	00:06:26,047	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	It all started with that first mall that was the original see that development that has led to everything else
EDL	00:06:26,047	00:06:32,191	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	And so talk again of a mall related action call it art call it a stunt
EDL	00:06:32,191	00:06:38,591	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Anaplan started to take shape in the mall
EDL	00:06:38,591	00:06:39,359	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	7 days
EDL	00:06:39,359	00:06:40,383	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Live
EDL	00:06:40,383	00:06:42,687	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	In the mall and they said a rule for themselves
EDL	00:06:43,199	00:06:48,319	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	They couldn't leave and without a second thought of thinking about how unfeasible that is
EDL	00:06:48,831	00:06:52,159	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	For own well-being we really thought that we had to do it
EDL	00:06:52,671	00:06:53,695	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	And if this sounds like
EDL	00:06:53,695	00:06:56,255	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Clark well yet I kind of was
EDL	00:06:56,255	00:06:57,535	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	But I secretly
EDL	00:06:57,535	00:06:58,559	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Serious Clark
EDL	00:06:58,559	00:07:00,095	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	The four friends
EDL	00:07:00,095	00:07:01,375	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	They would eventually number eight
EDL	00:07:01,887	00:07:04,447	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Wanted to assert that space is like them all
EDL	00:07:04,447	00:07:06,751	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Long dresses much to them after the debate
EDL	00:07:09,823	00:07:14,943	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	To really do this right they would need to find a space in the mall where they can hide themselves away
EDL	00:07:15,455	00:07:18,783	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	And Michael have the perfect place in mind
EDL	00:07:18,783	00:07:23,391	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	You begin to search for that Mysterious Room that he'd noticed when the mall was under construction
EDL	00:07:23,391	00:07:29,791	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	All those years before was connected to a kind of crevice a narrow Gap in
EDL	00:07:29,791	00:07:36,191	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	In the building structure that eventually LED out to an exterior wall so one night Michael went to see you
EDL	00:07:36,191	00:07:39,775	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Entrance to that crevasse had ever been sealed off
EDL	00:07:39,775	00:07:41,823	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Amazingly it hadn't
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:44,895	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	It was small and sort of hidden
EDL	00:07:44,895	00:07:47,455	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	But there was still a crack in the exterior of the mall
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:51,807	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	So he and his then wife Adriana turn themselves sideways
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:52,831	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	And slept inside
EDL	00:07:53,343	00:07:57,695	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	And then once you're once you're at that point you are exploring
EDL	00:07:58,719	00:07:59,487	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	A system of
EDL	00:07:59,487	00:07:59,999	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Caverns
EDL	00:08:01,023	00:08:02,303	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Long weird
EDL	00:08:02,815	00:08:03,839	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Vertical Caverns
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:06,655	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	And there are places where it is false
EDL	00:08:07,167	00:08:09,215	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Down into the lower levels of the mall
EDL	00:08:09,727	00:08:11,263	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	So you've got about
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:12,543	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	A foot-and-a-half
EDL	00:08:13,055	00:08:15,359	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	A blessed we are looking into a black abyss
EDL	00:08:15,871	00:08:16,895	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	And then
EDL	00:08:17,407	00:08:18,175	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	This
EDL	00:08:18,175	00:08:19,711	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Series of Chambers
EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:22,783	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Ultimately give you access
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:23,295	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	To this
EDL	00:08:23,807	00:08:24,319	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Space
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:30,463	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	The room was tall and wide filled with the byproducts of the mall's construction from the years before
EDL	00:08:30,975	00:08:32,255	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Broken two-by-fours
EDL	00:08:32,255	00:08:34,047	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Screws and plastic zip ties
EDL	00:08:34,047	00:08:35,839	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	That hadn't even been worth removing
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:37,375	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	The space
EDL	00:08:37,375	00:08:38,911	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Have literally been forgotten
EDL	00:08:39,423	00:08:41,215	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	And it was
EDL	00:08:41,983	00:08:42,751	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Big
EDL	00:08:42,751	00:08:44,287	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	He was a big space
EDL	00:08:44,799	00:08:45,311	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	That
EDL	00:08:45,823	00:08:47,615	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Serves no other purpose
EDL	00:08:47,615	00:08:48,639	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	That wasn't the storefront
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:50,687	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	I wasn't a star while it was just
EDL	00:08:51,455	00:08:52,223	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Big
EDL	00:08:52,223	00:08:52,735	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	And it was
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:54,015	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	A
EDL	00:08:54,015	00:08:54,783	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Thrill
EDL	00:08:55,295	00:08:55,807	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Tube
EDL	00:08:56,319	00:08:59,647	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Physically find it be like this is it this is what I remember
EDL	00:09:00,671	00:09:02,207	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	The room was in the guts of the building
EDL	00:09:02,719	00:09:05,023	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	The part that no one was ever supposed to use
EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:05,791	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Even really see
EDL	00:09:06,303	00:09:09,119	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	But Michael and Adriana saw that it could still be access
EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:10,399	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	I multiple-hit an entry point
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:13,215	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Including from inside the shopping center itself
EDL	00:09:13,983	00:09:16,543	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	If you know how to get there you could walk there from the Macy's
EDL	00:09:17,311	00:09:18,335	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	But as far as they can
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:21,151	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Hell they were the only people who knew this really exist
EDL	00:09:22,175	00:09:25,247	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	It was at that moment but the friend scheme started changing
EDL	00:09:25,759	00:09:27,807	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Initial planning to spend a week in the mall
EDL	00:09:28,319	00:09:29,087	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	But the way they saw it
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:34,207	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	They were sitting on 750 square feet of underutilized space
EDL	00:09:34,719	00:09:35,487	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Monastic
EDL	00:09:36,255	00:09:38,047	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	What would a developer do
EDL	00:09:38,047	00:09:39,583	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Because after all
EDL	00:09:39,583	00:09:41,887	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	If you see a space is underdeveloped
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:43,423	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	You have a
EDL	00:09:43,423	00:09:45,727	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	God-given responsibility to develop
EDL	00:09:46,751	00:09:47,519	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	So
EDL	00:09:47,519	00:09:51,359	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	When we decided that perhaps the absolute best thing we could do is just build a condo
EDL	00:09:52,639	00:09:56,991	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Like that is that is always the you that's always the answer you're not sure what to do with the space
EDL	00:09:57,503	00:09:58,527	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Just make it a condo
EDL	00:09:59,551	00:10:02,367	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	The new plan was no longer to live in the mall for a week
EDL	00:10:02,367	00:10:04,927	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	It was now simply to live in the mall
EDL	00:10:04,927	00:10:05,695	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Days of time
EDL	00:10:06,207	00:10:07,231	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Using the room
EDL	00:10:07,231	00:10:07,999	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Is an apartment
EDL	00:10:08,511	00:10:13,119	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Well that may sound like a nightmare to everyone but a few weird artist from Providence
EDL	00:10:13,631	00:10:16,191	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Michael and his friends at work on this little project
EDL	00:10:16,191	00:10:17,471	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	The excitement
EDL	00:10:17,471	00:10:18,239	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	New homeowner
EDL	00:10:20,031	00:10:21,567	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Step 1 of course was cleaning
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:23,103	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	They had to get rid of all that debris
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:24,383	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	It sounded like
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:29,247	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Irritated I get a prison break movie we were literally filling up our backpacks
EDL	00:10:29,247	00:10:30,271	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Swift Just
EDL	00:10:30,271	00:10:32,063	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Dirt and grime and then
EDL	00:10:32,063	00:10:34,367	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Brandon carrying it out of the mall and getting rid of it
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:37,439	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	And for every backpack full of debris they took out
EDL	00:10:37,951	00:10:39,999	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	They bring a pack full of something in
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:42,047	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Gallon jugs of water for drinking
EDL	00:10:42,047	00:10:42,815	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Cleaning
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:47,423	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Clamp lights and extension cords for illumination which they plugged into the malls internal power system
EDL	00:10:48,191	00:10:49,983	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Parts for an ad hoc kitchen
EDL	00:10:49,983	00:10:54,591	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	They even built a cinder block wall to hide the space from anyone else who might venture into the cavern,
EDL	00:10:55,103	00:10:56,383	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Commence various other entrance
EDL	00:10:57,151	00:11:01,503	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	We went and got a door that was an exact mirror of the doors that use in the mall
EDL	00:11:02,015	00:11:03,295	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	So if you were to find it
EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:05,599	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Unless you're looking really closely
EDL	00:11:05,599	00:11:08,159	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	At first glance it just looks exactly like a
EDL	00:11:08,159	00:11:11,743	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Like it had been built originally
EDL	00:11:11,743	00:11:18,143	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Finally it was time to decorate anything we could buy at the mall we would low table came in on
EDL	00:11:18,143	00:11:18,911	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	On top of that
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:21,727	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Probably perch with a television at our PlayStation
EDL	00:11:21,727	00:11:22,239	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	But
EDL	00:11:22,751	00:11:26,847	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	If you couldn't buy it at the mall we have to bring it in tomorrow that's for the large
EDL	00:11:26,847	00:11:29,151	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Pieces like the China hutch for the
EDL	00:11:29,151	00:11:30,175	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	4 piece sectional couch
EDL	00:11:31,455	00:11:32,735	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	No but nobody looks
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:34,271	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Twice that you brought
EDL	00:11:34,271	00:11:35,551	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Pieces of a couch
EDL	00:11:36,063	00:11:37,087	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Through them all
EDL	00:11:37,087	00:11:39,391	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	How did you get that in there
EDL	00:11:40,159	00:11:41,695	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	In broad daylight
EDL	00:11:41,695	00:11:42,975	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	We avoided the night
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:46,303	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	And sort of work for the ebb and flow of
EDL	00:11:46,303	00:11:47,327	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	The mall we were just
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:51,423	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Heart of the hills the living organism of it
EDL	00:11:51,935	00:11:53,471	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Pets daily activities
EDL	00:11:55,263	00:11:57,055	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Amazing risky trying to furnish
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:11:59,615	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	A secret apartment with a nested coffee table
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:00,895	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	But anyone watching
EDL	00:12:00,895	00:12:06,015	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	It was just a person walking through a mall with the nested coffee table that they just bought at the mall
EDL	00:12:06,015	00:12:10,623	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	There's simply no such thing as a suspicious consumer item in a building
EDL	00:12:10,623	00:12:11,903	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	What is dedicated
EDL	00:12:11,903	00:12:12,671	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Consumerism
EDL	00:12:13,951	00:12:16,255	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Friendswood sometimes stay in the secret
EDL	00:12:16,255	00:12:19,071	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Apartment for several weeks in a row just living
EDL	00:12:19,583	00:12:23,935	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Watching television and making collages with shadow boxes they bought at Pottery Barn
EDL	00:12:23,935	00:12:25,215	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Even cooking in the ad hoc
EDL	00:12:25,983	00:12:29,823	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Michael remembers burning some waffles with waffle iron and wondering if
EDL	00:12:29,823	00:12:30,847	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Smoke weed give them away
EDL	00:12:31,615	00:12:34,431	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	And when the eight friends were enjoying their secret apartment
EDL	00:12:34,943	00:12:36,479	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	They were enjoying the mall
EDL	00:12:36,479	00:12:37,759	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Not at Shoppers
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:38,527	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	But as residents
EDL	00:12:39,039	00:12:43,135	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Thanks to its late night movie theater the mall almost never closed
EDL	00:12:43,135	00:12:45,439	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	So sometimes it would just roam the building
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:46,975	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	With no goal in mind
EDL	00:12:46,975	00:12:48,511	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Observing its many moods
EDL	00:12:49,279	00:12:50,559	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	There are times in that in
EDL	00:12:50,559	00:12:51,583	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Haier building

EDL	00:13:00,287	00:13:02,847	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	And it's a really wonderful time because it's
EDL	00:13:03,615	00:13:04,383	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	It's like having

EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:11,551	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	4 levels deep all to yourself

EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:15,647	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	In those moments
EDL	00:13:15,647	00:13:16,671	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	There's a sense of
EDL	00:13:17,439	00:13:18,207	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Ownership
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:21,279	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	I just feel really good

EDL	00:13:25,119	00:13:26,399	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	And eventually years
EDL	00:13:27,167	00:13:30,751	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Out of the emotional Rubble of Fort Thunder they finally found their ref

EDL	00:13:38,687	00:13:40,223	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	But as the old saying goes

EDL	00:13:42,527	00:13:44,831	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Woody must stop living at the mall
EDL	00:13:45,343	00:13:46,367	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Unfortunately
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:48,415	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	The seed got planted
EDL	00:13:48,415	00:13:50,463	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Dad this whole thing was going to unravel
EDL	00:13:50,463	00:13:52,511	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	And that's because we had a we had a break-in
EDL	00:13:53,023	00:13:54,815	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	One day they came back to the apartment
EDL	00:13:54,815	00:13:56,095	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Only to discover
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:13:58,655	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	That someone who kicked open the door and still on the PlayStation
EDL	00:13:59,167	00:14:00,447	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Along with several other smaller
EDL	00:14:00,959	00:14:02,751	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Including the art they had made
EDL	00:14:02,751	00:14:03,263	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Photo
EDL	00:14:04,031	00:14:05,311	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	But it left a silverware
EDL	00:14:06,335	00:14:09,151	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	They left the TV right this is a very odd burglary
EDL	00:14:09,919	00:14:13,247	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	I didn't take the things of value they only two things that were like
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:15,295	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Super personal
EDL	00:14:15,807	00:14:16,831	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Michael and his friends were
EDL	00:14:17,855	00:14:20,671	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	They had managed to hide the apartment for 4 years
EDL	00:14:21,183	00:14:22,975	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	But now someone knew about the room
EDL	00:14:23,487	00:14:25,791	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Someone could come back at any time
EDL	00:14:25,791	00:14:27,583	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Who seem to be interested in them
EDL	00:14:28,095	00:14:29,119	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	So they change things up
EDL	00:14:29,631	00:14:32,447	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	They decided from now on they only stay there at night
EDL	00:14:32,447	00:14:33,983	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	When the chances of being caught were low
EDL	00:14:34,495	00:14:35,519	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Never during the day
EDL	00:14:36,287	00:14:37,311	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	And crucially
EDL	00:14:37,823	00:14:41,919	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	I would double down on another rule they had since almost the very beginning
EDL	00:14:41,919	00:14:43,199	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Don't share it
EDL	00:14:43,199	00:14:44,479	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	It with anyone don't
EDL	00:14:44,479	00:14:47,295	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Physically bring anyone here wasn't involved in the making of it
EDL	00:14:48,319	00:14:49,599	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	It's a lot of my very
EDL	00:14:49,599	00:14:50,623	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Very good
EDL	00:14:50,623	00:14:51,903	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Ban best friends
EDL	00:14:51,903	00:14:53,439	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Never saw this face
EDL	00:14:56,767	00:14:58,815	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	And I'm the one who
EDL	00:14:59,583	00:15:01,119	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Took that rule and broke it
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:05,471	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Michael is hosting a visiting artist from Hong Kong
EDL	00:15:05,471	00:15:06,239	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Her name is Jaffa
EDL	00:15:06,751	00:15:09,055	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	He was driving her to the bus station on her way out of town
EDL	00:15:09,567	00:15:10,847	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	And we're driving
EDL	00:15:11,359	00:15:13,407	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Pass them all I say to myself
EDL	00:15:13,919	00:15:15,199	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	What can it hurt
EDL	00:15:15,199	00:15:16,991	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	How could this possibly backfire me
EDL	00:15:18,271	00:15:19,551	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Self
EDL	00:15:19,551	00:15:20,319	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	I
EDL	00:15:20,319	00:15:21,087	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Brought her
EDL	00:15:21,087	00:15:21,855	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Into the space
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:27,999	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Her mind was absolutely blown and it got remember that this is at the peak of its
EDL	00:15:28,511	00:15:29,279	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	It's Bill.
EDL	00:15:29,279	00:15:31,071	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Michael show Java everything
EDL	00:15:31,583	00:15:32,863	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Couch the light

EDL	00:15:33,631	00:15:36,447	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	They were just days away from installing a water tank
EDL	00:15:36,447	00:15:37,215	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	And a wood floor
EDL	00:15:37,727	00:15:43,615	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	In spite of the break-in after 4 years of work the apartment was on the verge of feeling like a real home
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:45,407	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	But
EDL	00:15:45,407	00:15:47,199	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	When we're leaving
EDL	00:15:47,199	00:15:49,759	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	I hear walkie-talkie on the other side of the door
EDL	00:15:50,271	00:15:51,551	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Within 2
EDL	00:15:51,551	00:15:52,575	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Feet of us
EDL	00:15:53,343	00:15:54,879	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	And with the door open
EDL	00:15:54,879	00:15:55,647	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	It's
EDL	00:15:55,647	00:15:56,927	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Three dudes and ties
EDL	00:15:57,439	00:15:58,719	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Anta sports jackets
EDL	00:15:59,487	00:16:00,255	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:16:00,767	00:16:04,351	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	I realized in that moment I internalize that
EDL	00:16:04,351	00:16:04,863	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	It's over
EDL	00:16:06,143	00:16:10,751	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	It turned out that the earlier break-in have been the work of two of the mall's newest Security card
EDL	00:16:11,519	00:16:13,055	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Instead of removing everything
EDL	00:16:13,055	00:16:16,895	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Did taking the personal items in hopes of figuring out who Michael and his friends were
EDL	00:16:17,407	00:16:20,735	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Now that Michael have been foolish enough to come back during the day
EDL	00:16:20,735	00:16:21,759	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	They had their man
EDL	00:16:22,527	00:16:25,343	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	General Growth Properties the company that owned them all
EDL	00:16:25,343	00:16:27,647	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Did not take kindly to the secret apartment
EDL	00:16:27,647	00:16:28,159	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	And its walls
EDL	00:16:28,671	00:16:29,695	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	You don't say
EDL	00:16:29,695	00:16:32,255	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	After being handed over to the police and interrogated
EDL	00:16:32,767	00:16:34,047	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Java was eventually let go
EDL	00:16:34,559	00:16:38,143	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	But Michael soon found himself standing in front of a judge in Criminal Court
EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:41,215	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Charged with breaking and entering and felony tree
EDL	00:16:42,751	00:16:44,287	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	By the time I get to court
EDL	00:16:45,055	00:16:46,335	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	The mall is hired a lawyer
EDL	00:16:47,359	00:16:48,127	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:16:48,639	00:16:51,199	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	They launched into all these details about
EDL	00:16:51,711	00:16:52,479	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	The
EDL	00:16:52,479	00:16:54,783	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Illegal things that I have done
EDL	00:16:54,783	00:16:55,551	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	And I keep my mouth
EDL	00:16:56,063	00:16:56,575	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Shut
EDL	00:16:57,855	00:16:58,623	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	But
EDL	00:16:58,623	00:17:00,671	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	After they've gone to this laundry list of
EDL	00:17:01,183	00:17:01,695	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Illegal act
EDL	00:17:02,975	00:17:04,255	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	They use the phrase

EDL	00:17:09,375	00:17:10,399	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	They had built
EDL	00:17:10,399	00:17:11,935	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Over several years that had
EDL	00:17:11,935	00:17:14,239	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	The following things in it and goes on to Blythe

EDL	00:17:33,951	00:17:35,231	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	What's Happening Here
EDL	00:17:35,743	00:17:37,023	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	The judge
EDL	00:17:37,535	00:17:38,303	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Hustle
EDL	00:17:38,303	00:17:39,071	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Advisors
EDL	00:17:39,583	00:17:41,887	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Klosterman and hearing whispering
EDL	00:17:42,655	00:17:45,471	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Any looks that looks me dead in the eyes and he goes
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:47,519	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	This is not a criminal act
EDL	00:17:49,055	00:17:50,847	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	We're not sure exactly what it was
EDL	00:17:51,871	00:17:52,383	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	But
EDL	00:17:52,895	00:17:53,663	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	This is not a crime
EDL	00:17:55,967	00:18:00,063	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	When the judge was receiving a deep legal Truth at the heart of this case
EDL	00:18:00,063	00:18:05,183	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Where Michael was just the beneficiary of an incredible amount of white privilege
EDL	00:18:05,695	00:18:07,231	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Michael may never know
EDL	00:18:07,999	00:18:11,071	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	In the end he was slapped with a misdemeanor for trespassing and release
EDL	00:18:12,095	00:18:15,679	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	He lived on and off in a secret apartment for nearly 4 years
EDL	00:18:16,191	00:18:18,239	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	And it was going to cost him almost nothing
EDL	00:18:19,263	00:18:21,823	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	But that doesn't mean he got away entirely scot-free
EDL	00:18:22,847	00:18:27,199	| 332_The_Accidental_Room_pt_01 |	Just before Michael left the mall the mall security team handed him a piece of paper
