EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:57,343	| 99pi-0071-inandoutoflove-1 |	And so places like Love Park what kind of sitting there not being used

EDL	00:09:44,191	00:09:46,751	| 99pi-0071-inandoutoflove-1 |	Even though love Park was like Mecca
EDL	00:09:47,263	00:09:48,799	| 99pi-0071-inandoutoflove-1 |	It was never legal to get there
EDL	00:09:48,799	00:09:53,151	| 99pi-0071-inandoutoflove-1 |	I don't think it's legal to skate at Mecca either

EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:04,159	| 99pi-0071-inandoutoflove-1 |	And the area was gentrifying
EDL	00:10:04,927	00:10:10,047	| 99pi-0071-inandoutoflove-1 |	Finally in 2002 Philly Mayor John Street took the skateboard band step further and renovate
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:12,351	| 99pi-0071-inandoutoflove-1 |	The major thing that they did was they were
EDL	00:10:12,863	00:10:13,631	| 99pi-0071-inandoutoflove-1 |	Moved all of
EDL	00:10:13,631	00:10:14,911	| 99pi-0071-inandoutoflove-1 |	The granite benches
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:16,959	| 99pi-0071-inandoutoflove-1 |	These great skateable of elements
EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:19,007	| 99pi-0071-inandoutoflove-1 |	They replaced them with you know kind of

EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:33,343	| 99pi-0071-inandoutoflove-1 |	The new features were meant to make it harder for skaters to use the ledges or the cruise from one end of the park to the other
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:37,695	| 99pi-0071-inandoutoflove-1 |	So they took away the wide-open paved areas
EDL	00:10:38,207	00:10:38,975	| 99pi-0071-inandoutoflove-1 |	And tragic
EDL	00:10:38,975	00:10:39,743	| 99pi-0071-inandoutoflove-1 |	Replace them
EDL	00:10:39,743	00:10:40,511	| 99pi-0071-inandoutoflove-1 |	What's gracias

EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:46,143	| 99pi-0071-inandoutoflove-1 |	Was a good idea
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:47,679	| 99pi-0071-inandoutoflove-1 |	But the design result was
EDL	00:10:47,679	00:10:48,447	| 99pi-0071-inandoutoflove-1 |	Kind of worm
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:51,519	| 99pi-0071-inandoutoflove-1 |	It's just a very uncomfortable space and not a space that

EDL	00:10:54,591	00:10:56,383	| 99pi-0071-inandoutoflove-1 |	There were rallies in newspaper articles

EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:14,303	| 99pi-0071-inandoutoflove-1 |	And to kind of offset any damages skaters might have done over the years
EDL	00:11:14,815	00:11:16,607	| 99pi-0071-inandoutoflove-1 |	The city of Philadelphia decline the offer

EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:38,623	| 99pi-0071-inandoutoflove-1 |	I think politically it was
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:39,391	| 99pi-0071-inandoutoflove-1 |	It would that would have been
EDL	00:11:39,903	00:11:40,415	| 99pi-0071-inandoutoflove-1 |	Too difficult
