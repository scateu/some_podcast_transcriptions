EDL	00:01:31,136	00:01:37,280	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	For the past few days Californians have watched as the car Wildfire has raged through the northern part of the state
EDL	00:01:37,792	00:01:39,584	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	The fire started a little more than a week ago
EDL	00:01:40,096	00:01:41,376	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Fueled by dry brush
EDL	00:01:41,888	00:01:44,704	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	High temperatures and strong shifting winds
EDL	00:01:44,704	00:01:47,776	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	The fire has moved from a national Recreation Area
EDL	00:01:47,776	00:01:49,312	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Into the nearby city of Redding
EDL	00:01:50,080	00:01:56,480	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	As of this recording six people have died 19 people are reported missing in thousands have a key
EDL	00:01:56,480	00:01:59,296	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	He waited the fire is only 20% contained
EDL	00:02:00,064	00:02:02,624	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Wildland fires aren't new in California
EDL	00:02:02,624	00:02:08,256	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	But with climate change are fire seasons are becoming longer and fires are becoming bigger
EDL	00:02:08,256	00:02:09,024	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	And harder to fight
EDL	00:02:09,792	00:02:13,376	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	So the next two weeks we're going to look at the issue of wildfire
EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:14,912	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Some design Solutions
EDL	00:02:14,912	00:02:17,472	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Just how complicated they can be to implement
EDL	00:02:27,456	00:02:32,064	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	The Santa Ana winds of Southern California are sometimes called the devil winds
EDL	00:02:32,064	00:02:34,880	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	They pick up in the late summer and early fall
EDL	00:02:34,880	00:02:41,280	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Sweeping down from the mountains and across the coast are hot dry and known for creating
EDL	00:02:41,280	00:02:42,560	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Dangerous fire conditions
EDL	00:02:43,584	00:02:48,960	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	In late November of 1980 as the Santa anas blue in it up to 90 miles an hour

EDL	00:02:52,800	00:02:53,824	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	San Bernardino Mountain

EDL	00:02:56,640	00:03:02,784	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Pushed by the wind the fire grew and quickly spread down the mountain towards the city of San Bernardino
EDL	00:03:03,552	00:03:05,088	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Elizabeth city's been fired
EDL	00:03:05,600	00:03:12,000	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Talking to a reporter and we had extremely strong winds humidity was somewhere
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:12,768	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	About 10
EDL	00:03:13,536	00:03:17,120	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Another local fire chief said they called in all available resource
EDL	00:03:17,632	00:03:18,656	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	And still
EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:19,424	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	It wasn't enough
EDL	00:03:19,936	00:03:21,472	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	There was no stopping the fire
EDL	00:03:21,984	00:03:23,520	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	All the conditions were
EDL	00:03:24,032	00:03:24,800	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Just wright
EDL	00:03:25,568	00:03:26,848	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	+ 4
EDL	00:03:26,848	00:03:29,664	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	What we commonly refer to as a firestorm
EDL	00:03:30,688	00:03:32,736	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	In just a few hours
EDL	00:03:32,736	00:03:35,808	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Panorama fire destroyed hundreds of homes
EDL	00:03:35,808	00:03:37,088	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Killed 4 people
EDL	00:03:37,600	00:03:41,696	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Was one of the worst Wildfire disasters in California history
EDL	00:03:41,696	00:03:42,208	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	The time
EDL	00:03:42,720	00:03:45,792	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	It was also the fire that would make a young researcher
EDL	00:03:45,792	00:03:48,096	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Question or entire approach to wildfires
EDL	00:03:48,608	00:03:49,632	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	And conclude
EDL	00:03:49,632	00:03:53,472	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	That we might be able to design our way out of the devastation
EDL	00:03:53,472	00:03:53,984	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Because
EDL	00:03:56,544	00:03:59,616	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	When was a few years out of graduate school
EDL	00:03:59,616	00:04:01,920	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	In a recent transplant to California
EDL	00:04:01,920	00:04:02,944	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Time of the fire
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:05,504	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	He's working as a research scientist with a
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:06,016	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	The forest server
EDL	00:04:06,528	00:04:07,808	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Studying fire Behavior
EDL	00:04:08,320	00:04:12,416	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	He was interested in how to Panorama fire and destroyed so many homes
EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:16,000	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Especially when there was such an overwhelming firefighting response
EDL	00:04:16,512	00:04:21,887	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	A Strike Team of entrances five engines and they had 20 strike teams coming in
EDL	00:04:22,399	00:04:22,911	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Right away
EDL	00:04:23,423	00:04:29,055	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	There would be a whole block of houses on fire and they could not deliver enough water
EDL	00:04:30,079	00:04:31,103	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	So they were calling in
EDL	00:04:31,871	00:04:32,639	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	More hoses
EDL	00:04:33,919	00:04:34,943	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	And moving
EDL	00:04:34,943	00:04:36,223	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	A block down
EDL	00:04:36,223	00:04:36,991	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	42 block
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:38,527	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Box down and losing that
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:40,319	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	And then moving
EDL	00:04:40,319	00:04:40,831	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Further
EDL	00:04:41,855	00:04:42,879	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	And losing that
EDL	00:04:43,391	00:04:46,207	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Two Jacks are listening to the emergency dispatch
EDL	00:04:46,207	00:04:47,743	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Tapes from the day of the fire
EDL	00:04:49,279	00:04:51,327	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Jack is a matter-of-fact kind of guy
EDL	00:04:51,839	00:04:52,351	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Assignment
EDL	00:04:52,863	00:04:53,631	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Rational
EDL	00:04:53,631	00:04:54,399	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Not emotional
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:05:01,311	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Almost 40 years later he's still chokes up when he talks about the desperation he heard in the firefighters voice
EDL	00:05:02,591	00:05:04,639	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	The teams are pretty hard to understand
EDL	00:05:04,639	00:05:06,431	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	But you can hear the emotion
EDL	00:05:15,647	00:05:16,927	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	It was pretty emotional
EDL	00:05:17,695	00:05:19,231	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Particularly listening
EDL	00:05:19,999	00:05:21,023	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	The radio traffic
EDL	00:05:31,007	00:05:32,031	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Just couldn't
EDL	00:05:32,543	00:05:33,055	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	He couldn't fight it
EDL	00:05:39,199	00:05:44,063	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	For those of us who mostly say wildfires on TV or in pictures of the paper
EDL	00:05:44,063	00:05:48,159	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	It's easy to imagine that a wildfire is like a tsunami of flames
EDL	00:05:48,671	00:05:52,255	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Spreading across the landscape and destroying everything in its path
EDL	00:05:52,767	00:05:54,815	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	But Jack knew it wasn't that simple
EDL	00:05:55,839	00:05:58,399	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Piece together how the disaster had unfolded
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:06:01,983	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	And so one of the things that I did was to look at
EDL	00:06:02,495	00:06:04,031	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	When the first
EDL	00:06:04,031	00:06:09,151	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Call Kami on to dispatch for a fire in this community
EDL	00:06:10,175	00:06:12,223	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Where was that call from
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:15,295	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	And where was the Wildfire at that time
EDL	00:06:24,767	00:06:25,791	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Just get out of here
EDL	00:06:26,303	00:06:27,071	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Just get out
EDL	00:06:27,583	00:06:29,119	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Is Jack was listening to the tape
EDL	00:06:29,631	00:06:31,167	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	He started to notice a pattern
EDL	00:06:40,383	00:06:43,199	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	People were calling in about houses on fire
EDL	00:06:43,199	00:06:44,479	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Long before
EDL	00:06:44,479	00:06:46,527	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	The fire front ever reach their neighborhoods
EDL	00:06:47,551	00:06:49,087	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	The Wildfire was
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:52,159	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Still actually on the other side of the ridge
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:55,487	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	About a half a mile away burning up the hill
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:58,559	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	These houses were burning because of wall of Fire
EDL	00:06:58,559	00:06:59,839	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Was racing through the community
EDL	00:07:00,351	00:07:02,143	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	They were burning because of something else
EDL	00:07:02,655	00:07:03,423	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	The Embers
EDL	00:07:04,191	00:07:06,495	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	As wildfires burn they generate Ember
EDL	00:07:06,495	00:07:10,335	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Better lofted downwind ahead of the main body of a fire
EDL	00:07:10,335	00:07:13,919	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Jack realized most of the houses that burned had one
EDL	00:07:13,919	00:07:16,735	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Extremely problematic feature in common
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:20,063	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	As it turns out every house had a flammable Woodroof
EDL	00:07:20,575	00:07:25,183	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	The Embers were accumulating in the crevices around the dry wood shingles
EDL	00:07:25,183	00:07:27,487	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Setting fire to the houses from above
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:31,071	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Across the street in a development without wood roofs
EDL	00:07:31,071	00:07:32,607	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Most of the houses that survived
EDL	00:07:33,119	00:07:35,935	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	And while that might not seem like a huge epiphany
EDL	00:07:35,935	00:07:39,775	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	That houses with wood roofs burned and houses without wood roofs didn't
EDL	00:07:40,287	00:07:41,055	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	For Jack
EDL	00:07:41,055	00:07:45,663	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	It was that detail that made him rethink the entire Wildfire problem
EDL	00:07:46,175	00:07:49,759	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Because when you listen to other people talk about the fire
EDL	00:07:49,759	00:07:51,807	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	They weren't focusing on the wood roof
EDL	00:07:52,319	00:07:54,623	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	They were talking about firefighting
EDL	00:07:54,623	00:07:56,671	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	They were saying nothing could have been done
EDL	00:07:57,439	00:07:59,999	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	I just captain in the San Bernardino fire department
EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:02,815	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	If we would have had as many as 500 units
EDL	00:08:02,815	00:08:05,631	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Read along the whole Hillside there to protect those homes
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:10,239	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	I don't believe that we could have stopped that fire any better than we did on his condition
EDL	00:08:10,239	00:08:11,263	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	WeChat
EDL	00:08:11,263	00:08:15,871	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	The only thing that I feel is that what could have saved those homes
EDL	00:08:15,871	00:08:17,663	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Would have only been an act of God
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:23,295	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Jack didn't think that was right the problem wasn't the firefighting response
EDL	00:08:23,807	00:08:25,599	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	The problem was that the houses
EDL	00:08:25,599	00:08:26,367	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	What are built
EDL	00:08:26,367	00:08:27,135	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	To burn
EDL	00:08:27,903	00:08:29,695	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	And when Jack shifted his Focus
EDL	00:08:29,695	00:08:31,999	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	The fire to the design of the home
EDL	00:08:32,767	00:08:38,399	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Suddenly he found himself wondering if we were framing the whole problem of wildfire in the wrong way
EDL	00:08:38,911	00:08:40,959	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	He wasn't the first to have that thought
EDL	00:08:40,959	00:08:42,495	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	But he was the first
EDL	00:08:42,495	00:08:44,031	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	To do extensive research
EDL	00:08:44,031	00:08:45,055	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Exactly
EDL	00:08:45,055	00:08:47,103	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	How homes burned in wildfires
EDL	00:08:47,615	00:08:52,479	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Some of that work put him at odds with some of the main firefighting agencies in the US
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:56,319	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	And nearly a hundred years of fire policy in Tradition
EDL	00:08:56,319	00:08:59,391	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	And even though his ideas are simple and compelling
EDL	00:08:59,391	00:09:01,951	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	They still haven't caught on in the way that he hoped they would
EDL	00:09:02,463	00:09:07,839	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Maybe because fighting fires is as much a social and political problem as it is a technical one
EDL	00:09:08,607	00:09:12,191	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Do you feel frustrated most of the time
EDL	00:09:14,239	00:09:19,103	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	For most of this country's history or approach to Wildfire has been driven by the sentiment
EDL	00:09:19,615	00:09:20,895	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Fire is bad
EDL	00:09:21,407	00:09:27,551	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Before colonization Native American tribe set fires intentionally to regenerate while playing
EDL	00:09:28,063	00:09:31,135	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	How to create grassland habitat for game
EDL	00:09:31,135	00:09:35,999	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	When Europeans arrived they brought fear of fire with them
EDL	00:09:35,999	00:09:42,399	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	And overtime in much of the country not only did we do away with the practice of setting fires we actually
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:45,471	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	He started to extinguish naturally-occurring fires to
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:51,615	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	In 1911 that became an official responsibilities of the newly-created for a service
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:54,943	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Even got a name
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:09:56,479	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	The 10 a.m.
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:09:58,527	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Is it the forest service
EDL	00:09:58,527	00:10:02,879	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	To put out every new fire on public land by 10 a.m. the following day
EDL	00:10:03,647	00:10:04,671	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	President Roosevelt
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:07,999	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Civilian Conservation Corps was on the front lines of implementing
EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:08,767	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	That policy
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:11,583	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	We fought those fire night and day sometime
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:16,191	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	You can see smoke
EDL	00:10:16,191	00:10:17,471	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Clear the end of the world
EDL	00:10:18,239	00:10:21,311	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	The belief was that with enough water and Manpower
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:24,639	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Firefighters could put out any wildfire
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:27,711	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	And a huge industry rose up around that idea
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:30,527	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Agreed to employ tens of thousands of people
EDL	00:10:31,039	00:10:36,415	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	With hundreds of millions of dollars a year being spent on planes and helicopters and fire Crews
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:40,767	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	And for a while that Brute Force approach seem to work
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:44,351	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	What does early firefighters had an advantage
EDL	00:10:44,351	00:10:45,631	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	For millennia
EDL	00:10:45,631	00:10:47,935	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Before the rise of modern fire suppression
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:50,239	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Woodburn regularly
EDL	00:10:50,239	00:10:51,007	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	America
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:51,519	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	S4s
EDL	00:10:52,031	00:10:54,079	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	They would eat up all the fuel
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:57,151	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Thyroxine low-intensity
EDL	00:10:57,151	00:10:58,687	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Estate on the forest floor
EDL	00:10:59,199	00:11:02,271	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	As firefighters begin aggressively fighting fires
EDL	00:11:02,271	00:11:03,807	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	That balance started to change
EDL	00:11:04,319	00:11:06,111	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	With fewer fires burning
EDL	00:11:06,111	00:11:08,159	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	For it started getting more and more dance
EDL	00:11:08,927	00:11:09,951	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	On the forest
EDL	00:11:09,951	00:11:11,231	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Did catch on fire
EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:14,559	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	There's more material to burn in a fire burn hotter
EDL	00:11:14,559	00:11:15,071	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	And bigger
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:17,887	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	If I delete by suppressing natural fires
EDL	00:11:17,887	00:11:21,215	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	We created something that turned out to be much much worse
EDL	00:11:21,727	00:11:23,007	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Here's Mark Finney
EDL	00:11:23,007	00:11:25,567	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	He's a fire scientist with the forest service
EDL	00:11:25,567	00:11:27,359	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Fighting fire really has some
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:29,407	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Unintended consequences
EDL	00:11:29,407	00:11:31,199	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Or maybe even worse than the fire so
EDL	00:11:31,711	00:11:32,479	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	In Oxnard
EDL	00:11:34,527	00:11:37,343	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Since the very beginnings of our fire suppression policies
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:41,951	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	There been people arguing that it wasn't a good idea to put out every fire
EDL	00:11:42,463	00:11:46,047	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	But it took until the 1980s for that idea to really take hold
EDL	00:11:46,047	00:11:48,863	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	By then it was also becoming increasingly clear
EDL	00:11:48,863	00:11:50,911	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	That we couldn't put out every fire
EDL	00:11:50,911	00:11:53,215	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Especially as they got bigger and bigger
EDL	00:11:53,727	00:11:56,799	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	We're not actually stopping them we're just delaying them
EDL	00:11:58,079	00:11:58,591	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Yeah there's a
EDL	00:11:59,103	00:12:01,151	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	The saying a fire put out as a fire put off
EDL	00:12:01,919	00:12:06,271	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	But even as the public in the 1980s started to accept the idea that
EDL	00:12:06,271	00:12:08,831	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Fire was natural and necessary
EDL	00:12:08,831	00:12:11,135	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	And fighting it had unintended consequences
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:12,927	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Not fighting it
EDL	00:12:12,927	00:12:14,975	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Didn't seem like a viable option
EDL	00:12:14,975	00:12:16,767	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Outside of remote Wilderness Area
EDL	00:12:17,791	00:12:19,071	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Because how could you stop
EDL	00:12:19,071	00:12:20,095	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Fighting fires
EDL	00:12:20,095	00:12:20,863	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	When they threatened
EDL	00:12:22,399	00:12:24,447	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Which brings us back to Jack Cohen
EDL	00:12:24,447	00:12:25,471	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	The panorama fire
EDL	00:12:26,239	00:12:29,823	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Once he started to focus on the home at the problem not the wildfire
EDL	00:12:30,335	00:12:34,175	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	He wanted to know what made some houses more susceptible than others
EDL	00:12:34,943	00:12:41,343	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	This was a question that I had in my mind a curiosity question what I'm trying to do is to ask
EDL	00:12:41,343	00:12:44,415	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Establish a relationship between wildfire and Hondas
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:47,999	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	I want to know what that linkage is
EDL	00:12:47,999	00:12:49,791	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	How does this happen
EDL	00:12:50,303	00:12:51,839	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	In the Panorama fire
EDL	00:12:51,839	00:12:58,239	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	It had clearly been the wood roofs but in other fires there were plenty of homes without wood roofs
EDL	00:12:58,239	00:12:59,519	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Hepburn 2
EDL	00:12:59,519	00:13:03,103	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	So Jack said about learning all of the houses potential weaknesses
EDL	00:13:03,615	00:13:06,431	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	All the ways it might possibly catch on fire
EDL	00:13:06,943	00:13:09,503	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	The first thing he wanted to know was how close the
EDL	00:13:09,503	00:13:12,063	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Flames of the Wildfire had to be to a house
EDL	00:13:12,063	00:13:14,111	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Frederick Knight simply from the radiant heat
EDL	00:13:15,135	00:13:17,695	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Answer that question he did a series of experiments
EDL	00:13:17,695	00:13:21,279	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Including one in the late 1990s in Northern Canada
EDL	00:13:21,279	00:13:23,327	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Reset an actual Forest
EDL	00:13:23,327	00:13:23,839	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Text on fire
EDL	00:13:24,351	00:13:25,631	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Do you actually cut

EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:27,679	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	M2
EDL	00:13:27,679	00:13:28,959	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Affordable realtor
EDL	00:13:29,983	00:13:30,751	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	And then
EDL	00:13:30,751	00:13:32,031	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Japan on fire
EDL	00:13:32,031	00:13:32,543	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Yes
EDL	00:13:34,335	00:13:35,615	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Glastonbury
EDL	00:13:35,615	00:13:36,127	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Yes
EDL	00:13:37,407	00:13:39,455	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	What Jack found in the experiment
EDL	00:13:39,455	00:13:41,247	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Was it an entire Forest
EDL	00:13:41,247	00:13:42,271	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Could be on fire
EDL	00:13:42,271	00:13:43,807	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	30 feet away from the house
EDL	00:13:44,319	00:13:44,831	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	And nothing
EDL	00:13:45,343	00:13:45,855	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	It was fine
EDL	00:13:46,623	00:13:50,719	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	But of course Jack news at the flames and the radiant heat weren't the only threats to the house
EDL	00:13:51,231	00:13:52,767	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	There were also the Embers
EDL	00:13:53,279	00:13:57,119	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	He frequently found himself standing next to houses reduced to Ash
EDL	00:13:57,119	00:13:57,887	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	And next to them
EDL	00:13:58,399	00:13:59,423	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Green trees
EDL	00:13:59,935	00:14:03,519	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	It was a Telltale sign the fire front never even reached the home
EDL	00:14:04,287	00:14:05,567	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	But the Embers did
EDL	00:14:06,079	00:14:09,663	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Jack has a slideshow he likes to share with photos of burned houses
EDL	00:14:10,175	00:14:11,967	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	So this isn't going to be free audio
EDL	00:14:13,759	00:14:15,551	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	And it's like the optical illusion
EDL	00:14:15,551	00:14:17,087	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	The phase in the phases
EDL	00:14:17,855	00:14:18,623	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	At first
EDL	00:14:18,623	00:14:20,927	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	You look at the aftermath of a wildfire
EDL	00:14:20,927	00:14:22,207	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	And all you see is the
EDL	00:14:22,207	00:14:22,975	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Destruction
EDL	00:14:23,999	00:14:28,607	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	But after a few slide almost feel the transition in your
EDL	00:14:28,607	00:14:29,119	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	In your eyes
EDL	00:14:29,631	00:14:31,935	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	I'm like the green trees shift into Focus
EDL	00:14:32,447	00:14:34,239	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	It's easy to see that the home
EDL	00:14:34,239	00:14:36,031	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Is often the only thing that's burnt
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:38,847	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	When you when you see it
EDL	00:14:38,847	00:14:40,639	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	It's like a miracle you're like oh wow
EDL	00:14:40,639	00:14:41,151	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	So
EDL	00:14:41,663	00:14:43,455	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	One of the things that I always
EDL	00:14:43,967	00:14:45,503	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Try to point out because
EDL	00:14:46,015	00:14:47,295	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Everybody
EDL	00:14:47,295	00:14:50,623	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	That looks at news footage and pictures
EDL	00:14:50,623	00:14:52,415	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Can readily observe
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:54,463	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	No trees on fire
EDL	00:14:54,975	00:14:56,255	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	And the structure burning
EDL	00:14:56,767	00:14:58,047	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	So he did experiment
EDL	00:14:58,559	00:15:00,607	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	To see exactly how the Ember
EDL	00:15:00,607	00:15:02,399	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Setting houses on fire
EDL	00:15:02,399	00:15:05,983	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	He discovered Embers like to collect in lots of
EDL	00:15:05,983	00:15:06,751	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Places
EDL	00:15:06,751	00:15:08,799	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Like in the corners of wood
EDL	00:15:08,799	00:15:09,567	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Gutters
EDL	00:15:10,079	00:15:11,359	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Pine needles in an attic
EDL	00:15:11,871	00:15:12,383	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Open phone
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:18,271	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	People evacuate during Wildfire there's no one around to douse The Embers
EDL	00:15:18,271	00:15:21,087	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	A smolder and set fire to the entire house
EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:23,135	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	The more I thought about it
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:26,207	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	The more he came to believe the most Ember fires
EDL	00:15:26,207	00:15:28,767	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	To be stopped with some simple design solution
EDL	00:15:29,279	00:15:31,839	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	I mean you don't have to live in a bunker you don't have to
EDL	00:15:32,351	00:15:33,887	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Cut all your trees down
EDL	00:15:35,167	00:15:40,287	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Jack began to develop guidelines for Designing and Landscaping homes to withstand wildfire
EDL	00:15:40,799	00:15:45,919	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	He started by drawing a buffer based on a conservative interpretation of those Canadian fire experiment
EDL	00:15:46,431	00:15:47,455	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	He called it
EDL	00:15:47,455	00:15:48,991	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Home ignition Zone
EDL	00:15:48,991	00:15:54,111	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	The home ignition zone is limited to the house and its immediate surroundings out to about a hundred feet
EDL	00:15:54,623	00:15:57,951	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Between 150 and 30 seats in the House
EDL	00:15:57,951	00:15:58,975	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	The goal is to space
EDL	00:15:58,975	00:16:01,535	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Trees to the fire can't jump between them
EDL	00:16:01,535	00:16:02,815	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Has forced the ground
EDL	00:16:03,839	00:16:06,143	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Between 30 feet and 5 feet
EDL	00:16:06,143	00:16:09,983	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	What was the landscape and design to the ground fire loses Steam
EDL	00:16:10,495	00:16:12,543	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Removing fuels like tall grasses
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:13,311	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Woodpile
EDL	00:16:14,079	00:16:15,615	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Within five feet of the house
EDL	00:16:16,127	00:16:17,151	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	The going to stop
EDL	00:16:17,151	00:16:18,431	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Fire dead in its tracks
EDL	00:16:19,199	00:16:20,479	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	With things like rock that
EDL	00:16:20,479	00:16:21,759	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Well irrigated grass
EDL	00:16:22,271	00:16:26,111	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	What I found is that you don't have to be very exotic
EDL	00:16:26,111	00:16:29,695	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	About your design and materials in order to make your
EDL	00:16:29,695	00:16:33,023	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	The house is very resistant to ignition
EDL	00:16:33,535	00:16:38,911	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Jack also came up with a long list of suggestions for preventing Ember fires on the house itself
EDL	00:16:38,911	00:16:42,751	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	From the big and obvious ones like replacing your flammable Woodroof
EDL	00:16:42,751	00:16:44,287	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	To the smaller less obvious
EDL	00:16:44,799	00:16:46,847	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Like making sure your garage door has a
EDL	00:16:46,847	00:16:48,639	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Tight Seal with a concrete
EDL	00:16:48,639	00:16:50,687	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	And removing decorative juniper trees
EDL	00:16:50,687	00:16:51,199	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Which RX
EDL	00:16:52,735	00:16:55,039	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Some of these ideas were pretty intuitive
EDL	00:16:55,039	00:16:57,343	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	I've been floating around for a long time
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:17:01,439	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Many fire-prone communities homeowners have long been encouraged
EDL	00:17:01,439	00:17:03,999	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	The clear flammable vegetation in their properties
EDL	00:17:03,999	00:17:06,303	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Send to maintain their homes in ways that would reduce
EDL	00:17:06,303	00:17:06,815	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Stir chances
EDL	00:17:07,327	00:17:07,839	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Catching Fire
EDL	00:17:08,863	00:17:11,679	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Ajax experiments allowed him to put hard numbers
EDL	00:17:11,679	00:17:12,703	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	The people's intuition
EDL	00:17:13,471	00:17:15,007	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Develop specific
EDL	00:17:15,007	00:17:17,055	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Evidence based recommendations
EDL	00:17:17,055	00:17:18,591	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	For the changes homeowners should make
EDL	00:17:19,103	00:17:21,151	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	In Jack's experiment also showed
EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:22,943	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	The windows changes were made
EDL	00:17:22,943	00:17:24,991	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	House was much less likely to burn
EDL	00:17:25,503	00:17:27,807	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	In fact he showed that was the meantime
EDL	00:17:27,807	00:17:29,343	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Factor in whether a house was going to burn
EDL	00:17:29,855	00:17:32,671	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	It wasn't about the intensity of the fire or its size
EDL	00:17:33,183	00:17:36,511	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	It was really about what was happening within 100 feet of your home
EDL	00:17:37,023	00:17:39,071	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	And not let him to a further
EDL	00:17:39,071	00:17:40,351	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Far more radical
EDL	00:17:41,631	00:17:44,447	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	You can have extreme Wildfire Behavior
EDL	00:17:45,727	00:17:47,263	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Not control that
EDL	00:17:47,263	00:17:49,055	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	And yet still have houses
EDL	00:17:49,055	00:17:49,567	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Survive
EDL	00:17:50,335	00:17:56,223	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	In other words we may not even need to fight fires as long as buildings near fire-prone areas
EDL	00:17:56,223	00:17:57,759	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Are designed to withstand them
EDL	00:18:02,367	00:18:03,647	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	It wasn't that there weren't
EDL	00:18:03,647	00:18:04,415	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Other reason
EDL	00:18:04,415	00:18:05,183	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Just like fire
EDL	00:18:05,951	00:18:08,511	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	But Jack said there was no need to fight a fire
EDL	00:18:08,511	00:18:10,559	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Is the only goal was to save houses
EDL	00:18:11,071	00:18:13,631	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Not ruled out fighting a lot of force
EDL	00:18:14,911	00:18:17,471	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	So we have the opportunity to separate
EDL	00:18:17,983	00:18:22,079	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	The Wildfire issues from the home destruction issues
EDL	00:18:22,079	00:18:23,359	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	We can separate those
EDL	00:18:24,127	00:18:27,199	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Which meant we could let more forest fires burn naturally
EDL	00:18:27,199	00:18:32,319	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	And finally break out of the Vicious Cycle of fire suppression that leads to the largest inferno's
EDL	00:18:37,183	00:18:39,999	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Jack thought that he'd come up with a way to save houses
EDL	00:18:39,999	00:18:41,535	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	And let fires burn natural
EDL	00:18:42,047	00:18:43,583	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	He thought it was a win-win
EDL	00:18:44,095	00:18:48,447	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	1999 he presented a paper about his findings at a fire comprar
EDL	00:18:48,447	00:18:49,471	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Events in San Diego
EDL	00:18:50,495	00:18:56,895	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	So I give this paper in front of a group of mostly agency people people with the forest service and
EDL	00:18:56,895	00:18:58,175	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	State Fire agencies
EDL	00:18:58,175	00:19:00,991	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	People in a position to change policy
EDL	00:19:00,991	00:19:02,015	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	And Jack says
EDL	00:19:02,015	00:19:02,783	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	They are.
EDL	00:19:02,783	00:19:03,807	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Totally uninterested
EDL	00:19:04,319	00:19:05,087	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Like no Quest
EDL	00:19:06,111	00:19:11,231	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Jack is up there saying that it's really only what happens within a hundred feet of a home
EDL	00:19:11,231	00:19:13,023	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	It determines whether it burns
EDL	00:19:13,023	00:19:14,303	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	And no one seems to care
EDL	00:19:15,327	00:19:16,863	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Except this one guy
EDL	00:19:16,863	00:19:17,631	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Environmental Group
EDL	00:19:18,399	00:19:20,959	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	As I'm walking out he says
EDL	00:19:21,727	00:19:23,263	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Do you have a copy of that paper
EDL	00:19:23,263	00:19:24,287	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Ajax like
EDL	00:19:24,287	00:19:25,055	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Sure
EDL	00:19:25,055	00:19:25,567	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Here's a copy
EDL	00:19:26,335	00:19:28,639	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	A few days later a newspaper reporter calls
EDL	00:19:29,151	00:19:30,175	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Asking about Jack
EDL	00:19:30,175	00:19:30,687	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Talk
EDL	00:19:31,199	00:19:34,015	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Check is an interview and the article comes out in a local
EDL	00:19:34,015	00:19:34,783	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Wallpaper
EDL	00:19:34,783	00:19:35,295	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	And I don't
EDL	00:19:35,807	00:19:37,855	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Exactly remember the headline
EDL	00:19:37,855	00:19:39,135	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	But it was something like
EDL	00:19:39,647	00:19:41,183	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Poor service has its head up
EDL	00:19:41,183	00:19:41,695	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Pataas
EDL	00:19:43,231	00:19:45,279	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	That wasn't the actual title of the article
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:50,399	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	But the story did imply that basically everything about how the forest service dealt with wildfires
EDL	00:19:50,911	00:19:51,679	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	What's wrong
EDL	00:19:51,679	00:19:56,799	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Because remember the 10 a.m. rural had left us with this huge firefighting infrastructure
EDL	00:19:57,567	00:20:02,431	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	The forest service was spending hundreds of millions of dollars on planes and fire Crews
EDL	00:20:02,431	00:20:04,735	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Was approving massive logging projects
EDL	00:20:04,735	00:20:08,575	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Next on the grounds of thinning out the forest would help reduce the intensity
EDL	00:20:08,575	00:20:10,623	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Wildfires in safe homes
EDL	00:20:11,135	00:20:17,535	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	And Jack was saying actually it would be way more effective if you just encouraged homeowners
EDL	00:20:17,535	00:20:22,655	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Maintain retrofit their properties 9 in the morning I get a phone call
EDL	00:20:23,423	00:20:24,447	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	From
EDL	00:20:24,447	00:20:25,471	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Region 6
EDL	00:20:26,495	00:20:27,519	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Forest Service
EDL	00:20:27,519	00:20:29,823	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	The fire director of region 6
EDL	00:20:30,591	00:20:32,127	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	What do you think you're doing
EDL	00:20:33,151	00:20:34,431	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Immediately
EDL	00:20:34,431	00:20:35,199	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	He was in trouble
EDL	00:20:35,967	00:20:38,015	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	He remembers the conversation
EDL	00:20:38,015	00:20:41,599	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	The director told Jack he was putting those big logging projects
EDL	00:20:41,599	00:20:42,111	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	In jeopardy
EDL	00:20:42,879	00:20:44,927	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	And not put the director in a sticky
EDL	00:20:44,927	00:20:45,439	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Keep political
EDL	00:20:46,719	00:20:49,791	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	But in the middle of getting chewed out by the director Jack just
EDL	00:20:49,791	00:20:51,327	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Double down he says
EDL	00:20:51,327	00:20:53,119	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	He knew what the data said
EDL	00:20:53,119	00:20:55,167	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	He knew the signs wasn't wrong
EDL	00:20:55,167	00:20:59,263	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	And he told the director of the logging projects weren't going to do much to save home
EDL	00:20:59,775	00:21:00,543	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	And I said well
EDL	00:21:02,847	00:21:04,383	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	You might have a problem
EDL	00:21:06,175	00:21:07,967	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Because the research I've done
EDL	00:21:08,991	00:21:12,319	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Doesn't indicate that that's going to be very effective
EDL	00:21:13,599	00:21:15,647	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	That was the end of the phone call
EDL	00:21:15,647	00:21:17,952	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	And pretty much
EDL	00:21:20,768	00:21:22,304	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	The beginning of
EDL	00:21:22,304	00:21:23,072	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Adversity
EDL	00:21:24,608	00:21:25,376	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	For the next
EDL	00:21:25,376	00:21:26,656	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Three or four years at least
EDL	00:21:32,800	00:21:35,872	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	I don't know I wasn't at a level to know whether was resistant
EDL	00:21:36,384	00:21:37,920	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	This is Shawna legarza
EDL	00:21:37,920	00:21:41,504	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	She currently the national director of fire and Aviation management
EDL	00:21:42,016	00:21:43,040	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Forest Service
EDL	00:21:43,552	00:21:46,112	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Jack was first promoting his ideas
EDL	00:21:46,112	00:21:47,136	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	She wasn't in manager
EDL	00:21:47,904	00:21:49,952	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	So she wouldn't comment on the pushback
EDL	00:21:49,952	00:21:50,720	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	The Jack says he
EDL	00:21:50,720	00:21:51,232	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Effaced
EDL	00:21:52,000	00:21:55,328	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	She does say that over her 30-year career in the forest service
EDL	00:21:55,328	00:21:59,936	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	She's seen more and more emphasis placed on strategies like defensible space
EDL	00:21:59,936	00:22:02,752	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Which means clearing your property of flammable materials
EDL	00:22:02,752	00:22:03,776	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	And she's happy
EDL	00:22:04,288	00:22:07,104	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	I believe that people taking my ownership
EDL	00:22:07,104	00:22:13,504	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	And their home and have a defensible spaces is number one service can do to encourage
EDL	00:22:13,504	00:22:14,528	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Rich people to make changes
EDL	00:22:15,040	00:22:18,624	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	A lot of that work falls on local governments and individual homeowners
EDL	00:22:19,136	00:22:19,904	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	And even today
EDL	00:22:20,416	00:22:25,792	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Not everyone is convinced that it's important to invest in the kinds of preparations that Jack recommends
EDL	00:22:25,792	00:22:27,072	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Yeah you know so it's
EDL	00:22:27,072	00:22:32,704	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	It's kind of scattered across the country, communities don't believe a fire will ever happen
EDL	00:22:32,704	00:22:35,008	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Weather out it'll never happen to me
EDL	00:22:35,008	00:22:39,872	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	And I'll never have to evacuate and so I went to keep my trees and shrubs right by my house and
EDL	00:22:39,872	00:22:43,712	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Unfortunately time is telling us or showing us that it does happen
EDL	00:22:43,712	00:22:46,784	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Fire has no boundaries and no preference for
EDL	00:22:46,784	00:22:47,552	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Aware burn
EDL	00:22:48,064	00:22:50,368	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	And in the meantime the forest service
EDL	00:22:50,368	00:22:54,208	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	As a congressionally-mandated duty to fight fires
EDL	00:22:54,208	00:22:59,072	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Last year the federal government spent more than two billion dollars fighting fires
EDL	00:22:59,072	00:23:02,656	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Just a small fraction of that prevention and mitigation
EDL	00:23:02,656	00:23:03,424	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Deference
EDL	00:23:03,424	00:23:05,984	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Parkour culture views fire
EDL	00:23:05,984	00:23:08,544	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Has primarily an emergency response activity
EDL	00:23:09,056	00:23:15,200	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	But if you treat fire only is an emergency response under emergency circumstances you're missing out on all the preventive
EDL	00:23:16,992	00:23:18,272	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	This is Mark Finney again
EDL	00:23:18,784	00:23:20,576	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	You remember he also works
EDL	00:23:20,576	00:23:21,344	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	For the forest service
EDL	00:23:21,856	00:23:23,904	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	He was on board with Jack's ideas
EDL	00:23:24,416	00:23:26,976	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	He also understood that there were huge challenges
EDL	00:23:26,976	00:23:27,488	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Implement
EDL	00:23:28,512	00:23:30,816	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	The reasons why they didn't catch on
EDL	00:23:30,816	00:23:34,656	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	First we can't just throw a bunch of scientific papers on the table and
EDL	00:23:34,656	00:23:36,960	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Have everybody reason to go out cheese thanks
EDL	00:23:37,984	00:23:40,032	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	That's what I needed now we have a different
EDL	00:23:40,032	00:23:41,312	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	View of how things work
EDL	00:23:45,664	00:23:50,272	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	There's too much history behind the idea that we've got to do something about fire
EDL	00:23:50,272	00:23:53,088	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Whether it's effective or not we the public
EDL	00:23:53,088	00:23:57,184	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Expect to see dramatic shots of airplanes flying over raging fires
EDL	00:23:57,184	00:23:58,208	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Dropping water on them
EDL	00:24:00,000	00:24:01,280	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	But when communities put
EDL	00:24:01,280	00:24:03,328	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Principles Jack articulated into practice
EDL	00:24:04,096	00:24:04,608	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	They work
EDL	00:24:05,632	00:24:09,984	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	There are several communities in Southern California built with wildfires in mind
EDL	00:24:09,984	00:24:12,032	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	That survived when nearby homes
EDL	00:24:12,032	00:24:12,800	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Didn't
EDL	00:24:12,800	00:24:14,080	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	But those homes are mostly
EDL	00:24:14,080	00:24:15,360	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Free Custom Design
EDL	00:24:15,360	00:24:16,384	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Gated communities
EDL	00:24:17,152	00:24:18,688	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Homeowners association
EDL	00:24:18,688	00:24:21,504	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	7/4 strict rules about vegetation
EDL	00:24:22,016	00:24:22,784	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Home design
EDL	00:24:23,808	00:24:26,112	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Making changes elsewhere is more complicated
EDL	00:24:26,880	00:24:29,952	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	For starters many homeowners may not even have
EDL	00:24:29,952	00:24:30,720	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Space
EDL	00:24:30,720	00:24:31,744	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	To clear and Fireproof
EDL	00:24:32,256	00:24:34,304	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	It's expensive to replace your roof
EDL	00:24:34,816	00:24:37,120	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Renters they may not have the authority to
EDL	00:24:37,120	00:24:37,888	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Make changes to
EDL	00:24:37,888	00:24:38,400	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Their homes
EDL	00:24:39,168	00:24:40,192	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Remaining cases
EDL	00:24:40,192	00:24:41,472	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	There aren't incentives
EDL	00:24:41,472	00:24:42,240	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	For people to invest
EDL	00:24:43,008	00:24:46,080	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Plus many homeowners just kind of instinctively get
EDL	00:24:46,080	00:24:49,408	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Got the odds of being in a wildfire or extremely low
EDL	00:24:49,920	00:24:53,760	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	There are more than 40 million homes in wildfire-prone areas
EDL	00:24:53,760	00:24:56,064	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	And only a few thousand burn every year
EDL	00:24:56,576	00:24:58,624	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Without someone compelling them to do it
EDL	00:24:59,136	00:25:03,232	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Homeowners might decide is just not worth spending time and money
EDL	00:25:03,232	00:25:04,256	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	To change their properties
EDL	00:25:04,768	00:25:06,816	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	So even though Jack's ideas are
EDL	00:25:06,816	00:25:07,584	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Pretty simple
EDL	00:25:08,096	00:25:10,656	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	They're not simple to actually implement
EDL	00:25:10,656	00:25:11,424	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	In the real world
EDL	00:25:12,192	00:25:12,960	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	DuckTales
EDL	00:25:12,960	00:25:13,984	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	The story about a friend of his
EDL	00:25:14,496	00:25:17,312	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Descended modifying homes to make them fire
EDL	00:25:17,312	00:25:18,336	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Assistant isn't Rock
EDL	00:25:19,360	00:25:21,664	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	And I said to him know this
EDL	00:25:21,664	00:25:24,480	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Is much harder this is social science
EDL	00:25:27,040	00:25:28,832	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	And his comment is
EDL	00:25:29,600	00:25:30,880	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	OG's we're screwed
EDL	00:25:34,720	00:25:40,096	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Jack's ideas have become more mainstream Overtime Bar agencies like the forest service
EDL	00:25:40,096	00:25:42,400	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Now talk a lot about defensible space
EDL	00:25:42,912	00:25:45,728	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	There's more emphasis placed on homeowner responsibility
EDL	00:25:46,240	00:25:51,360	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Jack also helped start the prominent organization firewise which promotes fire preparedness
EDL	00:25:52,128	00:25:54,944	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Shawna legarza the forest service fire director
EDL	00:25:54,944	00:25:58,784	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Does it be enormously destructive fires of the last few years
EDL	00:25:58,784	00:26:03,648	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	I've also forced people to think about how to make their homes and properties more fire
EDL	00:26:03,648	00:26:04,416	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Resistant
EDL	00:26:04,416	00:26:09,792	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	And I think every year there's going to be more awareness about Wildland firefighting in
EDL	00:26:09,792	00:26:13,120	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	An evacuation Zone do you have defensible space or not
EDL	00:26:13,120	00:26:15,424	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Just because of the trends every year
EDL	00:26:15,424	00:26:18,496	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	You know we saw it last year with largest and most devastating
EDL	00:26:18,496	00:26:24,896	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	A fire year and now we have this year which is larger and more devastating than last year human fatality
EDL	00:26:24,896	00:26:26,688	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Firefighter fatalities
EDL	00:26:27,200	00:26:30,528	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	And with climate change the Fire season is only getting longer
EDL	00:26:31,040	00:26:35,904	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	When I asked the Garza if she could imagine a future like the one Jack proposes
EDL	00:26:36,416	00:26:38,464	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	The forest service would get out
EDL	00:26:38,464	00:26:39,232	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	As a firefighting

EDL	00:27:03,552	00:27:06,368	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	When you're that busy running around putting out fires
EDL	00:27:06,368	00:27:06,880	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Literally
EDL	00:27:07,392	00:27:09,696	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	It's hard to focus on how to prevent the

EDL	00:27:18,144	00:27:20,192	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Feeling like all his research
EDL	00:27:20,192	00:27:21,984	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Haven't made much of a difference in the end
EDL	00:27:23,008	00:27:24,544	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	When he's watching the news
EDL	00:27:24,544	00:27:28,640	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Especially coverage of the past few destructive fire seasons in California
EDL	00:27:28,640	00:27:32,992	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	You've noticed there isn't a lot of talk about making homes more fire-resistant
EDL	00:27:33,504	00:27:35,296	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Clearing defensible space

EDL	00:27:47,584	00:27:53,984	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Did what they could no way you could stop a fire front like that
EDL	00:27:53,984	00:27:54,496	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	The fire
EDL	00:27:56,032	00:27:59,104	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	One of the very frustrating things that I had

EDL	00:28:03,968	00:28:05,760	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Is the continued
EDL	00:28:06,528	00:28:07,296	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Sounds
EDL	00:28:07,296	00:28:08,320	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Of fatalism
EDL	00:28:08,832	00:28:10,880	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Oh well there's nothing that could be done
EDL	00:28:11,392	00:28:12,160	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Well
EDL	00:28:12,160	00:28:12,928	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Know that
EDL	00:28:13,952	00:28:14,976	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	The bottom line is
EDL	00:28:15,488	00:28:19,328	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	That we can do something it just doesn't have anything to do with

EDL	00:28:27,776	00:28:29,056	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Something stands out
EDL	00:28:29,824	00:28:30,592	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Especially if
EDL	00:28:30,592	00:28:32,128	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	You spend a lot of time with Jack
EDL	00:28:32,640	00:28:34,176	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Once you get over the shock of

EDL	00:28:54,144	00:28:55,936	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	In a battle with nature
EDL	00:28:55,936	00:29:02,080	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	That nature is more powerful than we are firefighters are battling the fire

EDL	00:29:25,120	00:29:27,680	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	We'll look at one community in Southern California
EDL	00:29:27,680	00:29:31,008	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Which has been threatened again and again by fire

EDL	00:31:32,352	00:31:38,496	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Next week on the show we're going to look at just how complicated it can be for a community to figure out what to do when their face
EDL	00:31:38,496	00:31:41,056	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	But the regular threat of destructive wildfires
EDL	00:31:41,056	00:31:45,920	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	And to do that we're going to spend some time with one Community & Southern California it's called Montecito
EDL	00:31:45,920	00:31:47,456	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	It's right next to Santa Barbara
EDL	00:31:47,968	00:31:50,272	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	And Daryl Cagle has lived there since the mid 60
EDL	00:31:50,784	00:31:52,576	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	It's a lovely place and it's
EDL	00:31:53,088	00:31:54,112	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Where I grew up in a
EDL	00:31:54,880	00:31:56,672	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Very comforting to
EDL	00:31:57,184	00:31:58,464	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	To be in the place
EDL	00:31:58,464	00:31:59,488	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	That is so
EDL	00:31:59,488	00:32:00,256	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Familiar
EDL	00:32:00,768	00:32:02,816	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	The hillsides are covered with Chaparral
EDL	00:32:02,816	00:32:05,120	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	The scrubby brush with yellow flowers
EDL	00:32:05,120	00:32:07,424	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	And the neighborhoods are aligned with eucalyptus
EDL	00:32:07,424	00:32:13,824	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	But montecito's beautiful landscape is also what makes the community particularly vulnerable to Wildfire
EDL	00:32:13,824	00:32:18,176	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	The Chaparral and Eucalyptus both provide excellent fire fuel
EDL	00:32:18,176	00:32:21,248	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	The Canyons that sit below the hills of Montecito
EDL	00:32:21,248	00:32:25,344	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	A cozy little spaces for fire can easily take hold
EDL	00:32:25,344	00:32:26,880	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	And the town so-called
EDL	00:32:26,880	00:32:27,904	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Sundowner winds
EDL	00:32:28,416	00:32:30,976	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Blow hot dry air from the desert
EDL	00:32:30,976	00:32:33,280	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Up over the mountains and through the Canyons
EDL	00:32:33,280	00:32:34,304	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Spreading that fire
EDL	00:32:34,816	00:32:36,096	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	This landscape
EDL	00:32:36,096	00:32:37,632	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Fire is predictable
EDL	00:32:37,632	00:32:38,656	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	And it is inevitable
EDL	00:32:39,168	00:32:41,216	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	And coupled with a multi-year drought
EDL	00:32:41,216	00:32:43,008	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	It is becoming unmanageable
EDL	00:32:43,520	00:32:46,848	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	We had no idea that fires were going to increase
EDL	00:32:46,848	00:32:48,896	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Insights in frequency like they have
EDL	00:32:49,920	00:32:51,712	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Maybe it's like the
EDL	00:32:52,224	00:32:55,296	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	The frog in the pot slowly coming to a boil
EDL	00:32:56,064	00:32:57,344	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	It's just so
EDL	00:32:59,136	00:33:00,672	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Getting worse slowly
EDL	00:33:01,952	00:33:05,024	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	For decades the residents of Montecito is it a kind of
EDL	00:33:05,024	00:33:07,840	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Stubborn Pioneer Street that characterizes a lot of California
EDL	00:33:08,352	00:33:10,144	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	After fires they rebuild
EDL	00:33:10,144	00:33:11,424	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Continue on with our lives
EDL	00:33:11,936	00:33:17,312	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	But that kind of optimism is getting harder to sustain as far as become more frequent and more intense
EDL	00:33:17,824	00:33:22,176	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	And as a community is force to reckon with rebuilding again and again
EDL	00:33:22,176	00:33:22,688	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	And again
EDL	00:33:23,456	00:33:25,504	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	We are entering a new time when
EDL	00:33:26,016	00:33:32,416	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	Because of the weather in the impacts of climate change and long-term extended drought that fires have reached
EDL	00:33:32,416	00:33:36,512	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	A new level of intensity that it's causing us to have to
EDL	00:33:37,024	00:33:43,168	| 317_Built_to_Burn_pt_01 |	In some cases change our tactics or strategies and to start to you know where we're re-evaluating our deal with this
