EDL	00:06:04,543	00:06:06,847	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	Cool but I've caused a big debate
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:13,247	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	This is from a BBC news story from 2014 the reporter Nick Beek is pointing to a set of angry
EDL	00:06:13,247	00:06:15,807	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	Looking spikes that were installed in the concrete
EDL	00:06:15,807	00:06:19,647	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	Floor of a small Alcove by the entrance to an apartment building
EDL	00:06:20,159	00:06:23,487	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	The spikes are clearly meant to stop people from sitting or lying
EDL	00:06:23,999	00:06:27,583	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	Is this a legitimate way to prevent rough sleeping and possible answer
EDL	00:06:27,583	00:06:28,863	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	Sexual behavior

EDL	00:06:32,959	00:06:34,239	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	H one of the answer
EDL	00:06:37,311	00:06:39,615	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	That spiked a huge debate and the
EDL	00:06:39,615	00:06:43,711	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	Even the mayor of London reacted and said that they should be removed and that the
EDL	00:06:43,711	00:06:44,735	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	We should not have a dress
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:46,527	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	Let's keep on this way
EDL	00:06:46,527	00:06:50,879	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	The grocery chain Tesco also at its bikes to areas outside the intro

EDL	00:06:54,207	00:06:58,559	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	They were removed after days of public protests
EDL	00:06:59,071	00:07:00,095	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	The way we
EDL	00:07:00,095	00:07:02,655	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	Treat homelessness and is that something that we just
EDL	00:07:02,655	00:07:03,423	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	I want to remove from apus
EDL	00:07:03,935	00:07:04,703	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	Space
EDL	00:07:04,703	00:07:05,983	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	Or is it something that we should

EDL	00:07:07,263	00:07:07,775	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	Address
EDL	00:07:08,287	00:07:13,663	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	Spikes to stop people from sitting or lying down evoked a wide variety of reactions from the public
EDL	00:07:14,175	00:07:15,967	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	The first time I saw someone lying here
EDL	00:07:16,479	00:07:18,015	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	Homeless couple actually
EDL	00:07:18,015	00:07:19,295	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	I didn't like it
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:20,319	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	Because
EDL	00:07:20,319	00:07:21,599	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	Buy them
EDL	00:07:24,159	00:07:25,695	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	So when I saw those.
EDL	00:07:25,695	00:07:26,719	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	I thought good idea
EDL	00:07:27,487	00:07:30,303	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	A lot of people are bothered by the presence of homeless people
EDL	00:07:30,303	00:07:33,631	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	But some are also alarmed by just how aggressive the spikes are
EDL	00:07:34,143	00:07:34,655	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	It's almost
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:36,447	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	Looks harmful
EDL	00:07:36,447	00:07:38,239	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	You know if you lie I know what you're gonna get spiked
EDL	00:07:39,775	00:07:42,079	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	So it sends a message which I think is wrong
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:45,407	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	It's worth saying that these fights are not just in England
EDL	00:07:45,407	00:07:47,199	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	We have them in the US to
EDL	00:07:47,199	00:07:49,247	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	Outside of our office is a window ledge
EDL	00:07:49,247	00:07:52,063	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	That's where you naturally want to say and sure enough
EDL	00:07:52,063	00:07:54,623	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	Beverly's black metal door knob looking things
EDL	00:07:54,623	00:07:56,415	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	I keep anyone from rusting there
EDL	00:07:56,927	00:08:00,511	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	And one thing that makes me spikes and similar features especially frustrating
EDL	00:08:00,511	00:08:02,303	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	Is that they're just there
EDL	00:08:02,303	00:08:03,327	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	They're not moving
EDL	00:08:03,327	00:08:04,351	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	There's no arguing with

EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:08,191	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	People from sleeping

EDL	00:08:09,471	00:08:12,031	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	I think there is still some possible negotiation
EDL	00:08:12,031	00:08:13,055	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	And I think that's
EDL	00:08:13,055	00:08:14,591	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	Good that's what Society is about
EDL	00:08:15,103	00:08:16,895	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	The ongoing negotiation
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:18,687	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	And ongoing change
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:20,479	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	But when we start
EDL	00:08:20,479	00:08:22,783	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	Using things that are immutable and
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:23,807	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	Unchangeable like
EDL	00:08:24,319	00:08:26,879	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	Metal spikes there is nothing that is going to
EDL	00:08:26,879	00:08:28,159	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	How to change until they rot
EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:29,695	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	I think that's the most important
EDL	00:08:30,207	00:08:30,975	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	Criteria
EDL	00:08:31,487	00:08:32,255	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	The calling some

EDL	00:08:36,863	00:08:40,191	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	We have all tried and probably failed to negotiate
EDL	00:08:40,703	00:08:44,543	| 99pi-0219-unpleasantdesign-1 |	With one of the most common and aggravating forms of unpleasant design
