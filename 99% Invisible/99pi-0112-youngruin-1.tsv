EDL	00:06:47,295	00:06:49,087	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Sutras original idea
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:51,647	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Was that he wanted to build a giant outdoor Aquarium
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:58,815	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	That would be filled by the tides and it would empty it low tide so in 1884 he created a catch Basin that refill
EDL	00:06:58,815	00:07:01,119	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Build naturally as the waves broken
EDL	00:07:01,119	00:07:04,447	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	And then Sutro kept making more and more plan
EDL	00:07:04,447	00:07:07,519	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Adding on an aquarium

EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:46,911	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	That it really didn't work out too well
EDL	00:10:46,911	00:10:50,495	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Which it really is a shame because right outside the beach is
EDL	00:10:50,495	00:10:54,335	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Freezing and usually foggy eye drop conversion isn't that crazy
EDL	00:10:54,335	00:10:55,615	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	And so they said well
EDL	00:10:56,127	00:10:56,639	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	How about this
EDL	00:10:57,919	00:10:59,967	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Take that traffic Beach away
EDL	00:11:00,991	00:11:02,527	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	And we'll put a platform there
EDL	00:11:03,807	00:11:05,855	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	And we'll make that into an ice rink
EDL	00:11:05,855	00:11:10,719	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	And when Tom was in high school his father got him a job working at this very ice rink

EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:19,423	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	People will really come up to me and say

EDL	00:12:10,623	00:12:13,439	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Whitney also thought an Aviary might bring in the big money
EDL	00:12:13,439	00:12:15,487	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	So he ordered some exotic birds
EDL	00:12:15,487	00:12:15,999	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Phantom cages
EDL	00:12:16,767	00:12:19,327	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	What happened was all the birds came in at once
EDL	00:12:20,095	00:12:21,375	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Before the cages
EDL	00:12:21,375	00:12:24,959	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	So they had that we need to go out to all the employees and said okay
EDL	00:12:25,983	00:12:27,263	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Everybody here
EDL	00:12:28,031	00:12:29,823	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Take it home take home a bird
EDL	00:12:30,335	00:12:33,151	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Until Dark Ages come in and then we'll bring the birds back
EDL	00:12:34,687	00:12:36,991	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	But even after the ice ring
EDL	00:12:36,991	00:12:38,271	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Mava
EDL	00:12:38,271	00:12:39,295	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	And the sky tram
EDL	00:12:39,807	00:12:41,855	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	People still weren't coming to sutro's
EDL	00:12:42,623	00:12:43,647	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	The whitneys
EDL	00:12:44,159	00:12:46,463	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	After struggling for 14 years
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:50,047	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Decided we're going to sell the property historian John Martini again
EDL	00:12:50,047	00:12:51,583	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	It was sold to a land developer
EDL	00:12:52,095	00:12:53,119	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Who began to
EDL	00:12:53,119	00:12:53,631	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Demolish it
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:12:54,911	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Amanda
EDL	00:12:54,911	00:12:57,727	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Engine 66 that's when the very convenient fire broke out
EDL	00:12:58,239	00:13:04,639	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	In 1966 a mysterious fire broke out to a pile of rubble an arsonist was suspected
EDL	00:13:04,639	00:13:06,175	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	But no one was arrested
EDL	00:13:06,175	00:13:07,455	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	And then sutro's
EDL	00:13:08,223	00:13:09,247	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Never rebuilt
EDL	00:13:09,247	00:13:15,647	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Eventually the last owner sold the land for National Park Service in 1980 so it's part of a
EDL	00:13:15,647	00:13:16,927	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	National Park area
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:23,327	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Sutro Baths is right inside Golden Gate National Recreation Area
EDL	00:13:23,327	00:13:25,887	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Included into this big National Park area
EDL	00:13:25,887	00:13:27,167	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	It's not a national park
EDL	00:13:27,167	00:13:32,543	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	And it doesn't look like it belongs within the Golden Gate national parks Conservancy at all
EDL	00:13:32,543	00:13:34,079	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	It just looks like a bunch of ruin
EDL	00:13:34,591	00:13:36,639	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Sometimes ruins are more evocative than its
EDL	00:13:36,639	00:13:37,663	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	The site is restored
EDL	00:13:38,175	00:13:42,527	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Cuz this is the real deal even though these are only 45 years old
EDL	00:13:43,295	00:13:44,319	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	They have the same attraction
EDL	00:13:44,831	00:13:46,623	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	The Purge try to explain
EDL	00:13:46,623	00:13:47,135	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	But
EDL	00:13:47,903	00:13:48,927	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	What people are looking at
EDL	00:13:51,231	00:13:55,327	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	So unlike other ruins remains of Sutro Baths for less than 50 years old
EDL	00:13:55,327	00:13:56,863	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	They're part of the National Park
EDL	00:13:56,863	00:14:01,471	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Since 2012 they do have their own tiny Museum and Gift Shop on side
EDL	00:14:01,471	00:14:04,031	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Ride along the Midway used to be
EDL	00:14:04,031	00:14:05,567	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	The street sign is still there
EDL	00:14:06,335	00:14:09,407	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	The roads are still pretty dangerous and too many people
EDL	00:14:09,407	00:14:10,431	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Still mysterious
EDL	00:14:12,479	00:14:14,783	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	So this point you may be wondering how to get out to the bath
EDL	00:14:15,807	00:14:17,087	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Or about parking availability
EDL	00:14:17,599	00:14:20,671	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Or maybe if you can go hold your photoshoot there
EDL	00:14:21,439	00:14:22,463	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Joe can help
EDL	00:14:22,463	00:14:24,255	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	People write me with

EDL	00:14:48,575	00:14:54,719	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	When it was Sutro Baths on Facebook or Twitter those accounts are also run by gel
EDL	00:14:54,719	00:14:59,071	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	In Seattle people ask me like how much does it cost can I get in
EDL	00:14:59,071	00:14:59,839	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	It's just like

EDL	00:15:01,119	00:15:02,399	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	It's never close
EDL	00:15:02,399	00:15:03,423	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	And unlike
EDL	00:15:03,423	00:15:07,007	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Tom braaten or John Martini who actually both experience
EDL	00:15:07,007	00:15:08,799	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Sutro Baths when it was a functioning building
EDL	00:15:09,311	00:15:12,383	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Jill first encounter the place as a ruin
EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:13,407	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Phone out to San Fran

EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:22,111	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	I went down there and I stumbled
EDL	00:15:22,623	00:15:23,135	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	On this
EDL	00:15:24,159	00:15:24,671	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Just
EDL	00:15:25,183	00:15:26,463	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Insane
EDL	00:15:26,463	00:15:26,975	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Playground
EDL	00:15:28,511	00:15:29,535	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Concrete metal
EDL	00:15:29,535	00:15:32,607	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Sticking out of the ground I don't know what the hell it was it was just
EDL	00:15:32,607	00:15:33,631	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Pretty much
EDL	00:15:33,631	00:15:35,935	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	The closest to a magical place I found as an adult
EDL	00:15:36,447	00:15:38,495	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	And if I fell in love
EDL	00:15:39,007	00:15:40,543	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	I think I will
EDL	00:15:40,543	00:15:41,823	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Toss my assets after I die
EDL	00:15:44,383	00:15:47,199	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Jill actually did bury her to pet lizards there
EDL	00:15:47,711	00:15:48,479	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	They're in the cave
EDL	00:15:53,343	00:15:56,671	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	The story of Sutro Baths didn't exactly shape history
EDL	00:15:56,671	00:15:57,951	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Does it help expand Sanford
EDL	00:15:58,719	00:15:59,487	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Transit
EDL	00:15:59,487	00:16:00,767	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Yes you can see the ruins
EDL	00:16:00,767	00:16:03,071	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Briefly in a scene in the movie Harold and Maude
EDL	00:16:03,071	00:16:07,935	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	But ultimately it was a strange glass complex at the edge of the ocean that was destined to fail
EDL	00:16:08,447	00:16:09,471	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	And Amusements
EDL	00:16:09,471	00:16:10,495	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Attractions
EDL	00:16:10,495	00:16:13,055	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Constantly added and removed throughout its life
EDL	00:16:13,567	00:16:16,383	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	But in a city as rapidly gentrifying is San Francisco
EDL	00:16:16,895	00:16:18,943	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	In a country as young as the United
EDL	00:16:18,943	00:16:19,711	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	States
EDL	00:16:19,711	00:16:20,735	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	These ruins
EDL	00:16:20,735	00:16:21,759	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Are an anomaly
EDL	00:16:22,271	00:16:24,063	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	I respect people's desire
EDL	00:16:24,063	00:16:25,087	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	For it to be like this
EDL	00:16:25,087	00:16:26,623	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Mysterious unknown thing
EDL	00:16:27,391	00:16:27,903	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	But
EDL	00:16:28,415	00:16:29,183	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Whack your

EDL	00:16:32,255	00:16:33,535	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	I have been known to walk out today
EDL	00:16:34,303	00:16:35,583	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	And tell them like they're used
EDL	00:16:35,583	00:16:36,095	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	To be there
EDL	00:16:36,863	00:16:37,631	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Giant
EDL	00:16:38,143	00:16:39,167	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Before magical thing here
EDL	00:16:40,191	00:16:40,703	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Know about it
EDL	00:16:41,727	00:16:43,263	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Always read the plaque right
EDL	00:16:43,263	00:16:43,775	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	You got it
EDL	00:16:44,543	00:16:46,847	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	In addition to researching what the battles were
EDL	00:16:47,359	00:16:48,895	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Joe keeps tabs on how they're changing
EDL	00:16:49,663	00:16:51,455	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Ruins seen status
EDL	00:16:51,455	00:16:52,735	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	What affects the ending
EDL	00:16:52,735	00:16:54,015	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	But of course they're not
EDL	00:16:54,015	00:16:56,831	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	I have watched it continue to fall apart
EDL	00:16:56,831	00:16:57,855	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	There used to be a deck
EDL	00:16:58,367	00:17:01,183	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	That you could go and Redan by the cave and then it just
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:02,975	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Crumbled into the sea
EDL	00:17:03,743	00:17:05,023	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Sometime around
EDL	00:17:05,535	00:17:06,559	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	2005
EDL	00:17:07,327	00:17:07,839	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Still
EDL	00:17:08,607	00:17:09,119	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Living in
EDL	00:17:09,631	00:17:10,143	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Dying
EDL	00:17:10,655	00:17:11,423	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	In slow-mo
EDL	00:17:12,191	00:17:15,007	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Which is a process the parks are actually trying to stop
EDL	00:17:15,007	00:17:15,775	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	According to Tom Brown
EDL	00:17:16,287	00:17:18,847	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	As far as the national parks
EDL	00:17:18,847	00:17:21,919	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	So that is not going to deteriorate anymore that already has
EDL	00:17:21,919	00:17:25,503	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	If it deteriorates anymore you're not going to really be able to tell what a really what has
EDL	00:17:26,015	00:17:31,903	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Tom speculates they might do this by adding more signed by destabilizing some of the decaying structures but not
EDL	00:17:31,903	00:17:32,671	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Too much more
EDL	00:17:32,671	00:17:33,695	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Both parks
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:35,743	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Really don't want to do it
EDL	00:17:35,743	00:17:37,791	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	They don't want to make it look like a box
EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:40,863	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	Can I go inside and look at the ruins and it comes out again
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:44,959	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	But recently the young ruins have become something else entirely

EDL	00:17:47,263	00:17:48,287	| 99pi-0112-youngruin-1 |	The ruins
