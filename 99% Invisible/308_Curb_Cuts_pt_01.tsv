EDL	00:01:24,992	00:01:27,040	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	And there was this one storage
EDL	00:01:27,552	00:01:28,576	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	In the building where she work
EDL	00:01:29,088	00:01:30,368	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	It's like that classic

EDL	00:01:31,904	00:01:34,208	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Think of it as a dark
EDL	00:01:34,208	00:01:40,608	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Dusty sort of scary mildly mysterious storage room in a museum there were drug charge

EDL	00:01:42,144	00:01:45,984	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Of mannequin bodies laying around but the weirdest thing was
EDL	00:01:45,984	00:01:47,008	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	There was this
EDL	00:01:47,008	00:01:48,544	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Wheelchair that had

EDL	00:01:55,968	00:01:58,528	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Bank of tripping over it and finally I'm like what the heck
EDL	00:02:00,320	00:02:02,112	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	The Catherine. Started asking around
EDL	00:02:02,624	00:02:05,696	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Where did this wheelchair come from why is it in storage
EDL	00:02:06,464	00:02:07,744	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	And no one at the castle
EDL	00:02:08,256	00:02:11,328	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Which is what the staff called in the main Smithsonian building
EDL	00:02:11,328	00:02:12,352	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Could really tell her
EDL	00:02:12,352	00:02:13,120	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Nobody
EDL	00:02:13,632	00:02:14,656	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Completely understood
EDL	00:02:15,168	00:02:16,960	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Who had owned it had been left
EDL	00:02:17,472	00:02:22,848	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	At the door of the castle with a note pinned to it like an orphan in a bass
EDL	00:02:22,848	00:02:25,664	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	The note said this was
EDL	00:02:26,176	00:02:27,968	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	A chair that belong head Roberts
EDL	00:02:28,480	00:02:30,272	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	We think it should be at the Smithsonian
EDL	00:02:30,784	00:02:31,296	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Ed Roberts
EDL	00:02:32,064	00:02:33,344	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	I didn't recognize the name
EDL	00:02:34,368	00:02:35,136	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Not yet
EDL	00:02:37,184	00:02:41,280	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	If you live in an American city and you don't personally use a wheelchair
EDL	00:02:41,792	00:02:44,096	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	You probably don't pay much attention to the small slope
EDL	00:02:44,608	00:02:45,888	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	At most intersections
EDL	00:02:45,888	00:02:47,680	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Between the sidewalk and the street
EDL	00:02:48,192	00:02:48,960	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	It's just a ram
EDL	00:02:49,472	00:02:50,240	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	A cut in the curb
EDL	00:02:50,752	00:02:52,288	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Through the country now
EDL	00:02:52,288	00:02:54,592	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Just about any place you find sidewalks
EDL	00:02:54,592	00:02:56,384	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	That's reporter Cynthia gorney
EDL	00:02:56,896	00:03:01,504	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	60 years ago when Ed Roberts the owner that wheelchair was young
EDL	00:03:01,504	00:03:05,344	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	The sidewalks at most Urban intersections ended with a sharp drop off
EDL	00:03:05,344	00:03:09,184	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	That's enough to stop a person in a wheelchair from reaching the next block without help
EDL	00:03:09,696	00:03:13,792	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	And the story of how the first widespread Urban curb Cuts came to be
EDL	00:03:14,304	00:03:15,840	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	It starts with a movement
EDL	00:03:16,352	00:03:18,400	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	The demanded Society see disabled
EDL	00:03:18,400	00:03:19,424	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	People in a new way
EDL	00:03:21,728	00:03:23,776	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Which was Central to that move
EDL	00:03:23,776	00:03:28,896	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	At 10 so we're the hundreds of people who helped drag his wheelchair up Constitution Avenue
EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:30,944	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Middle of Washington DC
EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:32,480	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	So we could end up at the Smithsonian
EDL	00:03:32,992	00:03:35,296	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Insisted it was a piece of American history
EDL	00:03:36,832	00:03:38,624	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Ed Roberts grew up in Burlingame
EDL	00:03:38,624	00:03:39,136	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Near San
EDL	00:03:39,904	00:03:42,976	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Who is the oldest of four boys and he loved the play baseball
EDL	00:03:43,488	00:03:45,792	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	But one day when he was 14 years old
EDL	00:03:45,792	00:03:47,072	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	He got really sick
EDL	00:03:47,072	00:03:47,584	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	With a fever
EDL	00:03:48,352	00:03:49,376	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Within a few days
EDL	00:03:50,400	00:03:51,680	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	He was in the hospital
EDL	00:03:52,192	00:03:53,472	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Zona Roberts
EDL	00:03:53,472	00:03:54,240	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	It's Mom
EDL	00:03:54,240	00:03:55,520	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	She's 98 now
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:04:02,432	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	And within two days of that he was in rush to an iron lung because he couldn't breathe anymore
EDL	00:04:02,432	00:04:02,944	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Chinese own
EDL	00:04:03,712	00:04:09,344	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	It had Polio in a damaged his respiratory muscles so much that he needed the iron lung to stay alive
EDL	00:04:10,112	00:04:14,720	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Iron lungs aren't made anymore but back in the day they were these full-body respirator
EDL	00:04:14,720	00:04:18,047	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	That encased polio survivors in metal up to the neck
EDL	00:04:18,559	00:04:20,607	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	And pulled are in and out of their lungs
EDL	00:04:21,375	00:04:23,935	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Is polio wrecked a lot more than his breathing
EDL	00:04:23,935	00:04:25,471	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	You left him paralyzed below the neck
EDL	00:04:25,983	00:04:28,799	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	He could move two fingers on his left hand and that was it
EDL	00:04:28,799	00:04:30,079	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Is paralysis permanent
EDL	00:04:30,847	00:04:36,223	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Parents survived is high fever did not present this as good news
EDL	00:04:36,223	00:04:37,247	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	He said
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:39,039	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Well how would you feel
EDL	00:04:39,551	00:04:42,111	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	If you had to live in an iron lung the rest of your life
EDL	00:04:42,623	00:04:46,719	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	I don't imagine you've ever been in one I've been in one and it's not a
EDL	00:04:46,719	00:04:47,743	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Very good way to live
EDL	00:04:50,559	00:04:55,935	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	In order to escape the iron lung once in awhile and taught himself on his own a technique called frog breathe
EDL	00:04:56,447	00:05:00,543	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	That's a deep sea divers trick where you go poop oxygen into your lungs the way a frog does
EDL	00:05:01,311	00:05:06,431	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Polio survivors whose weekend breathing muscles not strong enough to inhale that needed oxygen
EDL	00:05:06,431	00:05:10,271	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	A person could get out of the iron lung for short stretches of time
EDL	00:05:10,271	00:05:11,295	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	You swallow air
EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:13,343	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Like that
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:15,135	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Swallowing
EDL	00:05:15,135	00:05:16,415	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	And then you can breathe
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:22,303	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	And they kept telling him to stop at that was not good for his body and of course he kept doing it because it kept him alive
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:25,887	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	An ed was determined to stay alive on his own terms
EDL	00:05:26,655	00:05:28,959	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Here he is in a 60 Minutes interview from night
EDL	00:05:40,735	00:05:41,759	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Probably
EDL	00:05:41,759	00:05:43,295	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	The people around us
EDL	00:05:44,575	00:05:45,343	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Think about your own life
EDL	00:05:55,583	00:05:56,863	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	What's tenacious
EDL	00:05:56,863	00:05:58,143	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	But everything was hard
EDL	00:05:58,655	00:06:05,055	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	He was asleep but the Frog breathing let him leave it for a while during the day so he stayed in school
EDL	00:06:05,055	00:06:05,823	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Fast once a week
EDL	00:06:06,591	00:06:09,663	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	How's his family
EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:12,991	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	They were helping the world that wasn't built for a person in a wheelchair
EDL	00:06:13,759	00:06:17,087	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Ed's brothers or his dad would help lift him into his chair
EDL	00:06:17,087	00:06:22,207	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Drag the chair out of the house and then list the chair over curbs in up and down stairs
EDL	00:06:22,975	00:06:25,023	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Or if they'll know we are alone
EDL	00:06:25,023	00:06:26,559	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	She would Rangel strangers
EDL	00:06:26,559	00:06:28,095	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	God have to give somebody help me
EDL	00:06:28,863	00:06:30,911	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Get the chair up the stairs
EDL	00:06:30,911	00:06:32,447	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	So it would be
EDL	00:06:32,447	00:06:35,007	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Somebody in the back of somebody on the framing
EDL	00:06:35,007	00:06:37,311	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Get it up or sometimes it would just be me
EDL	00:06:38,079	00:06:41,407	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Graduated from high school then from a local community college
EDL	00:06:41,919	00:06:47,551	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	The Berkeley in 1962 the University at first said no he was just
EDL	00:06:47,551	00:06:48,575	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	To disabled
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:50,367	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	And where can I safely live
EDL	00:06:50,879	00:06:53,695	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	But she still used every night
EDL	00:06:53,695	00:06:54,975	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Wouldn't fit in a dorm room
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:58,559	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Until finally somebody suggested housing him as a campus
EDL	00:06:58,559	00:06:59,071	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Hospital

EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:09,983	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	So campus officials saw this experiment was work
EDL	00:08:10,751	00:08:12,799	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Newspapers wrote stories about that
EDL	00:08:13,567	00:08:16,127	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Is Mom still like to make fun of the headlines

EDL	00:08:32,511	00:08:34,047	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Then a few more arrive
EDL	00:08:34,047	00:08:37,631	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Both to live in the hospital and to find lodgings off campus
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:39,423	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	The word started to spread
EDL	00:08:40,191	00:08:42,239	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Something unusual was going on at Birth
EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:46,591	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	These students had profound and visible disabilities

EDL	00:09:03,999	00:09:05,791	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	That's the story and Steve Brown
EDL	00:09:06,559	00:09:10,399	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	He has a genetic syndrome that among other things makes his bones break easily
EDL	00:09:10,399	00:09:15,775	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	So he's a sometimes wheelchair user and a co-founder of the institute on disability culture
EDL	00:09:15,775	00:09:19,615	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	So the 60s were a time of lots of protests and lots of Reform and lots of

EDL	00:09:25,247	00:09:26,527	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	And it was
EDL	00:09:26,527	00:09:27,807	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	In the air
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:31,647	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Disabled people

EDL	00:09:34,975	00:09:41,375	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Those rooms turned into the headquarters for an exuberant and irreverent group of organizers like Ed and Hales

EDL	00:09:50,335	00:09:56,735	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	And like a few other coalitions of disabled young people around the country they started using a new kind of language
EDL	00:09:56,735	00:09:58,015	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	To talk about their knees
EDL	00:09:58,015	00:09:58,527	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	It's in REITs
EDL	00:09:59,295	00:10:01,855	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	The radical idea that people with disabilities
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:02,879	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Had civil rights
EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:04,927	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	The right to education jobs

EDL	00:10:14,143	00:10:15,935	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	And the Berkeley disabled students
EDL	00:10:15,935	00:10:16,959	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Had
EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:17,983	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Berkeley reputation
EDL	00:10:18,495	00:10:20,287	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	At that time it was
EDL	00:10:20,287	00:10:21,311	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	An explosive
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:22,079	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	The place

EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:36,671	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	To break down The Doors
EDL	00:10:37,183	00:10:38,463	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	And we had a lot of fun
EDL	00:10:39,231	00:10:39,743	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Because
EDL	00:10:40,767	00:10:42,559	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	It was much easier to organize
EDL	00:10:43,071	00:10:44,607	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	A demonstration in Berkeley
EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:45,887	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Then in Manhattan

EDL	00:11:00,991	00:11:04,831	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	It doesn't really have the same feel as wheelchair-bound right
EDL	00:11:04,831	00:11:07,647	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	And disabled people from other parts of the country

EDL	00:34:31,552	00:34:33,088	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	So I was out of town the last
EDL	00:34:33,088	00:34:34,112	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Couple weeks on the radio.
EDL	00:34:34,112	00:34:34,880	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Okay East Coast
EDL	00:34:34,880	00:34:37,184	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Store which is why Delaney filled in for me at the house
EDL	00:34:37,696	00:34:40,768	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	But I did get back in time to pull Cynthia gorney
EDL	00:34:40,768	00:34:42,048	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	The reporter on the story
EDL	00:34:42,048	00:34:44,864	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Into the studio to talk a little bit more about curb cut
EDL	00:34:45,376	00:34:47,168	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	In this newest idea that
EDL	00:34:47,168	00:34:47,936	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	You'll sometimes hear about
EDL	00:34:48,704	00:34:50,752	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Disability leaders and designers
EDL	00:34:50,752	00:34:51,520	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	That's called
EDL	00:34:51,520	00:34:52,288	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	The curb cut effect
EDL	00:34:52,800	00:34:55,616	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	So what's the story with the idea what is the curb cut
EDL	00:34:56,896	00:34:58,176	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Term gets used
EDL	00:34:58,176	00:34:58,944	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	To describe
EDL	00:34:59,456	00:35:00,992	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Pics that is made to help
EDL	00:35:00,992	00:35:02,272	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Particular disadvantage
EDL	00:35:03,040	00:35:04,832	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	In this case for example
EDL	00:35:05,344	00:35:06,112	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Putting ramps
EDL	00:35:06,112	00:35:07,392	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Sandy sidewalk curbs
EDL	00:35:07,392	00:35:08,160	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	So that
EDL	00:35:08,160	00:35:09,440	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	People who roll
EDL	00:35:09,952	00:35:11,232	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Because I have to
EDL	00:35:11,232	00:35:12,000	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Can
EDL	00:35:12,000	00:35:13,024	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Across the street
EDL	00:35:13,024	00:35:14,048	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Safely at an intersection
EDL	00:35:14,560	00:35:20,960	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	But it's got much wider applications because it turns out that there are a lot of them
EDL	00:35:20,960	00:35:22,240	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	These fixes you do
EDL	00:35:22,240	00:35:25,568	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Having helpful ramifications for a huge group
EDL	00:35:26,592	00:35:32,992	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	The GI Bill for example after World War II designed specifically to help veterans
EDL	00:35:32,992	00:35:39,136	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Wide-ranging population in the United States the home building a Suburban communities Etc
EDL	00:35:39,648	00:35:43,744	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	And so who's the first person to apply the curb cut metaphor to this idea
EDL	00:35:43,744	00:35:47,584	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Nobody knows who came up with the term the curb cut effect at least
EDL	00:35:47,584	00:35:52,192	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Let me rephrase that I don't know who's out there surely knows
EDL	00:35:52,192	00:35:53,472	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	I was not able to find out
EDL	00:35:54,752	00:35:57,824	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	The idea however has been around for quite some time
EDL	00:35:58,592	00:35:59,872	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	And the
EDL	00:35:59,872	00:36:02,688	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Most interesting example of
EDL	00:36:02,688	00:36:08,832	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Recent times that I learned about came from Steve Brown the disability historian we heard from earlier
EDL	00:36:09,344	00:36:12,160	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	She told me that at one point recently
EDL	00:36:12,160	00:36:17,024	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	While he was doing a radio program about his work and disability history
EDL	00:36:17,536	00:36:19,328	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Phone call from his own parents
EDL	00:36:19,328	00:36:22,144	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	You said we'll see that was all very interesting you were good on the show but
EDL	00:36:22,912	00:36:27,776	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Don't you remember that back in Kalamazoo Michigan by the way
EDL	00:36:27,776	00:36:33,664	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	We had some purp cuts and Steve said what and it turned out that in the 1940s
EDL	00:36:33,664	00:36:34,432	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	In Kalamazoo
EDL	00:36:35,200	00:36:38,784	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Disabled or injured veteran
EDL	00:36:40,576	00:36:44,160	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Stop watching other disabled vets
EDL	00:36:44,160	00:36:48,256	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Struggling up and down the Curves in Kalamazoo Kalamazoo turns out
EDL	00:36:48,256	00:36:52,608	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Apparently at least at that time to have extremely high unusually high curbs because of river flooding
EDL	00:36:53,632	00:36:55,424	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	This guy
EDL	00:36:55,424	00:37:00,032	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Talk to City officials into just in a very few Corners downtown
EDL	00:37:00,800	00:37:02,336	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Cutting ramps into the curbs
EDL	00:37:04,896	00:37:11,296	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	People started using it and they got so interested in what was happening that they decided to study it somewhat formally and see what effect
EDL	00:37:11,296	00:37:12,576	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	It was having
EDL	00:37:12,576	00:37:14,368	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	And so Steve told me
EDL	00:37:14,368	00:37:16,160	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	The officials commissioned a report
EDL	00:37:16,928	00:37:17,952	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	So it's
EDL	00:37:17,952	00:37:18,720	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Said
EDL	00:37:18,720	00:37:20,768	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Set the curb ramps not only help
EDL	00:37:20,768	00:37:22,304	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	People in wheelchairs
EDL	00:37:22,304	00:37:23,584	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Thank You For The Music crutches but
EDL	00:37:24,096	00:37:25,120	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Women
EDL	00:37:25,632	00:37:26,912	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Pushing strollers
EDL	00:37:26,912	00:37:29,472	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Send Delivery Man with the deliveries in bicycle
EDL	00:37:30,240	00:37:31,264	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	And then it kind of
EDL	00:37:31,776	00:37:35,616	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Ended with something like it was creating freedom of movement for everybody
EDL	00:37:37,408	00:37:38,176	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Examples of
EDL	00:37:38,176	00:37:43,040	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	That were devised for people who had certain Savanna Jazz but really benefit Oliver
EDL	00:37:43,040	00:37:47,392	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Okay you're going to really noisy bar you're watching the basketball game
EDL	00:37:48,160	00:37:49,184	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	You're following it
EDL	00:37:49,184	00:37:51,488	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	With the captions
EDL	00:37:51,488	00:37:53,792	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	You're experiencing the curb cut effect
EDL	00:37:54,304	00:37:57,888	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	You're trying to get into a building your hands are full of packages
EDL	00:37:58,400	00:38:01,216	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	You use the special electronic button or the button that you can
EDL	00:38:01,216	00:38:02,240	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Just hit with your hip
EDL	00:38:02,752	00:38:04,032	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	You just used
EDL	00:38:04,544	00:38:06,592	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	A thing that was made for somebody who
EDL	00:38:07,104	00:38:09,920	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Can't push the door or in the earlier example
EDL	00:38:09,920	00:38:15,552	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Somebody who can't hear into examples like this all the time without being aware of it and it's
EDL	00:38:16,064	00:38:18,368	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	When I started working on this story
EDL	00:38:18,368	00:38:20,416	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Whenever I would say to people curb cuts
EDL	00:38:20,928	00:38:21,696	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	They would
EDL	00:38:21,696	00:38:28,096	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	General especially if they were under the age of about 60 and had not been around Berkeley when the stuff I'm talking about what's happening
EDL	00:38:28,096	00:38:33,728	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Show me those things that are in the sidewalk so you can put your bag or your stroller
EDL	00:38:33,728	00:38:37,056	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	That's correct
EDL	00:38:39,360	00:38:41,920	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	What was the strangest most unexpected
EDL	00:38:41,920	00:38:42,944	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Carpet effect that you
EDL	00:38:42,944	00:38:43,712	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Found in your research
EDL	00:38:44,224	00:38:46,528	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	So the football huddle
EDL	00:38:46,528	00:38:48,576	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Turns out to have been invented
EDL	00:38:48,576	00:38:52,160	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	At gallaudet University the National University of the deaf
EDL	00:38:52,160	00:38:53,696	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	For students who couldn't hear
EDL	00:38:54,208	00:38:57,536	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Because gallaudet in the late 1800s early 1900s
EDL	00:38:58,304	00:38:59,072	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Had a football team
EDL	00:39:02,144	00:39:06,496	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	They had to figure out a way to communicate with each other so they got in a huddle and we're signing to each other
EDL	00:39:07,520	00:39:09,312	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	And therefore became the huddle
EDL	00:39:11,616	00:39:13,152	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Yes it's true
EDL	00:39:14,944	00:39:15,968	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	So I looked it up
EDL	00:39:15,968	00:39:16,480	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	It is true
EDL	00:39:16,992	00:39:21,088	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	They were signing because they were playing other deaf teams
EDL	00:39:21,088	00:39:23,136	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	And they got into a huddle
EDL	00:39:23,136	00:39:29,280	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Because I didn't want the other deaf teams to be able to read there signs every team in the NFL uses the football huddle
EDL	00:39:29,792	00:39:32,096	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Let me see which animal wouldn't have thought of that because
EDL	00:39:32,864	00:39:35,168	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Across the field you could talk openly
EDL	00:39:35,936	00:39:37,728	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Appreciate hearing teams
EDL	00:39:37,728	00:39:41,056	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	And they couldn't hear you in traffic
EDL	00:39:41,824	00:39:44,128	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	So this is connected to a bigger idea that
EDL	00:39:44,128	00:39:45,920	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Adding a lot of designers Maybe
EDL	00:39:45,920	00:39:49,504	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	A lot of other people know, Universal Design so how is this all connected
EDL	00:39:50,784	00:39:54,112	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	The person who is generally cited as the father of Universal Design
EDL	00:39:54,112	00:39:57,440	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Although it's not clear that he actually invented that term he's
EDL	00:39:57,440	00:40:00,256	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	To cease now Was An Architect named Ron mace out of North Carolina
EDL	00:40:00,768	00:40:02,304	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	He himself was a wheelchair user
EDL	00:40:02,816	00:40:05,888	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	And he did a lot of very influential writing
EDL	00:40:07,168	00:40:09,216	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Message being look
EDL	00:40:09,216	00:40:12,544	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	We shouldn't be thinking about just people in wheelchairs or just
EDL	00:40:12,544	00:40:13,312	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	People who can't
EDL	00:40:13,312	00:40:14,080	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Seorj
EDL	00:40:14,080	00:40:15,360	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Here when we design
EDL	00:40:15,872	00:40:17,664	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	We should be thinking about
EDL	00:40:17,664	00:40:24,064	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Designs that work for everybody regardless of their Mobility their ability to their ability to
EDL	00:40:24,064	00:40:25,344	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Hear their age
EDL	00:40:25,856	00:40:32,256	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	And there is among architects who are Advocates of Universal Design there's a set of set
EDL	00:40:32,256	00:40:34,560	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Seven principles which are
EDL	00:40:34,560	00:40:38,912	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	To elaborate to enumerate here but they're very straightforward
EDL	00:40:38,912	00:40:40,448	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	They should be easy to use
EDL	00:40:40,448	00:40:44,288	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	They should be widely accessible they should use the best of the best available materials
EDL	00:40:44,800	00:40:45,824	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	And so
EDL	00:40:45,824	00:40:46,336	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	The
EDL	00:40:47,104	00:40:47,872	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Curb cut
EDL	00:40:48,640	00:40:51,456	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Has turned out to be a classic

EDL	00:40:53,760	00:40:55,808	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Because anybody who rolls
EDL	00:40:55,808	00:40:56,320	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Uses it
EDL	00:40:57,344	00:41:00,928	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Mostly I think that people think of Universal Design in the physical space
EDL	00:41:00,928	00:41:01,440	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Case with like

EDL	00:41:06,304	00:41:08,864	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	The next Frontier of Universal Design is in the virtual
EDL	00:41:09,632	00:41:11,168	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Because the Internet is
EDL	00:41:11,168	00:41:16,288	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	The place where all of us are leaving for more and more of Our Lives more time how is Universal Design being applied to

EDL	00:41:26,528	00:41:27,296	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Wow
EDL	00:41:27,296	00:41:33,696	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Which is the term that people who work in Information Technology are now using to talk about
EDL	00:41:33,696	00:41:35,744	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Ways to make that technology
EDL	00:41:36,512	00:41:37,536	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Accessible
EDL	00:41:37,536	00:41:39,584	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Available to people who can't see

EDL	00:41:48,544	00:41:53,663	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Person who had originally been involved in the Center for Independent Living that we met earlier in the program
EDL	00:41:53,663	00:41:58,015	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Does this this is her specialty now she works on accessibility of
EDL	00:41:58,527	00:42:02,111	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Technology Information Technology electronic
EDL	00:42:02,111	00:42:03,391	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Yeah those of us who
EDL	00:42:03,903	00:42:04,927	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Thought for
EDL	00:42:05,439	00:42:07,999	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Accessibility of the built environment
EDL	00:42:07,999	00:42:10,047	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	When we realized that
EDL	00:42:10,559	00:42:12,607	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	The electronic environment was
EDL	00:42:14,399	00:42:16,447	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Getting built all around and end
EDL	00:42:17,215	00:42:18,751	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Becoming more and more
EDL	00:42:19,263	00:42:21,055	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Apart of
EDL	00:42:21,055	00:42:22,079	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Of daily life
EDL	00:42:23,615	00:42:26,687	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	We realize that we needed to get involved
EDL	00:42:26,687	00:42:27,199	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Quickly
EDL	00:42:27,711	00:42:28,735	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	How did they get in
EDL	00:42:29,247	00:42:31,039	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	I think that some of the earliest
EDL	00:42:31,551	00:42:34,367	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Problems that they wanted to address were
EDL	00:42:34,879	00:42:36,159	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	How you make
EDL	00:42:36,159	00:42:39,743	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Computer information available to people who cannot see
EDL	00:42:39,743	00:42:40,767	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	You cannot hear
EDL	00:42:40,767	00:42:42,047	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Who can't use a keyboard
EDL	00:42:42,559	00:42:43,327	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	So
EDL	00:42:43,327	00:42:45,375	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	A lot of the work
EDL	00:42:45,375	00:42:47,167	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Mapreduce
EDL	00:42:47,167	00:42:48,959	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Ends up being a factor in our daily life
EDL	00:42:48,959	00:42:52,031	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Siri and Alexa can recognize your voice
EDL	00:42:52,543	00:42:55,359	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Because of technology that was originally designed
EDL	00:42:55,359	00:42:57,919	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	For people who need to be able to address
EDL	00:42:57,919	00:42:58,943	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	A computer in that way
EDL	00:42:59,967	00:43:00,479	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	There is
EDL	00:43:01,503	00:43:02,527	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Program that
EDL	00:43:03,039	00:43:05,855	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Let the record show I will never use that allows
EDL	00:43:05,855	00:43:09,695	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Your email to be read back to you while you're driving your car right
EDL	00:43:09,695	00:43:13,023	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Comes from the kind of technology that was developed
EDL	00:43:13,535	00:43:15,583	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	By people working on electronic curb cut
EDL	00:43:16,351	00:43:18,399	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	What was originally thought of as
EDL	00:43:19,167	00:43:20,191	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Something just
EDL	00:43:20,191	00:43:21,215	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	For people in wheelchairs
EDL	00:43:21,983	00:43:25,055	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Ended up being just taken for granted by everybody and
EDL	00:43:25,567	00:43:27,103	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Used in ways that
EDL	00:43:27,871	00:43:29,919	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Weren't even originally anticipated
EDL	00:43:29,919	00:43:30,687	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Faded
EDL	00:43:30,687	00:43:32,223	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	For the benefit of
EDL	00:43:33,503	00:43:34,783	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Many many more
EDL	00:43:34,783	00:43:36,575	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	The older than originally
EDL	00:43:36,575	00:43:37,087	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Auto
EDL	00:43:37,855	00:43:39,135	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	And that's true for
EDL	00:43:39,647	00:43:42,463	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	The things that we do to make the electronic environment
EDL	00:43:42,975	00:43:43,487	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Isabel also
EDL	00:43:43,999	00:43:47,327	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	So now that Universal Design and the curb cut effect isn't pretty
EDL	00:43:47,327	00:43:48,095	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Widely-held
EDL	00:43:49,375	00:43:52,191	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Uncontroversial opinion of how design speed on WOW
EDL	00:43:52,191	00:43:53,983	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Where are we in the state of
EDL	00:43:53,983	00:43:55,775	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	Design about world or the electronic world
EDL	00:43:57,823	00:43:59,359	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	I would so to sum it up
EDL	00:43:59,871	00:44:02,431	| 308_Curb_Cuts_pt_01 |	In my own experience of learning about this
