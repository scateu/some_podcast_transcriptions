EDL	00:01:57,760	00:01:59,040	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Something had to be done
EDL	00:02:00,064	00:02:01,344	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	One day I had an idea
EDL	00:02:02,112	00:02:03,392	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Call the boys to the gym
EDL	00:02:04,160	00:02:08,256	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Divided them up into teams of nine and gave him a new soccer ball

EDL	00:02:13,888	00:02:17,216	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	I told them the idea
EDL	00:02:17,216	00:02:19,008	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Into the opposing team speech path

EDL	00:02:23,616	00:02:24,384	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	But this one.
EDL	00:02:25,152	00:02:26,176	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	I blew a whistle

EDL	00:02:29,504	00:02:32,320	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	That day in 1891 James Naismith
EDL	00:02:32,832	00:02:33,600	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Invented basketball
EDL	00:02:35,392	00:02:37,696	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	And what role did you have for your new game
EDL	00:02:37,696	00:02:38,208	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Dr. Naismith
EDL	00:02:38,976	00:02:40,256	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Well I didn't have enough
EDL	00:02:40,256	00:02:42,304	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	That's where I made my big mistake
EDL	00:02:43,072	00:02:44,352	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	The boys began text
EDL	00:02:44,352	00:02:45,120	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Kicking it

EDL	00:02:46,912	00:02:49,728	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	They ended up in a free-for-all in the middle of the gym floor
EDL	00:02:50,752	00:02:54,336	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	In subsequent weeks Naismith would go on to make more rules for the game
EDL	00:02:54,848	00:02:59,968	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Some of those are still around today like the one that says players can't run while holding the ball
EDL	00:02:59,968	00:03:00,736	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	They have to dribble a
EDL	00:03:02,528	00:03:06,624	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Rule but it design decision that he made back in 1891
EDL	00:03:06,624	00:03:09,696	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	That continues to define the way the game is played
EDL	00:03:09,696	00:03:11,744	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	He had to decide how high
EDL	00:03:11,744	00:03:12,768	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	To hang the peach basket
EDL	00:03:13,536	00:03:19,936	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	That's Cari Champion she's an anchor at ESPN and host of the be honest podcast and she's going to help us tell
EDL	00:03:19,936	00:03:25,056	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Story today Naismith chose to hang the peach basket at 10 feet above the porch floor
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:30,688	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	There was a running track that went around the court at that level but otherwise the decision was pretty random
EDL	00:03:30,688	00:03:33,248	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	And just a little higher or a little lower
EDL	00:03:33,248	00:03:34,784	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	And everything would be different
EDL	00:03:37,600	00:03:39,136	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	That arbitrary decision
EDL	00:03:39,136	00:03:41,184	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	To put the basket at 10 ft
EDL	00:03:41,184	00:03:45,024	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Cause the game of basketball to take shape around the tallest players
EDL	00:03:45,536	00:03:47,072	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	But it happened gradually
EDL	00:03:47,072	00:03:50,912	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	In fact in the beginning the game was played by shorter less imposing players
EDL	00:03:51,424	00:03:53,728	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	In the very early days of the game
EDL	00:03:53,728	00:03:55,520	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	People didn't really have a conception of
EDL	00:03:55,520	00:03:56,800	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Height having really
EDL	00:03:56,800	00:03:57,312	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Any importance

EDL	00:04:01,664	00:04:03,968	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Very early days guys were like six foot tall
EDL	00:04:03,968	00:04:05,248	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	It was not until
EDL	00:04:05,248	00:04:06,016	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	A few decades in
EDL	00:04:06,528	00:04:07,296	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	That
EDL	00:04:07,296	00:04:08,832	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Team started recruiting
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:09,856	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Really tall guy
EDL	00:04:09,856	00:04:11,392	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Send at the time they were sort of
EDL	00:04:11,392	00:04:12,928	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Refer to often is goon
EDL	00:04:12,928	00:04:16,768	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Nowadays if you play a little rough or dirty you might be called a goon
EDL	00:04:17,280	00:04:21,119	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Back then big men were sometimes called goons just because they were big
EDL	00:04:21,631	00:04:28,031	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	The first so-called going to have a major impact on the game was a big white dude named George Mikan who played for the mini
EDL	00:04:28,031	00:04:28,799	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Fabolous Lakers
EDL	00:04:28,799	00:04:31,103	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	From 1948 to 1956
EDL	00:04:31,871	00:04:35,967	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	He was a 6-foot 10 monster who wore big round spectacles when he played
EDL	00:04:39,551	00:04:42,367	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Notice the comparative size of referee Ackman
EDL	00:04:44,415	00:04:46,463	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Mike and towered over his opponents
EDL	00:04:46,463	00:04:48,767	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Ambrose scoring records with his strength and accuracy
EDL	00:04:59,775	00:05:05,151	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Mike and with such a force they actually had to change some rules in the game to offset his advantage
EDL	00:05:05,151	00:05:08,735	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	For example the rule against goaltending came about because it might
EDL	00:05:08,735	00:05:15,135	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Goaltending is the active catching or batting away another player shot as the ball is on a downward passport
EDL	00:05:15,135	00:05:15,903	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Basket
EDL	00:05:15,903	00:05:20,767	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Mike and was so tall he could just stand under the basket and SWAT away Shots by the other team
EDL	00:05:21,279	00:05:23,583	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Goaltending was banned in 1945
EDL	00:05:24,351	00:05:29,983	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	But rule changes didn't stop George Mikan or his fellow big man from dominating defensively and offensive
EDL	00:05:30,751	00:05:35,359	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	You start to sing people saying like it's too easy to score like they actually were really sort of disgusting
EDL	00:05:35,359	00:05:37,151	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	They thought this should be a Triumph
EDL	00:05:37,151	00:05:39,199	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	To get the ball in the hoop not something that happen
EDL	00:05:39,199	00:05:39,967	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	170
EDL	00:05:40,991	00:05:46,623	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	The ease with which these super-tall players could put the ball in the basket was alarming people
EDL	00:05:47,135	00:05:49,951	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	The traditionalist didn't like the way the game was going
EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:51,999	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	But they had no idea
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:53,279	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	What was about to hit them
EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:01,727	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Bad dog
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:03,775	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Sometimes called the slam dunk
EDL	00:06:03,775	00:06:10,175	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	The first one in organized game happened in 1936 but donkey didn't really get going in basketball
EDL	00:06:10,175	00:06:11,455	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Until the 1960s
EDL	00:06:11,455	00:06:13,503	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Amanda traditional is
EDL	00:06:13,503	00:06:15,039	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	They hated the duck
EDL	00:06:15,039	00:06:19,135	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	But not just because it was a new unconventional way to put the ball in the basket
EDL	00:06:19,135	00:06:20,671	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	The dump became political
EDL	00:06:21,183	00:06:22,463	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	The chi year

EDL	00:14:02,751	00:14:06,335	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	But they slowly came to realize something about the three-point shot

EDL	00:14:09,919	00:14:10,687	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	And you shoot

EDL	00:14:14,015	00:14:14,783	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Just break it down
EDL	00:14:15,295	00:14:17,087	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	It makes so much more sense to
EDL	00:14:17,087	00:14:19,135	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Build a team around 3-point shooting because
EDL	00:14:19,135	00:14:21,439	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	You're going to score more points and that's them

EDL	00:14:35,775	00:14:37,311	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	It's more than 10 times bad
EDL	00:14:37,823	00:14:41,919	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	And if there's any team that's demonstrating the value of the 3 point shot right now
EDL	00:14:41,919	00:14:44,479	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	It's the Golden State Warriors from California
EDL	00:14:44,479	00:14:45,759	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	And Mister Steph Curry
EDL	00:14:47,039	00:14:47,551	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Hurry
EDL	00:15:01,631	00:15:08,031	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	You don't know who Steph Curry as he's about six foot three so he's short by NBA standards but this hasn't stopped him from being the
EDL	00:15:08,031	00:15:11,359	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Star of the team end of the whole NBA
EDL	00:15:11,359	00:15:14,687	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	I think every kid growing up an American I was trying to be Steph Curry
EDL	00:15:14,687	00:15:15,711	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	He is
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:16,479	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Skinny and
EDL	00:15:16,991	00:15:20,831	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Doesn't seem to have anything physically dominant about him
EDL	00:15:20,831	00:15:22,879	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	And yet when you watch him play He's Alive
EDL	00:15:23,391	00:15:25,951	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Curry can hit 3-pointers for Golden State
EDL	00:15:25,951	00:15:32,351	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	From really anywhere he likes which makes it hard to defend against them and balances the influence of the big men
EDL	00:15:32,351	00:15:34,911	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Because of their guys like her who can score from
EDL	00:15:34,911	00:15:35,423	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Anywhere
EDL	00:15:35,935	00:15:38,495	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Then the 7-foot guys have to move away from the basket
EDL	00:15:39,007	00:15:40,287	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Weather most useful
EDL	00:15:40,287	00:15:40,799	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Could have been
EDL	00:15:42,079	00:15:47,455	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	And once you allow players to score an extra point from shooting further out the game spreads out
EDL	00:15:47,455	00:15:48,223	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	You got a whole new game
EDL	00:15:48,991	00:15:51,295	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	The game has changed for the better
EDL	00:15:51,807	00:15:52,831	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Is no doubt about it
EDL	00:15:53,343	00:15:55,903	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	That's former Indiana Pacer Jerry Harkness
EDL	00:15:55,903	00:15:58,719	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Harkness was a player in the NBA and the ABA
EDL	00:15:58,719	00:16:00,511	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Because the game is exciting
EDL	00:16:00,511	00:16:01,535	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	The game
EDL	00:16:01,535	00:16:02,559	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Is running shoe
EDL	00:16:03,071	00:16:03,839	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Quickness
EDL	00:16:03,839	00:16:04,607	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Defense
EDL	00:16:04,607	00:16:06,143	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Opening the game up
EDL	00:16:06,143	00:16:07,423	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Making it more grass
EDL	00:16:08,447	00:16:13,055	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	But even though the 3-point shot has had a balancing influence some traditionalists
EDL	00:16:13,055	00:16:14,079	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Still don't like it
EDL	00:16:14,591	00:16:17,151	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Penile leakage basketball
EDL	00:16:17,919	00:16:21,247	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	And like a circus sort of thing you know when we have a 5 point shot
EDL	00:16:21,759	00:16:23,039	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	7 point shot
EDL	00:16:23,039	00:16:29,439	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Stop doing that sort of thing. Just old school that San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich
EDL	00:16:29,439	00:16:33,535	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Speaking to ESPN about Steph Curry's Golden State Warriors last year
EDL	00:16:34,047	00:16:38,143	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	What Popovich is saying kind of Echoes what people said about the dump 50 years ago
EDL	00:16:38,143	00:16:38,655	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	That it's a trick
EDL	00:16:39,167	00:16:41,471	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	A departure from the fundamentals of basketball
EDL	00:16:41,471	00:16:43,263	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	And I kind of agree with Coach pop
EDL	00:16:43,263	00:16:46,591	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	But even Popovich seems to think that the 3-point shot is here to stay
EDL	00:16:47,103	00:16:52,991	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Do certain degree you better embrace it you going to lose and every time we want to Championship 3-point shot was a big part of it
EDL	00:16:52,991	00:16:58,111	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Instead of Designing the beautiful powerful dunk out of the game we designed a counterbalance
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:16:59,391	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	The 3 point shot
EDL	00:16:59,391	00:17:01,951	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	And now the game is more inclusive than it's ever been
EDL	00:17:02,719	00:17:06,303	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	You got these little guys I can shoot bombs from anywhere on the court
EDL	00:17:06,303	00:17:08,863	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	And there's still room for the big guys close in
EDL	00:17:08,863	00:17:12,447	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	The three pointer and the dunk and become the yin and yang
EDL	00:17:12,447	00:17:13,471	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	A basketball
EDL	00:17:13,471	00:17:15,263	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	All of this has sort of him by Acts
EDL	00:17:16,031	00:17:18,079	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	The 10-foot tall basket to dunk
EDL	00:17:18,591	00:17:19,615	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	The 3 point shot
EDL	00:17:20,127	00:17:21,919	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	But then again the game wasn't
EDL	00:17:21,919	00:17:23,455	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Carefully designed in the first place
EDL	00:17:23,967	00:17:26,783	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Really it came about because all James Naismith wanted

EDL	00:17:31,391	00:17:32,671	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	And the whole thing
EDL	00:17:32,671	00:17:36,511	| 99pi-0199-yinandyangofbasketball-1 |	Started with a couple of peach baskets I put up in The Little Gym
