EDL	00:03:05,856	00:03:08,160	| 38-Sound-of-Sport |	That has caused some issues because I use sampler
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:10,464	| 38-Sound-of-Sport |	What a sampler is
EDL	00:03:10,464	00:03:12,256	| 38-Sound-of-Sport |	It's a keyboard is attached
EDL	00:03:12,256	00:03:15,072	| 38-Sound-of-Sport |	To essentially a digital recorder
EDL	00:03:15,072	00:03:17,632	| 38-Sound-of-Sport |	When you hit the key on the keyboard
EDL	00:03:18,144	00:03:18,912	| 38-Sound-of-Sport |	Triggers
EDL	00:03:18,912	00:03:19,680	| 38-Sound-of-Sport |	The sound
EDL	00:03:20,192	00:03:21,216	| 38-Sound-of-Sport |	At the playback
EDL	00:03:21,728	00:03:25,312	| 38-Sound-of-Sport |	And with keyboard also triggers with sensitivity
EDL	00:03:25,824	00:03:27,104	| 38-Sound-of-Sport |	Means it if I hit the
EDL	00:03:27,104	00:03:28,896	| 38-Sound-of-Sport |	The key real hard
EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:30,944	| 38-Sound-of-Sport |	Don't have a little bit more of a heart attack
EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:32,224	| 38-Sound-of-Sport |	And you can vary the pitch
EDL	00:03:32,992	00:03:35,296	| 38-Sound-of-Sport |	If I hit a C note that has a stamp
EDL	00:03:35,296	00:03:38,112	| 38-Sound-of-Sport |	And then I hit a d note of the same sample
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:39,136	| 38-Sound-of-Sport |	It will be apus
EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:40,672	| 38-Sound-of-Sport |	So for the sea and it gets

EDL	00:04:39,295	00:04:45,439	| 38-Sound-of-Sport |	That afternoon we went out on a canoe with a couple of rowers and recorded stereo samples of the different

EDL	00:04:53,631	00:04:57,727	| 38-Sound-of-Sport |	And then we loaded those recordings into a sampler and play them back to cover the shots of the boats
