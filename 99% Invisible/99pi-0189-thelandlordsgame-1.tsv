EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:11,711	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	The story that starts with Lizzie McGuire
EDL	00:06:11,711	00:06:15,039	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	Willie McGee decided to spread the word about single tax Theory
EDL	00:06:15,551	00:06:18,623	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	In 1904 she patented a board game that she called

EDL	00:06:52,927	00:06:53,439	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	And then
EDL	00:06:53,951	00:06:59,327	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	Botox ruleset if you played with a single tax rules when one player develops property everyone benefit
EDL	00:07:00,095	00:07:04,191	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	But in the monopolist rules the goal was to create monopolies and crushing
EDL	00:07:04,703	00:07:06,495	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	The Hope was you play with both sets of rules
EDL	00:07:07,007	00:07:08,287	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	See the differences
EDL	00:07:08,287	00:07:10,847	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	And come away totally sold on the single tax Theory

EDL	00:07:15,199	00:07:18,015	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	Of course everyone preferred the monopolist ruleset
EDL	00:07:18,015	00:07:20,575	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	Because in a board game
EDL	00:07:20,575	00:07:21,343	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	Evil
EDL	00:07:21,343	00:07:22,111	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	Is fun
EDL	00:07:22,623	00:07:28,255	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	And the landlord's game at a greater capacity for evil than most board games at the time
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:33,119	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	If you look at games that are like late very end of 19th century early 20th century games
EDL	00:07:33,887	00:07:35,167	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	There's not a lot of depth
EDL	00:07:36,191	00:07:41,311	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	They're mostly games where you're just kind of moving characters along a track rolling a die
EDL	00:07:41,823	00:07:42,591	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	And
EDL	00:07:42,591	00:07:44,383	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	I think in that context
EDL	00:07:44,895	00:07:46,175	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	The landlord's game
EDL	00:07:46,175	00:07:50,783	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	Probably stuck out if something really interesting we're different and innovative
EDL	00:07:50,783	00:07:53,087	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	The landlord's game made its way around the Northeast
EDL	00:07:53,087	00:07:55,647	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	College campuses and activist circles
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:08:02,047	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	Folk variations organically popped up in different cities and properties on the board would be named after real streets in
EDL	00:08:02,047	00:08:08,447	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	Locations and around the time of the depression a man named Charles Darrow stumbled upon a version of the landlord's game it was
EDL	00:08:08,447	00:08:11,519	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	Made in a Quaker community in Atlantic City New Jersey
EDL	00:08:11,519	00:08:15,615	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	Future locations like Marvin Gardens and Vermont Avenue and the boardwalk
EDL	00:08:16,127	00:08:22,527	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	Daryl basically now the Quaker version not the landlord's game and started to tweak it into a board game that he would sell
EDL	00:08:22,527	00:08:23,039	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	Tell himself
EDL	00:08:23,807	00:08:24,319	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	He called it
EDL	00:08:24,831	00:08:25,343	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	Monopoly
EDL	00:08:26,111	00:08:27,135	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	Gyro
EDL	00:08:27,135	00:08:30,463	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	My reporting has yielded that he was in fact unemployed at the time
EDL	00:08:30,975	00:08:32,255	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	He was in fact living in
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:37,119	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	And this game made him enormously successful
EDL	00:08:37,631	00:08:42,239	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	Daryl made one game a day by hand he sold them out of his home for $4 a piece
EDL	00:08:42,751	00:08:44,287	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	Do use bright cheap paint
EDL	00:08:44,287	00:08:46,847	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	Any misspelled a few of the locations in Atlantic City
EDL	00:08:47,359	00:08:48,127	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	And yes
EDL	00:08:48,127	00:08:49,407	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	He totally stole
EDL	00:08:49,407	00:08:50,175	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	The concept
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:56,319	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	The look of Gerald's Game was pretty much the landlord's game but Darrow improve the graphics and added some color
EDL	00:08:56,319	00:08:57,599	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	Does it kind of graphic
EDL	00:08:57,599	00:09:00,415	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	Clarity to Monopoly that's really satisfying
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:02,207	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	And the game started selling like hot
EDL	00:09:03,231	00:09:06,559	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	Maybe because it was really fun to handle all of that fake money
EDL	00:09:06,559	00:09:07,583	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	Especially during the Depression
EDL	00:09:08,351	00:09:12,447	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	And then Monopoly attracts the attention of a family-owned company called
EDL	00:09:12,447	00:09:12,959	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	Parker brother
EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:15,007	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	They buy the Darrow game
EDL	00:09:15,007	00:09:16,287	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	Amanda buys leftover stock
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:17,567	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	It seems affirm
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:18,591	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	On the brink of Destruction
EDL	00:09:18,591	00:09:23,199	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	But Parker Brothers wasn't pleased when they learned adero had not actually invented Monopoly
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:28,063	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	So they start to stamp out all the different versions of Lizzie maggie's game
EDL	00:09:28,063	00:09:32,159	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	And finally they buy her patently McGee as best as we know about $500
EDL	00:09:32,927	00:09:33,695	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	Recruiting
EDL	00:09:33,695	00:09:35,231	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	You know the landlord's game which is
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:35,743	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	I consider
EDL	00:09:36,511	00:09:37,279	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	Foundation of Monopoly
EDL	00:09:37,279	00:09:43,679	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	Monopoly then becomes the sole property of Parker Brothers and four years Parker Brothers perpetuates the myth that.
EDL	00:09:43,679	00:09:46,239	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	Cheryl just invented the game out of whole cloth
EDL	00:09:46,239	00:09:49,311	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	Monopoly made a lot of money for Parker Brothers
EDL	00:09:49,311	00:09:55,455	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	Eventually got acquired by Hasbro and of course today Monopoly is everywhere there are hundreds of variations on the
EDL	00:09:55,967	00:09:57,759	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	International competitions
EDL	00:09:57,759	00:09:58,783	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	That McDonald's promotion
EDL	00:09:59,295	00:10:03,391	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	And all kinds of shirts and mugs and neckties printed with Monopoly graphics
EDL	00:10:03,903	00:10:05,951	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	But just because people buy it
EDL	00:10:05,951	00:10:06,975	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	Doesn't mean
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:07,487	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	They play at
EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:11,071	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	I think the people by Monopoly not necessarily to play to the Gris game of because
EDL	00:10:12,095	00:10:12,607	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	It's Monopoly

EDL	00:10:27,967	00:10:31,807	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	Way or in a nostalgic way
EDL	00:10:31,807	00:10:32,831	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	Feeds itself
EDL	00:10:32,831	00:10:33,855	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	Then you have

EDL	00:10:35,903	00:10:39,487	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	That are getting nostalgic about the games that they played
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:43,071	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	And they want to introduce those games to their children and play them again
EDL	00:10:43,071	00:10:46,143	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	In other words monopolies and popular because it's a great game
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:49,471	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	It's only popular now because it was popular then
EDL	00:10:49,983	00:10:52,543	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	And we don't even play by the real rules
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:53,823	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	Will nobody plays right
EDL	00:10:53,823	00:10:54,591	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	To begin with
EDL	00:10:54,591	00:10:55,615	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	How many people died
EDL	00:10:55,615	00:10:56,639	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	Really rad the ruleset that
EDL	00:10:58,687	00:11:04,575	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	For example the way most people play if you land on an available property that you don't want to buy or can't afford
EDL	00:11:04,575	00:11:05,855	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	Nothing to happen
EDL	00:11:05,855	00:11:07,903	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	Spend that is technically wrong
EDL	00:11:07,903	00:11:12,767	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	According the directions if you land on an available property that you don't want or can't afford
EDL	00:11:12,767	00:11:13,791	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	It gets auctioned off
EDL	00:11:14,559	00:11:16,607	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	This could make the game way more exciting
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:18,911	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	Though not necessarily fast
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:22,751	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	You can imagine every turn it's not like a quick decision do I buy this or not it's like

EDL	00:11:25,055	00:11:27,359	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	But let's auction this and who's going to be at higher in
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:29,407	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	So it drives out the game
EDL	00:11:29,407	00:11:33,247	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	But Eric is reluctant to accuse anyone of playing Monopoly wrong
EDL	00:11:33,759	00:11:35,807	| 99pi-0189-thelandlordsgame-1 |	The way we play Monopoly
