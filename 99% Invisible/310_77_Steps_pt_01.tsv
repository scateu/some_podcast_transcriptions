EDL	00:03:07,136	00:03:08,928	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	But it's squared off a bit on the side
EDL	00:03:09,440	00:03:11,232	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	It's a utilitarian looking design
EDL	00:03:11,744	00:03:14,560	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Except it has one slightly unexpected enhancement
EDL	00:03:15,072	00:03:16,096	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	There's a divot

EDL	00:03:25,568	00:03:27,616	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	But by the 1990s
EDL	00:03:27,616	00:03:29,920	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	The company was losing a lot of money
EDL	00:03:29,920	00:03:32,224	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	So Greg took a trip to the factory
EDL	00:03:32,224	00:03:32,736	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	To check on
EDL	00:03:33,504	00:03:36,320	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	When he got there things look really bleak

EDL	00:03:48,096	00:03:49,376	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Greg started to think
EDL	00:03:49,376	00:03:51,680	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Perhaps this place should be shut down
EDL	00:03:52,192	00:03:52,960	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	But then
EDL	00:03:52,960	00:03:54,496	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	He overheard a phone call
EDL	00:03:54,496	00:03:56,288	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Between the office manager Paulina
EDL	00:03:56,800	00:03:57,824	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	And a mystery customer

EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:17,024	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	And I started look through the file cameras of who we were shipping chairs to
EDL	00:04:18,047	00:04:22,399	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	They were shipping chairs to designers like Giorgio Armani and Terence conran

EDL	00:06:32,959	00:06:37,567	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	And for 99percentinvisible I wanted to look at the real and the fake
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:41,919	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	As they relate to the design of chairs
EDL	00:06:42,943	00:06:44,223	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	In America today
EDL	00:06:44,991	00:06:50,879	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Most people think of design and shape the average consumer doesn't realize the design is so much more than
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:54,207	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	To understand what a real Amoco is
EDL	00:06:54,207	00:06:55,743	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	You need to understand
EDL	00:06:55,743	00:06:57,279	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Not just what it looks like
EDL	00:06:57,279	00:06:58,303	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	How It's Made
EDL	00:06:58,815	00:07:02,655	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	There's 77 steps we go through to produce the Navy chair
EDL	00:07:03,423	00:07:05,215	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	That's why I took a visit
EDL	00:07:05,215	00:07:06,239	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	To the factory
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:07,007	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	In Pennsylvania
EDL	00:07:07,519	00:07:08,287	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	The first step
EDL	00:07:09,055	00:07:10,591	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Actual sheets of aluminum
EDL	00:07:11,359	00:07:12,127	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	This sheet

EDL	00:07:16,223	00:07:21,343	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	One of the most distinctive elements of an emeco Navy chair is the butt shaped divot
EDL	00:07:21,855	00:07:25,695	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Legend has it it was modeled after the derriere of Betty Grable

EDL	00:07:49,247	00:07:52,319	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	I didn't see much automation at the emeco factory
EDL	00:07:52,319	00:07:55,647	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Just a number of very skilled craftspeople

EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:13,823	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	The back of the emeco chair is curved like an upside-down U
EDL	00:08:13,823	00:08:17,407	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	And the three vertical slats come down from the top of this you
EDL	00:08:17,407	00:08:18,687	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	And made a curved crossbar
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:24,831	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	The three slots don't go all the way to the Sea they intersect with the crossbar 3/4 of the way down

EDL	00:08:35,839	00:08:40,191	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	The original chair they made for the Navy had a lump of welding I need to join
EDL	00:08:40,191	00:08:45,311	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	But when the fancy designer started working with hammock out they found all the welds to be a little crude
EDL	00:08:45,311	00:08:46,847	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	So emeco ground down
EDL	00:08:47,359	00:08:52,223	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Except for the three welds where the vertical slats meet the arch on the back of the chair
EDL	00:08:52,223	00:08:52,735	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	We leave

EDL	00:09:57,247	00:09:58,783	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	That's why
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:10:00,063	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	When you see

EDL	00:10:04,159	00:10:06,975	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	According to Greg when designers visit the factory
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:11,583	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	I Come Away with a deeper appreciation of the workers and the value of the chair
EDL	00:10:12,095	00:10:12,863	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Beyond its shape
EDL	00:10:13,631	00:10:14,911	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	When I take it architect
EDL	00:10:16,447	00:10:18,495	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	The one thing that they always say is
EDL	00:10:18,495	00:10:19,775	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	You should charge more
EDL	00:10:19,775	00:10:20,287	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	For this chair
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:23,615	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	A lot of Architects must have a pretty big chair but
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:25,663	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Because emeco chairs are not inexpensive
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:28,479	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Anew 1006 Navy chair will set you back
EDL	00:10:28,479	00:10:30,015	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	About $550
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:33,343	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	But you can get an emeco look-alike chair

EDL	00:11:11,743	00:11:14,303	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	When companies don't comply with their requests
EDL	00:11:14,303	00:11:15,327	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	To take down the look-alike
EDL	00:11:15,839	00:11:17,631	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Amoco can take the company to court
EDL	00:11:18,143	00:11:20,447	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	This is what happened in 2012
EDL	00:11:20,447	00:11:23,775	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	When Restoration Hardware started selling the naval chair
EDL	00:11:23,775	00:11:25,311	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	They even knocked off a name
EDL	00:11:25,823	00:11:26,591	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	So when
EDL	00:11:26,591	00:11:28,127	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Someone is a
EDL	00:11:28,895	00:11:29,919	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	A counterfeiter
EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:33,759	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	That's typically the kind of things they do in order to give their
EDL	00:11:34,271	00:11:34,783	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Product
EDL	00:11:35,295	00:11:36,575	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Fake authenticity
EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:39,647	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Restoration Hardware settled with Amoco
EDL	00:11:39,647	00:11:40,927	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Before the case went to court
EDL	00:11:41,439	00:11:43,743	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Greg's also got another big box
EDL	00:11:43,743	00:11:46,815	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Like Target and Ikea to knock it off with a knock off
EDL	00:11:47,327	00:11:50,143	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	He can do this because he has trade dress protection
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:56,799	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Trade dress protection is designed to protect consumers from the look-alike imitations of name brand products
EDL	00:11:57,311	00:11:59,871	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	He's not pressing the function or use of the product
EDL	00:11:59,871	00:12:02,943	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	It's just the dress how it looks and for emeco
EDL	00:12:02,943	00:12:04,479	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	That means the chair shape
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:07,039	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	That shape belongs
EDL	00:12:07,039	00:12:07,807	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	2 m Koh
EDL	00:12:07,807	00:12:09,855	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Nobody can reproduce that shape
EDL	00:12:09,855	00:12:10,623	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	So
EDL	00:12:10,623	00:12:11,647	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Having that
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:17,023	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Kind of protection allows us to be very aggressive when when we need to be
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:20,095	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	But I'm at a lawyer
EDL	00:12:20,095	00:12:22,911	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Christopher sprigman who doesn't think Amoco
EDL	00:12:22,911	00:12:23,679	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Deserves this
EDL	00:12:24,959	00:12:28,287	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	So consumers in the marketplace when they look at this chair
EDL	00:12:28,287	00:12:30,335	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Unless they are real furniture aficionados
EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:32,127	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	They don't think oh this is Amica
EDL	00:12:32,895	00:12:34,431	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	I think oh that's a chair
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:36,991	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Right or that's a pretty chair that chair would look good in my living room
EDL	00:12:37,503	00:12:39,551	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	I don't think that the shape of the chair is distinct
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:45,695	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	It's a it's an office chair design it's been around I have pictures of it from the twenties and department stores in office
EDL	00:12:45,695	00:12:48,511	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	If the cigars litigation I think I would have
EDL	00:12:49,023	00:12:49,535	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Clear
EDL	00:12:50,303	00:12:51,583	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Trade dress protection
EDL	00:12:51,583	00:12:53,375	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Is really hard to get for design Prada
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:12:55,679	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	And Christopher sprigman building
EDL	00:12:55,679	00:12:56,703	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	If a macaw
EDL	00:12:56,703	00:12:58,239	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Ever does end up in court
EDL	00:12:58,751	00:12:59,519	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	It risk
EDL	00:12:59,519	00:13:00,543	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Losing this production
EDL	00:13:01,311	00:13:05,407	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	What really bothers Christopher is companies like emeco and Herman Miller and vitra
EDL	00:13:05,407	00:13:08,223	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Turning to the law to take knockoffs out of marketplace
EDL	00:13:08,991	00:13:12,063	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	To the extent that that succeeds these designs become
EDL	00:13:12,063	00:13:14,879	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	The territory of the Rich and no one else can access them
EDL	00:13:15,391	00:13:16,415	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	But I just wanted
EDL	00:13:17,183	00:13:21,791	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Put a fine point on this so this is a family company that's their business and I understand that they care about that
EDL	00:13:22,559	00:13:23,839	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	But let me just
EDL	00:13:23,839	00:13:26,655	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Say that out there in the world are a bunch of consumers who want to
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:28,447	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Furnish their homes
EDL	00:13:28,959	00:13:31,007	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	This is a country where not everyone is rich
EDL	00:13:31,007	00:13:32,031	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	If you want to be
EDL	00:13:32,031	00:13:35,359	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Stylish and have a house that's nice and you don't have a ton of money
EDL	00:13:36,127	00:13:37,919	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	You might buy knockoff chairs
EDL	00:13:39,199	00:13:40,991	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	In his book The knockoff economy
EDL	00:13:40,991	00:13:43,807	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Christopher makes the argument that these kinds of protection
EDL	00:13:43,807	00:13:45,599	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Given to expensive things like
EDL	00:13:45,599	00:13:46,879	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Chairs in clothing
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:48,415	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Is actually bad for consumers
EDL	00:13:48,927	00:13:50,207	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Because for most people
EDL	00:13:50,207	00:13:52,511	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Knockoffs are as close as they can get
EDL	00:13:52,511	00:13:53,023	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	To the real
EDL	00:13:53,791	00:13:55,583	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	One of the things that's real about them is
EDL	00:13:55,583	00:13:57,119	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	They're there for
EDL	00:13:57,119	00:14:00,959	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	The rest of us right they they they bring the rest of us into
EDL	00:14:01,471	00:14:07,615	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	The world of the artist right they allow us to participate in the fashion world even if we can't afford the stuff
EDL	00:14:07,615	00:14:09,407	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	That is paraded on the runway
EDL	00:14:09,407	00:14:11,967	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	They allow us to participate in the world of
EDL	00:14:11,967	00:14:12,991	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Industrial design
EDL	00:14:12,991	00:14:14,527	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Furniture kitchen appliances
EDL	00:14:14,527	00:14:16,575	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Does etcetera even if we can't afford
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:17,599	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	The super expensive
EDL	00:14:17,599	00:14:18,111	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Browns
EDL	00:14:18,623	00:14:19,903	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	That's democratizing
EDL	00:14:21,439	00:14:22,719	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	I think it makes the country
EDL	00:14:22,719	00:14:23,999	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	You prettier and more enjoyable
EDL	00:14:24,767	00:14:26,815	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	But for Greg Amico knock-offs
EDL	00:14:26,815	00:14:29,631	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Also make the country the whole planet worse
EDL	00:14:30,143	00:14:31,679	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	By filling landfill
EDL	00:14:31,679	00:14:32,703	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	What's with garbage chair
EDL	00:14:33,215	00:14:35,007	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Oliver product is engineered
EDL	00:14:35,775	00:14:36,543	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	To be made
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:38,335	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	For the longest life possible
EDL	00:14:38,847	00:14:40,639	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Anak office is
EDL	00:14:40,639	00:14:42,943	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Is Shirley made to be
EDL	00:14:43,455	00:14:43,967	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Seoul
EDL	00:14:44,479	00:14:44,991	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Used
EDL	00:14:45,759	00:14:46,527	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Thrown away
EDL	00:14:47,295	00:14:48,319	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Great Clips
EDL	00:14:48,319	00:14:51,391	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Probably still make nice chairs for less money
EDL	00:14:51,903	00:14:52,671	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	But it takes
EDL	00:14:52,671	00:14:54,463	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	77 steps to
EDL	00:14:54,463	00:14:56,255	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Make a torpedo proof chair
EDL	00:14:57,023	00:14:58,815	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Torpedo proof chair
EDL	00:14:58,815	00:15:00,351	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Will last 250 years
EDL	00:15:01,119	00:15:02,143	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	The goal is to
EDL	00:15:02,143	00:15:03,167	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	To produce something
EDL	00:15:03,167	00:15:04,959	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Where it has the least impact
EDL	00:15:05,727	00:15:07,007	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Environmentally
EDL	00:15:07,007	00:15:08,287	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	All the way through
EDL	00:15:08,287	00:15:09,567	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	And has the longest life
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:13,919	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	To me that's the very best kind of product can you do
EDL	00:15:16,223	00:15:18,527	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Greg genuinely cares about sustainability
EDL	00:15:19,039	00:15:25,183	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	I spent just a few days with him but I know he thinks food tastes worse when it's served in disposable
EDL	00:15:26,207	00:15:28,255	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	And that he travels with his own silverware
EDL	00:15:28,767	00:15:31,071	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	This is why he wishes he could use the law
EDL	00:15:31,583	00:15:32,095	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	To go after
EDL	00:15:33,887	00:15:34,911	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	The lookalikes
EDL	00:15:34,911	00:15:36,191	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	And the almost
EDL	00:15:36,191	00:15:36,703	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Looks like
EDL	00:15:37,471	00:15:40,031	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Like the popular lightweight aluminum Delta
EDL	00:15:40,031	00:15:41,567	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	The chair from Crate & Barrel
EDL	00:15:42,079	00:15:43,615	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	I showed him a photo of his
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:45,663	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	What is this a fake
EDL	00:15:46,431	00:15:47,455	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Absolutely Frank
EDL	00:15:48,223	00:15:49,759	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	What they've done here is they
EDL	00:15:49,759	00:15:52,319	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	They put instead of three bars on the vertical back they put
EDL	00:15:52,319	00:15:53,087	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	4 bars
EDL	00:15:53,087	00:15:54,111	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Instead of having a
EDL	00:15:54,623	00:15:55,903	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Horizontal
EDL	00:15:56,415	00:15:57,439	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Or
EDL	00:15:57,439	00:15:59,743	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Towards the bottom they take these
EDL	00:15:59,743	00:16:02,559	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Or vertical bars and bring them all the way down
EDL	00:16:02,559	00:16:03,071	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	The seat bottom
EDL	00:16:03,583	00:16:04,351	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	But
EDL	00:16:04,351	00:16:05,119	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	It's the same
EDL	00:16:05,119	00:16:09,215	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Tube-shaped it's bent the same way the legs are the same configuration
EDL	00:16:09,215	00:16:13,055	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	The seat bottom has the bomb dipping if the front legs have the taper
EDL	00:16:13,055	00:16:14,591	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	This is May 2
EDL	00:16:15,103	00:16:16,127	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Look like anime
EDL	00:16:16,127	00:16:16,639	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Chair
EDL	00:16:18,431	00:16:20,223	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	We have a good look after dental work
EDL	00:16:20,223	00:16:20,735	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Amazing
EDL	00:16:21,247	00:16:25,855	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Benjamin took me to a Crate & Barrel in Manhattan to show me the chair in question
EDL	00:16:25,855	00:16:29,695	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	I think we have to go in this room I came in here looking for the other day
EDL	00:16:31,231	00:16:37,631	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	And look what these bastards did with us knock off
EDL	00:16:37,631	00:16:38,399	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Of the
EDL	00:16:46,335	00:16:49,407	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	To The Crate & Barrel chair is different enough to avoid a lawsuit
EDL	00:16:49,919	00:16:53,247	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	But it retain those signature welds of the emeco chair
EDL	00:16:53,247	00:16:54,783	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	To give it that handcraft
EDL	00:16:54,783	00:16:55,295	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	To feel
EDL	00:16:55,807	00:16:58,111	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	But even if they mimic the wellness according to Greg
EDL	00:16:58,623	00:17:02,463	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	There will always be one key difference between the emeco chair
EDL	00:17:02,463	00:17:02,975	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	And this one
EDL	00:17:03,487	00:17:07,839	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	It it won't last it's not designed to last as long as our Cheerios
EDL	00:17:08,863	00:17:10,655	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Greg is fairly certain
EDL	00:17:10,655	00:17:12,703	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	It wouldn't pass the original test
EDL	00:17:12,703	00:17:14,751	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Turn off that 8 story building
EDL	00:17:15,519	00:17:16,287	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Of course
EDL	00:17:16,287	00:17:18,079	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	There's really only one way to find out
EDL	00:17:19,871	00:17:23,455	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	The helicopter noise to the helicopter
EDL	00:17:24,479	00:17:29,343	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Now that I have you on my roof on the 7th floor with the knockoff
EDL	00:17:29,343	00:17:30,623	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Crate & Barrel
EDL	00:17:30,623	00:17:31,391	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	I kind of
EDL	00:17:31,391	00:17:33,439	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	I think the ultimate test is throwing it off
EDL	00:17:33,439	00:17:34,975	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	See what happened
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:42,143	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	You're on your own for that when you do that on your so there's no absolutely not
EDL	00:17:43,167	00:17:44,447	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Let me hear what happens next
EDL	00:17:44,447	00:17:48,287	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	You're going to have to go to The Theory of Everything Everything me
EDL	00:17:58,527	00:18:02,879	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	When it's here is designed specifically to be affordable and that becomes expensive
EDL	00:18:02,879	00:18:05,183	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	And then affordable knockoffs are created
EDL	00:18:05,183	00:18:06,719	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Which is the real chair
EDL	00:18:07,487	00:18:09,791	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Percocet and I talk more about fake chair
EDL	00:18:10,559	00:18:11,071	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	After that
EDL	00:18:15,423	00:18:16,447	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Between the beats
EDL	00:18:16,447	00:18:18,751	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Bongs and chatter of our devices
EDL	00:18:18,751	00:18:22,079	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound
EDL	00:18:22,847	00:18:27,967	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	If I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexis
EDL	00:18:27,967	00:18:33,855	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Is talking to me and my wife is in another room and a kid is another remembrall hearing that voice

EDL	00:20:07,807	00:20:12,671	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	In the mid-1900s they made all kinds of architectural products graphics

EDL	00:20:36,223	00:20:42,623	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Charles Eames once said that their 1950s lounge chair was designed to be soft and cushy because he was sick of people
EDL	00:20:42,623	00:20:45,183	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Complaining about how uncomfortable modern furniture
EDL	00:20:46,463	00:20:49,279	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Answer those complaints were pretty understandable
EDL	00:20:49,279	00:20:52,095	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	In response to what are the other best sellers
EDL	00:20:52,095	00:20:53,119	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Design a few years earlier
EDL	00:20:53,631	00:20:55,423	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	A series of molded fiberglass
EDL	00:20:55,423	00:20:56,191	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Best Chairs
EDL	00:20:56,191	00:20:58,751	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	So I know this one and you probably encounter.
EDL	00:20:58,751	00:21:01,567	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	I kind of think of it as the school chair it's a
EDL	00:21:01,567	00:21:03,615	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Has metal legs that you can stock up and
EDL	00:21:03,615	00:21:05,151	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Is this mean seat pieces
EDL	00:21:05,663	00:21:08,223	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Molded into a curvy L shape
EDL	00:21:08,223	00:21:10,015	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	And then there are various account
EDL	00:21:10,015	00:21:16,159	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Arms are no worms that can have different legs different thousand faces all I kind of saw
EDL	00:21:16,672	00:21:22,560	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Buyers could pick a base for the home or pick one for the office you have something more minimalist or something more stylish
EDL	00:21:23,072	00:21:27,424	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	But the chairs weren't just designed to look nice they were also meant to be affordable and functional
EDL	00:21:27,936	00:21:29,984	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	So they were low-cost easy to master
EDL	00:21:29,984	00:21:30,752	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Mapreduce
EDL	00:21:30,752	00:21:32,288	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Easy to move around easily
EDL	00:21:32,288	00:21:32,800	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Keep clean
EDL	00:21:33,312	00:21:38,944	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Actually the first prototype was built for an international competition for low-cost Furniture Design
EDL	00:21:39,456	00:21:40,480	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Which was hosted by
EDL	00:21:40,480	00:21:42,528	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Museum of Modern Art New York City
EDL	00:21:42,528	00:21:44,320	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	And so did it actually win this compass
EDL	00:21:44,832	00:21:48,160	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Actually no second place
EDL	00:21:48,672	00:21:54,048	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	You know $3,000 a piece or so
EDL	00:21:54,048	00:21:58,912	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Jury reportedly like that modular approach but they may have taken off points
EDL	00:21:58,912	00:22:00,704	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Because the Prototype was made a stamp
EDL	00:22:00,704	00:22:02,752	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Still and that's a tricky
EDL	00:22:02,752	00:22:04,800	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Inexpensive material to work with
EDL	00:22:04,800	00:22:05,568	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Takes these
EDL	00:22:05,568	00:22:07,104	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	High pressures and high temperatures
EDL	00:22:07,616	00:22:08,896	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	24 Mass
EDL	00:22:09,408	00:22:10,432	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Actually switch
EDL	00:22:10,432	00:22:12,736	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	2 fiber reinforced plastic
EDL	00:22:12,736	00:22:16,320	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	And because the chairs are made up of just a few pieces they were easy to assemble
EDL	00:22:16,832	00:22:19,648	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	And that sounds a lot different from the 77 step process
EDL	00:22:19,648	00:22:21,696	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	That's great the aluminum Navy chair
EDL	00:22:22,208	00:22:24,768	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Really is and that Simplicity is by Design
EDL	00:22:25,536	00:22:27,840	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	But these different areas do actually have something in common
EDL	00:22:28,352	00:22:30,656	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Knock-off companies love to make copies
EDL	00:22:31,680	00:22:35,520	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	And according to One Source I found one of these molded Eames chair variants
EDL	00:22:36,032	00:22:38,592	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	This one that has what's called the Eiffel Tower base
EDL	00:22:38,592	00:22:39,616	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Which is the son of
EDL	00:22:39,616	00:22:42,176	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Four legs with these criss-crossing middle connectors
EDL	00:22:42,176	00:22:43,968	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Is actually one of the most copied
EDL	00:22:43,968	00:22:45,248	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Chairs in the world today
EDL	00:22:45,248	00:22:47,296	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	But if they were designed to be affordable
EDL	00:22:47,296	00:22:48,064	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	What is the incentive
EDL	00:22:48,576	00:22:50,112	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	And make copies of them
EDL	00:22:50,112	00:22:53,440	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	YouTubers that are officially licensed by vitra
EDL	00:22:53,440	00:22:54,464	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Actually self

EDL	00:23:02,144	00:23:04,448	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Given the same quote that Victor has up on their website

EDL	00:23:07,008	00:23:09,312	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	To the greatest number of people for the lease
EDL	00:23:10,336	00:23:13,408	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	And maybe the real ones really are much higher quality

EDL	00:23:14,944	00:23:15,712	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Bill seems really high
EDL	00:23:16,224	00:23:19,040	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	And so are these copies illegal copies license

EDL	00:23:19,808	00:23:20,576	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Deal with them
EDL	00:23:20,576	00:23:22,112	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Will it varies by place
EDL	00:23:22,112	00:23:24,160	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	And in the UK for instance

EDL	00:24:12,544	00:24:15,360	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	And when all this started advertising a pair of

EDL	00:24:22,016	00:24:24,576	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Some argue that these very ghetto reprehensible knock
EDL	00:24:25,600	00:24:27,136	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Eames Originals
EDL	00:24:27,136	00:24:31,488	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	But this one architect and design critic who writes The Guardian defended the copies
EDL	00:24:31,488	00:24:32,000	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Asking
EDL	00:24:32,512	00:24:35,072	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Isn't this exactly what Charles Eames would have
EDL	00:24:36,096	00:24:38,144	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	What do you think Charles and Ray Eames would have

EDL	00:24:40,704	00:24:42,752	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Obviously we'll we'll never know for sure

EDL	00:24:46,080	00:24:46,848	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	I really
EDL	00:24:46,848	00:24:50,432	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	Just keep wondering if maybe they'd have seen these affordable copies
EDL	00:24:51,200	00:24:54,272	| 310_77_Steps_pt_01 |	As more real than fake and some cents
