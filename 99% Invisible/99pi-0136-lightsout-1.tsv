EDL	00:04:56,703	00:04:59,519	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	When one mind shuts off the electricity start squeezing a
EDL	00:05:00,031	00:05:01,567	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	Smaller and smaller channels
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:03,615	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	Like how cars on the freeway crowded
EDL	00:05:03,615	00:05:05,663	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	Single-lane when the other lanes are blocked
EDL	00:05:06,175	00:05:08,479	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	This is all fairly normal so far
EDL	00:05:08,479	00:05:11,551	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	But then
EDL	00:05:11,551	00:05:13,599	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	Flash of lightning
EDL	00:05:14,623	00:05:15,647	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	And this knocked out a couple of

EDL	00:05:17,695	00:05:21,023	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	So now you got even more electricity with
EDL	00:05:21,023	00:05:22,047	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	Fewer lines
EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:23,071	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	To distribute it
EDL	00:05:23,071	00:05:24,607	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	And it was hot outside
EDL	00:05:24,607	00:05:25,375	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	Really hot
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:31,263	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	Which meant that lots of New Yorkers were running lots of air conditioners putting an extra burden on the system
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:32,543	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	And now
EDL	00:05:32,543	00:05:34,847	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	They started to have trouble there wasn't enough
EDL	00:05:34,847	00:05:37,407	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	Room for all the electricity to flow
EDL	00:05:37,919	00:05:44,319	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	And so Con Edison that same power company that Thomas Edison started way back when he was laying the lines for the first
EDL	00:05:44,319	00:05:45,343	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	First electrical grid
EDL	00:05:45,343	00:05:48,927	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	Started doing the debris last thing they like to do which is
EDL	00:05:48,927	00:05:49,695	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	Turn off

EDL	00:06:03,007	00:06:04,543	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	It was still pretty much a

EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:10,687	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	It didn't have a name you know people referred to

EDL	00:06:48,319	00:06:53,439	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	It was like a powder keg like something like that was on the verge of happening all the time all it took was something to
EDL	00:06:53,951	00:06:55,231	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	To push it over the edge
EDL	00:06:55,231	00:07:01,631	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	A couple years before in 1975 New York City was in such a dire financial situation that it had turned
EDL	00:07:01,631	00:07:03,167	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	The federal government for a bailout
EDL	00:07:03,679	00:07:09,823	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	President Gerald Ford's response was a resounding no prompting the New York daily news to running now famous headline
EDL	00:07:10,591	00:07:11,359	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	For the city
EDL	00:07:11,871	00:07:12,383	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	Drop dead
EDL	00:07:13,151	00:07:16,223	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	In 1977 things were still bad for New York
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:18,527	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	And in the Bronx they were even worse
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:24,415	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	You had neighborhoods that had lost something like 46% of the population my name is Lloyd
EDL	00:07:26,207	00:07:27,999	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	The Bronx Borough historian
EDL	00:07:27,999	00:07:30,047	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	And they were blocks at the Block at the Block
EDL	00:07:30,559	00:07:31,071	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	Rubble
EDL	00:07:31,583	00:07:36,959	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	And the ombatse what was on the horizon where buildings that were empty and boarded up
EDL	00:07:37,727	00:07:38,751	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	Really it look like
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:40,031	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	Berlin right after
EDL	00:07:40,031	00:07:41,567	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	The bombings in World War II
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:45,663	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	The municipal government had forgotten about the Bronx and then the youth
EDL	00:07:45,663	00:07:47,455	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	In the Bronx have been forgotten about
EDL	00:07:47,455	00:07:48,735	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	By the older people in the Bronx
EDL	00:07:48,735	00:07:55,135	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	We didn't have those music programs all those were cut out when we were kids you know we had them but those intermediate years
EDL	00:07:55,135	00:07:57,183	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	This is like we don't have none of that anymore
EDL	00:07:57,695	00:08:02,047	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	So they work like a forgotten minority of a forgotten minority of the Forgotten minority
EDL	00:08:02,047	00:08:03,071	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	So I mean you can
EDL	00:08:03,071	00:08:04,095	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	You can really see how people
EDL	00:08:04,607	00:08:05,375	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	Enfield today
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:11,263	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	I mean is it's hard to describe you know what I mean cuz that we older
EDL	00:08:11,263	00:08:14,591	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	I can look back and say wow we got through some pretty rough times
EDL	00:08:15,103	00:08:18,431	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	Do you know if you were born into rough times then it's just time
EDL	00:08:33,279	00:08:39,423	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	And once again my friend the funky beat has no end we bout to take it on down to the
EDL	00:08:40,447	00:08:41,983	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	Would you and your friends
EDL	00:08:41,983	00:08:46,335	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	Put the sound to hear it's got a tough on your ear coming at you so loud
EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:48,383	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	But you have no fear
EDL	00:08:49,663	00:08:52,479	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	On the evening of July 13th 1977
EDL	00:08:52,991	00:08:54,271	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	The same day as the blackout
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:57,343	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	Grandmaster Caz and his partner disco Wiz
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:08:59,135	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	I've been challenged to a DJ battle
EDL	00:08:59,135	00:08:59,647	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	Buy another
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:00,671	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	DJ
EDL	00:09:01,183	00:09:03,999	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	So we decided to take our equipment out into the park
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:10,911	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	We used to hang out play basketball in everyday so that's where the battle was going to take place they said up all their stuff so
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:11,423	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	Side by side
EDL	00:09:12,191	00:09:15,519	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	I just remember them having a very very
EDL	00:09:15,519	00:09:17,567	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	Good professional sound system
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:18,847	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	Pandas have an hour
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:22,175	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	Thrown together it all in pieces set
EDL	00:09:22,943	00:09:24,735	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	The two groups of DJ started the battle
EDL	00:09:25,247	00:09:28,831	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	I was doing this dude combo that I used to do
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:32,159	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	And one song was a song by DC LaRue
EDL	00:09:32,927	00:09:34,719	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	And I was cut it up
EDL	00:09:34,719	00:09:35,999	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	With this other break fee
EDL	00:09:38,559	00:09:42,143	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	Repentance
EDL	00:09:42,143	00:09:42,911	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	Love
EDL	00:09:42,911	00:09:44,703	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	And I was chilling
EDL	00:09:44,703	00:09:48,543	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	Now remember that the hype
EDL	00:09:48,543	00:09:50,847	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	Of everybody you know being really excited
EDL	00:09:54,175	00:09:56,735	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	And then the record just started slowing down
EDL	00:09:57,503	00:09:59,039	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	You know what I mean just you know
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:10:04,159	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	Do not turntable cuts off and then just that kind of situation
EDL	00:10:05,695	00:10:07,487	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	So quite naturally we thought
EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:08,767	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	It was us
EDL	00:10:09,535	00:10:14,399	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	We thought we had drain too much power and we shorted out you know the electricity
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:22,079	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	So we're frantically looking around with checking buttons with checking switches with seeing what's up cuz this is death in a battle if your
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:23,103	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	System comes out on you
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:27,199	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	But after a while
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:30,783	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	Everything around us started getting dark I mean windows
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:33,599	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	The apartment buildings around us we're all dark
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:37,695	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	Kind of came over everybody at the same time like oh
EDL	00:10:41,791	00:10:45,119	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	Generators all over the city had been turning themselves off one by one
EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:48,191	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	And then the biggest generator in the city
EDL	00:10:48,191	00:10:50,495	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	A machine called Big Alice
EDL	00:10:50,495	00:10:51,519	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	Turned itself off
EDL	00:10:52,799	00:10:55,871	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	Just about everything left that was still lit up in the air
EDL	00:10:55,871	00:10:56,383	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	Turned off
EDL	00:10:57,151	00:10:59,711	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	Boroughs of New York City went dark
EDL	00:11:00,479	00:11:02,271	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	Turn All the Lights Off
EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:04,319	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	That go all that
EDL	00:11:04,319	00:11:06,879	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	Diffuse light goes away and you can look up
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:08,671	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	How there is the Milky Way
EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:16,863	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	If people took a minute to gaze up at the newly visible in the night sky they didn't stargaze for long
EDL	00:11:17,631	00:11:18,911	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	Because pretty soon
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:19,935	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	Things started to
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:20,447	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	Field 10
EDL	00:11:21,471	00:11:22,751	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	The stores
EDL	00:11:22,751	00:11:23,519	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	Started to close
EDL	00:11:24,287	00:11:29,151	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	Like the local bodegas on each Corner we would hit a gate slamming Down Show
EDL	00:11:29,151	00:11:33,503	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	Like they knew what was happening they know what was going on at like week
EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:34,783	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	Be closing out now
EDL	00:11:35,807	00:11:37,855	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	New Yorkers reactions were very

EDL	00:11:41,695	00:11:43,999	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	Thelma stayed up in the bars and clubs
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:45,023	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	Send someone out to help
EDL	00:11:45,535	00:11:46,815	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	But many took it better
EDL	00:11:46,815	00:11:47,839	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	Age of a sudden chaos
EDL	00:11:48,351	00:11:51,423	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	The park was right around the corner from the Grand Concourse
EDL	00:11:51,423	00:11:52,959	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	And the Bronx which is like
EDL	00:11:52,959	00:11:58,335	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	Shopping area all the way up and down stores electronics stores toy stores
EDL	00:11:58,335	00:11:59,871	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	Furniture stores
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:01,919	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	Pet stores I mean everything
EDL	00:12:02,431	00:12:05,759	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	Here in corner of 135th Street and Broadway
EDL	00:12:06,271	00:12:12,415	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	I'm amazed to find a right before my eyes a Singer sewing machine stores
EDL	00:12:14,207	00:12:18,047	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	I saw people taking stuff that people had stolen you know what I mean like
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:23,167	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	He couldn't get in the store so they wait for people to come out the store with something they just grab it from them it was
EDL	00:12:23,167	00:12:23,679	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	Chaos
EDL	00:12:24,447	00:12:25,983	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	And it was exciting
EDL	00:12:27,519	00:12:28,799	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	But while it was going on
EDL	00:12:29,311	00:12:29,823	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	It was scary
EDL	00:12:30,335	00:12:33,663	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	In the Bronx liquor smashed a steel door open auto showroom and drove off

EDL	00:13:05,663	00:13:12,063	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	I even like I said I even got a new mixer I went right to the place where I bought my first set of these yet

EDL	00:13:25,631	00:13:26,911	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	After the Blackout all this
EDL	00:13:27,423	00:13:28,447	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	This new wealth
EDL	00:13:28,447	00:13:32,799	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	That I like to call it you know what I mean was founded by people and and they just

EDL	00:13:37,919	00:13:38,943	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	The blackout
EDL	00:13:38,943	00:13:39,967	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	And after
EDL	00:13:44,575	00:13:45,087	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	So
EDL	00:13:46,367	00:13:47,135	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	The question is
EDL	00:13:47,903	00:13:49,951	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	Did they go and seal turntables
EDL	00:13:49,951	00:13:52,511	| 99pi-0136-lightsout-1 |	The things like that so they think it actually becomes
