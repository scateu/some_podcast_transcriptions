EDL	00:03:08,160	00:03:08,928	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	As one
EDL	00:03:09,696	00:03:13,280	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	And the fact that a 48-minute game of basketball can still be won at

EDL	00:03:20,192	00:03:21,216	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	That my friends
EDL	00:03:21,728	00:03:22,752	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	Is what we call good.
EDL	00:03:23,520	00:03:24,800	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	It is good design
EDL	00:03:24,800	00:03:27,616	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	But it's not the way basketball was originally designed
EDL	00:03:28,384	00:03:29,152	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	In fact
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:30,176	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	The drama the game clock
EDL	00:03:30,688	00:03:33,248	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	Really became relevant after the Advent of another clock
EDL	00:03:34,016	00:03:35,296	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	The 24-second shot-clock
EDL	00:03:38,368	00:03:41,184	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	This is the story of how the smaller less visible clock
EDL	00:03:43,744	00:03:46,816	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	24-second violation created the reaction
EDL	00:03:47,840	00:03:53,984	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	Outside for pain lets it go
EDL	00:03:59,360	00:04:05,248	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	For the uninitiated a shot clock is the smaller clock that you sometimes see counting down in the bottom corner of the TV screen
EDL	00:04:05,760	00:04:06,784	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	In the NBA
EDL	00:04:06,784	00:04:10,112	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	When a team gets the ball they have 24 seconds to make a shot
EDL	00:04:10,112	00:04:11,136	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	With the violation
EDL	00:04:11,136	00:04:11,904	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	They lose the ball
EDL	00:04:12,416	00:04:13,184	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	But this
EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:14,464	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	Hasn't always been the case
EDL	00:04:14,464	00:04:17,024	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	In the early 1950s during pro basketball infancy
EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:18,303	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	There was no shot
EDL	00:04:19,071	00:04:21,631	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	Nothing force a player to actually shoot the ball
EDL	00:04:22,143	00:04:23,423	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	NFL team was winning
EDL	00:04:23,423	00:04:24,959	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	They wanted to keep their lead
EDL	00:04:24,959	00:04:26,751	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	They could literally hold onto the ball for
EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:27,263	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	10 minutes
EDL	00:04:27,775	00:04:32,895	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	That means you could turn off the game and listen to this entire pod gas and go back to the game in
EDL	00:04:32,895	00:04:33,663	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	Not miss it
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:36,479	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	I mean the game stock it was
EDL	00:04:36,479	00:04:37,759	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	Boring it was
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:38,271	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	Stupid
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:41,343	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	This is Dolph schayes
EDL	00:04:41,343	00:04:47,231	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	He's in the NBA Hall of Fame player and Coach whose career spanned two eras of basketball
EDL	00:04:47,231	00:04:49,023	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	Before the Inception of a shot clock
EDL	00:04:49,023	00:04:49,535	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	And after
EDL	00:04:50,047	00:04:54,655	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	He says this problem of players running time off the clock by just dribbling the ball around
EDL	00:04:54,655	00:04:57,215	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	Can really be summed up in a 1950 game
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:04:58,751	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	Between the Fort Wayne Pistons
EDL	00:04:58,751	00:05:00,031	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	In the Minneapolis Lakers
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:03,103	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	Good game near the end of it
EDL	00:05:03,103	00:05:03,615	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	Season
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:07,199	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	The Lakers they had like a dynasty at that time
EDL	00:05:07,199	00:05:09,503	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	And so the Pistons were ahead
EDL	00:05:10,015	00:05:10,783	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	Decided
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:11,295	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	2
EDL	00:05:12,063	00:05:13,343	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	Have a Slowdown
EDL	00:05:13,343	00:05:14,623	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	Meaning run time off the clock
EDL	00:05:15,135	00:05:16,415	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	So the game ended up
EDL	00:05:16,927	00:05:17,951	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	17
EDL	00:05:17,951	00:05:18,463	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	60
EDL	00:05:19,231	00:05:20,511	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	As the final score
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:21,791	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	The final score
EDL	00:05:22,303	00:05:24,607	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	What was something like that was in the teens
EDL	00:05:24,607	00:05:26,399	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	Actually was 19 to 18
EDL	00:05:26,399	00:05:26,911	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	Go Pista
EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:28,191	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	And of course
EDL	00:05:28,703	00:05:32,287	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	The crowd was booing I mean that the became a real Forest
EDL	00:05:32,287	00:05:37,919	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	It was such a joke that in 1953 NBC decided to forgo coverage of the NBA Championship
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:39,711	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	Take out the game would be too boring
EDL	00:05:40,479	00:05:42,015	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	Finally it became a
EDL	00:05:42,015	00:05:42,527	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	A crisis
EDL	00:05:43,039	00:05:44,063	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	Sol basketball
EDL	00:05:44,575	00:05:45,855	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	Lizard a rule change

EDL	00:05:48,927	00:05:50,463	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	Owner of the Syracuse Nationals
EDL	00:05:50,463	00:05:51,743	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	The team Dolph schayes play for
EDL	00:05:52,255	00:05:56,863	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	Crunch some numbers and he believed that some simple arithmetic could save
EDL	00:05:56,863	00:05:57,631	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	Basketball
EDL	00:05:58,143	00:05:59,423	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	And anybody song
EDL	00:05:59,423	00:06:00,447	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	It looks like I have this
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:01,215	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	Is formula
EDL	00:06:01,727	00:06:03,007	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	Why don't we try it out
EDL	00:06:09,919	00:06:16,063	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	Bizon figured that the best games of basketball the ideal games at Team scoring 80 or more points each
EDL	00:06:16,063	00:06:18,367	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	A store that buys on figured with high enough
EDL	00:06:18,367	00:06:19,647	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	To retain the audience's interest
EDL	00:06:20,159	00:06:23,743	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	Right so by Zone started tracking how many shots a team needed to make
EDL	00:06:23,743	00:06:25,791	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	Tuscora requisite 80-something points
EDL	00:06:26,559	00:06:28,095	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	Each team averages
EDL	00:06:29,119	00:06:30,143	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	60 shots
EDL	00:06:30,143	00:06:30,911	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	Hurricane
EDL	00:06:30,911	00:06:33,471	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	And there's two teams that means 120 shots
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:36,799	| 99pi-0077-gamechanger-1 |	And the game was still 48 minutes long
