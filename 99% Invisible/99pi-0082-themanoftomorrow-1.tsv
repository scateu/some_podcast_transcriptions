EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:34,016	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Despite the fact that there's some stuff in the in the movie that kind of
EDL	00:03:34,016	00:03:34,784	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Contradict
EDL	00:03:34,784	00:03:40,928	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	I still plugged for this music that I'm talking over is from the Superman movie soundtrack you know what it's called it's called

EDL	00:03:45,280	00:03:49,120	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	I'm teasing Glen Weldon because I feel like I know him because in addition to being

EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:55,776	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	He's also a panelist on NPR's pop culture Happy Hour podcast which is
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:03:57,824	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Great it comes out on Friday

EDL	00:03:59,360	00:04:00,128	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Friday
EDL	00:04:01,152	00:04:04,992	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	So I got in touch with Clan because I thought if I can appreciate Superman as a character
EDL	00:04:05,760	00:04:07,296	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Maybe I can appreciate him
EDL	00:04:07,296	00:04:08,320	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	As a design
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:11,648	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	A supremely successful design
EDL	00:04:11,648	00:04:15,488	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	And the first thing Glenn told me is that I need to dispense with this notion
EDL	00:04:15,488	00:04:16,512	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	That's Superman
EDL	00:04:16,512	00:04:18,047	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Should be relatable
EDL	00:04:18,047	00:04:19,839	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	The thing you have to understand about Superman
EDL	00:04:19,839	00:04:20,607	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Is that he was
EDL	00:04:21,119	00:04:22,143	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Never intended
EDL	00:04:22,143	00:04:24,447	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	The character that we identify with
EDL	00:04:24,447	00:04:25,727	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	He's not a hero like Batman
EDL	00:04:25,727	00:04:27,263	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Set a hero like Spiderman
EDL	00:04:27,263	00:04:27,775	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Man who have

EDL	00:04:31,615	00:04:32,383	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	He's not the hero
EDL	00:04:32,895	00:04:34,175	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	We identify with
EDL	00:04:34,175	00:04:35,199	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	He's the hero
EDL	00:04:35,199	00:04:35,967	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	We believe in
EDL	00:04:36,479	00:04:39,039	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Different he's an inspiration he supposed to be
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:39,551	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Better than us
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:41,087	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	That's right there in the name
EDL	00:04:41,087	00:04:42,623	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Movie called Superman for a reason
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:44,927	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	He exists to say
EDL	00:04:44,927	00:04:47,231	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	We can be better we can achieve these eyes
EDL	00:04:47,231	00:04:47,743	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Ideals
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:54,143	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	There are so many things that the creators of Superman Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:58,751	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Got right in the design is Superman from the very beginning the first thing they got right
EDL	00:04:59,263	00:05:00,287	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Was being first
EDL	00:05:00,799	00:05:02,079	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	1st and Market
EDL	00:05:02,079	00:05:05,407	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	It difficult to pinpoint which character qualifies as the first
EDL	00:05:05,407	00:05:06,175	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Superhero
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:09,759	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Yoga Master Hercules or the Phantom or the clock
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:12,063	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	It's worth looking into the clock
EDL	00:05:12,063	00:05:13,855	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	But Superman is certainly
EDL	00:05:13,855	00:05:15,391	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	The first of a type
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:19,487	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	The dominated popular culture from the moment he debuted in 1938
EDL	00:05:19,999	00:05:21,023	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Any idea
EDL	00:05:21,535	00:05:22,047	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Was simple
EDL	00:05:22,559	00:05:25,631	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Well he was created to be basically a circus strongman
EDL	00:05:25,631	00:05:26,399	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	What's that word
EDL	00:05:26,399	00:05:27,167	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Design the costumes
EDL	00:05:28,191	00:05:31,519	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	And that's what Siegel and Shuster intended he was just like us
EDL	00:05:32,031	00:05:32,543	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Only
EDL	00:05:33,055	00:05:34,335	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Bigger stronger
EDL	00:05:34,335	00:05:36,895	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Better so he could do everything that we could do
EDL	00:05:36,895	00:05:37,919	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	You only do it
EDL	00:05:37,919	00:05:39,455	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	More that's where the Superman ID
EDL	00:05:40,479	00:05:43,039	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	It's very simple that's why this character stuck around
EDL	00:05:43,551	00:05:45,087	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Cuz the iconography of simple
EDL	00:05:45,087	00:05:49,439	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Red blue and yellow even the color blind can see red blue and yellow that's that's important
EDL	00:05:49,439	00:05:52,255	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	You have to keep everything about this character as simple as possible
EDL	00:05:52,255	00:05:53,023	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Couldn't fly at the
EDL	00:05:53,791	00:05:55,071	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	He denied any of the other sensory
EDL	00:05:56,095	00:05:59,679	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	He was at the guy that Siegel and Shuster would drop into the middle of a scene
EDL	00:06:00,191	00:06:00,959	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	With a bunch of fog
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:03,775	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	And they would try to attack him and he would shrug them off
EDL	00:06:03,775	00:06:06,335	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	This was the engine of the story this is where the

EDL	00:06:29,631	00:06:30,143	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	And more powerful

EDL	00:06:45,247	00:06:47,807	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Was the ability to contort the muscles

EDL	00:06:48,575	00:06:52,415	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	To change his appearance and pass himself off as somebody else
EDL	00:06:53,183	00:06:54,719	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Now that doesn't Square
EDL	00:06:54,719	00:06:55,487	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	With the iconography

EDL	00:06:58,559	00:06:59,583	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	What we can do
EDL	00:06:59,583	00:07:00,351	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Only more
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:01,887	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	It went away
EDL	00:07:01,887	00:07:04,447	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Because it's not the power of a superhero That's The Power of a

EDL	00:07:11,103	00:07:14,943	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	And when you have powerful enough iconography you can make mistakes like that
EDL	00:07:15,455	00:07:17,247	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	And it doesn't have a lasting effect
EDL	00:07:17,247	00:07:18,271	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	The other powers
EDL	00:07:18,783	00:07:20,319	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Are things like

EDL	00:07:27,487	00:07:28,511	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Traits that we possess
EDL	00:07:28,511	00:07:29,279	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	That just

EDL	00:07:30,047	00:07:30,815	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	That's what the
EDL	00:07:30,815	00:07:31,327	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Is characters about
EDL	00:07:32,351	00:07:35,423	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Later on the course we get things like super hypnotism

EDL	00:07:46,175	00:07:47,967	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Because things just get bananas
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:48,479	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	And
EDL	00:07:48,991	00:07:50,783	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Superman has become so powerful
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:53,599	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	That the focus starts to shift away from

EDL	00:08:01,279	00:08:02,047	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Can you become to the
EDL	00:08:02,047	00:08:03,327	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Patriarch of this
EDL	00:08:03,327	00:08:04,095	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Extended family

EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:12,031	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	But beyond the comic book superfan none of that stuff filter too far out into popular culture and stuck around
EDL	00:08:12,031	00:08:14,591	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	The one power that they develop later
EDL	00:08:14,591	00:08:17,919	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	I got folded into the very core of the character
EDL	00:08:17,919	00:08:18,943	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Was flight
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:20,223	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Original you could just jump around
EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:23,295	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Turn on the page that's fine you see him in mid-air
EDL	00:08:23,295	00:08:25,343	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	But as soon as the Fleischer animated shorts
EDL	00:08:26,367	00:08:27,647	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	The very first couple
EDL	00:08:27,647	00:08:28,159	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	He jumps around
EDL	00:08:28,927	00:08:29,695	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	And it looks
EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:33,023	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	It just doesn't work
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:34,559	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	So very soon
EDL	00:08:35,071	00:08:38,655	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	In on the radio show you know the sound of him jumping around
EDL	00:08:38,655	00:08:40,191	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Suspended sound of
EDL	00:08:40,191	00:08:40,959	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Wind noise
EDL	00:08:40,959	00:08:41,983	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	It was clear
EDL	00:08:42,495	00:08:43,519	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Flying through the air
EDL	00:08:43,519	00:08:44,031	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Defying Gravity
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:46,591	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	And that's what happened in the Flasher
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:48,383	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Bridge of the comics a long time
EDL	00:08:48,895	00:08:49,919	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	To agree that y'all cake
EDL	00:08:50,687	00:08:51,455	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Because
EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:54,015	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Beat the thing you could do was be better than us
EDL	00:08:54,527	00:08:57,855	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	But this idea of somebody being able to hover in mid-air
EDL	00:08:57,855	00:08:59,391	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Was just too much of a break
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:01,439	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	From from the kind of
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:02,207	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Grounded
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:03,487	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Grounded stories

EDL	00:09:05,279	00:09:06,559	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	But once he did
EDL	00:09:06,559	00:09:09,119	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Once he did become a
EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:09,887	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	A capable of
EDL	00:09:09,887	00:09:10,911	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Flying Defying Gravity
EDL	00:09:15,007	00:09:16,543	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	You will believe a man can fly
EDL	00:09:17,055	00:09:18,591	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Because there's something Primal about
EDL	00:09:18,591	00:09:19,359	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	That there's something that
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:22,175	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Man is always wanted to do and so we got this guy
EDL	00:09:22,687	00:09:23,455	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Can bring it along.
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:24,735	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Unemployment
EDL	00:09:24,735	00:09:26,527	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	You can do it and that's what we looked
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:27,807	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Recognize
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:29,855	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Now today but it wasn't always the case
EDL	00:09:36,255	00:09:39,071	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	As you go to the history of Superman England weldon's book
EDL	00:09:39,071	00:09:42,655	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	You find a character that adapts in strange ways to reflect
EDL	00:09:43,167	00:09:45,471	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	The Zeitgeist and anxieties of the time
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:48,799	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	But certain qualities get written into Superman zna
EDL	00:09:48,799	00:09:51,615	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	The phone the real basis of what makes Superman
EDL	00:09:52,127	00:09:52,639	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Superman
EDL	00:09:53,151	00:09:55,455	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	And it has nothing to do with the way he looks
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:09:57,503	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Ultimately what I found over the course of the
EDL	00:09:58,015	00:10:00,831	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Writing a book is that a lot of the stuff comes and goes
EDL	00:10:00,831	00:10:03,647	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	What's the red shorts can come and go espectro goes away it's comes back
EDL	00:10:04,159	00:10:06,207	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Gets a different costume you gets this
EDL	00:10:06,207	00:10:07,231	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Weird electrical blue
EDL	00:10:07,743	00:10:09,023	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Costume in the 90s everything psycho
EDL	00:10:10,303	00:10:11,071	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	But
EDL	00:10:11,071	00:10:12,095	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	It's not what he looks
EDL	00:10:12,095	00:10:13,887	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Even though that is considered the iconography
EDL	00:10:14,399	00:10:15,167	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	He looks like
EDL	00:10:16,191	00:10:17,215	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	It is what he does
EDL	00:10:18,751	00:10:20,543	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Number one he puts the needs of others
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:21,311	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Overdose
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:22,847	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	And be he does
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:24,895	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	So those two Elam
EDL	00:10:24,895	00:10:26,687	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Either one of those two elements are missing
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:29,247	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Our brain instinctively reject
EDL	00:10:29,247	00:10:30,527	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Don't feel like a Superman
EDL	00:10:32,063	00:10:35,647	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Which makes telling compelling and nuanced Superman stories
EDL	00:10:35,647	00:10:36,671	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Pretty difficult
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:37,951	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	Butwell Nikes
EDL	00:10:37,951	00:10:43,327	| 99pi-0082-themanoftomorrow-1 |	And you want is not what Superman is about age where we don't trust altruism
