EDL	00:03:35,808	00:03:37,088	| 17-Concrete-Furniture |	And there was immediate

EDL	00:03:39,904	00:03:44,000	| 17-Concrete-Furniture |	About the furniture particularly from the people who were actually using it there were

EDL	00:04:18,047	00:04:18,815	| 17-Concrete-Furniture |	Desks
EDL	00:04:18,815	00:04:20,351	| 17-Concrete-Furniture |	Sixties and
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:21,631	| 17-Concrete-Furniture |	Hemlines were starting to
EDL	00:04:21,631	00:04:24,191	| 17-Concrete-Furniture |	Shorter than the shield of the secretaries knees
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:25,983	| 17-Concrete-Furniture |	And the new desktop no drawers

EDL	00:04:31,871	00:04:32,895	| 17-Concrete-Furniture |	And it didn't wobble
EDL	00:04:33,407	00:04:37,247	| 17-Concrete-Furniture |	When she said it's hard to imagine because some of the complaints make no sense to her
EDL	00:04:38,015	00:04:39,039	| 17-Concrete-Furniture |	And she has a theory
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:40,575	| 17-Concrete-Furniture |	Once
EDL	00:04:40,575	00:04:41,599	| 17-Concrete-Furniture |	Quite uncomfortable
EDL	00:04:41,599	00:04:42,623	| 17-Concrete-Furniture |	People to
EDL	00:04:42,623	00:04:44,415	| 17-Concrete-Furniture |	Internalized but this is really what the heck
EDL	00:04:44,415	00:04:44,927	| 17-Concrete-Furniture |	Chosen
EDL	00:04:45,439	00:04:51,839	| 17-Concrete-Furniture |	And perhaps there was a kind of anxiety about this new modernism in this new concrete that we were inserting into our traditional
EDL	00:04:51,839	00:04:52,351	| 17-Concrete-Furniture |	So
EDL	00:04:52,863	00:04:55,935	| 17-Concrete-Furniture |	Perhaps the furniture which was kind kind of mimetic
EDL	00:04:55,935	00:04:56,959	| 17-Concrete-Furniture |	Of the building
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:04:57,727	| 17-Concrete-Furniture |	Mimetic
EDL	00:05:02,079	00:05:08,479	| 17-Concrete-Furniture |	Relating to characteristic of or exhibiting mimicry okay so perhaps the furniture which was mimetic of the building
EDL	00:05:08,479	00:05:09,247	| 17-Concrete-Furniture |	Served as an outlet
EDL	00:05:09,759	00:05:10,527	| 17-Concrete-Furniture |	For that anxiety
EDL	00:05:11,039	00:05:13,087	| 17-Concrete-Furniture |	And perhaps this is why
EDL	00:05:13,599	00:05:14,623	| 17-Concrete-Furniture |	The controversy
EDL	00:05:14,623	00:05:15,391	| 17-Concrete-Furniture |	Didn't seem to me
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:15,903	| 17-Concrete-Furniture |	How much time
EDL	00:05:19,743	00:05:21,791	| 17-Concrete-Furniture |	Later of the complaint was that it was
EDL	00:05:21,791	00:05:25,375	| 17-Concrete-Furniture |	Difficult to move and so on so of course you know actually holding on to update itself
EDL	00:05:26,143	00:05:26,655	| 17-Concrete-Furniture |	Over the years
EDL	00:05:27,423	00:05:27,935	| 17-Concrete-Furniture |	The furniture
EDL	00:05:28,447	00:05:29,727	| 17-Concrete-Furniture |	Since it was not valued
EDL	00:05:31,007	00:05:35,103	| 17-Concrete-Furniture |	It was it was lost just simply three replacement it was it was actually thrown away
EDL	00:05:36,383	00:05:37,151	| 17-Concrete-Furniture |	But not all of it
EDL	00:05:37,663	00:05:38,687	| 17-Concrete-Furniture |	It's kind of like a
EDL	00:05:38,687	00:05:39,455	| 17-Concrete-Furniture |	A haunted house
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:41,503	| 17-Concrete-Furniture |	Looking for them
EDL	00:05:41,503	00:05:42,527	| 17-Concrete-Furniture |	They are here

EDL	00:05:46,879	00:05:47,903	| 17-Concrete-Furniture |	This is a very subtle one
EDL	00:05:48,671	00:05:50,463	| 17-Concrete-Furniture |	And put the word out to the rest of City Hall
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:53,791	| 17-Concrete-Furniture |	If you replacing your concrete Furniture he said send it up
