EDL	00:03:46,048	00:03:49,120	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	I'd heard that song The District sleeps alone tonight I mean
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:51,936	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	So many times since it came out in 2003
EDL	00:03:51,936	00:03:55,776	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	I knew that part and I knew that sound I have no idea
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:03:56,544	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	But that was a
EDL	00:03:56,544	00:03:57,568	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Human voice
EDL	00:03:57,568	00:03:59,872	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Making that sound until he took everything away
EDL	00:04:00,640	00:04:05,504	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	And that was the first episode that was for like the pilot before the show is called
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:08,064	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Song Exploder before when I was closer to figuring it out
EDL	00:04:08,064	00:04:11,136	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	And when Jimmy play that part I was like oh this is it this is
EDL	00:04:11,648	00:04:13,440	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	This is the reason why I want to do the show
EDL	00:04:14,464	00:04:16,256	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	And a radio show was born
EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:18,815	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Podcast whatever
EDL	00:04:19,327	00:04:21,119	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	As opposed to like a magic
EDL	00:04:21,119	00:04:23,679	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Trick where the intention is to
EDL	00:04:24,191	00:04:25,727	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Fool the audience

EDL	00:04:29,055	00:04:31,615	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	If you're learning all the secrets of a song
EDL	00:04:31,615	00:04:33,407	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	The idea is still too dress

EDL	00:04:42,111	00:04:42,879	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	How it is for me

EDL	00:05:46,367	00:05:49,183	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Composer I do the music for House of Cards
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:51,999	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	I had worked with David Fincher on a commercial
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:52,767	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Probably about 6
EDL	00:05:52,767	00:05:53,791	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Six or seven years ago
EDL	00:05:53,791	00:05:57,631	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	This was around the time I have been working on Rome
EDL	00:05:57,631	00:05:58,911	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	HBO
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:06:05,055	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	So I saw the trades you know this show is happening with David's name attached and I kept in touch and we never worked together since and I thought this might be
EDL	00:06:05,823	00:06:07,871	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Good match for us you know
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:14,271	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Bad watch little bit of the British show and that was something that's part of my pitch to David is that cuz I saw her use the wrong thing I said well I said
EDL	00:06:14,271	00:06:16,831	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Even around with a. Rama was very much about politics
EDL	00:06:17,855	00:06:21,183	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Operatic scale cast and storytelling
EDL	00:06:21,183	00:06:27,071	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	After I first met with David disorder talk about the project and got his initial thoughts about music makes or put our heads together
EDL	00:06:27,071	00:06:28,607	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Based on his sort of
EDL	00:06:28,607	00:06:33,215	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Way of thinking about music and how much music informs his choices he actually asked me to write some sketches
EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:35,263	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Before he started shooting at a course before
EDL	00:06:35,263	00:06:39,615	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	We had the meeting or before I wrote this sketches they shared with me I think about four or five Scripts
EDL	00:06:40,639	00:06:42,431	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Early drafts of what became season 1
EDL	00:06:43,199	00:06:48,575	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	So it was very much and Bose both sense of language in the way he sort of created this world that inspired
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:51,135	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Some of the early early work
EDL	00:06:51,135	00:06:53,951	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	The thing I like about the British show with his sword dark humor to it
EDL	00:06:54,719	00:07:00,863	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	And I said yeah did the music definitely have to find a way to sort of give the audience permission to sort of the laugh the sardonic
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:03,167	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Darkness once he
EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:09,567	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Call me and you know he gave me some of his thoughts on it which were interesting and some of the surprising to me she was one song you really like
EDL	00:07:09,567	00:07:10,591	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Like the Supertramp
EDL	00:07:10,591	00:07:11,359	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Crime of the century
EDL	00:07:18,527	00:07:19,551	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Great song
EDL	00:07:19,551	00:07:22,111	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	The section of that song towards the end where
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:24,415	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	It just becomes a sort of driving
EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:25,183	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Kiest
EDL	00:07:32,095	00:07:33,375	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Had to send some sort of
EDL	00:07:33,887	00:07:37,215	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Operatic for a classism in and
EDL	00:07:37,727	00:07:39,263	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Sort of Gravitas but
EDL	00:07:39,775	00:07:41,311	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	But it also had a very gritty
EDL	00:07:42,591	00:07:44,639	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Birthday almost Jazzy or bluesy
EDL	00:07:45,151	00:07:51,295	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Transportation of rock and roll
EDL	00:08:10,751	00:08:14,847	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	We knows we distracted that together and sort of thought about why that spoke to him
EDL	00:08:15,615	00:08:17,151	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	That's the show the show is
EDL	00:08:17,151	00:08:19,967	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	It's all about the underbelly of Washington
EDL	00:08:19,967	00:08:22,527	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	The dark Corners what you don't see and what really happens
EDL	00:08:23,295	00:08:25,855	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Supposed to sort of The West Wing you know heroic
EDL	00:08:25,855	00:08:27,135	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	More aspirational
EDL	00:08:27,647	00:08:33,279	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	The storm Hail to the Chief you know Washington than your typical sort of the film score gestures about the capital and Pollock
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:39,679	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	I wrote about for sketches
EDL	00:08:39,679	00:08:40,447	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	For David
EDL	00:08:40,447	00:08:44,543	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	One of the things we talked about in our first meeting you was he said was we kind of need a call to Arms
EDL	00:09:04,255	00:09:05,279	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	And when you listen to it
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:11,935	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	It has a lot of the elements that became the main title theme it's got that bass line it's got that sort of cloud dark Electro
EDL	00:09:12,447	00:09:13,983	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Proceed at like a
EDL	00:09:13,983	00:09:15,263	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Like a fog or something
EDL	00:09:15,775	00:09:20,895	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	And the tune is there although in this case it was displayed by the piano very simple orchestration
EDL	00:09:20,895	00:09:23,711	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	And then just in the second time it goes around the snare drum comes in
EDL	00:09:27,551	00:09:31,391	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Very simple but there's a tune in there there's a little sequences
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:32,927	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Of chords and Melody
EDL	00:09:33,695	00:09:38,047	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Part of the reason sketching is useful is because it's like the bones of something
EDL	00:09:38,047	00:09:40,607	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	If the structure of the skeleton is it has integrity
EDL	00:09:41,119	00:09:42,655	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	It should be able to stand without
EDL	00:09:43,679	00:09:45,727	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	An abundance of sort of instrumental
EDL	00:09:46,495	00:09:47,007	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Embellishment
EDL	00:09:47,519	00:09:51,103	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	And so by sketching and by doing Simple versus themes
EDL	00:09:51,103	00:09:53,919	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	You are able to sort of make sure that you have an idea
EDL	00:09:56,735	00:09:59,807	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	I always thought of this is sort of the Puppet Master theme the idea that like
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:01,599	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Kevin Spacey's character is
EDL	00:10:02,111	00:10:06,207	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Serta manipulator who's a virtuoso at pulling the strings on people and getting them
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:07,999	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Do what he wants them to do
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:11,839	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	But the reason I'm sharing this one in the context of the main title is
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:17,215	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	When we got around to finally doing the arrangement David said he would be cool if the main title felt like the sort of
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:19,007	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Stu
EDL	00:10:19,519	00:10:21,311	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	A lot of different elements from the score
EDL	00:10:22,335	00:10:25,663	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Which would then be deconstructed into its individual parts
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:30,271	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	So you'll hear this sort of descending chromatic line in the high piano
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:31,807	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	That became
EDL	00:10:32,575	00:10:34,367	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	One of the signature the main title sequence
EDL	00:10:34,879	00:10:40,767	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	As-built sketch grows the electric bass comes in
EDL	00:10:41,279	00:10:44,607	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	So it's the sort of
EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:51,263	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Homeless piano Motif by putting that bass underrated sort of gave it at attention of something that's pushing against it
EDL	00:10:53,311	00:10:58,943	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Dave and I talked about the piano little bit cuz I was in the Supertramp q&c instrument I like a Laden
EDL	00:10:59,455	00:11:05,855	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	It felt like a good instrument for Kevin's character because it can be very precise and very
EDL	00:11:05,855	00:11:07,647	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Through mechanical in a way
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:08,415	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Which I love about it
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:17,119	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Those are called arms things that was dropped into the main title sequence and it never left once it was in there that was what we're going to do
EDL	00:11:17,631	00:11:20,703	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	And I started you know if you passes through
EDL	00:11:20,703	00:11:22,495	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	I start to work on the arrangement
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:25,311	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	The story of the main title sequences visually
EDL	00:11:25,311	00:11:30,431	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Lyric on flowing but then I remember this came straight from sort of those original scripting of the main title
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:35,807	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Just basically the whole idea of the sun going down in Washington uni started in really broad daylight
EDL	00:11:35,807	00:11:36,831	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	And as a sequence
EDL	00:11:37,599	00:11:38,879	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Progressives you end up at night
EDL	00:11:39,391	00:11:45,791	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	So you so there was a way in which you went from something very open and and Airy and light just like the.
EDL	00:11:45,791	00:11:47,071	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Darkness falling
EDL	00:11:47,583	00:11:52,191	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	So that was that was a little bit of a visual storytelling thing I tried to play off of
EDL	00:11:52,703	00:11:55,775	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	The first thing we hear is the fog the fog of
EDL	00:11:55,775	00:12:02,175	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	The Cloud of Doom it's this is sort of low since Brown
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:08,575	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Shortly after that comes the Baseline
EDL	00:12:08,575	00:12:14,975	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Which I know David affectionately referred to as the riptide I was like that describes
EDL	00:12:14,975	00:12:21,375	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	It's kind of like the idea of something that pulls you under basically a combination of several things it's
EDL	00:12:21,375	00:12:27,775	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Analog e model 10 things that I designed some of my head for a long time and it's a couple different
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:34,175	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Playing the part
EDL	00:12:34,175	00:12:40,575	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Who is a Wonderful Young musician he's actually Now setting jazz bass
EDL	00:12:40,575	00:12:46,975	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Patient with getting big enough I actually recorded the bass an octave above it gives it enough Midway contents so that when all this other stuff
EDL	00:12:46,975	00:12:52,095	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Is happening at basic still driving one of the fun things about the composition for me with that
EDL	00:12:52,095	00:12:58,495	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	The harmony change is a lot over that bass line in fact bass is always playing in a minor but the harmony sometimes goes to a major
EDL	00:12:58,495	00:13:03,103	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Can I create this very strange dissonance
EDL	00:13:03,103	00:13:09,503	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Innocence of collision
EDL	00:13:09,503	00:13:15,903	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	I know because it's ingrained it's got its own logic to it so much like Frank will push through anything he doesn't care he's not going to
EDL	00:13:15,903	00:13:19,999	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Stop playing those notes
EDL	00:13:21,791	00:13:28,191	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	My original sort of call the arm sketch two times through which is kind of the original demo with almost long enough to cover the main title sequence
EDL	00:13:28,191	00:13:28,959	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	I need some more time
EDL	00:13:29,727	00:13:32,543	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	And I also had this direction from David to sort of work in another theme
EDL	00:13:33,311	00:13:37,407	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	So what I did was I kind of extended the intro I had a lot of percussion
EDL	00:13:37,407	00:13:42,015	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	But I also added that little Puppetmaster Rip but did you know that thing
EDL	00:13:42,015	00:13:43,551	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	It has a slightly different
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:47,647	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Cadence because this isn't for 4 in the master theme of those in three
EDL	00:13:50,719	00:13:55,071	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Prices are broken up a little bit but it's sort of it's still got that descending chromatic line
EDL	00:13:55,583	00:14:00,959	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Another layer that was sort of one of the last things I came up with but was really useful as the trumpet
EDL	00:14:03,519	00:14:04,799	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	McLaren
EDL	00:14:05,311	00:14:06,591	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Again it's the most
EDL	00:14:06,591	00:14:11,199	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Expected cliche thing you here in old show about Washington would be that sort of
EDL	00:14:11,711	00:14:13,759	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Military trumpet kind of thing
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:17,855	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Because we're seeing
EDL	00:14:18,367	00:14:20,671	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	The sort of iconic shots of Washington
EDL	00:14:20,671	00:14:27,071	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	It just felt right to have something that references that icon cuz obviously the rest of the composition is telling you that this isn't the heroic
EDL	00:14:27,071	00:14:33,471	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Version of the Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Monument and there's a way in which is sort of lonely too me too I like this riddle
EDL	00:14:33,471	00:14:33,983	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Loneliness
EDL	00:14:37,823	00:14:39,871	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	One of the things David visually did
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:41,407	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Was to pull out
EDL	00:14:41,919	00:14:44,223	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	A lot of the people in some of the time-lapse shots he has
EDL	00:14:44,735	00:14:48,063	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	It was much creepier seeing some of those shots with no people in them
EDL	00:14:48,575	00:14:52,415	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	They just made it feel like he was a ghost town or was that the sorcerer real
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:53,695	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Quality to it
EDL	00:14:57,279	00:14:59,327	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Basically in talking to David Fincher
EDL	00:14:59,327	00:15:00,863	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	About the second season
EDL	00:15:00,863	00:15:02,399	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	That was a sort of surprising to me but
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:05,215	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	If we were spotting the first couple episodes YouTube
EDL	00:15:05,215	00:15:08,031	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Guitar to give me notes on the main title that what he wanted different
EDL	00:15:08,031	00:15:12,127	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	You know David saw the second season is even more operatic and darker to which is
EDL	00:15:12,639	00:15:13,663	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Shocking meager
EDL	00:15:13,663	00:15:15,455	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	The first season was pretty dark
EDL	00:15:15,455	00:15:21,855	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	You seen who who Frank is and what he can do you know in these killed somebody in the first season I mean
EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:25,951	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Obviously very nothing's going to get in the way of what this guy wants to do
EDL	00:15:25,951	00:15:29,791	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	In general for main titles you know people get attached to push when they like something
EDL	00:15:29,791	00:15:32,607	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Does very careful you know to like steer the ship enough
EDL	00:15:33,119	00:15:38,495	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	But not so far as to make it feel like your old friend was not your friend anymore so
EDL	00:15:38,495	00:15:41,567	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	I added some voices some voice samples to a lot of it
EDL	00:15:46,687	00:15:49,247	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	I also added some some low strings
EDL	00:15:49,247	00:15:50,015	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	To the intro
EDL	00:15:58,463	00:16:04,607	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	The high string line that used to be in the Celli
EDL	00:16:10,239	00:16:12,287	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	2 Gannett slower everything sort of
EDL	00:16:12,287	00:16:13,823	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Skewing Downs doing darker
EDL	00:16:14,591	00:16:16,895	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Insulate It Feels Like This Cloud is sort of
EDL	00:16:16,895	00:16:18,175	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Come over the whole thing
EDL	00:16:18,175	00:16:20,223	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	The sort of lightness and
EDL	00:16:20,223	00:16:26,111	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Sense of that type of energy is dissipated you know he's no longer the Puppet Master return to the vice-president season 2 we know he's
EDL	00:16:26,623	00:16:31,231	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	He's very much in command so there's less of a game going on and much more of a
EDL	00:16:31,231	00:16:33,023	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	It's it's like you sent to the phone
EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:45,055	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	I think somebody networks or even the filmmakers are afraid of a real main title sequence a servant old-fashioned idea but the whole idea of a
EDL	00:16:45,055	00:16:48,639	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	A little mini film that settles you into a world and get you ready
EDL	00:16:48,639	00:16:51,199	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	To experience something is a wonderful sort of a
EDL	00:16:51,199	00:16:52,223	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	Storytelling device
EDL	00:16:52,991	00:16:56,575	| 99PI-0118-songexploder-1 |	You know it's sort of frames a moment for you and gets you settled into
