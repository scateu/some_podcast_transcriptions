EDL	00:01:55,712	00:01:57,760	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	To be more than just a huge Plantation
EDL	00:01:58,272	00:02:00,832	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	He wanted it to be a kind of industrial Utopia
EDL	00:02:01,344	00:02:03,648	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	He paid his Brazilian workers good wages

EDL	00:02:49,728	00:02:54,336	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	And well it's easy to look at him as some greedy imperialist
EDL	00:02:54,336	00:02:56,128	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Capitalist very easy
EDL	00:02:56,128	00:02:57,664	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	He actually felt that he could help
EDL	00:02:57,664	00:03:02,272	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	These people

EDL	00:03:09,952	00:03:12,000	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Then comes the afternoon round of golf
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:15,840	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Play it on the plantation links against a beautiful jungle backdrop
EDL	00:03:17,376	00:03:20,448	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Today the Ford plantation is a successful Enterprise
EDL	00:03:20,960	00:03:22,752	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	A tribute to skill in science

EDL	00:03:27,616	00:03:31,200	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	But the reality is that fordlandia was not a successful Enterprise
EDL	00:03:31,200	00:03:34,272	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Nor was it really a tribute to skill and science
EDL	00:03:34,784	00:03:36,064	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	It was a colossal
EDL	00:03:36,064	00:03:38,112	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Expensive and tragic mistake
EDL	00:03:38,624	00:03:41,440	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	It took Henry Ford nearly two decades
EDL	00:03:41,440	00:03:41,952	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	To give up on
EDL	00:03:42,720	00:03:49,120	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	It's a parable of arrogance but the arrogance isn't that Ford thought he couldn't aim and conquer the Amazon
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:49,888	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Greg Grandin
EDL	00:03:49,888	00:03:54,752	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	He had his sights on something actually much bigger he thought he could tame and Conquer capitalist
EDL	00:03:55,264	00:03:56,288	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Industrial capitalism
EDL	00:03:57,312	00:04:01,408	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Ford wanted to export his brand of industrial paternalism to the Amazon
EDL	00:04:01,920	00:04:02,688	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Hey workers well
EDL	00:04:03,200	00:04:04,480	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	And provide services
EDL	00:04:04,480	00:04:07,808	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	So that they stayed healthy productive and most importantly
EDL	00:04:08,320	00:04:09,344	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Loyal to the company
EDL	00:04:09,856	00:04:11,136	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	And and that didn't have
EDL	00:04:14,720	00:04:16,000	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	In the early 1900s
EDL	00:04:16,000	00:04:19,071	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	It's a couple of decades before Ford set out to build fordlandia
EDL	00:04:19,583	00:04:21,887	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	A massive shift was underway in the rubber industry
EDL	00:04:22,655	00:04:25,727	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	4 years Brazil have been the world's main supplier
EDL	00:04:25,727	00:04:29,567	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Rubber pretty much all of the Rebel with the one at some bicycles at 1

EDL	00:04:31,359	00:04:32,639	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Gaskets
EDL	00:04:32,639	00:04:33,151	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	The valves
EDL	00:04:33,919	00:04:34,943	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Winter tires
EDL	00:04:34,943	00:04:36,735	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	All came from Brazil
EDL	00:04:36,735	00:04:40,063	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	And the way rubber was cultivated was very labour-intensive
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:43,135	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Rubber tappers would go out into the dense jungle
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:44,415	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	And find rubber trees
EDL	00:04:44,415	00:04:47,999	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	They would slash the trees and then they would extract the latex
EDL	00:04:47,999	00:04:49,279	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	The floor on the side of the trees
EDL	00:04:50,047	00:04:51,327	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	They would boil
EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:53,375	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Innocence this Milky
EDL	00:04:53,375	00:04:55,167	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Fluid and turn it into
EDL	00:04:55,935	00:04:57,471	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	A large balls of rubber
EDL	00:04:57,471	00:04:58,239	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Which they would then
EDL	00:04:58,751	00:05:00,031	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	You try to sell
EDL	00:05:00,031	00:05:06,431	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Passing it on this kind of very decentralised chained up until it wound up in warehouses

EDL	00:05:09,247	00:05:13,855	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Rubber stoppers would work part of the Year tapping Rubber and they were part of the year
EDL	00:05:13,855	00:05:14,623	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Growing
EDL	00:05:14,623	00:05:17,183	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Other sustenance crops in order to survive
EDL	00:05:17,183	00:05:18,719	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	This is the economy
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:21,279	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Lasted four years in in Brazil
EDL	00:05:22,559	00:05:26,399	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	But this economy could be brutal for workers at the bottom of the production chain
EDL	00:05:26,911	00:05:30,239	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	As rubber plantations grew they struggled to find enough workers
EDL	00:05:30,239	00:05:35,871	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Some robber barons started enslaving indigenous people in forcing them to tap trees
EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:39,455	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Even the workers that were being paid didn't make very much
EDL	00:05:39,455	00:05:41,247	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	The so-called latex Laura.
EDL	00:05:41,247	00:05:43,295	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Set the top ruin normally wealthy
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:47,391	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Living in palatial homes in gilded cities in the jungle
EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:54,047	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	This system all started to change because of a British Explorer named Henry Wickham
EDL	00:05:54,047	00:05:56,863	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	He come to Brazil to seek his fortune in the Amazon
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:05:59,679	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	And then in 1876
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:00,447	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Henry Wickham
EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:02,751	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Managed to steal
EDL	00:06:02,751	00:06:04,287	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Thousands of rubber plant
EDL	00:06:05,823	00:06:09,663	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	And he sent them back to England and eventually they want to the English colonies
EDL	00:06:10,175	00:06:12,991	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	It was technically no law at the time preventing the X
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:14,015	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Sport of the seeds
EDL	00:06:14,015	00:06:17,087	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Wickham had applied for an export license under false
EDL	00:06:17,087	00:06:17,599	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Pretenses
EDL	00:06:18,111	00:06:20,159	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	He smuggled be tens of thousands of
EDL	00:06:20,159	00:06:23,231	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	The seeds back to England in the hold of a steamship
EDL	00:06:23,231	00:06:26,303	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Each seed was about three quarters of an inch long
EDL	00:06:26,303	00:06:27,839	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Is entire seed cash
EDL	00:06:27,839	00:06:29,631	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Weight over 1000 lbs
EDL	00:06:30,143	00:06:32,191	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	He may not have known it at the time
EDL	00:06:32,191	00:06:34,239	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	But his act of Bio piracy
EDL	00:06:34,751	00:06:36,799	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Would totally transform the rubber tray
EDL	00:06:39,103	00:06:45,503	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	From England Wickham's rubber seeds travel to various European colonies like Malaysia Sri Lanka and Indonesia
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:47,295	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	The trees thrive

EDL	00:06:53,695	00:07:00,095	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Plantations with rubber trees planted in dense rows and these new Colonial plantations ended up
EDL	00:07:00,095	00:07:02,911	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Possibly outperforming the traditional Brazilian rubber Tapper
EDL	00:07:04,191	00:07:10,591	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Say run 1910 Brazil head by that we're pretty much lost its control over the
EDL	00:07:10,591	00:07:11,103	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Rubber industry
EDL	00:07:11,615	00:07:16,479	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Meanwhile the new European robber barons were talking about setting up a kind of cartel
EDL	00:07:16,479	00:07:19,039	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Danelle dominated the global rubber trade

EDL	00:07:59,231	00:08:02,559	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	What is problem is that rubber doesn't grow in the US
EDL	00:08:02,559	00:08:06,399	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	So Not only was Henry Ford vulnerable bit but Brazil was vulnerable
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:11,263	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	That's why the nation of Brazil basically gave him this huge

EDL	00:08:47,615	00:08:51,455	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	They brought in American managers and hired a Brazilian Workforce
EDL	00:08:51,455	00:08:54,271	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Then they started clearing the land to build
EDL	00:08:54,271	00:08:55,295	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Portlandia
EDL	00:08:55,295	00:08:59,135	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	The jungle courses is just a very challenging

EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:01,183	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	And right away
EDL	00:09:01,183	00:09:04,511	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Things started to go wrong you have four
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:06,815	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Example the workers were trying to clear the land
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:09,631	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Baby working out their bare chested
EDL	00:09:09,631	00:09:12,191	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	And would be suddenly covered with biting ants
EDL	00:09:12,959	00:09:19,359	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Hornets and scorpions in even worse they would reach in and suddenly a pit viper

EDL	00:09:21,407	00:09:26,783	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	So they were they were dealing with a life-and-death struggle year
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:32,159	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Eventually the workers managed to clear the land and build a town in the middle of the rainforest
EDL	00:09:32,671	00:09:35,487	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Bored at a very particular vision for this town
EDL	00:09:35,999	00:09:40,863	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	He wanted it to feel like these small Midwestern Town T associated with his childhood
EDL	00:09:40,863	00:09:42,143	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	He grew up on a farm
EDL	00:09:42,655	00:09:44,447	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	He believed that there was a
EDL	00:09:44,959	00:09:47,007	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	A kind of healthy connection between
EDL	00:09:47,775	00:09:50,591	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Between Agriculture and Industry
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:54,175	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Is this crazy as that seems he he saw them kind of intermingling
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:09:55,711	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	And
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:10:00,575	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	He really brought these Boyhood memories of the farm into his adult life
EDL	00:10:01,087	00:10:02,367	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Justice nostalgic

EDL	00:10:03,903	00:10:05,439	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	For a bygone era
EDL	00:10:05,951	00:10:09,535	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	This Nostalgia was for a very narrow slice of America
EDL	00:10:09,535	00:10:11,583	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Small town mostly white in there
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:14,399	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	That was Ford's model for fordlandia
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:19,007	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Even though he was importing it into a very different cultural environment
EDL	00:10:19,007	00:10:21,567	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	When you go to fordlandia there's an uncanniness to

EDL	00:10:22,591	00:10:23,615	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	It doesn't seem exotic

EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:39,231	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	They started recruiting even more Brazilian workers from the surrounding areas
EDL	00:10:39,231	00:10:41,535	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	A lot of them were excited to work for 4
EDL	00:10:42,047	00:10:44,863	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Ford was promising something they'd never really had

EDL	00:11:04,063	00:11:05,599	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Totally exploit them in other words
EDL	00:11:06,111	00:11:08,159	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	He could dramatically reduce turnover
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:10,463	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	And that's what he wanted to do in Brazil
EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:13,279	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	In a sense they're trying to apply lessons from the factory

EDL	00:13:10,527	00:13:12,575	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	And what people should enjoy
EDL	00:13:12,575	00:13:13,599	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	For example
EDL	00:13:13,599	00:13:14,879	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	He loved square dancing
EDL	00:13:14,879	00:13:17,183	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	He met his wife Clara at a square dance
EDL	00:13:17,183	00:13:18,975	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	And so he figured well

EDL	00:13:26,399	00:13:31,263	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Surprised you know it wasn't all that popular down there who would have thought
EDL	00:13:31,263	00:13:32,799	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Ford was also a teetotaler
EDL	00:13:33,311	00:13:35,615	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	So even though drinking was legal in Brazil
EDL	00:13:35,615	00:13:37,663	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Gibbeted alcohol in Portlandia
EDL	00:13:38,175	00:13:40,735	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Again you have Henry Ford trying to

EDL	00:13:43,807	00:13:46,879	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Although a lot of Americans of the time didn't think the prohibition work
EDL	00:13:47,647	00:13:48,671	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	But he was
EDL	00:13:49,183	00:13:51,487	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	By golly he was going to make it work in Brazil

EDL	00:14:18,623	00:14:20,415	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	And then there was the food

EDL	00:14:36,031	00:14:40,127	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Workers resented having to eat the exact kind of food that Henry Ford told them to
EDL	00:14:40,895	00:14:42,175	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	But the other problem was that
EDL	00:14:42,175	00:14:44,991	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	It initially serve lunch the workers restaurant-style

EDL	00:14:58,815	00:15:00,351	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Absolutely hated that approach
EDL	00:15:01,119	00:15:02,655	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	They felt like they were
EDL	00:15:02,655	00:15:03,935	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Being treated like cogs in a
EDL	00:15:04,703	00:15:07,263	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	In a wheel and suddenly went on a rampage

EDL	00:15:27,999	00:15:31,327	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	And and then rather than give up Ford recommitted

EDL	00:15:37,983	00:15:42,591	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	At this point forward was only a few years into this Portlandia experiment
EDL	00:15:42,591	00:15:44,127	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	And it wasn't paying off
EDL	00:15:44,127	00:15:45,663	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	The company dust cap
EDL	00:15:45,663	00:15:47,455	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Money it's the Rubber Plantation

EDL	00:16:06,399	00:16:07,935	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Who was going to say no
EDL	00:16:07,935	00:16:08,959	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Henry Ford
EDL	00:16:08,959	00:16:13,311	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	No one really had the gumption the determination that this
EDL	00:16:13,311	00:16:16,127	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Bravery perhaps the challenge for dummies big decision
EDL	00:16:16,127	00:16:16,639	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Because
EDL	00:16:17,151	00:16:22,527	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Yeah he was a tough fellow more and more as the years went by he got set in his ways and that was it his word was
EDL	00:16:23,039	00:16:23,807	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	What is going to happen
EDL	00:16:26,111	00:16:28,927	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	But fordlandia was up against insurmountable challenges
EDL	00:16:29,695	00:16:30,463	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	More than the time
EDL	00:16:30,975	00:16:31,999	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	More than the square dance
EDL	00:16:32,511	00:16:34,303	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	More than the way meals were served
EDL	00:16:34,815	00:16:36,095	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	The real problem
EDL	00:16:36,095	00:16:36,863	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Was Boggs
EDL	00:16:37,375	00:16:38,143	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	The insect
EDL	00:16:38,143	00:16:39,167	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Fungi
EDL	00:16:39,167	00:16:41,983	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	That were the rubber trees natural predators in the Amazon
EDL	00:16:42,495	00:16:48,895	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Ford hadn't really bother to learn anything about botany or Agronomy before embarking on his fordlandia
EDL	00:16:48,895	00:16:49,407	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	The experiment
EDL	00:16:49,919	00:16:51,455	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	He didn't trust the expert
EDL	00:16:51,967	00:16:52,991	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	I could have warned them
EDL	00:16:52,991	00:16:53,759	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	What he was getting into
EDL	00:16:54,527	00:16:56,063	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	In fact he didn't trust
EDL	00:16:56,063	00:16:57,087	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Experts at all
EDL	00:16:57,087	00:16:59,391	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Kingdom and the idea of
EDL	00:16:59,391	00:17:01,439	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Exports of slowing
EDL	00:17:01,439	00:17:03,743	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	The progress of of an idea
EDL	00:17:03,743	00:17:06,815	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	And his experience they could go to the factory floor
EDL	00:17:07,583	00:17:11,679	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	And maybe they had a problem with a widget or a wagon and they would have trial and error
EDL	00:17:12,191	00:17:13,471	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	And they would just figure it out
EDL	00:17:14,239	00:17:16,031	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Need some
EDL	00:17:16,031	00:17:17,055	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Buddy with the title
EDL	00:17:17,567	00:17:19,871	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Or an education and some specialty
EDL	00:17:19,871	00:17:21,151	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Need to tell them what to do
EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:23,199	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	That was part of the problem with this that I thing
EDL	00:17:23,199	00:17:26,271	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Ford bought into his own kind of invincibility is own price
EDL	00:17:26,271	00:17:27,295	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	If you will think Unity
EDL	00:17:27,295	00:17:28,831	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	You could just go down there and take
EDL	00:17:28,831	00:17:29,855	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	This kind of rock
EDL	00:17:29,855	00:17:30,879	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Jungle in
EDL	00:17:30,879	00:17:33,695	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Turn it into an industrial Enterprise Al working industrial Enterprise
EDL	00:17:34,463	00:17:35,999	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	And I think his
EDL	00:17:36,511	00:17:38,303	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	His eyes were bigger than his stomach soda
EDL	00:17:38,815	00:17:40,095	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Because Ambitions got ahead of his
EDL	00:17:40,095	00:17:40,607	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Disabilities
EDL	00:17:41,119	00:17:43,167	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Because he wasn't willing to listen to
EDL	00:17:43,167	00:17:45,471	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	The experts wasn't willing to bring them on board
EDL	00:17:45,471	00:17:46,751	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	He was in
EDL	00:17:46,751	00:17:48,543	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Far far to DP over his head
EDL	00:17:49,311	00:17:54,943	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	The problem was that rubber trees have never grown in the Amazon in the way that the Ford company with trying to grow them
EDL	00:17:54,943	00:17:58,271	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Intense plantations with trees planted in Tyro
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:18:03,135	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	This growing style might have worked in the Southeast Asian plantations run by European
EDL	00:18:03,135	00:18:05,951	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	That's because the bugs there hadn't evolved to eat rubber trees
EDL	00:18:06,463	00:18:09,791	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	In Brazil this density ended up creating an environment
EDL	00:18:09,791	00:18:12,351	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Were Native bugs that fed on rubber trees
EDL	00:18:12,351	00:18:13,119	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Thrive
EDL	00:18:13,119	00:18:16,447	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	What Ford was basically doing with building a giant incubator
EDL	00:18:16,447	00:18:17,727	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	In which
EDL	00:18:18,239	00:18:20,799	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Which year did the bugs and the
EDL	00:18:20,799	00:18:23,615	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Blade and the fungi that feed off of rubber
EDL	00:18:24,127	00:18:27,967	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Was able to grow exponentially because the trees will close together
EDL	00:18:28,735	00:18:30,527	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	For example there were these caterpillar
EDL	00:18:30,527	00:18:32,319	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	We're very fond of rubber tree
EDL	00:18:32,831	00:18:34,623	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	One of the predators of a caterpillar
EDL	00:18:34,623	00:18:37,695	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Spray tan
EDL	00:18:38,719	00:18:39,743	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Chipotle near me
EDL	00:18:40,255	00:18:42,047	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	The managers would send out
EDL	00:18:42,047	00:18:43,839	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Battalions of workers to
EDL	00:18:43,839	00:18:44,863	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Pek the caterpillar
EDL	00:18:45,631	00:18:51,775	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Play even gathered all the caterpillars together and end in in buckets and then pulled them together and then had a huge bonfire
EDL	00:18:52,287	00:18:54,079	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	But within a few years guess what happen
EDL	00:18:54,591	00:18:56,639	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	It wouldn't the caterpillars Warren actually
EDL	00:18:57,663	00:19:02,015	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Eating the leaves from the bottom they will leave from the top
EDL	00:19:02,015	00:19:04,575	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	You couldn't actually see them and so therefore you couldn't pick them
EDL	00:19:05,343	00:19:07,903	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Again and again they replanted the trees
EDL	00:19:07,903	00:19:09,439	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	I need to have them killed off bypass
EDL	00:19:10,207	00:19:16,095	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	This went on for years and then decades
EDL	00:19:16,863	00:19:21,471	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	It wasn't until 1945 the Ford finally decided to shut down fordlandia
EDL	00:19:21,983	00:19:25,567	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	That point Henry Ford had turn the company over to his grandson
EDL	00:19:25,567	00:19:26,847	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	In fordlandia with a
EDL	00:19:27,359	00:19:28,895	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	And within a few months
EDL	00:19:28,895	00:19:31,455	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	He sold it back to the Brazilian government
EDL	00:19:31,967	00:19:35,807	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	For like $250,000 and then it was over
EDL	00:19:38,111	00:19:40,671	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Henry Ford died a couple years later
EDL	00:19:41,183	00:19:43,231	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	And after all the money and time invested
EDL	00:19:43,743	00:19:44,511	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Weirdly
EDL	00:19:44,511	00:19:46,303	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	He never even visited for Atlanta
EDL	00:19:47,071	00:19:48,607	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	He orchestrated all of it
EDL	00:19:48,607	00:19:50,143	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Right down to the square dances
EDL	00:19:50,143	00:19:52,703	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	I miss home thousands of miles away
EDL	00:19:52,703	00:19:53,471	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	In Michigan
EDL	00:19:53,471	00:19:56,287	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	You're part of it maybe he was just afraid of going and
EDL	00:19:56,287	00:19:57,055	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Qingdao
EDL	00:19:57,055	00:19:58,591	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Tell you there in person so dusty
EDL	00:19:58,591	00:20:00,639	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	I was reading the reports the memos
EDL	00:20:01,151	00:20:04,991	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Knew what was happening or what wasn't having the fordlandia surprised you didn't want to
EDL	00:20:04,991	00:20:06,015	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Reckon with it personally
EDL	00:20:15,487	00:20:17,535	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Fordlandia is still a town today
EDL	00:20:17,535	00:20:20,351	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	And although a lot of the old buildings are now falling down
EDL	00:20:20,351	00:20:22,143	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	People continue to live there
EDL	00:20:22,655	00:20:25,215	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Is Dwayne Greg Grandin has visited twice
EDL	00:20:25,215	00:20:27,519	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	That's two times more than Henry Ford ever did
EDL	00:20:27,519	00:20:28,543	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	For those of you keeping count
EDL	00:20:29,055	00:20:33,151	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Brandon made the day and a half long trip up the top of those River by boat
EDL	00:20:33,151	00:20:37,759	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	You just turn you just come around the bank and then all of a sudden you see this enormous
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:40,319	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Enormous saltwater tank
EDL	00:20:41,087	00:20:43,135	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Back in the day
EDL	00:20:43,135	00:20:44,415	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	The word Ford was

EDL	00:26:22,336	00:26:23,104	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Is because
EDL	00:26:23,104	00:26:24,640	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	We have this unique
EDL	00:26:24,640	00:26:25,408	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Window
EDL	00:26:25,408	00:26:26,176	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	What he's thinking
EDL	00:26:26,688	00:26:27,200	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Because

EDL	00:26:37,184	00:26:41,280	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Every piece of news or policy which may only hold for the next
EDL	00:26:41,280	00:26:44,096	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	5 minutes but nevertheless we get a snapshot into what he's thinking
EDL	00:26:44,608	00:26:48,960	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	And that's been important because this is been a norm breaking presidency
EDL	00:26:48,960	00:26:52,800	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	It's almost a tired phrase now to say this is abnormal I mean
EDL	00:26:53,312	00:26:56,640	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	The abnormal has become normal and in some ways that's been the Genesis
EDL	00:26:57,920	00:27:00,480	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	And Trump has definitely changed the way that Elizabeth teaches cost
EDL	00:27:01,504	00:27:02,528	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	At UC Davis
EDL	00:27:02,528	00:27:06,112	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	When I Survey my class and asked like what would you like to talk about

EDL	00:27:08,160	00:27:10,976	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Donald Trump related they all are no basically
EDL	00:27:10,976	00:27:12,512	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Whatever the topic is
EDL	00:27:12,512	00:27:13,280	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Can he do that
EDL	00:27:13,792	00:27:17,376	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Is he allowed to do that and I think that's been what's really remarkable
EDL	00:27:17,376	00:27:19,680	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	So yeah it's very different to me
EDL	00:27:20,192	00:27:20,704	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Student ID
EDL	00:27:21,216	00:27:21,728	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	The teacher of
EDL	00:27:23,264	00:27:27,360	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	It's very different just to be an American today to think about what what's normal in terms of
EDL	00:27:27,360	00:27:29,664	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Expecting certain kind of behavior out of an American Prayer
EDL	00:27:30,176	00:27:30,944	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	That's totally true
EDL	00:27:31,712	00:27:32,480	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	We're using in Cypress
EDL	00:27:34,016	00:27:34,528	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	About the concert
EDL	00:27:35,296	00:27:35,808	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Anyways
EDL	00:27:36,576	00:27:38,880	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	And that seems to be going on Beyond
EDL	00:27:41,440	00:27:43,232	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Is that a silver lining that you
EDL	00:27:43,232	00:27:44,000	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	You see in all this
EDL	00:27:44,000	00:27:45,024	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	List of people are actually talking about the
EDL	00:27:47,840	00:27:48,352	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Take pleasure in the
EDL	00:27:49,376	00:27:54,240	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Yes but has to be the one silver lining the people actually want to learn about how the government works
EDL	00:27:54,240	00:27:55,008	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	And
EDL	00:27:55,008	00:28:00,128	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	The people are slowly discovering that despite the fact that we have a constitution and we have
EDL	00:28:00,128	00:28:02,688	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	So many Supreme Court decisions on a variety of topics
EDL	00:28:03,200	00:28:08,832	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	The real thing that was always binding us the cookies and the glue for society was norms
EDL	00:28:11,648	00:28:13,952	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	That the Norms actually make
EDL	00:28:13,952	00:28:16,512	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Our shared experience of what government should be possible
EDL	00:28:17,024	00:28:19,072	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	And when those start to unravel
EDL	00:28:19,072	00:28:20,352	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	People are understandably nervous
EDL	00:28:20,864	00:28:22,144	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	So that's been a
EDL	00:28:22,144	00:28:23,424	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Big learning experience for all of us
EDL	00:28:23,936	00:28:25,472	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Do you have a greater sense
EDL	00:28:25,472	00:28:27,264	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	That we are dependent on Norms
EDL	00:28:27,264	00:28:28,032	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Then you did
EDL	00:28:29,056	00:28:29,568	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	18 months
EDL	00:28:30,336	00:28:33,152	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	You're absolutely mean it's it's showing us that
EDL	00:28:33,152	00:28:36,992	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	You know what we need is as kind of collective faith that are institutions
EDL	00:28:36,992	00:28:40,832	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Our Collective faith in what the President should and should not be doing
EDL	00:28:40,832	00:28:46,464	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	And when that starts to come apart I think that that raises new kinds of questions for how we got to think about all of these
EDL	00:28:46,976	00:28:48,000	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Offices
EDL	00:28:48,000	00:28:50,816	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Westland institutions Congress the president how log works
EDL	00:28:51,328	00:28:54,912	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	But we should think about chords and we've never really had this kind of
EDL	00:28:54,912	00:28:57,216	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Ultimate question that you want what is this song mean
EDL	00:28:57,984	00:28:59,008	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	In the very very beginning
EDL	00:28:59,520	00:29:00,032	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	When we started
EDL	00:29:01,056	00:29:01,568	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	We talk.
EDL	00:29:02,848	00:29:04,128	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Only 5000 words
EDL	00:29:04,640	00:29:05,408	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	What's the scaffolding that
EDL	00:29:05,920	00:29:06,432	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Be interpreted in
EDL	00:29:06,944	00:29:07,712	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	The ways
EDL	00:29:07,712	00:29:08,992	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	You kind of wish now.
EDL	00:29:08,992	00:29:09,760	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	But they were
EDL	00:29:09,760	00:29:12,832	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	More words of the Constitution that it was a little more exact
EDL	00:29:13,600	00:29:20,000	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	No I don't think so because I think there's a mean one of the reasons why so far anyway our system
EDL	00:29:20,000	00:29:22,560	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Has been remarkably resilient in my last day
EDL	00:29:22,560	00:29:24,864	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Is because of the flexibility and the doctor
EDL	00:29:25,376	00:29:26,144	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	You know if
EDL	00:29:26,144	00:29:27,680	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	They we had spend specific
EDL	00:29:29,216	00:29:31,008	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	You can't use muskets
EDL	00:29:31,008	00:29:33,056	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	And every person should pay
EDL	00:29:33,056	00:29:33,568	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	You know
EDL	00:29:34,592	00:29:39,968	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	$1 in taxes would be a very different document and probably we would have abandoned it a long time ago
EDL	00:29:40,480	00:29:44,064	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	But it's the open-endedness of it which kind of shows the genius of
EDL	00:29:44,576	00:29:45,344	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Original framers
EDL	00:29:46,112	00:29:46,880	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	The show that
EDL	00:29:46,880	00:29:48,928	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	They were writing a document that was supposed to last
EDL	00:29:48,928	00:29:49,952	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Astro long time
EDL	00:29:49,952	00:29:53,280	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	The problem with that is that we end up arguing a lot about what that means
EDL	00:29:53,792	00:29:55,072	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	And so that's
EDL	00:29:56,096	00:29:58,912	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Thrilling parts of constitutional law or had been
EDL	00:29:58,912	00:30:00,448	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	And now sometimes it's becoming a scary
EDL	00:30:13,248	00:30:14,784	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	So if you want to take the chaos of
EDL	00:30:15,296	00:30:16,832	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Unhinged tweets and
EDL	00:30:16,832	00:30:18,112	| 298_Fordlandia_pt01 |	Endless political news
