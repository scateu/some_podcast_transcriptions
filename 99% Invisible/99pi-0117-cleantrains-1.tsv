EDL	00:06:44,479	00:06:44,991	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	She said
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:52,415	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	You better take that or you'll see everybody will think you're a coward

EDL	00:07:16,479	00:07:18,271	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	When we see graffiti
EDL	00:07:18,271	00:07:20,063	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	We think about it in terms of Aesthetics
EDL	00:07:20,063	00:07:24,159	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	Like it or hate it but we're reacting to it visually
EDL	00:07:24,671	00:07:25,951	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	David Dunn
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:32,095	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	Looks right past all of those wildstyle letters and sees a transit system not doing its job

EDL	00:07:35,679	00:07:36,447	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	Because

EDL	00:07:39,775	00:07:40,799	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	Is part of maintenance
EDL	00:07:42,079	00:07:46,687	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	For decades people in charge treated subway graffiti like it was a sanitation problem
EDL	00:07:46,687	00:07:48,991	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	Gun says that all wrong
EDL	00:07:48,991	00:07:51,295	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	It wasn't just a sanitation problem
EDL	00:07:51,295	00:07:52,831	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	It was something else entirely
EDL	00:07:53,343	00:07:58,207	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	Gun says the root of the problem was MTA deferred maintenance program
EDL	00:07:58,719	00:08:01,023	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	New York City was broke
EDL	00:08:01,535	00:08:02,559	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	And the City
EDL	00:08:02,559	00:08:06,143	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	A big chunk of the transit authority operating budget
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:11,263	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	To reduce its budget
EDL	00:08:11,263	00:08:13,567	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	The worst decision
EDL	00:08:14,079	00:08:16,895	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	They cut back on the things that kept the Subways running
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:18,175	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	Routine inspections

EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:23,807	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	And what you expect to happen happened
EDL	00:08:24,319	00:08:26,111	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	The subway deteriorated
EDL	00:08:26,623	00:08:27,903	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	Breakdowns tripled
EDL	00:08:28,415	00:08:30,975	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	Nearly every two weeks
EDL	00:08:31,487	00:08:32,255	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	And get this

EDL	00:13:00,287	00:13:02,079	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	There's a real way of thinking
EDL	00:13:02,079	00:13:04,895	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	Kane graffiti which I don't think it's entirely wrong with that
EDL	00:13:05,407	00:13:07,967	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	You're not a real writer until you got here or

EDL	00:13:09,503	00:13:12,063	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	Kind of like the Holy Grail of all trains yunnan
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:17,695	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	Right now spray painting a New York subway car is a felony
EDL	00:13:17,695	00:13:22,815	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	If teachers get caught it could mean jail time and thousands of dollars in fines
EDL	00:13:22,815	00:13:25,375	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	Graffiti artist have to ask themselves
EDL	00:13:25,375	00:13:26,655	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	Is this worth it
EDL	00:13:28,191	00:13:31,519	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	I'm pretty nervous talking on the phone right now even about it because

EDL	00:14:08,895	00:14:11,455	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	Turned around to tell the guy that someone
EDL	00:14:11,967	00:14:12,479	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	Is coming for us
EDL	00:14:13,247	00:14:15,039	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	And when I turned around he's already like
EDL	00:14:15,807	00:14:16,575	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	Running
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:17,855	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	We we actually

EDL	00:14:23,487	00:14:25,535	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	And now Vincent demarino
EDL	00:14:26,047	00:14:30,143	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	He's the vice president of security for the MTA and New York City Transit
EDL	00:14:30,655	00:14:34,495	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	He sees guys from all over the world in New York train yards
EDL	00:14:34,495	00:14:38,335	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	Demarino didn't have hard numbers of who gets caught from where in the yard
EDL	00:14:38,847	00:14:40,895	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	But when a train gets hit in New York
EDL	00:14:41,407	00:14:43,967	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	The graffiti artist is more likely to be from say
EDL	00:14:43,967	00:14:45,247	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	Spain or France
EDL	00:14:45,759	00:14:47,039	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	Not from New York
EDL	00:14:47,551	00:14:49,855	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	Someone put the ratio at something like a D20

EDL	00:14:51,647	00:14:52,927	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	It cost a lot of money to do
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:56,511	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	If I was to get on a plane I'd go somewhere and sit on the beach
EDL	00:14:56,511	00:15:00,351	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	I wouldn't buy an airplane ticket to go commit a crime in a train yard
EDL	00:15:00,863	00:15:03,423	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	Graffiti artists that's part of the draw
EDL	00:15:03,423	00:15:05,215	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	It's a rush to break the law
EDL	00:15:05,215	00:15:06,495	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	Now I want to get over this

EDL	00:16:31,743	00:16:34,559	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	I think about 11 cans in an hour to paint
EDL	00:16:35,071	00:16:36,863	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	But days and days

EDL	00:17:38,815	00:17:41,375	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	Graffiti is an art form a two-stage out at some point
EDL	00:17:42,143	00:17:44,447	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	And if subway graffiti did die out
EDL	00:17:44,447	00:17:45,983	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	How do we even know
EDL	00:17:45,983	00:17:52,383	| 99pi-0117-cleantrains-1 |	The artist know that their work will never be seen by the public at Large
