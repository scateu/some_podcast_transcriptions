EDL	00:04:38,015	00:04:38,527	| 296_Bijlmer_City_of_the_Future_Part_1_pt01 |	Socrative
EDL	00:04:39,551	00:04:41,087	| 296_Bijlmer_City_of_the_Future_Part_1_pt01 |	But in the 1930s
EDL	00:04:41,087	00:04:41,855	| 296_Bijlmer_City_of_the_Future_Part_1_pt01 |	That's all it was
EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:43,135	| 296_Bijlmer_City_of_the_Future_Part_1_pt01 |	A great image
EDL	00:04:43,647	00:04:46,207	| 296_Bijlmer_City_of_the_Future_Part_1_pt01 |	Because the world was in an economic depression
EDL	00:04:46,207	00:04:49,535	| 296_Bijlmer_City_of_the_Future_Part_1_pt01 |	There was not much to do in the 1930s
EDL	00:04:49,535	00:04:53,631	| 296_Bijlmer_City_of_the_Future_Part_1_pt01 |	Because it was the crisis there was no no building anymore
EDL	00:04:53,631	00:04:55,935	| 296_Bijlmer_City_of_the_Future_Part_1_pt01 |	I never got the second World War
EDL	00:04:56,703	00:04:58,751	| 296_Bijlmer_City_of_the_Future_Part_1_pt01 |	It sounds cynical but
EDL	00:04:58,751	00:04:59,519	| 296_Bijlmer_City_of_the_Future_Part_1_pt01 |	In effect
EDL	00:05:00,031	00:05:06,431	| 296_Bijlmer_City_of_the_Future_Part_1_pt01 |	They were rather lucky that so many cities were destroyed in the Second World War

EDL	00:05:13,599	00:05:17,695	| 296_Bijlmer_City_of_the_Future_Part_1_pt01 |	So that was a lot of work to do in 1945
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:20,767	| 296_Bijlmer_City_of_the_Future_Part_1_pt01 |	And they were really excited
EDL	00:05:21,791	00:05:24,863	| 296_Bijlmer_City_of_the_Future_Part_1_pt01 |	But it wasn't just that the Architects had a lot of work

EDL	00:05:32,031	00:05:38,175	| 296_Bijlmer_City_of_the_Future_Part_1_pt01 |	And that was all that was their idea from the start
EDL	00:05:38,943	00:05:41,503	| 296_Bijlmer_City_of_the_Future_Part_1_pt01 |	So dear everything down
