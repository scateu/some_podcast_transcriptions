EDL	00:10:13,887	00:10:17,215	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	And then he would add it all together and mix it together so you hear the full product

EDL	00:12:22,143	00:12:24,191	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	And that's part of the reason for Douglas's silence

EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:09,247	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	I love that
EDL	00:13:09,759	00:13:11,807	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	It tells a story in a single laugh
EDL	00:13:11,807	00:13:13,855	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	There's a joke but one guy in the audience
EDL	00:13:13,855	00:13:15,135	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	He doesn't get it right away
EDL	00:13:15,135	00:13:17,951	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	He does Split Second late and then he last a little bit longer
EDL	00:13:18,463	00:13:19,487	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Hear it listen to it again
EDL	00:13:25,375	00:13:27,167	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Charlie Douglas wasn't at the sound engineer
EDL	00:13:27,935	00:13:28,959	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	He was a psychologist
EDL	00:13:33,055	00:13:36,639	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Dropping the last track is that it's fake laughter from a fake audience
EDL	00:13:36,639	00:13:37,919	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	But that's not quite right
EDL	00:13:38,431	00:13:40,479	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Doesn't represent a bogus body
EDL	00:13:40,991	00:13:42,783	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	It represents an audience of one
EDL	00:13:42,783	00:13:43,551	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Charlie Douglas
EDL	00:13:44,831	00:13:47,903	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	He definitely Goose laugh a producer's instructions
EDL	00:13:47,903	00:13:51,231	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Large extent he and the people who work for him follow their guts
EDL	00:13:51,743	00:13:57,631	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	It's incredible that one man's taste and sense of humor or so important and pasting an entire type of Television comedy
EDL	00:13:58,143	00:14:02,751	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	But it's true
EDL	00:14:09,663	00:14:12,223	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	So how did the last active in Era of TV come to an end
EDL	00:14:12,735	00:14:15,039	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	How did the laugh track go from being a tittering companion
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:18,879	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	I think we need to think about the laugh track
EDL	00:14:18,879	00:14:20,671	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Not just a habit or an object
EDL	00:14:20,671	00:14:21,695	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	But an idea
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:22,975	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	An idea about why we laugh
EDL	00:14:23,487	00:14:26,815	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	I'm going to get you another idea about laughter later on but this first one
EDL	00:14:27,327	00:14:29,375	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	I think it makes the last track of the 50s and
EDL	00:14:29,375	00:14:30,143	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Take these make a lot more

EDL	00:14:55,231	00:14:57,791	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	It was recorded a few years earlier in Germany
EDL	00:14:57,791	00:15:01,631	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	As the sound of a cornet being interrupted by a hysterically laughing woman

EDL	00:15:15,199	00:15:17,759	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	The okeh laughing record was a huge novelty hit
EDL	00:15:17,759	00:15:20,063	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	There's speculation that sold over a million copies

EDL	00:15:29,023	00:15:30,815	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Just by listening to other people laugh
EDL	00:15:31,327	00:15:32,863	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	What's funny must be the laughter
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:34,143	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Because it's not the joke
EDL	00:15:34,143	00:15:35,167	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	There is no joke
EDL	00:15:35,935	00:15:39,007	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	But this particular approach to humor it's not that popular right now
EDL	00:15:39,519	00:15:42,079	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Define someone to defend it I had to talk to one of Paul's friends

EDL	00:15:58,719	00:15:59,999	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	It just wouldn't be funny
EDL	00:16:00,767	00:16:04,351	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	And it was
EDL	00:16:04,351	00:16:04,863	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Scratch
EDL	00:16:06,911	00:16:13,055	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Yes yes parley
EDL	00:16:16,383	00:16:17,151	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	It's not funny
EDL	00:16:18,175	00:16:18,687	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Right
EDL	00:16:21,503	00:16:22,271	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	That's funny
EDL	00:16:22,783	00:16:23,807	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	I found this
EDL	00:16:23,807	00:16:28,671	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	What does a tree falling in the forest make a sound send Cohen a sitcom laughter a genuinely perplexing
EDL	00:16:29,183	00:16:31,487	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Is a pie in the face funny if no one laughs
EDL	00:16:31,999	00:16:34,559	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Is an episode of Friends funny
EDL	00:16:34,559	00:16:37,119	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	That's what I wondered after coming across this video
EDL	00:16:37,119	00:16:40,703	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Posted on YouTube a friends without a laugh track

EDL	00:16:46,079	00:16:47,359	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Buffet man
EDL	00:16:49,663	00:16:51,455	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Here's what I went all my money back
EDL	00:16:52,223	00:16:54,783	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	You can hear what the rhythm of the show was supposed to be
EDL	00:16:54,783	00:16:56,575	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	How the pacing depends upon their being laughed
EDL	00:16:57,343	00:16:59,391	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Without it friend sounds weird and unnatural
EDL	00:16:59,903	00:17:04,767	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	If there's no audience laughter it suddenly starts how hot it is that the characters are trying to make each other laugh
EDL	00:17:05,535	00:17:06,815	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Friends need to slap
EDL	00:17:06,815	00:17:08,607	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	To be funny even if some of them are fake
EDL	00:17:09,119	00:17:10,655	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Has anyone seen Richie
EDL	00:17:11,423	00:17:13,215	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	She's upstairs not doing the dishes
EDL	00:17:13,215	00:17:15,007	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	I'll tell you something you don't I'm not doing them this time
EDL	00:17:25,759	00:17:28,063	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	The transition away from the Laff trakk started slowly
EDL	00:17:28,575	00:17:31,903	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	In the seventies with Norman Lear sitcoms like All in the Family
EDL	00:17:31,903	00:17:34,975	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Comedy started to be taped in front of a live studio audience again
EDL	00:17:35,487	00:17:38,815	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	The audience is last would be smoothed out edited or boosted
EDL	00:17:38,815	00:17:42,911	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	This is a process called sweetening which Douglas had done a lot of and still happens all the time
EDL	00:17:43,423	00:17:45,983	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	But already it was of the last sound borealis
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:53,407	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	In the eighties and nineties some shows like The Wonder Years the Larry Sanders show and the days and nights of Molly Dodd
EDL	00:17:53,919	00:17:56,223	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Started to experiment with dropping the laugh track
EDL	00:17:56,223	00:17:57,759	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	The TV's biggest hits
EDL	00:17:57,759	00:18:00,063	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Shows like Jerry Seinfeld and friends still had them
EDL	00:18:00,575	00:18:05,439	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	By the late 90s with the rise of cable and on Laff tracks animated series like The Simpsons
EDL	00:18:05,439	00:18:08,511	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Even the network started contemplating making different kinds of comedies
EDL	00:18:09,023	00:18:13,375	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Setting up a collision between the old idea about comedy and the typical way of doing things
EDL	00:18:13,375	00:18:14,911	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	And a new idea about comedy
EDL	00:18:14,911	00:18:16,447	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	A new way of shooting a TV show
EDL	00:18:17,471	00:18:18,495	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Cotton a collision

EDL	00:18:39,487	00:18:41,535	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	If I had four walls the camera moves
EDL	00:18:42,047	00:18:43,839	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	And they wanted to shoot it without a laugh track
EDL	00:18:44,351	00:18:45,375	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	ABC
EDL	00:18:45,375	00:18:45,887	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Not so much
EDL	00:18:46,399	00:18:47,935	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	They wanted to do something different
EDL	00:18:47,935	00:18:48,703	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	But not that differ

EDL	00:18:55,615	00:18:56,383	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	4
EDL	00:18:56,383	00:18:58,431	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Shows that I've had traditional
EDL	00:18:58,431	00:18:58,943	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Laugh tracks
EDL	00:18:59,711	00:19:03,039	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	If they were really very nervous about giving that up
EDL	00:19:04,063	00:19:08,671	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	What did you feel like the last recommend about your show

EDL	00:19:10,463	00:19:12,255	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Situational comedy is the laugh track
EDL	00:19:12,767	00:19:15,327	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	I think we're familiar with it I think it sort of
EDL	00:19:15,327	00:19:16,863	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Resonates in a certain way
EDL	00:19:17,375	00:19:22,495	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	But I think it is kind of establishing a conceptual idea about a show
EDL	00:19:23,007	00:19:29,151	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	That is saying it's not real this is a theatrical presentation I'm there with this group of people were all laughing it's fine
EDL	00:19:29,919	00:19:35,551	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	That was not the idea of the way I think Aaron wrote or what I think Sports night was about

EDL	00:21:09,503	00:21:10,783	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	The end of the last track
EDL	00:21:15,135	00:21:15,903	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	So what changed
EDL	00:21:17,696	00:21:22,560	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	I want to talk about another Siri about laughter that's different from the pie-in-the-face theory I mentioned earlier
EDL	00:21:24,096	00:21:27,168	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Isn't a fundamentally social activity
EDL	00:21:27,168	00:21:29,216	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Because everyone else is doing it
EDL	00:21:29,728	00:21:35,616	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Something deeply wonderfully individual and idiosyncratic reaction to the quality of the joke itself

EDL	00:22:10,432	00:22:12,224	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Alternative comedy snob
EDL	00:22:12,224	00:22:14,272	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	And coming out of the New York scene
EDL	00:22:14,784	00:22:15,808	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Already was
EDL	00:22:16,320	00:22:18,880	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Show with a laugh track
EDL	00:22:19,648	00:22:21,184	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Other than Seinfeld
EDL	00:22:21,184	00:22:21,952	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Is
EDL	00:22:21,952	00:22:22,720	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	You know

EDL	00:22:24,000	00:22:25,280	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	A dinosaur
EDL	00:22:25,280	00:22:28,352	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	But it didn't have the clout to keep love incorporated from having a laugh track
EDL	00:22:28,864	00:22:31,168	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	The show is performed in front of a studio audience
EDL	00:22:31,168	00:22:32,448	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	And hatsune real life
EDL	00:22:32,448	00:22:34,752	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Dennis sound editor came in to sweeten it
EDL	00:22:34,752	00:22:36,800	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Boosting and manipulating all of them
EDL	00:22:36,800	00:22:38,592	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Is a relapse replaced by Alaska
EDL	00:22:39,360	00:22:42,176	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	But anyone use that last track in the typical way
EDL	00:22:42,176	00:22:43,712	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	So I guess my take was
EDL	00:22:43,712	00:22:44,224	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Well
EDL	00:22:44,736	00:22:46,528	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Since we're doing this anyway
EDL	00:22:47,040	00:22:48,832	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Why don't we just decide what
EDL	00:22:50,624	00:22:53,440	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Give me I was with like if we'll it's going to be
EDL	00:22:53,440	00:22:54,720	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	This creation
EDL	00:22:55,488	00:22:56,768	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	This false thing
EDL	00:22:57,280	00:22:59,328	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Why go half way just make the whole thing of
EDL	00:23:01,376	00:23:04,448	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Train the audience that's watching at home
EDL	00:23:04,448	00:23:10,592	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	How much attention anyway in my head in other words anyone the last track to reflect what was really funny
EDL	00:23:11,104	00:23:12,640	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	He understood how the laugh track is
EDL	00:23:12,640	00:23:13,152	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Supposed to work
EDL	00:23:13,664	00:23:16,480	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	It is supposed to make people laugh at what other people are laughing at
EDL	00:23:16,480	00:23:19,552	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	What do you want to retrofit it to account for the secondary of laughter
EDL	00:23:20,064	00:23:21,600	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Tell audiences hey
EDL	00:23:21,600	00:23:24,160	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Some jokes are funnier than others and you should laugh at those
EDL	00:23:25,440	00:23:28,000	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	In 68 his boss wouldn't have it
EDL	00:23:28,000	00:23:29,536	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	But even so you can see
EDL	00:23:29,536	00:23:33,888	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	He may be skeptical of the laughter of the crowd but he believes in the objective quality of
EDL	00:23:33,888	00:23:36,448	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	The joke you may be able to get a big laugh
EDL	00:23:36,960	00:23:38,752	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Ativan audience and B
EDL	00:23:39,264	00:23:40,800	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Not that great a comic
EDL	00:23:40,800	00:23:43,360	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	I mean a lot of comics with argue well if you get a let get the laugh
EDL	00:23:43,872	00:23:45,920	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Then you are a great time at
EDL	00:23:46,432	00:23:49,248	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Cuz I'm a snob
EDL	00:23:49,248	00:23:51,808	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Any may be a snob but his perspective has become White
EDL	00:23:52,320	00:23:54,624	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	This is how a lot of people think about comedy Now
EDL	00:23:54,624	00:23:55,392	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Me included
EDL	00:23:55,904	00:24:00,768	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Some jokes are better than others and you can't tell simply based on what got the biggest laugh
EDL	00:24:00,768	00:24:02,560	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Especially when that last comes from Alaska
EDL	00:24:06,144	00:24:09,728	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	For decades TV was ruled by the idea that laughter is socially contingent
EDL	00:24:12,544	00:24:14,848	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Debackers idiosyncratic and individual
EDL	00:24:15,360	00:24:16,640	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	This is a big transition
EDL	00:24:17,152	00:24:20,480	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	For some viewers the last act into stop encouraging laughter
EDL	00:24:20,480	00:24:21,248	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Started inhibiting
EDL	00:24:22,272	00:24:23,296	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	The last track
EDL	00:24:23,296	00:24:23,808	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Broke
EDL	00:24:24,320	00:24:30,720	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Play shows of artifacts have been almost entirely cut out of the crib.
EDL	00:24:30,720	00:24:31,488	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Conversation
EDL	00:24:31,488	00:24:33,792	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Do they still have their modern-day Defenders and uses
EDL	00:24:33,792	00:24:36,864	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Especially in the revivals of beloved shows that have laugh tracks
EDL	00:24:36,864	00:24:37,376	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Like Will & Grace
EDL	00:24:39,424	00:24:45,824	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Netflix's 2017 reboot of Norman lear's one day at a time a show about a divorced cuban-american better

EDL	00:24:47,104	00:24:50,688	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Raising her son and teenage daughter while living with her mother is great
EDL	00:24:50,688	00:24:54,016	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	It's smart it's Charming it's clear and it has a laugh track 2
EDL	00:24:54,016	00:24:55,040	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	She has to
EDL	00:24:55,040	00:24:56,064	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	To have a quinceanera
EDL	00:24:56,576	00:25:00,160	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	How else would we know the day that our little girl becomes a woman
EDL	00:25:00,672	00:25:01,440	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	You missed it
EDL	00:25:02,208	00:25:05,280	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Well I was in gym and ironically happened at first.
EDL	00:25:05,792	00:25:10,144	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	So I'm just
EDL	00:25:10,144	00:25:11,936	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Podcast for doing about the last rocket
EDL	00:25:12,960	00:25:14,752	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	I'm wanting to talk to you guys
EDL	00:25:14,752	00:25:21,152	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Because you do a great job as laugh track
EDL	00:25:21,152	00:25:25,760	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	That's Gloria Calderon kellett in microwave
EDL	00:25:25,760	00:25:27,296	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	The showrunners of one day at a time
EDL	00:25:27,808	00:25:30,368	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	There right there shows filmed in front of a live audience
EDL	00:25:30,368	00:25:31,136	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	I was the
EDL	00:25:31,904	00:25:34,976	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Mike and Gloria say they're sound editor cuts down on the Oz
EDL	00:25:34,976	00:25:38,816	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	And the more excessive whoops Rita Moreno and even trims down to laugh
EDL	00:25:38,816	00:25:40,608	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	But they say there's no sweetening in their show
EDL	00:25:41,120	00:25:42,656	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	I said it was a laugh track
EDL	00:25:42,656	00:25:43,424	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Like
EDL	00:25:43,424	00:25:44,960	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Why does that bother you so much
EDL	00:25:44,960	00:25:46,752	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Some people just don't like
EDL	00:25:46,752	00:25:48,544	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	To hear other people laughing cuz
EDL	00:25:48,544	00:25:50,336	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	It feels like they're being told what to do
EDL	00:25:50,848	00:25:52,384	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	But part of that comes from
EDL	00:25:52,896	00:25:56,480	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	I think feeling like the laughter is somehow fakely adidon
EDL	00:25:56,992	00:25:59,552	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Mike is right that is how some people feel about the laugh track
EDL	00:26:00,064	00:26:01,600	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	That is a false advertisement
EDL	00:26:01,600	00:26:02,880	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Trying to sell you a bad joke
EDL	00:26:02,880	00:26:03,648	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	As I was a good one
EDL	00:26:04,160	00:26:05,696	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	And sometimes that is what the laughter
EDL	00:26:06,720	00:26:09,024	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	So I asked why it was worth risking that kind of reaction
EDL	00:26:09,792	00:26:11,328	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Police about a shared experience

EDL	00:33:30,624	00:33:35,232	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Joshua is also an actor on the side he recently wrapped up a 7-year run on Scandal
EDL	00:33:35,232	00:33:37,024	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	He was also on The West Wing
EDL	00:33:37,024	00:33:42,912	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Because big break in television has Jeremy Goodwin on another Aaron's working creation Sports night
EDL	00:33:42,912	00:33:47,776	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	It was a strange and beautiful half hour comedy with strong dramatic elements in
EDL	00:33:47,776	00:33:52,128	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	The rapid-fire dialogue that people would Embrace more fully on The West Wing
EDL	00:33:52,128	00:33:54,432	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	But as was mentioned in the documentary you just heard
EDL	00:33:54,432	00:33:58,016	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Sports night marked the beginning of the end for the laugh track
EDL	00:33:58,016	00:34:01,600	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	I asked Joshua if he was aware of that Dynamic at the time
EDL	00:34:01,600	00:34:04,672	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	It was always my understanding that Erin
EDL	00:34:04,672	00:34:06,720	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Objected strenuously
EDL	00:34:06,720	00:34:10,048	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	To the inclusion of a laugh track on Sports night
EDL	00:34:10,048	00:34:13,120	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	And for that matter to the inclusion of a live audience
EDL	00:34:13,888	00:34:17,984	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	In the studio as we filmed what was essentially
EDL	00:34:17,984	00:34:18,752	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Single-camera
EDL	00:34:19,264	00:34:21,568	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Comedy so it was kind of being forced
EDL	00:34:22,080	00:34:23,360	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Into
EDL	00:34:23,360	00:34:24,128	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	A hybrid
EDL	00:34:24,640	00:34:25,920	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Of which iron did not approve
EDL	00:34:26,432	00:34:30,528	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	And did you feel the tension of it be neither fish nor fowl when you are
EDL	00:34:30,528	00:34:31,552	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Acting in it
EDL	00:34:31,552	00:34:36,160	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Yes I think as a performer and that somebody coming from a theater background
EDL	00:34:36,160	00:34:38,464	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	And perhaps somebody is a little bit
EDL	00:34:38,464	00:34:42,560	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Oven 1/8 ham it's hard to ignore
EDL	00:34:43,072	00:34:45,376	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	The presence of 90 people
EDL	00:34:45,376	00:34:47,168	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	In a room where your
EDL	00:34:47,168	00:34:51,264	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Making a show hopefully for millions of people to watch at home and there is
EDL	00:34:52,800	00:34:54,848	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Something different between a performance
EDL	00:34:54,848	00:34:55,872	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Four camera
EDL	00:34:56,384	00:34:58,432	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	And a live performance
EDL	00:34:58,432	00:34:59,456	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	And so
EDL	00:34:59,968	00:35:04,320	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	While be priority ought to be be home viewing audience
EDL	00:35:04,320	00:35:08,416	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	I found it difficult not to play to the people who are in the room with me
EDL	00:35:08,416	00:35:11,232	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Flight very happy with my performance in the pilot
EDL	00:35:11,232	00:35:12,768	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	It's large
EDL	00:35:12,768	00:35:16,352	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	It's possible one can detect
EDL	00:35:16,352	00:35:17,376	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	My playing
EDL	00:35:17,888	00:35:24,288	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	To be live audience and perhaps I should have toned it down a little bit
EDL	00:35:24,288	00:35:30,688	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Sophisticated and I sense that you are
EDL	00:35:30,688	00:35:31,712	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	At least 20 minutes
EDL	00:35:37,600	00:35:38,880	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	As the
EDL	00:35:38,880	00:35:40,160	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Laugh track itself
EDL	00:35:40,672	00:35:42,208	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Was slowly muted
EDL	00:35:42,976	00:35:43,744	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	I think
EDL	00:35:43,744	00:35:47,584	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Maybe my performance got a little bit smaller little more finally realized
EDL	00:35:48,096	00:35:52,448	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	So I think I need to go back up a little bit understand so there is a live audience
EDL	00:35:53,216	00:35:56,544	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	For the first season or what was the setup actually
EDL	00:35:57,056	00:35:59,104	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	There was a live audience
EDL	00:35:59,104	00:36:01,408	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	For I think as long as there was a laugh track
EDL	00:36:01,408	00:36:07,808	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Tommy schlamme and Aaron Sorkin finally outwitted ABC simply by dialing it down a bit
EDL	00:36:07,808	00:36:10,624	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Episode-by-episode until it was gone
EDL	00:36:10,624	00:36:11,648	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	So they never
EDL	00:36:12,160	00:36:13,440	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	They never
EDL	00:36:13,440	00:36:18,816	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	One of the explicit argument about a laugh track ABC never said fine get rid of the laugh track
EDL	00:36:18,816	00:36:25,216	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	They just got rid of it so slippery you know it's that thing I guess where you boil a frog
EDL	00:36:25,216	00:36:29,824	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	It was a you know de facto they have gotten rid of these laugh track by the time
EDL	00:36:29,824	00:36:35,200	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	ABC you seem to notice up my memory is that that was somewhere around episode 7 or 8
EDL	00:36:35,712	00:36:36,480	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	End
EDL	00:36:36,480	00:36:39,808	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Having disposed of the laugh track we dispose of a live audience
EDL	00:36:39,808	00:36:45,952	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	It was already a weird situation to have the audience there when we were moving around trying to make our
EDL	00:36:45,952	00:36:47,488	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Single-camera comedy
EDL	00:36:47,488	00:36:50,304	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	And so there really was no
EDL	00:36:51,072	00:36:54,144	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Existential point to the live audience once the laugh track was
EDL	00:36:54,656	00:36:55,168	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Removed
EDL	00:36:55,936	00:36:56,960	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	It was one of those
EDL	00:36:56,960	00:37:01,312	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	We're instances why I think that a lot of us who grew up on television the laptop
EDL	00:37:01,312	00:37:02,592	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Heart of sitcoms
EDL	00:37:03,104	00:37:05,408	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	And this was a very different sitcom
EDL	00:37:05,408	00:37:07,968	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Did you feel the sense of this tension
EDL	00:37:08,480	00:37:11,808	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	As an audience member as well as up as a person crafting this
EDL	00:37:12,576	00:37:13,344	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Yes
EDL	00:37:13,344	00:37:14,880	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	I'm not a big fan of laugh tracks
EDL	00:37:14,880	00:37:15,904	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	All together
EDL	00:37:15,904	00:37:22,304	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	The Golden Age of TV if the shows in black and white and feels like a theater piece anyway like The Honeymooners looks like
EDL	00:37:22,304	00:37:24,096	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Like they're putting on a play
EDL	00:37:24,096	00:37:25,376	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	It kind of works
EDL	00:37:25,376	00:37:28,192	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	And has heard of an old-school resonance for me
EDL	00:37:28,192	00:37:29,728	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Certainly for what we were doing
EDL	00:37:30,240	00:37:30,752	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Wait
EDL	00:37:31,264	00:37:34,080	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Was creating a piece that included
EDL	00:37:34,080	00:37:36,640	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Elements of comedy in drama
EDL	00:37:36,640	00:37:37,408	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	It just
EDL	00:37:37,408	00:37:37,920	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Felt
EDL	00:37:39,456	00:37:39,968	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Felt
EDL	00:37:40,480	00:37:43,040	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Weird as we're making it when I watched it
EDL	00:37:43,040	00:37:44,576	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	The that that
EDL	00:37:44,576	00:37:45,856	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	You know sweetens
EDL	00:37:47,392	00:37:48,672	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Super artificial
EDL	00:37:49,184	00:37:49,952	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Laugh track
EDL	00:37:50,976	00:37:52,256	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	I think there's not
EDL	00:37:53,024	00:37:53,792	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Elevate The Shadow
EDL	00:37:54,560	00:37:59,936	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	And so over the course of the first season while the laptop was being
EDL	00:37:59,936	00:38:00,960	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Bow Down
EDL	00:38:00,960	00:38:02,240	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Surreptitiously
EDL	00:38:02,240	00:38:03,264	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Did you
EDL	00:38:03,776	00:38:05,824	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Intuitively know to change your
EDL	00:38:05,824	00:38:08,640	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Performance slightly was that communicated to you in some way
EDL	00:38:09,408	00:38:11,456	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	I don't think it was made explicit I think
EDL	00:38:12,736	00:38:19,136	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	I just settled into the natural rhythm of acting for the camera I think the best piece of advice I got as a young actors
EDL	00:38:19,136	00:38:20,416	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Learning how to act on film
EDL	00:38:20,928	00:38:21,696	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Was
EDL	00:38:21,696	00:38:24,512	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	I always remembered that the camera can read your mind
EDL	00:38:25,280	00:38:26,048	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:38:26,048	00:38:30,656	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	That's a very different piece of advice from you to make sure your performance reaches
EDL	00:38:30,656	00:38:37,056	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	That person in the last row of the balcony and said they're just there are baked in
EDL	00:38:37,056	00:38:38,592	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Inherent differences
EDL	00:38:38,592	00:38:44,480	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Between a live performance in the performance for Cameron sowinski audience was actually gone I think I just settled into
EDL	00:38:44,480	00:38:46,272	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Okay we're making it TV show
EDL	00:38:47,808	00:38:48,832	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	You know did that
EDL	00:38:48,832	00:38:50,368	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Cameras going to get in
EDL	00:38:50,368	00:38:51,136	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Really close
EDL	00:38:51,648	00:38:52,928	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	When it needs to
EDL	00:38:52,928	00:38:53,952	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	And
EDL	00:38:54,720	00:38:56,256	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Startled let go of the idea of
EDL	00:38:56,256	00:38:56,768	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Trying to
EDL	00:38:57,280	00:38:58,048	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Project
EDL	00:38:58,048	00:38:58,560	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Anyting
EDL	00:38:59,072	00:39:01,376	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	So what do you think of sports night being this
EDL	00:39:01,888	00:39:03,424	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Pivotal moment in
EDL	00:39:03,424	00:39:04,192	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Laugh track history
EDL	00:39:04,704	00:39:07,008	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	The situation with the laugh track
EDL	00:39:07,776	00:39:10,848	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	And ABC versus Aaron and Tommy
EDL	00:39:10,848	00:39:11,616	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Reflected
EDL	00:39:14,176	00:39:15,456	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Very significant
EDL	00:39:17,504	00:39:19,552	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Misunderstanding on the networks
EDL	00:39:19,552	00:39:20,320	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Part
EDL	00:39:20,320	00:39:21,600	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Of what the show was
EDL	00:39:23,136	00:39:23,904	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	End
EDL	00:39:24,672	00:39:26,208	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	So I think it's just one
EDL	00:39:26,720	00:39:29,024	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Offshoot of they're not quite knowing
EDL	00:39:29,024	00:39:32,096	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	What they had or what to do with sports night
EDL	00:39:32,096	00:39:36,704	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	And I think we're we're very used to sing single-camera comedies and we're used to seeing
EDL	00:39:36,704	00:39:37,984	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Television shows that
EDL	00:39:38,496	00:39:44,640	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	When might have difficulty classifying as a comedy or drama I don't know why this is such a
EDL	00:39:45,408	00:39:50,528	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	20 years ago now we're a little bit more sophisticated
EDL	00:39:50,528	00:39:53,088	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	As an audience and we understand
EDL	00:39:53,088	00:39:58,464	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	That much like Life TV shows can have moments of drama and moments of Comedy
EDL	00:39:58,464	00:39:59,232	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	But I think

EDL	00:40:48,128	00:40:54,528	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	A lot of Television that we admire today feels like a platitude to say that anything was before

EDL	00:41:10,400	00:41:13,984	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	I think they were truly a little bit ahead of the Curve
EDL	00:41:13,984	00:41:17,312	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	And did ultimately take a little more time for
EDL	00:41:17,312	00:41:20,128	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	Audiences to come around for this type of material
EDL	00:41:20,128	00:41:21,664	| 305_The_Laff_Box_pt_01 |	But I agree with you that we did
