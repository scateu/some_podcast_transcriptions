EDL	00:01:43,424	00:01:46,240	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Everything seemed to be based around this reference point average
EDL	00:01:46,752	00:01:49,568	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	And obviously everything about societies Built This Way
EDL	00:01:49,568	00:01:51,360	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	But I never really thought of it
EDL	00:01:51,360	00:01:52,384	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Until I dug into
EDL	00:01:53,664	00:01:54,944	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	7 part of this is
EDL	00:01:54,944	00:01:55,456	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Todd Road
EDL	00:01:55,968	00:01:59,552	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	My name is Todd Rose I am the director of the mind brain education

EDL	00:02:02,112	00:02:03,648	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	He's also the author of the book
EDL	00:02:03,648	00:02:04,416	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	The end of average
EDL	00:02:04,928	00:02:06,464	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	But he had to that first we have to
EDL	00:02:06,464	00:02:07,232	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Start with the
EDL	00:02:07,232	00:02:08,000	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Beginning of average
EDL	00:02:09,024	00:02:10,560	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Because it wasn't always a thing
EDL	00:02:11,328	00:02:17,472	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	The concept of average as we know it was pioneered by a Belgian mathematician and astronomer named out of Kevlar
EDL	00:02:17,472	00:02:20,032	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	So Kelly is the person who actually
EDL	00:02:20,032	00:02:21,568	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Coins the term the average man
EDL	00:02:22,336	00:02:23,360	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	And he is
EDL	00:02:23,360	00:02:24,896	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	In like the 1830s
EDL	00:02:25,408	00:02:27,456	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	She is actually an astronomer in Belgium
EDL	00:02:27,968	00:02:31,296	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Today the way the most people get a handle on any set of numbers
EDL	00:02:32,064	00:02:33,088	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Calculate
EDL	00:02:33,856	00:02:34,880	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Catalyst
EDL	00:02:34,880	00:02:38,208	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Astronomers were some of the only people who did this
EDL	00:02:38,720	00:02:43,840	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Basically averages were a way to compensate for the imprecise tools that astronomers were working with
EDL	00:02:43,840	00:02:45,120	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	In 1830
EDL	00:02:45,120	00:02:46,656	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	If you were trying to time
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:50,752	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	The movement of Saturn you would actual scratches on your glass of your
EDL	00:02:50,752	00:02:56,128	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Telescoping as soon as it crossed one you start counting and stopped counting after across the other
EDL	00:02:56,128	00:02:59,712	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	But you can imagine you're off by half a second
EDL	00:02:59,712	00:03:01,504	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	It's going to be a lot of error
EDL	00:03:03,040	00:03:04,064	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	And so
EDL	00:03:04,064	00:03:06,880	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	They they realize if they wanted to make sense of
EDL	00:03:06,880	00:03:07,904	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Painting heaven
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:09,184	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	They needed more
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:10,464	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Precision in their ass
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:13,280	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	And they realize that if you had saved
EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:14,304	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	10 measurements
EDL	00:03:14,304	00:03:15,328	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	They were all slightly different
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:18,656	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	You added them together and divided them by 10
EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:20,192	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	You got a better approximation of
EDL	00:03:20,960	00:03:21,472	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	True measure
EDL	00:03:21,984	00:03:23,776	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	If you just average together are measurement
EDL	00:03:24,288	00:03:27,360	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	You're way more likely to be closer to the truth right end
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:29,920	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	You end up getting kind of a bell curve of measurement error
EDL	00:03:29,920	00:03:33,504	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Cadillac was the first to take this tool of astronomers and Appliance
EDL	00:03:33,504	00:03:34,016	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Two people
EDL	00:03:34,784	00:03:36,064	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	In the early 1840s
EDL	00:03:36,064	00:03:37,600	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Is Cadillac find a data set
EDL	00:03:37,600	00:03:41,184	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Of the chest measurements of 5738
EDL	00:03:41,696	00:03:42,464	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Scottish soldiers
EDL	00:03:43,232	00:03:47,584	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Kelly added together each of the measurements and divided by the total sum of the soldiers
EDL	00:03:47,584	00:03:48,352	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Net result
EDL	00:03:48,864	00:03:50,912	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	39 and 3/4 in
EDL	00:03:50,912	00:03:52,960	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Was one of the very first time
EDL	00:03:52,960	00:03:54,496	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Scientists had calculated
EDL	00:03:55,008	00:03:56,032	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	The average size
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:03:56,800	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	I like humans
EDL	00:03:57,312	00:03:59,104	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	But he brings with it the idea of Truth
EDL	00:03:59,616	00:04:01,152	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	That the average
EDL	00:04:01,152	00:04:05,248	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Chastise is true and that all the individuals are like error
EDL	00:04:05,248	00:04:07,808	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	That nature striving for the average Soldier
EDL	00:04:07,808	00:04:10,368	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	This means the average measurement is the
EDL	00:04:10,368	00:04:11,392	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Truemeasureman
EDL	00:04:11,392	00:04:12,672	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Platonic ideal
EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:15,232	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	The perfect Scottish Soldier
EDL	00:04:15,232	00:04:16,000	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Another joke
EDL	00:04:16,000	00:04:18,047	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	What is 39 and 3/4 inches
EDL	00:04:18,815	00:04:19,583	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	According to Cadillac
EDL	00:04:20,095	00:04:25,983	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	So he's the one that decides not only is average mathematical useful it's morally the way to think about people
EDL	00:04:25,983	00:04:30,335	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	And so he basically find averages anywhere he can possibly find them
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:36,479	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	And he measures all kinds of other people and averages them he create something called The Catalyst
EDL	00:04:37,247	00:04:39,807	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Measuring ratios of average height and weight
EDL	00:04:39,807	00:04:41,599	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Actually we still use it today
EDL	00:04:41,599	00:04:43,135	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Just now it's called the body mass
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:43,903	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Index
EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:44,671	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	4 BMI
EDL	00:04:44,671	00:04:45,695	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Hillywood say
EDL	00:04:45,695	00:04:46,975	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	If you talk about height
EDL	00:04:46,975	00:04:51,839	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Everyone if they were optimally fed if they were under the same environmental conditions
EDL	00:04:51,839	00:04:53,375	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Would have been average
EDL	00:04:53,375	00:04:54,911	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	So his view was that
EDL	00:04:54,911	00:04:56,447	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	What you're striving for
EDL	00:04:56,447	00:05:00,031	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Is the continual Improvement of the average of the group
EDL	00:05:00,799	00:05:02,079	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	And it wasn't all just physical
EDL	00:05:02,591	00:05:04,895	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Timberlake homes through various data sets
EDL	00:05:04,895	00:05:08,479	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	It's for marriages murders and suicides and calculates the averages for them
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:14,879	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	He figures out there such a thing as a normal suicide rate which is really really bizarre the
EDL	00:05:14,879	00:05:16,159	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	But I'm almost scandalous
EDL	00:05:16,159	00:05:20,767	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Nowadays when we're so used to the stability of big massive amount of data
EDL	00:05:20,767	00:05:22,047	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	That is hard
EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:22,815	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Put your
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:24,351	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Stuff in their shoes but like
EDL	00:05:25,119	00:05:26,911	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Back then they really thought that
EDL	00:05:26,911	00:05:27,935	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Something like to say
EDL	00:05:27,935	00:05:28,447	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Suicide
EDL	00:05:28,959	00:05:30,495	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	With such a personal
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:31,007	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Decision
EDL	00:05:31,519	00:05:33,567	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	And I couldn't possibly be any pattern there
EDL	00:05:34,335	00:05:35,615	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	But some of the word patterns
EDL	00:05:36,127	00:05:37,919	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Body size intelligence
EDL	00:05:37,919	00:05:38,943	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Birth of death
EDL	00:05:39,455	00:05:40,991	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	People became statistic
EDL	00:05:41,759	00:05:43,807	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	The behavior starts to become
EDL	00:05:44,319	00:05:44,831	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Predictable
EDL	00:05:45,599	00:05:47,135	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Suddenly human life
EDL	00:05:47,135	00:05:47,903	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Went by the numbers
EDL	00:05:48,927	00:05:55,327	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	So obviously at the first interpretation is we'll wait a minute maybe there's no free well maybe there's laws of society
EDL	00:05:55,327	00:05:56,351	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	You just like the laws of physics
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:05:58,399	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Black kick-started
EDL	00:05:58,399	00:06:01,215	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	A whole bunch of people like me like Karl Marx
EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:02,495	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	To love cuddly
EDL	00:06:02,495	00:06:04,799	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Until it becomes a huge star
EDL	00:06:04,799	00:06:07,871	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	This Time Cabaret was up there with the likes of Sir Isaac Newton
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:12,991	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Is science of averages was this remarkable cutting-edge way to assess the health
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:15,551	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Wellness and progress of population
EDL	00:06:15,551	00:06:19,391	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	He's really active in the 1820s and 1830s 1840s
EDL	00:06:19,391	00:06:20,927	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	I'm all the way up like the 50s and
EDL	00:06:21,439	00:06:23,487	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	The 1860s brings us
EDL	00:06:23,487	00:06:25,023	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	The US Civil War
EDL	00:06:25,023	00:06:28,095	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Do another Super Fan of catalase Science of averages
EDL	00:06:29,119	00:06:30,143	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Abraham Lincoln
EDL	00:06:30,143	00:06:31,423	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	When the Civil War
EDL	00:06:31,935	00:06:34,239	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Is going in the North Lincoln
EDL	00:06:34,239	00:06:35,007	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Actually
EDL	00:06:35,519	00:06:37,567	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Kind of cleaner bucket Frank
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:39,871	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Because this war had guns
EDL	00:06:39,871	00:06:41,663	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	So huge and unwieldy
EDL	00:06:41,663	00:06:43,199	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Lincoln doesn't really have
EDL	00:06:43,199	00:06:44,735	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Handle on the Northern Army
EDL	00:06:44,735	00:06:45,503	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	And
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:48,319	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	He's like we don't even know who our soldiers are we don't know
EDL	00:06:48,319	00:06:51,903	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	I will said they are we don't know what kind of armor they need we don't know anything about them
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:57,279	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Lincoln decided that the Union Army needed more information about its soldiers
EDL	00:06:57,279	00:06:59,071	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	In order to best distribute resources
EDL	00:06:59,839	00:07:04,447	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	So he ordered this enormous study to assess the Union Army physically
EDL	00:07:04,447	00:07:05,727	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Medically and Mentos
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:10,335	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	And then it explicit obedience to catalyze new science averages
EDL	00:07:10,335	00:07:12,127	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Calculated and reported
EDL	00:07:12,127	00:07:15,199	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	They actually say basically we're following
EDL	00:07:15,199	00:07:16,991	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	The father of this new field cantlay
EDL	00:07:16,991	00:07:19,295	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Bees freshly calculated averages
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:21,343	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Informed the distributions of food ration
EDL	00:07:21,855	00:07:22,879	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	And the design of weapon
EDL	00:07:23,391	00:07:25,695	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	For example if you were going to create muskets
EDL	00:07:25,695	00:07:27,743	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Well how far is the trigger
EDL	00:07:27,743	00:07:32,351	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	And you could actually calculate average reach for Soldier this also affected military uniform
EDL	00:07:32,351	00:07:37,471	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Switch used to be all custom sound but in the Civil War so many people had to be outfitted
EDL	00:07:37,471	00:07:40,287	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	The custom uniforms would be impossibly expensive
EDL	00:07:40,799	00:07:42,591	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	So the uniforms had be mass-produced
EDL	00:07:43,103	00:07:45,407	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	But they couldn't be just all one big floppy size
EDL	00:07:45,919	00:07:47,711	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	And so now they're letting go
EDL	00:07:47,711	00:07:49,759	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Will you know if you break it into into subtypes
EDL	00:07:54,367	00:07:56,927	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Broad shoulders small medium large
EDL	00:07:56,927	00:08:00,511	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	That's going to carry over into the way they think about the mass production of clothing
EDL	00:08:00,511	00:08:03,327	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Yep the sizes small medium and large
EDL	00:08:03,327	00:08:04,607	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Which might be on your T-shirt tag
EDL	00:08:05,375	00:08:07,423	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Those came out of this massive Civil War
EDL	00:08:08,191	00:08:10,495	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	So you can thank cataleya and Lincoln for that
EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:16,127	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	This study in the Civil War was the basis for the American military's long-standing philosophy
EDL	00:08:16,127	00:08:16,895	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Standardized
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:20,479	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Average base design design philosophy
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:22,527	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	From the Civil War forward
EDL	00:08:23,551	00:08:24,831	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	So in 1926
EDL	00:08:25,343	00:08:26,879	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	When the Army was designing it
EDL	00:08:26,879	00:08:28,159	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	First ever fighter plane
EDL	00:08:28,927	00:08:30,975	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Engineers measure the physical dimensions
EDL	00:08:30,975	00:08:32,255	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Hundreds of male Pilots
EDL	00:08:32,767	00:08:34,559	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	And use this data to standardize cockpit
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:37,119	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Quite the possibility of female pilot
EDL	00:08:37,631	00:08:38,143	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Never considered
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:42,239	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	The size and shape of the seat that distance the pedals
EDL	00:08:42,239	00:08:43,775	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Stick hide the windshield
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:48,895	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Even the shape of the flight helmets were all made to conform to the average 1920s male pilot
EDL	00:08:49,407	00:08:51,199	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Change the way the pilots were select
EDL	00:08:51,711	00:08:55,039	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	You basically then select people that fit into that and then exclude people that died
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:57,599	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Design works okay
EDL	00:08:57,599	00:08:59,391	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Up to World War II
EDL	00:08:59,391	00:09:01,183	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	What happened was though is that
EDL	00:09:01,183	00:09:02,207	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	In World War II
EDL	00:09:02,975	00:09:03,999	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	It became
EDL	00:09:03,999	00:09:08,351	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	An Air Force War right after the first time when the air force would be the determinant of
EDL	00:09:08,351	00:09:09,375	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Who is going to win the war
EDL	00:09:09,887	00:09:12,191	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	And we we actually ran out of Pilots
EDL	00:09:12,703	00:09:15,519	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	The government recruited hundreds of new pilots
EDL	00:09:15,519	00:09:17,311	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	An expanded military Aviation
EDL	00:09:17,823	00:09:20,383	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	It's been a bunch of money on fancy new planes
EDL	00:09:20,895	00:09:21,663	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Although
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:22,431	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	The cockpit
EDL	00:09:22,431	00:09:25,247	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	We're still design for the average 1920s male
EDL	00:09:26,527	00:09:29,855	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	And this new big bad military force was going to fly to fast
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:30,623	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Listen to highest
EDL	00:09:31,135	00:09:31,903	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Be the best
EDL	00:09:32,927	00:09:37,023	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	But that's not what happened they actually had a pretty massive decline in
EDL	00:09:37,023	00:09:37,791	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Performance
EDL	00:09:37,791	00:09:39,071	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Including to the rash
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:42,143	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Pilots were dying all the time
EDL	00:09:42,911	00:09:49,055	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Even after the war ended just in training they could not control airplanes it became kind of part of the culture of the
EDL	00:09:50,079	00:09:51,871	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	It's just really dangerous to fly
EDL	00:09:51,871	00:09:53,663	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	No one knew what was going on
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:59,807	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Some people thought propeller planes anymore maybe these new pilots just can't deal with the new aviation technology
EDL	00:10:00,319	00:10:04,927	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	And then they were like well maybe you got to train them better and they did their better training programs and that didn't work
EDL	00:10:04,927	00:10:06,207	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	After blaming the pilot
EDL	00:10:06,207	00:10:07,999	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	The training programs in the technology
EDL	00:10:08,511	00:10:10,047	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Finally dawned on them
EDL	00:10:10,047	00:10:11,327	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	What is the cockpit
EDL	00:10:11,839	00:10:13,375	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Maybe it doesn't this anymore
EDL	00:10:13,375	00:10:15,167	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Their first instinct is to think
EDL	00:10:15,935	00:10:22,079	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	We just got bigger the people so the old average for 1922 is just too small right which is bigger and badder
EDL	00:10:24,895	00:10:28,735	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	So in 1950 researchers at Wright Air Force Base in Ohio
EDL	00:10:29,247	00:10:31,295	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Tasked with finding this new average
EDL	00:10:32,063	00:10:33,343	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	And one of those researchers
EDL	00:10:33,855	00:10:36,159	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	With a man named Gilbert s Daniels
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:42,559	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Daniels was a Harvard graduate could written his thesis on the average sizes of his classmates hands
EDL	00:10:43,071	00:10:44,607	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	It was 23 years old
EDL	00:10:44,607	00:10:46,655	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Small skinny nerdy
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:48,447	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Not a military man at all
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:51,007	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	And he travels all the countries are Air Force bases
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:53,823	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	And his job is to take these tape measures
EDL	00:10:53,823	00:10:57,151	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	And just measure like 147 different dimensions
EDL	00:10:58,687	00:11:02,783	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Tedious job ever and is Daniel's is traveling around
EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:05,343	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	From Base to Base measuring thousands of Airmen
EDL	00:11:05,343	00:11:06,623	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	He's realizing this
EDL	00:11:06,623	00:11:08,671	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Portable variability from person to person
EDL	00:11:09,183	00:11:11,999	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Even within this limited demographic of young men
EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:14,815	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	As he was measuring hands and legs and waist
EDL	00:11:14,815	00:11:15,327	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	4 heads
EDL	00:11:16,095	00:11:17,119	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Daniel kept asking him
EDL	00:11:17,887	00:11:19,935	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	How many Pilots were actually average
EDL	00:11:20,703	00:11:21,471	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	So he reports back
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:23,519	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	So he goes limited like I think
EDL	00:11:24,031	00:11:26,847	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	I can get a problem with the average and he says I just want to do this
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:31,967	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Decide study I want to know if we take the 10 dimensions of size that matter most
EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:33,247	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	For design
EDL	00:11:33,247	00:11:34,783	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Like save shoulder-width
EDL	00:11:34,783	00:11:35,551	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	I8
EDL	00:11:35,551	00:11:37,087	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Chest circumference sleeve length
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:40,159	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	How many of these Pilots are actually average
EDL	00:11:42,207	00:11:43,487	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Daniel's crunch the numbers
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:47,071	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Andaba 4063 Pilots he measured
EDL	00:11:47,583	00:11:48,351	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Not
EDL	00:11:48,351	00:11:49,119	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Single Airmen
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:50,911	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Was close to average
EDL	00:11:51,423	00:11:52,191	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	In all of the
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:52,703	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	The 10 dimensions
EDL	00:11:53,727	00:11:54,495	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Naughty
EDL	00:11:54,495	00:11:55,007	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Not one
EDL	00:11:55,519	00:11:58,079	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	And it got even worse like if you just used
EDL	00:11:58,079	00:11:59,359	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Three dimensions of
EDL	00:11:59,359	00:12:00,127	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Size
EDL	00:12:00,127	00:12:02,175	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Less than 5% of the pilots were hours
EDL	00:12:03,455	00:12:05,247	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	So he quickly realizes like
EDL	00:12:05,247	00:12:06,783	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Wait now you know the problem
EDL	00:12:06,783	00:12:09,599	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	If you are designing something for an average
EDL	00:12:09,599	00:12:11,647	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Pilot it's literally designed if it nobody
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:14,719	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	And in this new era of jet-powered Aviation
EDL	00:12:14,719	00:12:18,303	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Four Pilots were making split-second decisions that could be life or death
EDL	00:12:18,303	00:12:21,887	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	It really matter that Pilots could reach what they needed to reach in the cockpit
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:24,447	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	The military spring2action pretty much right away
EDL	00:12:25,215	00:12:26,751	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	For the military
EDL	00:12:26,751	00:12:28,031	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Three willing to
EDL	00:12:28,543	00:12:30,335	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Basically drop generations of
EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:36,223	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Design philosophy right it doesn't take them more than a few years to just be like you can't design an hour today
EDL	00:12:36,991	00:12:42,367	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Air Force engineers and contractors designed adjustable foot pedals and adjustable helmet straps and flight suit
EDL	00:12:42,367	00:12:43,391	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Adjustable seats
EDL	00:12:43,391	00:12:45,951	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	I just can't believe that we are building plans with no adjustable seat
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:52,863	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	That's how much faith we had in the average person once all the adjustable elements another design Solutions were put into place
EDL	00:12:52,863	00:12:54,143	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Pilot performance
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:12:54,911	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Sword
EDL	00:12:54,911	00:12:56,959	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Of course now we take this for granted
EDL	00:12:57,471	00:13:00,031	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	What equipment should fit a wide range of body sizes
EDL	00:13:00,543	00:13:02,591	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Instead of standardized around 1 Ave
EDL	00:13:03,103	00:13:05,919	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	You wouldn't buy a car
EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:10,783	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Crazy and it seeps into their pretty quickly in terms of automobiles
EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:11,807	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	And then you see
EDL	00:13:11,807	00:13:13,855	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	What's interesting is the whole idea of
EDL	00:13:13,855	00:13:14,623	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Ergonomics
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:16,415	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	That all comes off of the street at
EDL	00:13:17,183	00:13:19,743	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	What word jump-starts the science of ergonomics
EDL	00:13:19,743	00:13:21,535	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Text which is not just for officer
EDL	00:13:22,047	00:13:24,095	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Well it's really the study of work
EDL	00:13:24,095	00:13:25,119	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Is what you
EDL	00:13:25,119	00:13:25,631	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	You could boil it down
EDL	00:13:26,143	00:13:28,959	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	But it really is a matter of matching
EDL	00:13:28,959	00:13:29,471	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	In people's
EDL	00:13:30,751	00:13:31,519	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Capacity
EDL	00:13:31,519	00:13:34,335	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	To the job this is Professor Carissa Harris Adamson
EDL	00:13:34,847	00:13:37,663	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Director of the UCSF UC Berkeley ergonomics
EDL	00:13:37,663	00:13:38,431	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Program
EDL	00:13:38,431	00:13:39,199	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	It's
EDL	00:13:39,199	00:13:42,015	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Really important not to go with the average
EDL	00:13:42,015	00:13:42,783	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	A lot of the time
EDL	00:13:42,783	00:13:44,319	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	If we want to
EDL	00:13:44,319	00:13:45,599	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Incorporates a handle
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:49,695	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Well we'll look up anthropometry data and
EDL	00:13:49,695	00:13:51,231	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Make sure we identify
EDL	00:13:51,231	00:13:51,743	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Span
EDL	00:13:53,791	00:13:55,071	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Or if we're designing
EDL	00:13:55,839	00:13:58,143	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Crank and we wanted to be at a certain height
EDL	00:13:58,143	00:13:59,423	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Then we will go back to them
EDL	00:13:59,935	00:14:00,959	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Data and figure out
EDL	00:14:01,471	00:14:02,751	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	What makes the most sense
EDL	00:14:02,751	00:14:03,519	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	To accommodate
EDL	00:14:05,311	00:14:07,103	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Keeping in mind that in the US
EDL	00:14:07,103	00:14:09,151	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Most of the measurements we base our designs on
EDL	00:14:09,663	00:14:10,431	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Still
EDL	00:14:10,431	00:14:11,199	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Company USR
EDL	00:14:11,967	00:14:12,735	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Not
EDL	00:14:12,735	00:14:13,759	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Primarily the
EDL	00:14:13,759	00:14:14,527	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	The source that we use
EDL	00:14:15,039	00:14:15,807	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	And
EDL	00:14:15,807	00:14:17,087	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Say ergonomic bucks or when
EDL	00:14:18,879	00:14:21,695	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	What we found is that those numbers are actually all
EDL	00:14:22,463	00:14:24,255	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Pretty representative today
EDL	00:14:24,255	00:14:25,791	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Except for weight
EDL	00:14:25,791	00:14:26,815	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	An abdominal girth
EDL	00:14:26,815	00:14:30,399	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Which is part of why the world is so hard for heavier people to navigate
EDL	00:14:30,911	00:14:32,447	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	The military might be considered a more fit pop
EDL	00:14:32,959	00:14:33,727	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	And then the rest
EDL	00:14:35,007	00:14:37,055	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	So does this mean that like military measurement
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:37,823	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Affect
EDL	00:14:37,823	00:14:38,591	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	The way our cars are
EDL	00:14:39,615	00:14:40,383	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Absolutely
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:43,455	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	The measurements of our military personnel over the years
EDL	00:14:43,455	00:14:44,479	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Sfax just about
EDL	00:14:45,247	00:14:47,295	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Military measurements are the most
EDL	00:14:48,831	00:14:50,111	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	And they work okay
EDL	00:14:50,111	00:14:51,135	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	You're not perfect
EDL	00:14:51,135	00:14:52,415	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Sure but they're getting more
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:56,255	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	They've done a really good job in a company name or the population
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:14:56,767	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Given that women are
EDL	00:14:57,535	00:14:58,303	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Now very
EDL	00:14:58,303	00:14:59,071	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Vibrant part
EDL	00:14:59,583	00:15:00,095	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Of our military
EDL	00:15:00,607	00:15:03,423	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	When the military opted to design for a greater range of
EDL	00:15:03,423	00:15:06,239	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	People they designed for a greater range of opportunity
EDL	00:15:06,751	00:15:07,775	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Take for example
EDL	00:15:07,775	00:15:08,543	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Kim Campbell
EDL	00:15:09,567	00:15:11,615	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	She was a fighter pilot
EDL	00:15:11,615	00:15:12,383	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	And
EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:13,663	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	She flew
EDL	00:15:13,663	00:15:18,015	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	A A-10 Warthog in it's worth Googling it is like the baddest looking
EDL	00:15:18,015	00:15:19,295	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Playing you're ever going to see
EDL	00:15:19,807	00:15:22,623	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	That's tyros Again by the way helping us tell the story
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:23,903	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Captain Campbell
EDL	00:15:23,903	00:15:29,535	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	In 2003 Campbell was sent on a mission to assess submarines who are trying to take a bridge in a rock
EDL	00:15:29,535	00:15:31,071	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	They were under heavy fire
EDL	00:15:31,583	00:15:33,119	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	But either way back or playing
EDL	00:15:33,119	00:15:33,887	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Shot
EDL	00:15:33,887	00:15:35,167	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	And she loses all control
EDL	00:15:36,191	00:15:37,471	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	She has the option
EDL	00:15:37,471	00:15:38,239	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	2
EDL	00:15:38,239	00:15:39,007	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Big Jack
EDL	00:15:39,007	00:15:41,055	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Right there and save her life but then the plane
EDL	00:15:41,567	00:15:42,847	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Spirals into Baghdad
EDL	00:15:42,847	00:15:43,359	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	I didn't kill too much
EDL	00:15:45,663	00:15:48,223	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	She stabilized what I don't know how you do
EDL	00:15:48,223	00:15:49,759	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	And she flies back and then she says
EDL	00:15:50,271	00:15:51,295	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	I think I can land This Plane
EDL	00:15:52,063	00:15:55,135	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	And she lands the massive damage.
EDL	00:15:55,135	00:15:56,159	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Uncontrollable playing
EDL	00:15:56,671	00:15:58,207	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	It's an incredible heroic theme
EDL	00:15:58,719	00:15:59,487	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Really I'm president
EDL	00:16:00,255	00:16:02,815	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Of course Kim Campbell get Awards and distinctions
EDL	00:16:03,327	00:16:06,911	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	And she is someone who could have never been one of the best
EDL	00:16:06,911	00:16:07,679	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Pilots in the world
EDL	00:16:08,191	00:16:10,751	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Had the military not change their design philosophy
EDL	00:16:11,519	00:16:13,567	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	She's the beneficiary of a cockpit
EDL	00:16:13,567	00:16:14,591	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Wesley design

EDL	00:16:17,407	00:16:19,967	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	And don't look anything remotely close to an average sized pile
EDL	00:16:20,479	00:16:25,343	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	When Kim gets into a cockpit she has to put the seat all the way up and pull the pedals
EDL	00:16:25,343	00:16:26,367	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	All the way out
EDL	00:16:26,879	00:16:27,903	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	But it fits
EDL	00:16:27,903	00:16:30,975	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Does idea of equal fit as the foundation for How We Do

EDL	00:16:35,839	00:16:36,607	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	In this concept
EDL	00:16:37,119	00:16:38,655	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	That's it makes opportunity
EDL	00:16:39,423	00:16:40,447	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	It's an important one for
EDL	00:16:41,215	00:16:44,031	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Because he believes that we can design environments
EDL	00:16:44,031	00:16:45,823	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Equipment and even entire system
EDL	00:16:46,847	00:16:48,383	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	To accommodate more and more
EDL	00:16:49,151	00:16:51,455	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	When we think about how we design environment
EDL	00:16:51,967	00:16:53,503	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	You know in a lot of fields
EDL	00:16:53,503	00:16:55,295	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	We made some progress around
EDL	00:16:55,295	00:16:56,575	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Accommodating wider range
EDL	00:16:56,575	00:17:00,159	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	The people but actually in things like education we still actually design
EDL	00:17:00,159	00:17:02,207	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	For this mythical average person
EDL	00:17:02,207	00:17:06,815	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Under the assumption that if you design something that fit an average person it would actually fit most
EDL	00:17:06,815	00:17:07,327	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	People
EDL	00:17:07,839	00:17:10,655	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	By re-examining the concept of the average
EDL	00:17:10,655	00:17:12,191	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	Etymology its limitations
EDL	00:17:12,191	00:17:17,055	| 99pi-0226-onaverage-1 |	We can maybe start to consider other ways of assessing and categorizing test scores
