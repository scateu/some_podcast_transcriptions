EDL	00:08:55,551	00:09:01,695	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	Worley said that besides some local coverage when the guys went up there wasn't that much fanfare around the contest in the beginning
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:06,047	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	Even though wsan had launched the contest as a kind of promotion
EDL	00:09:06,047	00:09:09,375	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	They didn't do the best job of promoting it with other media Outlet

EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:14,239	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	There was
EDL	00:09:15,007	00:09:18,079	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	Mention on the other radio stations that they might have listened to

EDL	00:09:24,223	00:09:27,295	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	Become additions on the billboard were pretty bare-bones
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:28,575	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	Each guy had a small tent

EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:34,207	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	Which is kind of like a tiny porta potty
EDL	00:09:34,719	00:09:35,999	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	It was almost like camping
EDL	00:09:36,511	00:09:38,303	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	Only you were 30 feet in the air
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:39,839	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	Surrounded by freeway traffic

EDL	00:09:41,887	00:09:44,447	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	We made the guys comfortable we didn't torture own
EDL	00:09:44,447	00:09:46,495	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	Everything going on in there
EDL	00:09:47,007	00:09:49,567	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	The billboard platform itself was about 8 ft
EDL	00:09:49,567	00:09:50,079	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	By 48
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:52,639	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	And it has been divided into three
EDL	00:09:52,639	00:09:53,407	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	Cool sections
EDL	00:09:53,407	00:09:54,687	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	My waist high partition
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:10:00,319	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	The organizers at wsan wanted to contest the last long enough to draw some attention
EDL	00:10:00,319	00:10:01,087	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	But not
EDL	00:10:01,087	00:10:01,599	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	Forever
EDL	00:10:02,367	00:10:05,439	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	I figured that by discouraging interaction between the contestants
EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:07,999	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	They might keep the whole thing to a reasonable length
EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:09,023	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	And we didn't talk
EDL	00:10:09,023	00:10:09,535	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	At all
EDL	00:10:11,583	00:10:13,119	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	I don't know what we said hi to each other
EDL	00:10:13,631	00:10:19,007	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	But even if the guys weren't encouraged to interact with each other they still had plenty of people to keep them company
EDL	00:10:19,519	00:10:20,031	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	From a distance

EDL	00:15:38,495	00:15:40,031	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	All for a chance to win a home
EDL	00:15:40,543	00:15:42,335	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	There was something dystopian
EDL	00:15:42,335	00:15:42,847	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	About it
EDL	00:15:43,615	00:15:45,919	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	I mean the American dream was really shaky at the
EDL	00:15:46,943	00:15:51,039	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	Name all the guys in the billboard never said they felt excluded by the radio station
EDL	00:15:51,039	00:15:53,599	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	An air of desperation did begin to
EDL	00:15:53,599	00:15:56,415	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	Seep into the contact as the months went by

EDL	00:16:04,607	00:16:05,887	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	Probably 2 years

EDL	00:16:10,751	00:16:11,775	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	Some summer person
EDL	00:16:12,287	00:16:14,591	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	They asked us how long we would stay up there and I said
EDL	00:16:15,103	00:16:16,639	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	Two or three years
EDL	00:16:17,151	00:16:18,687	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	Then I really mad at you and I was I was just

EDL	00:16:21,503	00:16:24,063	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	In order to save enough to get an $18,000 home
EDL	00:16:24,831	00:16:26,367	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	What would I be willing to invest
EDL	00:16:26,367	00:16:26,879	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	Time
EDL	00:16:27,391	00:16:28,159	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	Two to three years
EDL	00:16:29,439	00:16:32,767	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	When December and January arrived it started getting colder
EDL	00:16:33,279	00:16:36,351	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	Lowest recorded temperature was 0 degrees Fahrenheit
EDL	00:16:36,351	00:16:38,143	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	So the guys were getting portable heaters

EDL	00:16:43,775	00:16:45,055	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	They didn't stop the contest
EDL	00:16:45,567	00:16:46,847	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	According to Dalton

EDL	00:17:02,207	00:17:02,975	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	The isolation
EDL	00:17:02,975	00:17:03,999	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	The weather at the border
EDL	00:17:04,511	00:17:06,559	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	They were holding up surprisingly well

EDL	00:17:33,439	00:17:34,207	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	Chatting with the guys
EDL	00:17:34,719	00:17:38,815	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	He casually struck up a conversation with Dalton telling him that he was also a veteran
EDL	00:17:38,815	00:17:43,423	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	We were talking about our experiences in the military and some of the party and we had it done at 9

EDL	00:27:16,352	00:27:18,912	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	So I guess some of those arguments make some sound
EDL	00:27:18,912	00:27:19,680	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	But

EDL	00:28:09,088	00:28:13,696	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	And the absence of ads in general right like sort of the decolorization of the city
EDL	00:28:14,208	00:28:16,512	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	Put a lot of focus on crumbling

EDL	00:28:35,712	00:28:38,016	| 324_Billboard_Boys_The_Greatest_Radio_Contest_of_All_Time_pt01 |	And a lot of building owners ended up repeating their facade
