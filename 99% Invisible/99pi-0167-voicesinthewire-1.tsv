EDL	00:06:39,359	00:06:42,687	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	Frank Conrad was among the first to use the word broadcasting

EDL	00:07:13,919	00:07:15,199	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	Then a man named Rick Harris

EDL	00:07:40,031	00:07:41,567	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	Really begins with that victrola
EDL	00:07:42,591	00:07:44,383	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	Conrad was an engineer for Westinghouse

EDL	00:07:49,247	00:07:50,527	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	But at the time
EDL	00:07:50,527	00:07:52,319	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	ConEd wasn't thinking about Broadcasting
EDL	00:07:53,087	00:07:55,903	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	He was simply trying to test and improve his transmitting it
EDL	00:07:56,927	00:08:00,767	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	The problem was his voice after talking endless hours
EDL	00:08:00,767	00:08:03,071	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	Into the microphone would wear out so
EDL	00:08:03,071	00:08:07,423	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	He got the idea one day to put on a record that would give him two or three minutes
EDL	00:08:07,423	00:08:09,983	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	To adjust his equipment and would save his voice
EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:15,871	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	This one is an ancient one so I don't know what it's going to sound like though
EDL	00:08:16,383	00:08:22,783	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	And as soon as he started playing the music
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:25,343	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	Began getting requests for
EDL	00:08:25,343	00:08:31,743	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	More music and he would get phone calls and letters asking him to play a certain song at a certain time so some
EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:38,143	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	Someone listening with their crystal said could convince the relative that you could actually play music over the air
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:42,495	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	He found very quickly that there was an unseen audience out there
EDL	00:08:43,519	00:08:49,919	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	England call me up at 9
EDL	00:08:49,919	00:08:51,455	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	This is Frank Conrad
EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:54,527	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	Recorded in the late 1930s not long before
EDL	00:08:54,527	00:08:55,295	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	He died
EDL	00:08:55,295	00:08:56,831	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	Anybody got do it
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:08:59,647	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	The program
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:01,439	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	Everyone's in Saturday night
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:05,791	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	Places that time and I had no idea what
EDL	00:09:06,559	00:09:10,911	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	Overtime Conrad garage starting to sound more like a radio station
EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:16,031	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	Along with phonograph records Conrad would transmit piano solos by family members
EDL	00:09:16,031	00:09:17,055	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	Baseball scores
EDL	00:09:17,823	00:09:22,175	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	And then when he started to run out of Records to play Conrad went to the Hamilton music store
EDL	00:09:22,175	00:09:23,967	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	That's if he could borrow some for his broadcast
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:28,575	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	The owner said yes as long as Conrad agreed to announce the name of the store on the air
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:33,951	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	So the Conrad was building the one thing the radio industry hadn't yet thought much about
EDL	00:09:33,951	00:09:34,719	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	An audience
EDL	00:09:35,743	00:09:38,815	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	But the real Turning Point came on September 29th 1920
EDL	00:09:39,327	00:09:42,655	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	When did Joseph Horne department store place this ad in the Pittsburgh Sun

EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:11,327	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	Diane really caught the attention of Conrad's boss at Westinghouse Amman
EDL	00:10:11,327	00:10:13,119	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	By the name of Harry Davis who
EDL	00:10:13,631	00:10:16,191	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	Add to Story Goes called Conrad in the next day
EDL	00:10:16,703	00:10:17,727	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	And said
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:20,287	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	Essentially I would like to put you out of business
EDL	00:10:20,287	00:10:21,055	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	Because
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:21,823	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	I would like
EDL	00:10:21,823	00:10:24,639	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	Westinghouse to set up its own station
EDL	00:10:24,639	00:10:25,151	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	And
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:27,455	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	I Davis ask Conrad
EDL	00:10:27,455	00:10:29,503	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	Could that be done in Conrad set of course
EDL	00:10:30,271	00:10:35,903	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	So over the next month Conrad and his team began constructing a wooden Shack on the roof of the Westinghouse plant
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:38,463	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	They built a 100 watt transmitter
EDL	00:10:39,231	00:10:42,303	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	And at 6 p.m. on the night of November 2nd 1920
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:45,119	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	The newly-licensed station KDKA
EDL	00:10:45,631	00:10:46,143	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	When on the air

EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:15,327	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	We'd appreciate it if anyone hearing this broadcast would communicate with us
EDL	00:11:15,839	00:11:18,911	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	We are very anxious to know how far the broadcast is reaching
EDL	00:11:19,679	00:11:20,959	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	And how it is being received
EDL	00:11:21,471	00:11:26,335	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	Well nobody's ever heard of such a thing before you had to wait till next day to find out who won the election
EDL	00:11:26,847	00:11:29,151	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	Henry Mills who is 13 by this time
EDL	00:11:29,663	00:11:32,991	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	Remembers going down to the local newspaper where they had set up a receiving station
EDL	00:11:33,759	00:11:40,159	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	Somebody would sit at the receiver and a crowd gathered outside or number of people and they would watch TV
EDL	00:11:40,159	00:11:43,231	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	Returns being updated as the numbers came in bigger
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:48,095	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	The next day in the newspaper of course the talk was G for the first time
EDL	00:11:48,607	00:11:52,959	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	Ever people were able to get the reports before the newspaper was printed
EDL	00:11:53,471	00:11:55,775	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	I think it's very difficult for us
EDL	00:11:55,775	00:11:57,311	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	Today to imagine
EDL	00:11:57,311	00:12:00,383	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	Really quite what a magical moment this was
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:05,247	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	Susan Douglas is a professor at the University of Michigan and the author of inventing American Broadcasting

EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:09,599	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	What's a watershed event
EDL	00:12:09,599	00:12:12,671	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	And because there were no connecting wires because
EDL	00:12:12,671	00:12:15,231	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	There was a concept of The Ether
EDL	00:12:15,231	00:12:18,303	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	It was kind of a cosmic connection for people with a
EDL	00:12:18,303	00:12:23,167	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	Quasi sort of spiritual event that these voices were coming out of the air

EDL	00:12:41,599	00:12:42,879	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	And into the living room

EDL	00:13:29,471	00:13:33,055	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	The more I learn about Frank Conrad and what he did and
EDL	00:13:33,055	00:13:36,383	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	The fact that he was virtually unknown outside of Pittsburgh
EDL	00:13:36,895	00:13:38,431	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	Just something
EDL	00:13:38,431	00:13:42,271	| 99pi-0167-voicesinthewire-1 |	It feels that he's been overlooked for what he did
