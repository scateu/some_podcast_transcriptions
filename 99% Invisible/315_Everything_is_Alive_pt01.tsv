EDL	00:01:46,496	00:01:52,640	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Delete weird well the show is called Everything Is Alive and it's an interview show
EDL	00:01:52,640	00:01:55,968	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	In which all the subjects are inanimate object
EDL	00:01:56,480	00:01:58,528	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	So I talk to things
EDL	00:02:01,088	00:02:03,136	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	So what made you want to do a show like this
EDL	00:02:03,136	00:02:04,928	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Well a couple things like
EDL	00:02:04,928	00:02:06,464	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	One I think it's just like
EDL	00:02:07,744	00:02:11,072	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	We just sort of think this way like you know
EDL	00:02:11,072	00:02:12,352	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	I'd get up from a chair and
EDL	00:02:12,864	00:02:13,888	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Think about
EDL	00:02:13,888	00:02:14,656	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	What a
EDL	00:02:14,656	00:02:17,472	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Terrible job the chair had and liked
EDL	00:02:17,472	00:02:23,616	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	And like how the chair must feel about being sad on all the time and then I think
EDL	00:02:23,616	00:02:25,664	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Producing for so long
EDL	00:02:26,176	00:02:27,712	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	You're always trying to get to like the

EDL	00:02:28,736	00:02:29,248	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	You know
EDL	00:02:30,016	00:02:31,808	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	And my girls looking for experts
EDL	00:02:32,576	00:02:35,136	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	I thought it would be really fun if like
EDL	00:02:36,416	00:02:36,928	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	You know your
EDL	00:02:37,440	00:02:38,720	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Putting the other piece about
EDL	00:02:38,720	00:02:42,304	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Rainbows or whatever and like rather than talk to the
EDL	00:02:42,304	00:02:44,096	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Physicist to understand rainbows
EDL	00:02:44,096	00:02:46,400	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	If you could actually talk to the rainbow
EDL	00:02:46,400	00:02:47,680	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Tuff Stuff County idea
EDL	00:02:48,704	00:02:54,848	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	I know that was going to deny 10% invisible are fully capable of accepting that even the most mundane objects are
EDL	00:02:54,848	00:02:58,944	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Infuse with great meaning and can say something about us as humans but
EDL	00:02:59,456	00:03:05,856	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	You may not be prepared for that object to actually talk so I asked me in for a primer on how to listen to everything is a lie
EDL	00:03:05,856	00:03:10,208	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	You know if I was talking to a candle say like a bedroom candle
EDL	00:03:10,720	00:03:12,000	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Like it's not
EDL	00:03:12,512	00:03:15,840	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Every candle it's not speaking for every candle
EDL	00:03:15,840	00:03:19,680	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	It is one candle that is sad on one night stand forever
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:20,448	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	And like
EDL	00:03:20,448	00:03:26,848	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Been blown out by one person forever and has a relationship with that person they're kind of aware of their
EDL	00:03:26,848	00:03:30,432	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Object communities like it knows more about candles than
EDL	00:03:30,432	00:03:30,944	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	We do
EDL	00:03:31,456	00:03:34,016	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	It also has like a very distinct
EDL	00:03:34,016	00:03:35,296	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Lifetime of experiences
EDL	00:03:36,064	00:03:38,368	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	But the things that says are all
EDL	00:03:38,368	00:03:40,928	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Actual I think I was surprised by that when I first heard
EDL	00:03:41,440	00:03:44,000	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	The episodes that I have the same flavor
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:44,768	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Yeah
EDL	00:03:44,768	00:03:46,048	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	They know things
EDL	00:03:46,048	00:03:48,608	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	They know real things about their world
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:50,144	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	For the most part
EDL	00:03:50,912	00:03:52,448	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	They're the
EDL	00:03:52,448	00:03:58,080	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Inanimate object version of the person at the party who like always has an anecdote for everything
EDL	00:03:58,080	00:04:00,896	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	They're very aware of history and
EDL	00:04:00,896	00:04:01,408	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Stories of
EDL	00:04:02,176	00:04:02,688	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	What they are
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:07,040	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	So even though the situation is quite absurd on the face
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:10,112	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	When you hear a fact it's a true fact yeah
EDL	00:04:10,112	00:04:11,648	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	There's so much about
EDL	00:04:11,648	00:04:13,440	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Personal life of the object
EDL	00:04:13,952	00:04:16,512	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	That you know you know isn't
EDL	00:04:16,512	00:04:17,791	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Exactly real
EDL	00:04:17,791	00:04:20,351	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	When I'm telling a story about something real I don't
EDL	00:04:21,375	00:04:24,191	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Yeah I don't tell you what like
EDL	00:04:24,191	00:04:25,215	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	And so
EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:27,775	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	We're just letting the objects behave in the same way until
EDL	00:04:27,775	00:04:30,335	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	There's probably you know there's going to be some mystery and
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:32,127	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Hopefully people will Google +
EDL	00:04:32,639	00:04:33,919	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Figure out if things are real or not
EDL	00:04:34,687	00:04:36,479	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	This is everything is alive
EDL	00:04:36,479	00:04:37,759	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Hosted by in Tagalog

EDL	00:04:57,983	00:05:01,311	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	You want to get my honest opinion I believe in a blind taste test
EDL	00:05:01,823	00:05:06,431	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Your average person wouldn't be able to tell the difference between me and a can of regular Coca-Cola but
EDL	00:05:06,943	00:05:08,991	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Bottom shelf

EDL	00:05:24,863	00:05:29,983	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	I want to ask you about your time before you ended up in the fridge or in now
EDL	00:05:29,983	00:05:33,823	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	So you are you I take it were you were in a supermarket

EDL	00:05:41,759	00:05:44,831	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	We were all purchased together and actually
EDL	00:05:44,831	00:05:45,855	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Our next
EDL	00:05:46,367	00:05:50,207	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Residence was a bowling alley for a 12 year old's birthday party
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:55,583	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	I saw most of the rest of my case drunk at that party
EDL	00:05:56,095	00:05:56,863	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	I was not drunk
EDL	00:05:57,631	00:06:01,215	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	I was saved for later and brought home and put into refrigerator
EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:04,287	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	And then forgotten about for a few months placed in the back of fridge
EDL	00:06:04,799	00:06:05,567	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Sure
EDL	00:06:06,335	00:06:08,127	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	I froze in the fridge
EDL	00:06:08,639	00:06:14,271	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	I was in the very back and the temperature got very cold I didn't freeze all the way through but
EDL	00:06:14,783	00:06:16,575	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	I had a frozen couple of weeks
EDL	00:06:16,575	00:06:17,343	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Pretty learn
EDL	00:06:17,343	00:06:19,903	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	You are slushy inside always like inside
EDL	00:06:20,415	00:06:21,951	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	And
EDL	00:06:21,951	00:06:26,815	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	I had a brief Adventure when they realize I was still in the fridge and they took me out for a road trip
EDL	00:06:27,327	00:06:28,607	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	I got to sit in the front
EDL	00:06:28,607	00:06:30,399	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Seat cup holder you know
EDL	00:06:30,911	00:06:31,935	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	And I took a little
EDL	00:06:31,935	00:06:35,775	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Fun road trip down to Florida and then back again
EDL	00:06:35,775	00:06:40,127	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	I never got around to drinking me on that trip then they put me back in the fridge and that's where I've been ever since
EDL	00:06:41,407	00:06:44,479	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	It sounds like you were almost chosen so many times
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:48,575	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	What does it feel like when your play at this birthday party
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:49,599	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	And
EDL	00:06:50,367	00:06:51,647	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	You're waiting for your moment

EDL	00:07:11,359	00:07:16,735	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	He's waiting to be picked off and he's waiting and having that long dark night and one by one is in his friends go
EDL	00:07:17,503	00:07:19,551	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	That's kind of what it was like for me
EDL	00:07:20,319	00:07:26,463	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Irvine and on the one hand I was very angry at you and being sore being in this position to consume us
EDL	00:07:26,975	00:07:31,071	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	And then on the other hand I was also very angry how come you didn't want to consume me
EDL	00:07:32,095	00:07:32,607	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Yeah
EDL	00:07:34,143	00:07:37,471	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	When you when you think about being consumed by human
EDL	00:07:37,471	00:07:40,031	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Do you think about the human that you want to be in
EDL	00:07:42,079	00:07:46,431	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	If and when I'm finally consumed I hope I'm consumed by someone who enjoys
EDL	00:07:47,711	00:07:54,111	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	But I like to imagine that if you're drunk immediately that instead of be
EDL	00:07:54,111	00:08:00,511	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Being a painful process there's the sort of first moment of release the can is cracked open
EDL	00:08:00,511	00:08:06,911	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	All of this internal fizzing that I have going on finally
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:13,311	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Somewhere to go just for them to round out
EDL	00:08:13,311	00:08:19,711	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Your external can we have that last moment where you're feeling to purpose and beginning to
EDL	00:08:19,711	00:08:26,111	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Blend in with his human being and you become part of their story
EDL	00:08:26,111	00:08:32,511	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Truthfully here's how I expect to go assuming that I am
EDL	00:08:32,511	00:08:38,911	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Consumed I'm expecting it's going to happen
EDL	00:08:38,911	00:08:45,055	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Blow the night we're not waiting for it and someone's going to open the fridge and pull me out and that'll be that
EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:52,479	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	It would be nice to be poured into a nice big pint glass you know
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:56,831	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Frosty mug would be pretty good way to go happy Pleasant you know
EDL	00:08:58,111	00:09:04,255	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	I doubt that's going to happen though they don't Reserve Frosty mugs for gotu Kola so that's just another one of those Facts of Life
EDL	00:09:10,143	00:09:11,935	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	How did you see jaws

EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:38,047	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Scolded him on not drinking soft drinks by pulling back in the fridge

EDL	00:15:25,695	00:15:32,095	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	I guess I'm a human being terms to be like a rush of adrenaline and for a while you're feeling just very
EDL	00:15:32,095	00:15:33,631	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Reverse
EDL	00:15:34,143	00:15:35,423	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Hyper after the shakeup
EDL	00:15:36,191	00:15:41,055	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	And then you start this recovery Saddleback to a neutral state but you have this awful kind of nauseous
EDL	00:15:41,055	00:15:43,359	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	City sleepy feeling after the fact
EDL	00:15:43,871	00:15:45,151	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	And you feel kind of
EDL	00:15:45,151	00:15:51,551	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Dumb you know the shake up kind of like rattles you a little bit and takes a little bit of time for your intelligence to come to come back to you with an offer
EDL	00:15:51,551	00:15:52,063	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Experience
EDL	00:15:52,831	00:15:55,903	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Imagine two like we often after that happens
EDL	00:15:56,415	00:15:57,695	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	We will tap on
EDL	00:15:57,695	00:15:58,719	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	What would be your head
EDL	00:15:59,231	00:15:59,743	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Don't
EDL	00:16:00,255	00:16:01,791	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Doesn't do anything
EDL	00:16:03,071	00:16:08,447	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	There's no reason to do it it doesn't do anything to the carbonation all it does is Annoy Us in a very sensitive moment
EDL	00:16:09,727	00:16:11,007	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Don't do that
EDL	00:16:11,007	00:16:17,407	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	You're listening to everything is alive on 99percentinvisible
EDL	00:16:17,407	00:16:18,943	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	This might be
EDL	00:16:18,943	00:16:25,343	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Awkward to talk about but I feel like there's a hierarchy to sodas at least in terms of how humans think about them sure at the
EDL	00:16:25,343	00:16:27,647	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Doctors you know Coke and Pepsi
EDL	00:16:27,647	00:16:30,975	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	And then there's 7Up and Sprite and then there's
EDL	00:16:30,975	00:16:33,791	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Destino like your son casting
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:34,559	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Great
EDL	00:16:34,559	00:16:37,375	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Soda Fanta that are kind of at the
EDL	00:16:37,375	00:16:41,983	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Bottom I wonder if that does that hierarchy does it mean the same thing to you
EDL	00:16:41,983	00:16:43,775	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	But let me tell you something I Fanta
EDL	00:16:44,287	00:16:48,383	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	I mean sure here in the US it's not the most sophisticated soft drink but overseas
EDL	00:16:48,383	00:16:49,407	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Its huge
EDL	00:16:49,407	00:16:50,943	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Vitapan euge
EDL	00:16:50,943	00:16:51,967	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Fanta Fanta
EDL	00:16:52,479	00:16:53,503	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	In Thailand
EDL	00:16:53,503	00:16:57,855	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	It's all over the place if you walk down the street there you'll see half open bottles of fanta everywhere
EDL	00:16:58,367	00:17:01,183	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Strawberry Fanta in particular everywhere just hanging out
EDL	00:17:01,183	00:17:02,975	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Just like sitting on this
EDL	00:17:02,975	00:17:05,023	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	The street yeah just on the street because
EDL	00:17:05,535	00:17:08,351	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Youmans there you Strawberry Fanta as an offering
EDL	00:17:09,375	00:17:10,143	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Two ghosts
EDL	00:17:10,911	00:17:13,983	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	So they leave it out on the street because
EDL	00:17:13,983	00:17:18,591	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	They're giving it to go yes friendly ghosts according to local custom
EDL	00:17:18,591	00:17:20,639	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Love sweet red soda
EDL	00:17:20,639	00:17:24,735	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	So if you leave it out it attracts them and they hang out around your house and protect you from
EDL	00:17:24,735	00:17:26,783	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	I guess whatever unfriendly ghost might come around
EDL	00:17:27,551	00:17:29,343	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Who I guess don't love sweet red soda
EDL	00:17:29,343	00:17:30,111	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Right
EDL	00:17:30,111	00:17:35,487	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Do you know what it is about Strawberry Fanta in particular because of the color
EDL	00:17:35,999	00:17:42,399	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	So there's a theory that it's because I can't do blood offerings anymore until Strawberry Fanta which is another you know red
EDL	00:17:42,399	00:17:48,799	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Viscous liquid will be the next best thing Strawberry Fanta among the sodas available to us looks the most like blood
EDL	00:17:48,799	00:17:51,103	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Yeah which I personally don't see
EDL	00:17:51,103	00:17:53,407	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Okay but you know I tok Thailand thing
EDL	00:17:54,175	00:17:56,223	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	We humans we think a lot about
EDL	00:17:56,991	00:18:03,391	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Spirits or at least you know what might happen to us after we die do you as a cold
EDL	00:18:03,391	00:18:04,927	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Do you think about that
EDL	00:18:04,927	00:18:06,207	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	The afterlife
EDL	00:18:06,719	00:18:07,999	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Yeah oh yeah
EDL	00:18:07,999	00:18:10,047	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	I do not think that all the time yeah
EDL	00:18:12,351	00:18:16,703	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Reaching that age myself are probably not to be around that much longer
EDL	00:18:16,703	00:18:19,007	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	You are a mean you are recyclable
EDL	00:18:19,519	00:18:20,799	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Which opens up a whole other
EDL	00:18:21,311	00:18:22,079	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Conversation
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:24,895	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	You know my my body McCann
EDL	00:18:25,407	00:18:28,223	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Will almost certainly be repurposed
EDL	00:18:28,991	00:18:35,391	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	That leads me to you know ask questions of like well have I already been repurposed I don't know you could have been any number
EDL	00:18:35,391	00:18:41,791	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Sodas or or anything else and airplane I could have been I actually when I was younger I used to have a return
EDL	00:18:41,791	00:18:42,559	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Recurring nightmare
EDL	00:18:43,327	00:18:46,655	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	That I was there was a plane crashing
EDL	00:18:46,655	00:18:48,191	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	There's no trying to be
EDL	00:18:48,191	00:18:52,031	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	And in that it was nighttime and it was raining and there's a plane crashing on the beach
EDL	00:18:53,055	00:18:59,455	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	And I used to like to think that in a previous existence I was part of an airplane and this was some sort of
EDL	00:18:59,455	00:19:03,295	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Memory that had traveled with me maybe as part of like a
EDL	00:19:03,295	00:19:06,367	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Ventilation system on Board of Ed 747 or something

EDL	00:19:18,911	00:19:20,959	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	That I'm sorry
EDL	00:19:21,471	00:19:26,079	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	I'm only saying because I wish I had the answer to this question is there an equivalence yes
EDL	00:19:26,591	00:19:31,967	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Yes the body mind problem that youman beings have been dealing with since the days of Descartes

EDL	00:19:56,543	00:19:57,311	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Yeah
EDL	00:19:57,311	00:20:01,407	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	I don't have an answer but it's something to wrestle with all the time what am I fundamentally

EDL	00:20:12,415	00:20:13,439	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	As far as I know
EDL	00:20:14,975	00:20:19,583	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	I have to say I think I think about the type of can you are with the pull tab
EDL	00:20:20,095	00:20:25,983	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	And then I think about other cans in the kitchen you know like a soup can I know if you know any soup can
EDL	00:20:26,751	00:20:29,055	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	And it occurs to me you are
EDL	00:20:29,823	00:20:30,847	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	So lucky
EDL	00:20:30,847	00:20:32,127	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Because
EDL	00:20:32,639	00:20:35,711	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	You think about the way a soup can gets open
EDL	00:20:35,711	00:20:36,479	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	That
EDL	00:20:36,479	00:20:38,271	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	That I can opener to me
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:40,063	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Seems like a torture device
EDL	00:20:40,831	00:20:47,231	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	It is let me tell you something else to I thank God everyday of my life that I was not born in a can of minute
EDL	00:20:47,231	00:20:47,743	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Macaroni soup
EDL	00:20:49,023	00:20:50,815	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	I at least
EDL	00:20:50,815	00:20:53,375	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	I have lived a life I know where I've been
EDL	00:20:53,375	00:20:59,775	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	You know I'm not all of my dreams may have necessarily come true I may have taken a couple of bad turns here and there
EDL	00:20:59,775	00:21:02,591	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	But at least at the end of the day I've been witness to my own life
EDL	00:21:03,103	00:21:05,663	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	These poor bastards are stuck in the Soup cans
EDL	00:21:05,663	00:21:07,199	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	We talked about hermetically sealed
EDL	00:21:07,711	00:21:11,551	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	They lose all sense of time and perspective when you open a can of soup
EDL	00:21:12,063	00:21:13,087	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	When they wake up
EDL	00:21:13,087	00:21:18,976	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	I have no idea how much time has passed there like astronauts coming out of cryogenic freeze
EDL	00:21:18,976	00:21:25,376	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	They're all spaced out in the completely disoriented they don't know what's going on and their wake-up call is being
EDL	00:21:25,376	00:21:26,400	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Torn open
EDL	00:21:27,168	00:21:30,496	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Buy these damn can opener is what a nightmare of an existence
EDL	00:21:30,496	00:21:34,848	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	The Flash is literally busted open only to wake up into a world that they don't know anything about
EDL	00:21:36,384	00:21:42,528	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	All the rest of us stay away from the cans of soup and I'll be honest with you I feel awful about it but whenever I try to talk to a can of soup
EDL	00:21:43,552	00:21:44,576	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	They are weird
EDL	00:21:47,392	00:21:51,488	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	You mentioned that you're you're feeling like you're nearing the end of your life hell yeah

EDL	00:22:09,920	00:22:12,736	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	But you could keep going on after that that's just
EDL	00:22:12,736	00:22:14,272	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	I thought it's not recommended
EDL	00:22:14,272	00:22:14,784	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	But I could
EDL	00:22:15,552	00:22:19,904	| 315_Everything_is_Alive_pt01 |	Desert C I mean I think about this with you because
