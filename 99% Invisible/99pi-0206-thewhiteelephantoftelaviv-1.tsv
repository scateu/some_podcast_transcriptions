EDL	00:08:31,487	00:08:33,791	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	So we go there and try to find
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:34,815	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	The answer for that

EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:48,127	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	I looked around and realized
EDL	00:08:48,127	00:08:51,967	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	We are in the lobby of a deserted movie theater
EDL	00:08:54,271	00:08:58,879	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	So we're actually 15 meters below ground level here in what was the Grand Cinema
EDL	00:08:59,647	00:09:02,719	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	And there was Six movie theaters here with

EDL	00:13:25,631	00:13:29,471	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	So we purchased the old Orange Grove turn slime from the Jewish National Fund
EDL	00:13:33,055	00:13:35,871	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	But then there was the problem of the squatters

EDL	00:13:53,791	00:13:55,071	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	The location wasn't ideal

EDL	00:14:11,455	00:14:12,991	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	And as often happens
EDL	00:14:12,991	00:14:14,527	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	This contributed to the areas
EDL	00:14:14,527	00:14:16,575	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Decline into a hub of crime

EDL	00:14:17,855	00:14:20,159	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	It was clear to the municipal planners that
EDL	00:14:20,159	00:14:20,927	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Something wasn't working
EDL	00:14:21,439	00:14:25,535	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	They wanted to move the station to another place while they renovate and open up the old one
EDL	00:14:26,303	00:14:27,071	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	So cute
EDL	00:14:27,071	00:14:28,863	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Who was a really clever guy just
EDL	00:14:28,863	00:14:30,655	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Came out to dance party and told them
EDL	00:14:30,655	00:14:31,423	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Wait a minute
EDL	00:14:31,423	00:14:32,191	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Why
EDL	00:14:32,191	00:14:33,983	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Would you move the bus station and then
EDL	00:14:33,983	00:14:35,519	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Bring it back just keep it
EDL	00:14:35,519	00:14:36,799	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Where do you
EDL	00:14:36,799	00:14:38,591	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Well I will build you a new one
EDL	00:14:39,103	00:14:40,895	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	And pills had Big Dreams
EDL	00:14:41,663	00:14:44,479	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	He was going to finance the building of the new bus station
EDL	00:14:44,479	00:14:46,015	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	By making it part of a huge Mall
EDL	00:14:46,527	00:14:47,295	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	It was
EDL	00:14:47,295	00:14:53,439	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Meant to be the largest bus station in the world when it was
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:54,463	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	I conceived
EDL	00:14:54,463	00:14:56,255	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Israel is still a small country
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:14:58,303	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	With a population of just over 2 million
EDL	00:14:58,815	00:15:01,887	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	So as you might imagine lots of people thought the idea was
EDL	00:15:02,399	00:15:03,423	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Absolutely insane
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:05,983	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	But this is charismatic
EDL	00:15:05,983	00:15:08,543	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	And even more importantly he knew all the right people
EDL	00:15:09,055	00:15:13,151	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	So you managed to persuade the folks at City Hall and with their approval
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:15,199	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	He approached a 33 year old architect
EDL	00:15:15,967	00:15:16,735	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Langkawi
EDL	00:15:16,735	00:15:18,015	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Enfield said to him
EDL	00:15:20,063	00:15:22,367	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Build me a central bus station
EDL	00:15:27,999	00:15:34,399	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Promise first proposal was relatively simple day there was the decisions that will ever would be similar to
EDL	00:15:34,399	00:15:37,727	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Train station in the sense that the buses would pass right through it
EDL	00:15:37,727	00:15:39,519	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	On top of that they would build
EDL	00:15:40,031	00:15:44,127	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Apartments hotels offices in in the center that would be a big Park
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:46,687	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Which would actually sit on the stations
EDL	00:15:47,455	00:15:49,247	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	From there on it only went down
EDL	00:15:50,783	00:15:52,575	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Pretty quickly issues a rose with
EDL	00:15:52,575	00:15:53,343	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Counties plan
EDL	00:15:53,855	00:15:56,671	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Bigger than than the two rival bus companies
EDL	00:15:56,671	00:15:58,463	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Could become stakeholders in a project
EDL	00:15:58,975	00:16:01,279	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Where is furious when they realized they would have to sheriff
EDL	00:16:02,047	00:16:03,071	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Not a problem
EDL	00:16:03,071	00:16:03,583	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	The developer
EDL	00:16:04,351	00:16:06,399	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	We'll put the bus companies on separate
EDL	00:16:07,423	00:16:08,703	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Carly had a brilliant idea
EDL	00:16:09,215	00:16:12,799	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Dividing the transportation between the 1st and the 6th floor
EDL	00:16:12,799	00:16:14,335	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	The dance city buses
EDL	00:16:14,335	00:16:15,359	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Svn stop on the first floor
EDL	00:16:15,871	00:16:20,223	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	And it gets Intercity buses would leave from a platform all the way up on the 6th
EDL	00:16:21,247	00:16:25,343	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	So passengers transferring from one to the other would have to go through the entire building
EDL	00:16:25,343	00:16:27,391	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	And what's been good money in The Malt Shop
EDL	00:16:27,903	00:16:33,279	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Yeah it seem logical at this time
EDL	00:16:33,279	00:16:36,863	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Was very trendy at the time and I'm coming forward this idea to Israel
EDL	00:16:37,375	00:16:43,775	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Built in the meantime understood that the project was going to be much more expensive than he originally expected
EDL	00:16:43,775	00:16:44,543	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	He said
EDL	00:16:44,543	00:16:47,615	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Cuz I mean we need more spaces which we can sell
EDL	00:16:47,615	00:16:50,687	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	And so in every subsequent design, submitted
EDL	00:16:51,199	00:16:52,991	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	The station grew bigger
EDL	00:16:52,991	00:16:53,503	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Bigger
EDL	00:16:54,271	00:16:57,855	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	By the six draft handed in in November 1967
EDL	00:16:57,855	00:17:00,671	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	The blueprint that started to resemble that behemoth
EDL	00:17:00,671	00:17:01,183	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Reno today
EDL	00:17:01,695	00:17:05,023	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	In fact I remember I'm talking about the central bus station
EDL	00:17:05,791	00:17:07,583	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	And saying that they wanted
EDL	00:17:07,583	00:17:08,863	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	To build the largest
EDL	00:17:08,863	00:17:10,143	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Bus station in the world
EDL	00:17:10,911	00:17:15,519	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	And they kept wondering why would anyone wants to build a largest
EDL	00:17:15,519	00:17:18,591	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Central bus station in such a small country
EDL	00:17:19,103	00:17:20,383	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	But this is exactly what I
EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:24,735	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	In the end the new Central bus station was designed to include 8th floor
EDL	00:17:25,503	00:17:27,807	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	For a total of 230 square meter
EDL	00:17:27,807	00:17:29,599	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Parasaur 57 Acres
EDL	00:17:29,599	00:17:31,135	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Which is more less
EDL	00:17:31,135	00:17:31,903	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	2
EDL	00:17:31,903	00:17:32,927	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Empire State Building
EDL	00:17:34,207	00:17:36,511	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	By the time Prince Carlos building permits in order
EDL	00:17:36,511	00:17:39,327	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Architectural Styles around the world had begun to change
EDL	00:17:40,095	00:17:43,679	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	New wisdom had it that a few small scale public transportation hubs
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:46,239	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	We're more efficient than one gigantic station
EDL	00:17:47,007	00:17:48,287	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	And besides
EDL	00:17:48,287	00:17:51,359	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	There were enough examples to conclude that megastructures
EDL	00:17:51,359	00:17:53,663	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Rarely function the way they were originally intended to
EDL	00:17:54,687	00:17:56,735	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	On top of all that has had other problems
EDL	00:17:58,015	00:17:59,551	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	He had bought out all the squatters
EDL	00:17:59,551	00:18:02,367	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	But the residents in the adjacent streets were living
EDL	00:18:03,135	00:18:06,207	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Even though their neighborhood had never been particularly nicer
EDL	00:18:06,207	00:18:07,231	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Upscale
EDL	00:18:07,231	00:18:08,767	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	They were concerned that the new station
EDL	00:18:09,279	00:18:10,815	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	And all the increased bus traffic
EDL	00:18:10,815	00:18:12,607	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Would depreciate the value of their
EDL	00:18:12,607	00:18:13,631	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Apartments even more
EDL	00:18:14,399	00:18:16,703	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	The day would end up living in a cloud of smoke and
EDL	00:18:16,703	00:18:17,215	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Fumes
EDL	00:18:17,727	00:18:18,495	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	And
EDL	00:18:18,495	00:18:19,775	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	As it turns out
EDL	00:18:19,775	00:18:20,287	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	They were right
EDL	00:18:20,799	00:18:22,079	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	This is Sheila Kesha

EDL	00:24:25,088	00:24:27,392	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	The station was set to open more or less on schedule

EDL	00:24:30,720	00:24:31,488	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Back in the day
EDL	00:24:32,256	00:24:36,096	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	So in order to make this financially viable you don't know how to build more
EDL	00:24:37,120	00:24:37,888	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	And more

EDL	00:25:16,288	00:25:17,824	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	And there's really nothing
EDL	00:25:17,824	00:25:18,336	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Things to do about
EDL	00:25:18,848	00:25:21,920	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	So what you're saying is that the new Central bus station is
EDL	00:25:21,920	00:25:24,224	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	The largest construction violation in the city

EDL	00:25:54,944	00:25:58,784	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	And again people who seem to have forgotten the heartache of the station

EDL	00:26:08,256	00:26:08,768	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	The paper
EDL	00:26:09,280	00:26:11,584	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	All the usual dignitaries reconvened at the station
EDL	00:26:12,352	00:26:16,704	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Prime minister Yitzhak Rabin was there as was the transportation minister

EDL	00:26:21,056	00:26:24,128	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	And what was the only time he ever visited the building
EDL	00:26:24,128	00:26:24,896	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	While it was working
EDL	00:26:25,920	00:26:28,480	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	In a rare moment of self-deprecating humor
EDL	00:26:28,480	00:26:34,880	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	The opening ceremony was kicked off by releasing a giant helium balloon in the shape of
EDL	00:26:34,880	00:26:35,392	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	All white outfit
EDL	00:26:37,440	00:26:38,976	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	But not everyone was amused
EDL	00:26:39,744	00:26:41,280	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Here again is Chula Kesha
EDL	00:26:41,280	00:26:43,072	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	One of the station's unhappy Neighbors
EDL	00:26:43,584	00:26:46,912	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	At the time they were celebrating inside
EDL	00:26:46,912	00:26:51,264	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	We were standing outside in a big demonstration of thousands of people
EDL	00:26:51,776	00:26:52,544	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Thousands of
EDL	00:26:52,544	00:26:53,312	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	People
EDL	00:26:53,312	00:26:55,616	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	And we were standing in demonstrating
EDL	00:26:55,616	00:26:57,920	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	At the foot of the Central bus station
EDL	00:26:58,432	00:27:02,784	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	This terrible monster that is destroying lives until today
EDL	00:27:03,296	00:27:05,856	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	But the neighborhood residents protest was largely ignored
EDL	00:27:06,368	00:27:09,184	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	While all of Israel heard about the grand opening that evening

EDL	00:27:17,888	00:27:20,960	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	The new Central bus station in Tel Aviv was now up and run
EDL	00:27:22,240	00:27:23,264	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	It's been open ever since
EDL	00:27:24,032	00:27:26,336	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	But it's far from the Posh shopping
EDL	00:27:26,336	00:27:26,848	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	What was meant
EDL	00:27:27,360	00:27:33,760	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Does a certain temptation to view
EDL	00:27:33,760	00:27:36,832	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Do those first years as the years when things were still working
EDL	00:27:38,112	00:27:38,880	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	But honestly
EDL	00:27:39,392	00:27:40,672	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Things never really worked here
EDL	00:27:41,440	00:27:44,256	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	You'll never manage to sell all the new stores had built
EDL	00:27:44,256	00:27:45,536	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	So many of them stood Baker
EDL	00:27:46,304	00:27:47,840	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	And many of the ones that were open
EDL	00:27:48,352	00:27:49,888	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Specialized stores located in

EDL	00:27:55,520	00:27:57,312	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	You can understand why the vendors
EDL	00:27:57,312	00:27:58,848	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Don't have many good words to say about

EDL	00:28:43,904	00:28:45,440	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	We're not short on this kind

EDL	00:28:59,520	00:29:00,288	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	The national bus
EDL	00:29:01,312	00:29:02,080	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	So now what
EDL	00:29:02,080	00:29:04,640	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	All the platforms located on the top floors
EDL	00:29:05,152	00:29:06,688	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	The entire concept of the station
EDL	00:29:07,200	00:29:10,784	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	People will trickle down through the shops on their way from one bus

EDL	00:29:13,088	00:29:15,392	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	The lower floors of the station became ghost
EDL	00:29:17,440	00:29:19,744	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Before long just like his predecessor.
EDL	00:29:20,512	00:29:22,048	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Mordecai and I filed for bankruptcy
EDL	00:29:23,840	00:29:26,144	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Since then the station is falling deep in debt
EDL	00:29:27,168	00:29:29,472	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	They're real estate billionaires and Banks
EDL	00:29:29,472	00:29:31,776	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Passing the hot potatoes from one to the other

EDL	00:29:34,592	00:29:39,200	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	And in the middle of all of this is me Kizi the station's general manager
EDL	00:29:39,968	00:29:41,504	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Who's doing his best to run the play
EDL	00:29:42,272	00:29:44,320	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	He's tried all kinds of creative solution
EDL	00:29:44,832	00:29:46,624	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Cheap rates for artist Studios

EDL	00:29:49,184	00:29:50,976	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	But it seems as if the station is
EDL	00:29:50,976	00:29:52,512	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Is just getting emptier and emptier
EDL	00:29:53,024	00:29:54,048	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	We have here

EDL	00:29:57,120	00:30:00,960	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	But only say 600 open
EDL	00:30:00,960	00:30:03,776	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Because the building is so huge
EDL	00:30:05,056	00:30:06,336	| 99pi-0206-thewhiteelephantoftelaviv-1 |	Download necessary
