EDL	00:06:30,911	00:06:35,775	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	This is what I was talking about in the beginning rules regarding what you can and can't say in an ad
EDL	00:06:35,775	00:06:39,103	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Who can appear in your ad and what they are allowed to say about you

EDL	00:06:47,295	00:06:48,831	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	As proven by history
EDL	00:06:48,831	00:06:52,415	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Lawyers will tell themselves exactly as loudly

EDL	00:06:57,023	00:07:01,119	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Back in the 19 century you see ads for attorneys on the front page of newspaper

EDL	00:07:24,927	00:07:27,487	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	That band lasted about 70 years
EDL	00:07:27,999	00:07:29,791	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	And then in 1976
EDL	00:07:29,791	00:07:32,351	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	The lock Clinic of Bates and Osteen
EDL	00:07:32,351	00:07:36,191	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Ran one little classified in the Arizona Republic saying

EDL	00:07:41,823	00:07:44,895	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	And in short the Arizona bar got mad
EDL	00:07:45,407	00:07:46,687	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Suspended the two lawyers

EDL	00:07:55,135	00:07:58,719	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	The Court ruled that lawyers have the same freedom of speech as everybody else

EDL	00:08:14,847	00:08:16,639	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	There was kind of a wild wild west
EDL	00:08:16,639	00:08:18,175	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Situation where lawyers were
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:20,223	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Advertising anyway they wanted
EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:20,991	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Because I want regular

EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:27,647	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	So Florida actually
EDL	00:08:27,647	00:08:28,415	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Had
EDL	00:08:28,415	00:08:29,183	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	A couple of different
EDL	00:08:29,695	00:08:31,743	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Blue Ribbon commission and they adopt

EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:35,839	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Very concerned about

EDL	00:08:40,191	00:08:44,031	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Elizabeth Herbert wasn't with the bar back then so she doesn't know what those ads look like
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:46,079	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	But an attorney I talk to you names
EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:46,847	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Steve Miller
EDL	00:08:47,615	00:08:52,223	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Nose look at when I first started practicing that he's a divorce lawyer with offices in Florida and Mass
EDL	00:08:52,223	00:08:54,015	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Massachusetts I work for a woman
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:55,551	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	In Florida
EDL	00:08:56,063	00:08:57,087	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Doing personal energy work
EDL	00:08:57,855	00:08:59,135	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	And she was one of
EDL	00:08:59,135	00:09:01,439	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	I want sushi was one of the first on TV but
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:02,719	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	She did a lot of TV advertising
EDL	00:09:03,231	00:09:04,767	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	And her add when something like this
EDL	00:09:05,279	00:09:06,303	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Here car crash
EDL	00:09:09,375	00:09:11,423	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	You hear a car crash
EDL	00:09:12,191	00:09:15,263	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	See hear the sirens and then they threw a doll
EDL	00:09:15,263	00:09:16,799	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Baby doll
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:17,823	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Into the picture
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:19,103	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Which
EDL	00:09:21,919	00:09:23,711	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	I'll never forget I won't say her name
EDL	00:09:23,711	00:09:30,111	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	But it it was just the worst thing that I ever see everyday and so I'm sure that had something to do with the bar
EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:31,647	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Come in and say and look
EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:38,047	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	You can't you can't do music you can't do dramatizations can't have your clients come on 2K
EDL	00:09:38,047	00:09:38,559	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Can't do that
EDL	00:09:39,071	00:09:40,863	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	It actually goes way beyond that
EDL	00:09:40,863	00:09:41,887	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Florida has some of the
EDL	00:09:41,887	00:09:43,935	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Strictest guidelines in the country for these ads
EDL	00:09:44,447	00:09:47,007	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	For instance testimonials if a lawyer
EDL	00:09:47,775	00:09:50,591	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Writes the testimonial him or herself that would be Miss
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:51,359	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Bleeding that's not.
EDL	00:09:52,639	00:09:53,407	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Experience
EDL	00:09:53,407	00:09:56,223	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	If it's not the person's actual experience with a lawyer or not
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:09:57,247	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Qualified to judge
EDL	00:09:59,807	00:10:03,391	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Think of how many lawyer commercials you've seen that used
EDL	00:10:03,391	00:10:04,159	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Testimonial
EDL	00:10:04,159	00:10:05,183	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Assurance company
EDL	00:10:05,183	00:10:06,463	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Kept asking me to hurry up
EDL	00:10:06,463	00:10:06,975	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Sign a release
EDL	00:10:07,743	00:10:08,511	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	I was thinking
EDL	00:10:09,023	00:10:10,047	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	What's the rush
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:11,583	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Of course
EDL	00:10:12,863	00:10:14,911	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Horse some of them are written by the attorney
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:16,191	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Were there advertising consult
EDL	00:10:16,703	00:10:19,519	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Often time the actual client doesn't even appear in the ass
EDL	00:10:19,519	00:10:22,847	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	I'm Jason Smith he is not Jason Smith
EDL	00:10:22,847	00:10:25,407	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	He's an actor performing a testimonial
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:26,943	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Which is also prohibited in Florida
EDL	00:10:27,455	00:10:32,319	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Nor are you allowed in Florida to have actors playing authority figures like cops and judges
EDL	00:10:32,319	00:10:33,855	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Saying how great the lawyer is
EDL	00:10:34,367	00:10:40,255	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Nor are you allowed to have actual cops and judges saying how great the lawyer is people inherently respond to it
EDL	00:10:41,023	00:10:42,047	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Here is whether they're real or not
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:44,095	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	So we prohibit their use
EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:47,423	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Does Robert Vaughn fall under that category
EDL	00:10:47,935	00:10:49,727	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	I wouldn't consider Robert Vaughn and Authority fee
EDL	00:10:50,751	00:10:54,079	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	But he would fall within the probation in the same rollabouts
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:55,103	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Using the voice or images
EDL	00:10:56,127	00:10:56,895	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Again
EDL	00:10:56,895	00:11:01,759	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Kind of pervasive in other states tell the insurance companies you mean business
EDL	00:11:01,759	00:11:04,063	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Tell them you hired Jacoby and Meyers
EDL	00:11:04,063	00:11:10,207	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	They go after your rights piece by piece by piece until justice has been served
EDL	00:11:17,887	00:11:20,959	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Elizabeth Herbert says the rules are meant to protect the public
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:25,055	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	That people should pick a lawyer based on what she calls objective selection criteria
EDL	00:11:25,567	00:11:27,359	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Other than Fancy Pants promises and sound effects
EDL	00:11:27,871	00:11:30,175	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	If you break the rules the penalties
EDL	00:11:30,687	00:11:32,991	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Are not really that dramatic
EDL	00:11:32,991	00:11:34,527	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	The worst that might happen is
EDL	00:11:34,527	00:11:36,831	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Then you'll get what's known as a public reprimand
EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:41,439	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Bar sent out a press release so your reputation is kind of marred
EDL	00:11:41,951	00:11:48,351	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	But it's not like you're going to be disbarred
EDL	00:11:48,351	00:11:49,887	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	A few other states
EDL	00:11:49,887	00:11:51,167	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Iowa
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:52,447	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	And
EDL	00:11:52,447	00:11:58,591	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Texas weirdly given that it's home to one of the Hammers
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:03,967	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Massachusetts and Connecticut are still
EDL	00:12:03,967	00:12:04,991	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Pretty wild Westie
EDL	00:12:05,759	00:12:07,551	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	And if you are National firm
EDL	00:12:07,551	00:12:09,599	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Operating in a bunch of jurisdiction
EDL	00:12:09,599	00:12:12,415	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	You have to comply with multiple sets of rules
EDL	00:12:13,183	00:12:14,463	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	That's what Lucian Pera has to be
EDL	00:12:14,975	00:12:17,023	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	He's a lawyer with Adams and Reese in Memphis
EDL	00:12:17,535	00:12:20,863	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	And among other things he advises Nationwide firms on their
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:24,959	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	And sometimes he'll be looking over the disclaimer rules for example
EDL	00:12:25,471	00:12:25,983	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Going to be like
EDL	00:12:26,751	00:12:31,871	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	State I said you got to say this but stay busy if I say what state I said state is going to say why can't say exactly that
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:32,895	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	So I got to
EDL	00:12:33,407	00:12:34,431	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Weave it together somehow
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:35,455	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	It is a morass
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:38,015	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	It does what it's I think in my opinion
EDL	00:12:38,015	00:12:38,783	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Intended to do which is
EDL	00:12:39,295	00:12:39,807	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Guitars

EDL	00:14:03,007	00:14:07,103	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Last year he and the Tennessee Association for justice
EDL	00:14:07,103	00:14:08,383	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	A group of plaintiffs lawyer
EDL	00:14:08,895	00:14:11,711	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Filed two petitions to the state supreme court
EDL	00:14:11,711	00:14:14,783	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Asking them to change the advertising rules in Tennessee
EDL	00:14:14,783	00:14:15,551	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	So that they

EDL	00:14:18,367	00:14:21,951	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Is a public comment. Some First Amendment Advocates got involved
EDL	00:14:21,951	00:14:22,975	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	And ultimately
EDL	00:14:23,487	00:14:24,511	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	The courts at now
EDL	00:14:24,511	00:14:26,303	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	But man is determinism
EDL	00:14:26,303	00:14:26,815	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	To keep trying
EDL	00:14:27,327	00:14:30,143	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	And I asked him in and so do you think Bates was
EDL	00:14:31,167	00:14:36,287	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	The sort of the beginning of the end like the the big bang that created the downfall of
EDL	00:14:36,287	00:14:38,591	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	The sort of stature of lawyers
EDL	00:14:38,591	00:14:40,639	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	I do I mean if you look in the
EDL	00:14:40,639	00:14:43,199	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	You know what our history in the 50s and 60s

EDL	00:14:51,135	00:14:51,647	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	But those
EDL	00:14:52,415	00:14:54,207	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	What I would call the Halcyon Days of
EDL	00:14:54,207	00:14:55,487	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	A positive public perception

EDL	00:14:57,279	00:14:58,303	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	What most people see
EDL	00:14:58,815	00:15:00,607	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Unfortunately is this unsavory
EDL	00:15:01,119	00:15:01,631	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Advertising
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:03,679	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	The lawyers
EDL	00:15:03,679	00:15:04,191	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Matt Everett
EDL	00:15:05,471	00:15:06,751	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	But might you know my biggest
EDL	00:15:06,751	00:15:08,287	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Concerned about this is how it affects
EDL	00:15:08,287	00:15:09,311	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	The jury pool and make people
EDL	00:15:09,823	00:15:10,591	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	So you're just a furry
EDL	00:15:10,591	00:15:11,359	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Easy money
EDL	00:15:11,359	00:15:17,247	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	That is if people start thinking plaintiff's and their attorneys are just out for easy money they might get cynical about the process
EDL	00:15:17,759	00:15:22,111	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	And cynical people become cynical jurors and no one gets a fair trial anymore
EDL	00:15:22,623	00:15:23,391	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	That's
EDL	00:15:23,391	00:15:24,159	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	The calculus
EDL	00:15:24,159	00:15:27,231	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	And by the way that's not opposed to advertising writ large
EDL	00:15:27,231	00:15:30,559	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	I advertise myself none on TV
EDL	00:15:31,327	00:15:37,727	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	You ever doesn't movie theaters and online his that sound like this

EDL	00:15:50,271	00:15:52,831	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	Which makes me wonder if maybe there's not something more basic
EDL	00:15:53,343	00:15:54,367	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	What is objection
EDL	00:15:54,367	00:15:55,135	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	What's to the

EDL	00:16:05,631	00:16:07,423	| 99pi-0107-callnow-1 |	But do you think they're not
