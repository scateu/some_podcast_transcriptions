EDL	00:04:42,111	00:04:42,623	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	Historic import
EDL	00:04:43,391	00:04:43,903	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	The form of waves

EDL	00:04:49,023	00:04:51,327	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	Profound I mean it's politically so important
EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:54,655	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	But now you know you're guaranteed when you go out you're going to find one of these

EDL	00:04:59,007	00:05:00,799	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	But this isn't the end of the story
EDL	00:05:01,311	00:05:03,359	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	Because it's the logo got absorbed into
EDL	00:05:03,359	00:05:04,639	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	The built environment
EDL	00:05:04,639	00:05:07,711	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	People with disabilities and their allies started finding it

EDL	00:05:09,247	00:05:13,087	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	The shapes of the body in the body parts on that icon

EDL	00:06:04,543	00:06:07,615	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	Answer for starters the accessible icon project has
EDL	00:06:07,615	00:06:08,383	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	Take a name
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:09,663	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	At the standard blue and white
EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:10,175	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	Wheelchair I
EDL	00:06:10,943	00:06:15,295	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	They've created a new icon that they hope will ultimately replace the iso standard
EDL	00:06:15,295	00:06:16,831	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	It's still a white
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:19,391	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	Figure in a wheelchair positioned in a blue field
EDL	00:06:19,903	00:06:22,719	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	But the head and body are tilted forward
EDL	00:06:22,719	00:06:24,767	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	The arm is angled back as if it's
EDL	00:06:24,767	00:06:25,279	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	Propelling you
EDL	00:06:25,791	00:06:27,327	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	And the wheel looks like it's in motion
EDL	00:06:28,095	00:06:32,447	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	The visible leg is also move forward and re angled so look more active
EDL	00:06:32,447	00:06:33,983	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	It doesn't just disappear into
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:34,751	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	The wheel
EDL	00:06:34,751	00:06:36,031	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	It looks modern
EDL	00:06:36,031	00:06:36,799	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	I'm asleep
EDL	00:06:36,799	00:06:41,407	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	You do a pretty good job picture in it if you imagine the new logo as the old logo
EDL	00:06:41,407	00:06:42,431	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	But italicized
EDL	00:06:43,199	00:06:45,247	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	Changing an ISO standard isn't easy
EDL	00:06:45,759	00:06:47,039	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	A proposal has two
EDL	00:06:47,039	00:06:49,087	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	To be submitted and reviewed by isos
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:51,647	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	Technical committee on graphical symbols
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:54,719	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	Then it has to be considered by symbols
EDL	00:06:54,719	00:06:56,255	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	Experts from around the world
EDL	00:06:56,255	00:06:58,047	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	And then finally approved
EDL	00:06:58,047	00:06:59,071	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	White Isis member
EDL	00:07:00,351	00:07:01,631	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	I talked with Barry Gray
EDL	00:07:02,143	00:07:03,167	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	The chairman of the two
EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:05,215	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	Technical committee on graphical symbols
EDL	00:07:05,215	00:07:06,495	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	Oh my God I want very gray
EDL	00:07:07,263	00:07:10,847	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	He says he's seen the new logo and applauds the designers for the icon
EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:11,359	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	Consignment
EDL	00:07:12,383	00:07:14,431	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	But he told me a lot of factors would have to
EDL	00:07:14,943	00:07:15,967	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	Taking into account
EDL	00:07:15,967	00:07:17,759	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	Before the current symbol could be replaced
EDL	00:07:18,271	00:07:22,111	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	Like whether this new icon might be confused with symbols used for wheelchair
EDL	00:07:22,623	00:07:25,439	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	So as much good as the current logo has done
EDL	00:07:25,439	00:07:26,975	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	300 among others
EDL	00:07:27,487	00:07:29,023	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	Text issue with how the logo
EDL	00:07:29,023	00:07:29,535	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	Portrays people
EDL	00:07:30,047	00:07:30,559	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	Disabilities
EDL	00:07:31,071	00:07:32,607	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	It has this a mobile
EDL	00:07:32,607	00:07:33,375	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	Talk to it
EDL	00:07:33,375	00:07:34,655	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	The figure in the image
EDL	00:07:34,655	00:07:35,423	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	Looks like it's waiting to
EDL	00:07:35,935	00:07:36,447	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	Pushed around
EDL	00:07:36,959	00:07:39,775	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	It's not that there's anything wrong with anyone who experience
EDL	00:07:39,775	00:07:41,055	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	What is mobility in that way
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:44,639	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	It's just that for hendren the implicit message the icons
EDL	00:07:45,151	00:07:46,943	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	Is it people with disabilities are helpful
EDL	00:07:47,455	00:07:51,551	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	In this new logo Grant a sense of autonomy to the figure in the wheelchair
EDL	00:07:52,063	00:07:55,135	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	And there's a clear delineation between where the person starts
EDL	00:07:55,135	00:07:56,159	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	And the chair begin
EDL	00:07:56,159	00:07:57,439	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	I think what the
EDL	00:07:57,439	00:07:59,487	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	Former icon lacked was
EDL	00:07:59,487	00:08:02,815	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	There just wasn't any definition of moving forward
EDL	00:08:03,327	00:08:04,863	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	You know it was just kind of
EDL	00:08:05,887	00:08:06,911	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	Stoic
EDL	00:08:07,423	00:08:09,471	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	Whereas this symbol
EDL	00:08:09,471	00:08:12,799	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	Shows that the malta Community is moving full-steam ahead
EDL	00:08:13,567	00:08:15,103	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	We are all moving
EDL	00:08:15,103	00:08:16,127	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	Full steam ahead

EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:56,575	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	That's how eager I am to
EDL	00:08:56,575	00:08:57,855	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	To try and fulfill
EDL	00:08:57,855	00:08:59,135	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	This wonderful initiative
EDL	00:08:59,135	00:09:00,927	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	At this point in our conversation
EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:05,279	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	The mayor handed the phone over to Jeff Gentry from Triangle Eye Lauren how are you

EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:30,623	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	And hopefully the icon creates dialogue around that
EDL	00:09:31,135	00:09:36,511	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	And I believe that the accessible icon is creating a more inclusive world like we're building here
EDL	00:09:36,511	00:09:38,047	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	In Malden when I ask

EDL	00:10:09,535	00:10:13,375	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	This project is way more than just a picture and assemble to me
EDL	00:10:13,375	00:10:17,983	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	The project to me shows that people with disabilities can be active and participate
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:21,567	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	It makes people understand about the disabilities Rights Movement

EDL	00:10:24,639	00:10:25,919	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	Downtown New Bern
EDL	00:10:25,919	00:10:30,783	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	I did a lot of speaking with television and radio stations locally about the new icon
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:34,111	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	I have a letter from the state to allow me to use the icon here
EDL	00:10:34,623	00:10:38,207	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	I have painted the new icon in several businesses in New Bern
EDL	00:10:38,207	00:10:40,255	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	And still have many more to do
EDL	00:10:40,255	00:10:43,327	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	People at the North Carolina state level like the new icon
EDL	00:10:43,327	00:10:45,887	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	They thanked me for bringing the icon here

EDL	00:10:58,431	00:11:02,783	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	Then they made me Regional director of North Carolina for the icon project
EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:04,831	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	Because I am kicking their butts
EDL	00:11:04,831	00:11:06,623	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	In getting the icon out in the world
EDL	00:11:07,135	00:11:10,975	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	Sara hendren said she's not interested in what she calls sign washing
EDL	00:11:11,487	00:11:14,815	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	Or getting the logo change just to be politically correct
EDL	00:11:14,815	00:11:17,119	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	She says this project is a process of
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:19,167	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	Consciousness-raising quote-unquote
EDL	00:11:19,167	00:11:21,983	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	So that each time the sign is officially changed
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:23,519	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	There's intention around it
EDL	00:11:23,519	00:11:24,799	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	And dialogue about

EDL	00:11:25,567	00:11:28,383	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	But a symbol meant to start dialogue and
EDL	00:11:28,383	00:11:33,503	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	Spread through Grassroots action is very different than one created to be at Universal
EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:35,807	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	An internationally recognized symbol
EDL	00:11:35,807	00:11:41,951	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	There's a lack of clarity as to
EDL	00:11:42,463	00:11:47,071	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	Even though the law states that reasonable changes can be made to the symbol as long as it

EDL	00:12:02,687	00:12:03,455	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	At least for now
EDL	00:12:03,967	00:12:07,807	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	I think a lot of people end up buying that old original image because they're nervous
EDL	00:12:07,807	00:12:12,159	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	About complying with Ada code and I think what we're trying to do is say look
EDL	00:12:12,671	00:12:13,951	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	Functional equivalence

EDL	00:12:21,119	00:12:23,423	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	It's not as though functional equivalence means
EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:26,751	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	Willy-nilly personal interpretation it means
EDL	00:12:26,751	00:12:27,263	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	As long as it's

EDL	00:12:35,711	00:12:39,551	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	All comes back to the question of what we are trying to accomplish through our symbols
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:44,159	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	Having one unified icon can tell one clear story all over the world
EDL	00:12:44,671	00:12:45,951	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	But sometimes stories change
EDL	00:12:46,719	00:12:51,071	| 99pi-0102-iconforaccess-1 |	We said earlier that the group behind the original call for an international symbol of Acts
