EDL	00:03:20,448	00:03:22,752	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	Kate believes the source of this ugliness
EDL	00:03:22,752	00:03:24,800	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	Stems from the combination of mass production
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:26,592	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	In customization
EDL	00:03:26,592	00:03:28,896	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	During the 90s and 2000's thanks

EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:39,904	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	The standard model Elizabeth mass-produced homes reflected that
EDL	00:03:40,416	00:03:45,280	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	Blu Grand entrances and granite countertops and stainless steel appliances were nice enough
EDL	00:03:45,792	00:03:50,400	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	Many new home manufacturers allowed for customizations that brought the opulence
EDL	00:03:50,400	00:03:51,168	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	To the next level
EDL	00:03:51,680	00:03:55,264	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	So the combine the two done already design prototype with

EDL	00:04:00,384	00:04:00,896	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	Results
EDL	00:04:01,920	00:04:04,992	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	So they're designed and customized from the inside out
EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:06,528	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	And it makes the outside
EDL	00:04:06,528	00:04:07,296	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	Big
EDL	00:04:07,296	00:04:08,320	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	And weird

EDL	00:04:19,583	00:04:20,351	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	Is the roof

EDL	00:04:23,423	00:04:23,935	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	RMS
EDL	00:04:24,447	00:04:26,751	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	The roof is sort of the number one way to tell
EDL	00:04:27,263	00:04:29,567	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	Mcmansion from a mansion
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:31,359	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	And that the roof kind of makes no sense
EDL	00:04:31,871	00:04:34,943	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	It's got various pitches which is held certif

EDL	00:04:39,551	00:04:40,575	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	Many different angles
EDL	00:04:41,087	00:04:46,975	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	Like a gabled roof with a hip roof the pyramidal roof you don't really need to know what these look like but just know
EDL	00:04:47,487	00:04:48,767	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	They're not usually all together
EDL	00:04:49,279	00:04:50,303	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	They're really just
EDL	00:04:50,303	00:04:51,071	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	There
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:52,607	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	To put a hat on a ridiculous

EDL	00:04:54,399	00:04:58,239	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	But the coup de Grasse of the mcmansion roof is a future that Kate has dubbed
EDL	00:04:58,239	00:05:00,031	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	The mcmansion nub
EDL	00:05:00,031	00:05:01,055	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	The mcmansion Novas
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:05,919	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	Where you'll see like a roofline that is relatively organized and I know just have like this
EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:06,943	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	At the top because
EDL	00:05:07,455	00:05:08,991	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	Somebody had to have some fun
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:10,783	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	Feature and they just couldn't fit it in
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:14,111	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	Linearly usually it's like either storage space or like someone wanted
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:14,623	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	Some ridiculous
EDL	00:05:15,903	00:05:17,951	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	Feature so they just have this like
EDL	00:05:17,951	00:05:18,719	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	At the top
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:20,255	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	Just like a hat to a hat if
EDL	00:05:20,255	00:05:20,767	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	If you will
EDL	00:05:21,279	00:05:25,887	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	According to Kate another Hallmark of the mcmansion is the two-story entrance
EDL	00:05:25,887	00:05:28,447	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	You walk into a house and their son leave the house so much space
EDL	00:05:28,959	00:05:30,239	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	Wow look at our chandelier
EDL	00:05:30,751	00:05:31,263	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	Wow
EDL	00:05:32,031	00:05:33,567	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	So dramatic that was aware that
EDL	00:05:34,335	00:05:34,847	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	Dramatic
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:39,199	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	They being the real estate brokers in marketers and hoes
EDL	00:05:39,199	00:05:40,735	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	Civ house flipping TV shows
EDL	00:05:41,503	00:05:43,039	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	So to have a big entryway
EDL	00:05:43,039	00:05:44,063	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	You should probably have

EDL	00:06:57,279	00:07:03,679	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	So the columns usually either oversized or undersized sometimes the columns are not columns at all they're just called

EDL	00:07:06,495	00:07:07,775	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	Basically a column is

EDL	00:07:09,055	00:07:09,567	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	Serve balance
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:11,615	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	Whatever it is that it's holding up
EDL	00:07:11,615	00:07:12,895	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	That's the point of college
EDL	00:07:12,895	00:07:14,175	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	I'm just that they hold things up
EDL	00:07:14,687	00:07:16,991	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	I know a lot of people seem to have not understood
EDL	00:07:16,991	00:07:17,503	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	Did that in the last
EDL	00:07:18,783	00:07:24,671	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	But they actually are supposed to hold things up and so if you have these really big columns and they're holding up the
EDL	00:07:24,671	00:07:29,023	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	Tiniest little pediment or Portico then it looks like
EDL	00:07:29,023	00:07:29,791	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	Pretty
EDL	00:07:29,791	00:07:33,887	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	But the point is is that you have the really big column so everyone knows that you're rich like a bank that also has
EDL	00:07:35,679	00:07:38,751	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	Alright so this kind of snarky criticism is fun at all

EDL	00:07:40,799	00:07:44,639	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	But there's a larger point to be made about the design of the mcmansion
EDL	00:07:45,151	00:07:45,919	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	According to Kate

EDL	00:07:47,455	00:07:49,247	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	Saw the shift of the house
EDL	00:07:49,247	00:07:52,319	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	I'm a place that we live in potentially for the rest of our lives
EDL	00:07:52,831	00:07:53,855	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	To an asset
EDL	00:07:53,855	00:07:56,927	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	That we are decidedly not supposed to live in Forever
EDL	00:07:56,927	00:08:01,023	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	People started designing their houses with the notion of selling them in mine
EDL	00:08:01,023	00:08:03,839	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	Realtors would advise I wouldn't buy or do this because
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:05,631	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	The house isn't going to sell very well
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:10,495	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	So we sort of device this culture where we thought about selling our houses before we even
EDL	00:08:10,495	00:08:11,263	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	Spent one night in them
EDL	00:08:12,287	00:08:16,895	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	Kate lays the blame for this mindset at the feet of HGTV
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:17,919	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	And similar channels
EDL	00:08:18,431	00:08:23,295	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	The excess and Conformity of the mcmansion was reinforced over and over again

EDL	00:08:27,135	00:08:29,183	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	Because the house as object
EDL	00:08:29,695	00:08:30,975	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	Could always be improved

EDL	00:08:33,279	00:08:34,303	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	But to make it sell

EDL	00:08:37,631	00:08:41,727	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	Wooden paint the house page and then you would see the sticker in the corner this is all we just

EDL	00:08:44,287	00:08:45,311	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	Is there something like that
EDL	00:08:45,311	00:08:48,127	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	They would come up with these crazy ways to quantify

EDL	00:08:55,295	00:08:56,063	| 99pi-0232-mcmansionhell-1 |	Because
