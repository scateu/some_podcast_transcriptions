EDL	00:02:23,360	00:02:23,872	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	Love animation
EDL	00:02:24,384	00:02:30,784	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	Yeah the amazing thing about this guy is that he never drew Bugs Bunny or Elmer Fudd or Yosemite Sam or any of those characters he threw the back
EDL	00:02:30,784	00:02:31,552	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	Backgrounds
EDL	00:02:31,552	00:02:32,832	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	Behind those character

EDL	00:02:55,104	00:02:55,616	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	Noble
EDL	00:02:56,384	00:02:59,200	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	You're helping us tell the story is reporter Eric molinsky
EDL	00:02:59,200	00:03:03,552	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	Hey Eric used to work in animation as a storyboard artist on the Rugrats
EDL	00:03:03,552	00:03:07,136	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	And a couple of other cartoons for Nickelodeon
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:10,720	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	So breakdown press with the layout artist does in the hole animation
EDL	00:03:12,512	00:03:16,096	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	Hartwell so today like a TV show you would start out with
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:21,472	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	Or in the case of Looney Tunes it probably did start drawing story sketches to figure out the gags
EDL	00:03:21,472	00:03:22,240	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	The camera angles
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:23,008	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	Stop
EDL	00:03:23,008	00:03:24,800	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	And then before the animation starts
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:26,848	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	The background
EDL	00:03:26,848	00:03:28,640	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	Designer or layout artist has
EDL	00:03:28,640	00:03:30,688	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	First crack at drawing
EDL	00:03:30,688	00:03:31,456	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	This world
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:33,760	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	And those drawings are then later
EDL	00:03:33,760	00:03:39,904	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	Painting by someone else but you know the layout artist like Maurice Noble is really accomplished would actually have a say in in the color choices
EDL	00:03:39,904	00:03:40,672	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	As well
EDL	00:03:40,672	00:03:44,256	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	And so this is actually really important to imagine you're watching cartoon
EDL	00:03:44,256	00:03:48,352	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	Can any of the layout or they going to the background is sometimes the first image that you see it
EDL	00:03:48,352	00:03:49,888	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	Pops on screen for a second
EDL	00:03:50,400	00:03:53,472	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	And your brain use to instantly register Where You Are
EDL	00:03:53,472	00:03:54,496	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	In what mood you're supposed
EDL	00:03:55,264	00:03:58,336	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	So let's get on say watching Road Runner cartoon you cut to this
EDL	00:03:58,848	00:03:59,872	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	Big boulder
EDL	00:03:59,872	00:04:02,944	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	Perched on top of a really high narrow cliff
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:06,272	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	You're going to immediately feel dread for the coyote
EDL	00:04:06,784	00:04:09,600	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	So the layout artist is kind of like the straight man in the comedy duo
EDL	00:04:09,600	00:04:10,880	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	Setting up the gag
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:11,648	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	For the animator hygge
EDL	00:04:12,416	00:04:18,815	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	Funny guy right credit I mean they're literally in the background they're creating the painstaking work of
EDL	00:04:18,815	00:04:19,839	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	Bart for somebody else
EDL	00:04:19,839	00:04:21,887	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	Plop their drawings right on top of it
EDL	00:04:21,887	00:04:24,191	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	So you have to keep your ego in check
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:32,383	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	Reasonable spent most of his career working for Warner Bros
EDL	00:04:32,895	00:04:35,199	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	Cadence are outdoing new wacky cartoon
EDL	00:04:35,711	00:04:38,271	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	Asian man he wanted to be a fine artist
EDL	00:04:38,271	00:04:39,295	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	Painting desert landscape
EDL	00:04:39,807	00:04:43,135	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	When he graduated Art School Maurice found work at Walt Disney Studios
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:46,463	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	His first job is paying an apple and they said it was
EDL	00:04:46,463	00:04:51,583	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	Dirty toilet tedious process of exacting process of just putting the colors downgraded to match
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:54,655	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	You know he didn't think so at the moment but it was definitely
EDL	00:04:54,655	00:04:55,679	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	Pampering him creatively
EDL	00:04:56,191	00:04:59,007	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	This is Bob McKinnon who wrote a biography of Maurice Noble
EDL	00:04:59,007	00:05:05,407	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	He said that even though Disney feature film that is really realistic and settle background you see every leaf on a tree or the shine
EDL	00:05:05,407	00:05:06,175	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	Hang on a door knob
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:08,479	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	Maurice felt like he was slumming it
EDL	00:05:08,479	00:05:10,015	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	Squandering his talent on
EDL	00:05:10,015	00:05:10,527	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	Commercial Art
EDL	00:05:11,295	00:05:14,623	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	1941 Disney Studios was torn apart by a strike
EDL	00:05:14,623	00:05:16,671	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	The artist wanted to create a union
EDL	00:05:16,671	00:05:18,719	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	In-wall took the walkout very
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:20,767	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	Very personally when it was over
EDL	00:05:20,767	00:05:23,071	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	He got rid of anyone associated with the strike
EDL	00:05:23,583	00:05:24,863	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	Concluding reasonable
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:28,703	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	I think it's a strike and not happen he said he would have had a job for life time it is
EDL	00:05:28,703	00:05:31,263	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	Dbd I think he was with a stay there forever
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:33,567	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	But Maurice wasn't unemployed for long
EDL	00:05:33,567	00:05:37,407	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	World War II broke out and he was drafted into a unit that made propaganda film

EDL	00:05:39,199	00:05:40,735	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	Name the private snafu
EDL	00:05:55,071	00:06:00,703	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	As you can probably tell from that phone clip which has the very distinct voice of Mel Blanc in it
EDL	00:06:00,703	00:06:02,495	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	The propaganda film crew
EDL	00:06:02,495	00:06:04,287	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	Was full of people from Warner Brothers
EDL	00:06:04,287	00:06:05,567	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	Including Chuck Jones
EDL	00:06:05,567	00:06:07,103	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	So I also talked with Todd
EDL	00:06:07,103	00:06:09,407	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	Pulse and who's working on a book about Maurice's artwork
EDL	00:06:09,919	00:06:12,223	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	And he's as Maurice found their style to be
EDL	00:06:12,223	00:06:12,991	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	Liberating
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:15,551	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	You know everybody was involved with those
EDL	00:06:16,063	00:06:20,415	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	Those films for the Army definitely were able to finally Express themselves
EDL	00:06:20,415	00:06:21,951	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	And then after the war
EDL	00:06:21,951	00:06:23,743	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	They got Maurice a job working at Warner Brothers
EDL	00:06:24,255	00:06:25,279	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	Cuz I was sweating you said
EDL	00:06:25,791	00:06:27,071	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	No one knew
EDL	00:06:27,071	00:06:31,167	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	How little he knew about that particular end of the business and
EDL	00:06:31,167	00:06:36,287	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	According to him he was flying by the seat of his pants layouts before but
EDL	00:06:36,799	00:06:38,847	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	I'm like 30 short films per year
EDL	00:06:39,359	00:06:41,407	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	And just to give you a sense of how crazy that is
EDL	00:06:41,407	00:06:46,271	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	So today in OTR lease when I worked in TV going to we would ship are storyboards to create
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:47,551	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	Today they would probably
EDL	00:06:47,551	00:06:49,343	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	You know email them to Korea
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:54,975	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	Eyewear near cheaper labor will fill in the animation or you could use a computer base program like Flash 2
EDL	00:06:54,975	00:06:56,255	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	To speed up the workflow
EDL	00:06:56,255	00:06:58,815	| 99pi-0085-nobleefforts-1 |	And I just make 22 Episodes for a season
