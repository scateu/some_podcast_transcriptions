EDL	00:03:25,568	00:03:28,128	| 99pi-0266-repackagingthepill-1 |	It all started with a family in Illinois
EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:31,456	| 99pi-0266-repackagingthepill-1 |	In 1961 David and Doris Wagner

EDL	00:03:36,320	00:03:39,136	| 99pi-0266-repackagingthepill-1 |	And so they were thrilled to learn about the pill
EDL	00:03:39,136	00:03:40,672	| 99pi-0266-repackagingthepill-1 |	Doris got a prescription
EDL	00:03:40,672	00:03:42,464	| 99pi-0266-repackagingthepill-1 |	The pills came in a big bottle
EDL	00:03:42,976	00:03:45,536	| 99pi-0266-repackagingthepill-1 |	Instructions said to begin the pill on the

EDL	00:03:47,328	00:03:49,632	| 99pi-0266-repackagingthepill-1 |	To take one pill every day

EDL	00:03:50,912	00:03:52,704	| 99pi-0266-repackagingthepill-1 |	Followed by a 5-day break
EDL	00:03:52,704	00:03:53,472	| 99pi-0266-repackagingthepill-1 |	For menstruation
EDL	00:03:54,240	00:03:58,336	| 99pi-0266-repackagingthepill-1 |	Is Doris lost track of recycle or if she forgot whether or not she had taken a pill that day
EDL	00:03:58,848	00:04:01,152	| 99pi-0266-repackagingthepill-1 |	She was instructed to pour all the pills out of the bottle
EDL	00:04:01,664	00:04:03,200	| 99pi-0266-repackagingthepill-1 |	Count how many pills were left
EDL	00:04:03,200	00:04:05,504	| 99pi-0266-repackagingthepill-1 |	Subtract that from the original number of pills
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:07,040	| 99pi-0266-repackagingthepill-1 |	And consult the calendar
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:09,856	| 99pi-0266-repackagingthepill-1 |	Not as super user-friendly design
EDL	00:04:09,856	00:04:10,880	| 99pi-0266-repackagingthepill-1 |	And if she missed a pill
EDL	00:04:11,392	00:04:12,672	| 99pi-0266-repackagingthepill-1 |	She risk getting pregnant again
EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:14,464	| 99pi-0266-repackagingthepill-1 |	David Wagner
EDL	00:04:14,464	00:04:17,536	| 99pi-0266-repackagingthepill-1 |	Noticed that his wife Doris was often
EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:22,655	| 99pi-0266-repackagingthepill-1 |	Should have concerned about taking her pills and he was also concerned about whether or not she was
EDL	00:04:22,655	00:04:23,679	| 99pi-0266-repackagingthepill-1 |	Taking her pills
EDL	00:04:23,679	00:04:25,727	| 99pi-0266-repackagingthepill-1 |	The Wagner Simpsons passed away
EDL	00:04:25,727	00:04:27,519	| 99pi-0266-repackagingthepill-1 |	But this is Carolyn Hiser

EDL	00:04:32,895	00:04:33,407	| 99pi-0266-repackagingthepill-1 |	Control package
EDL	00:04:33,919	00:04:36,991	| 99pi-0266-repackagingthepill-1 |	So he thought I'd do something
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:37,503	| 99pi-0266-repackagingthepill-1 |	About this
EDL	00:04:38,783	00:04:41,599	| 99pi-0266-repackagingthepill-1 |	David Wagner was an engineer for a tool company in Illinois
EDL	00:04:42,111	00:04:44,159	| 99pi-0266-repackagingthepill-1 |	And he was used to solve any mechanical problems
EDL	00:04:44,671	00:04:49,791	| 99pi-0266-repackagingthepill-1 |	He figured he could create a packaging system that would make the pill taking process easier for his wife
EDL	00:04:50,303	00:04:52,607	| 99pi-0266-repackagingthepill-1 |	First he tried something really simple
EDL	00:04:52,607	00:04:54,399	| 99pi-0266-repackagingthepill-1 |	He took a piece of paper
EDL	00:04:54,399	00:04:57,727	| 99pi-0266-repackagingthepill-1 |	And he wrote out the days of the week and put the pills
EDL	00:04:57,727	00:05:00,287	| 99pi-0266-repackagingthepill-1 |	On the piece of paper along with the days of the week
EDL	00:05:00,799	00:05:03,615	| 99pi-0266-repackagingthepill-1 |	Turn it make it into a bit of a calendar and that works pretty well
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:05,663	| 99pi-0266-repackagingthepill-1 |	At least for a few weeks
EDL	00:05:05,663	00:05:08,479	| 99pi-0266-repackagingthepill-1 |	Then I guess the story goes something
EDL	00:05:08,479	00:05:10,271	| 99pi-0266-repackagingthepill-1 |	Fell on the dresser and the pills
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:12,831	| 99pi-0266-repackagingthepill-1 |	Got scattered and fell on the floor
EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:14,367	| 99pi-0266-repackagingthepill-1 |	And that was that that made him think
EDL	00:05:14,879	00:05:16,671	| 99pi-0266-repackagingthepill-1 |	Maybe I can make a package
EDL	00:05:17,695	00:05:18,975	| 99pi-0266-repackagingthepill-1 |	Say you could
EDL	00:05:18,975	00:05:22,303	| 99pi-0266-repackagingthepill-1 |	Throwing your purse throwing your bag take with you and
EDL	00:05:22,303	00:05:23,583	| 99pi-0266-repackagingthepill-1 |	Keep everything in order
EDL	00:05:24,863	00:05:26,911	| 99pi-0266-repackagingthepill-1 |	So what he came up with

EDL	00:14:25,535	00:14:27,839	| 99pi-0266-repackagingthepill-1 |	Most didn't want the pill to be taken off the market
EDL	00:14:28,607	00:14:31,423	| 99pi-0266-repackagingthepill-1 |	But they did want more transparency about the

EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:33,727	| 99pi-0266-repackagingthepill-1 |	In 1970
EDL	00:14:33,727	00:14:38,847	| 99pi-0266-repackagingthepill-1 |	Barbara Seaman's book inspired Congress to hold hearings to investigate the safety of the birth control

EDL	00:14:42,175	00:14:43,455	| 99pi-0266-repackagingthepill-1 |	To testify at these hearing
EDL	00:14:43,967	00:14:45,759	| 99pi-0266-repackagingthepill-1 |	It was a panel of men

EDL	00:14:47,039	00:14:53,439	| 99pi-0266-repackagingthepill-1 |	And this not surprisingly was really al-amin to semen and other feminists

EDL	00:15:54,879	00:15:59,487	| 99pi-0266-repackagingthepill-1 |	These hearings reveal that some doctors had long been aware of the negative side effects of the pill
EDL	00:15:59,999	00:16:03,071	| 99pi-0266-repackagingthepill-1 |	And many had failed to adequately alert there female patient
EDL	00:16:03,839	00:16:06,399	| 99pi-0266-repackagingthepill-1 |	The situation left many women feeling torn
