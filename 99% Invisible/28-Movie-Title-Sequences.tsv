EDL	00:03:58,848	00:04:03,712	| 28-Movie-Title-Sequences |	Establishing tone and perhaps a storyline but there are rules what you're doing in studio film
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:07,808	| 28-Movie-Title-Sequences |	The designer or the company will gets a
EDL	00:04:08,320	00:04:10,112	| 28-Movie-Title-Sequences |	A document that's
EDL	00:04:10,112	00:04:14,208	| 28-Movie-Title-Sequences |	You know maybe 10 to 15 pages long if you just read out the text
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:19,071	| 28-Movie-Title-Sequences |	The title sequence easily on a single page but of course it says 15 page document
EDL	00:04:19,583	00:04:21,375	| 28-Movie-Title-Sequences |	And besides title
EDL	00:04:21,375	00:04:22,911	| 28-Movie-Title-Sequences |	There is several paragraphs
EDL	00:04:22,911	00:04:25,215	| 28-Movie-Title-Sequences |	Text about how each title needs to be
EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:29,311	| 28-Movie-Title-Sequences |	Be treated like maybe in some sequences the lead to actors require their names

EDL	00:04:31,359	00:04:33,151	| 28-Movie-Title-Sequences |	And they'll actually list in the
EDL	00:04:33,151	00:04:36,479	| 28-Movie-Title-Sequences |	Exact percentage size that it needs to be bigger than the other titles in the sink
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:42,623	| 28-Movie-Title-Sequences |	Set very specific and it's in as a designer it gets very frustrating and challenging to deal with this because
EDL	00:04:42,623	00:04:44,159	| 28-Movie-Title-Sequences |	It feels very limiting
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:49,023	| 28-Movie-Title-Sequences |	To need to have every single title in the sequence be exactly the same size
