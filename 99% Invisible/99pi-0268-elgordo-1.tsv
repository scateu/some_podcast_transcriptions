EDL	00:14:27,583	00:14:28,351	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	House
EDL	00:14:28,351	00:14:29,375	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	It still feels
EDL	00:14:29,375	00:14:30,655	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	Kind of like a barn
EDL	00:14:34,495	00:14:36,799	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	He has a couple of big German Shepherds
EDL	00:14:36,799	00:14:38,591	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	You can hear one of them jumping into my mic
EDL	00:14:43,967	00:14:50,111	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	When I asked him if he's if he felt or still feels any regret or jealousy about not having a tick
EDL	00:14:51,135	00:14:51,903	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	He laughs
EDL	00:14:51,903	00:14:54,207	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	It's like it's a ridiculous question
EDL	00:14:55,743	00:14:59,583	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	For a while after so that those when reporters swarm the little town
EDL	00:15:00,095	00:15:02,655	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	They especially wanted to talk with Kostas
EDL	00:15:02,655	00:15:05,727	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	The one unlucky guy was left out of the lottery
EDL	00:15:07,007	00:15:08,799	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	But Kostas doesn't feel unlucky
EDL	00:15:09,311	00:15:11,615	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	In fact is anything he feels like
EDL	00:15:11,615	00:15:13,151	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	He got something that day too
EDL	00:15:13,663	00:15:14,687	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	He's a filmmaker
EDL	00:15:14,687	00:15:16,479	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	And the David Town won the lottery
EDL	00:15:16,991	00:15:19,551	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	He grabbed his camera and went to the plaza
EDL	00:15:19,551	00:15:21,087	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	The moment that happened
EDL	00:15:21,087	00:15:24,415	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	He was literally like somebody was giving me a script in
EDL	00:15:24,415	00:15:28,511	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	He filmed all the celebrating and he's been filming ever since
EDL	00:15:28,511	00:15:30,559	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	He says it's been really interesting
EDL	00:15:30,559	00:15:33,375	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	See what happens when a whole town gets well fall at once
EDL	00:15:34,399	00:15:40,031	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	The whole thing is like a social experiment with really
EDL	00:15:40,543	00:15:41,567	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	Fast results
EDL	00:15:41,567	00:15:42,079	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	Study
EDL	00:15:42,847	00:15:45,663	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	And see what an event like this can do to people
EDL	00:15:46,431	00:15:47,455	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	Is not always for good
EDL	00:15:48,479	00:15:53,343	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	Cuz he thinks the people and said it. Become a little more insular since the wind
EDL	00:15:53,343	00:15:58,207	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	More focused on the nuclear family and less on the town as a community
EDL	00:15:58,207	00:16:01,535	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	You do see how it's affecting how they have changed how they have
EDL	00:16:02,047	00:16:02,559	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	Closed
EDL	00:16:03,327	00:16:04,095	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	Before that
EDL	00:16:04,095	00:16:05,631	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	All the doors were constantly
EDL	00:16:06,399	00:16:11,263	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	The way he talks about it makes me wonder if the people in the town will like the film when they see it
EDL	00:16:11,775	00:16:13,055	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	Because he says
EDL	00:16:13,055	00:16:14,079	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	Do you think they will
EDL	00:16:14,591	00:16:15,103	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	Mostly
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:18,687	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	Maybe if you do small things they might not like it
EDL	00:16:19,199	00:16:20,479	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	But that that's reality
EDL	00:16:28,415	00:16:30,207	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	One thing about set at though
EDL	00:16:30,207	00:16:30,975	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	Thoroughbreds
EDL	00:16:31,487	00:16:31,999	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	A lot of them
EDL	00:16:32,511	00:16:35,839	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	Luckily this is also one of the things I'm able to say in Spanish
EDL	00:16:40,191	00:16:41,727	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	Another thing about said that though
EDL	00:16:41,727	00:16:42,239	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	It's hot
EDL	00:16:43,007	00:16:49,151	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	Mari Carmen the former Secretary of the housewives Association tells me it's not usually this hot until later in the summer
EDL	00:16:54,271	00:16:55,551	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	This heat she says
EDL	00:16:55,551	00:16:56,575	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	I just can't
EDL	00:16:56,575	00:16:57,087	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	What does he
EDL	00:16:57,855	00:17:02,719	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	As we walk around so that those she's pointing at a few houses that have been fixed up with Lottery money
EDL	00:17:07,327	00:17:11,423	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	But mostly Mari Carmen says the town hasn't changed that much
EDL	00:17:11,935	00:17:16,031	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	So that was the town of farmers and some of them installed new irrigation
EDL	00:17:16,031	00:17:17,567	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	Thumbs are bought new tractors
EDL	00:17:18,335	00:17:22,687	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	Some people made modest additions to their homes but nothing that extravagant
EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:25,503	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	Get overnight service
EDL	00:17:25,503	00:17:31,135	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	I'm like kosice Mari Carmen hasn't noticed the town being more closed off since the lottery
EDL	00:17:31,647	00:17:35,999	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	She thinks there's been some little jealousies here and they're not everyone one the same amount
EDL	00:17:36,511	00:17:41,887	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	But overall she thinks it's been an incredible thing for everyone in this little working-class town
EDL	00:17:41,887	00:17:43,679	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	To live without the worry of death
EDL	00:17:44,447	00:17:48,287	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	She's been battling cancer which keeps going away and coming back
EDL	00:17:48,287	00:17:50,335	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	And the money's allowed her to stop working
EDL	00:17:50,335	00:17:51,359	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	And not worry
EDL	00:17:51,359	00:17:57,503	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	I need the phone number for me personally
EDL	00:17:57,503	00:17:59,295	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	The lottery has juice
EDL	00:17:59,295	00:18:00,575	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	Broad sense of calm
EDL	00:18:01,343	00:18:02,111	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	I don't know like
EDL	00:18:02,623	00:18:04,415	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	To have they do they cover that you know
EDL	00:18:06,207	00:18:09,023	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	And that's the thing with this Syndicate style Lottery
EDL	00:18:09,023	00:18:10,303	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	Unlike the Powerball
EDL	00:18:10,303	00:18:13,631	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	I bought which keeps hundreds of Millions on one or two lonely winners
EDL	00:18:14,143	00:18:17,983	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	The money from the Christmas Lottery get divvied up among thousands of people
EDL	00:18:18,495	00:18:20,799	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	And they don't generally win enough to buy mansion
EDL	00:18:20,799	00:18:21,311	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	Yachts
EDL	00:18:21,823	00:18:23,615	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	They want enough to pay off their debts
EDL	00:18:24,127	00:18:25,151	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	Maybe buy a Honda Civic
EDL	00:18:25,919	00:18:28,991	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	The lottery brings wealth to a whole geographic area
EDL	00:18:28,991	00:18:31,295	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	Distributed relatively evenly
EDL	00:18:31,807	00:18:34,111	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	At least among those lucky enough to have a ticket
EDL	00:18:35,135	00:18:40,255	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	After a short walk Mari Carmen and I arrive at the new office of the housewives Association
EDL	00:18:40,767	00:18:45,887	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	Which now to be more modern is officially called the women's Association
EDL	00:18:45,887	00:18:48,191	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	Everyone still seems to call it the Housewives
EDL	00:18:48,191	00:18:48,959	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	Association
EDL	00:18:49,983	00:18:53,055	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	Back in 2011 when they were selling lottery tickets
EDL	00:18:53,567	00:18:54,591	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	The group kept
EDL	00:18:54,591	00:18:55,615	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	Or for themselves
EDL	00:18:56,127	00:18:57,663	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	Which ended up winning them
EDL	00:18:57,663	00:18:58,431	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	400
EDL	00:18:58,431	00:18:59,455	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	Thousand Euros
EDL	00:18:59,967	00:19:00,991	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	The time
EDL	00:19:00,991	00:19:04,063	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	Enough to cover their budget for the next 200 years
EDL	00:19:09,951	00:19:15,839	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	With all the new money they fix up an old school building in town and made it into their office / Community Center
EDL	00:19:16,607	00:19:20,447	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	As a nice kitchen for parties a laundry room and a fitness center
EDL	00:19:20,959	00:19:22,495	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	Queso Panela Dinero
EDL	00:19:24,031	00:19:26,847	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	All of these was made with Lottery money
EDL	00:19:27,359	00:19:29,663	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	These living room was built
EDL	00:19:29,663	00:19:30,943	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	Description
EDL	00:19:30,943	00:19:34,015	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	And the association gave coasties some money for his film
EDL	00:19:35,295	00:19:37,087	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	Is Olivia
EDL	00:19:39,903	00:19:41,439	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	I don't remember how my
EDL	00:19:41,439	00:19:44,767	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	MattyB was 15000 Euros or how much
EDL	00:19:44,767	00:19:45,791	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	I don't know it was a good day
EDL	00:19:46,303	00:19:48,095	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	But she also mentions that
EDL	00:19:48,095	00:19:49,631	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	He hasn't finished it yet
EDL	00:19:51,679	00:19:52,447	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	Everyone is waiting
EDL	00:19:58,591	00:19:59,359	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	Either is or anything
EDL	00:20:00,383	00:20:04,479	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	The people here in the village are waiting like what's up
EDL	00:20:08,575	00:20:11,391	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	Mari Carmen isn't the only one to mention this to me
EDL	00:20:11,903	00:20:14,975	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	It actually seems to be the Talk of the Town
EDL	00:20:14,975	00:20:17,791	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	A little later that day I run into a group of older guys
EDL	00:20:18,303	00:20:21,119	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	When I tell them I met with coasties one of them says
EDL	00:20:21,119	00:20:23,679	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	El Que hizo la pelicula
EDL	00:20:23,679	00:20:24,959	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	The one who made the movie
EDL	00:20:25,471	00:20:27,519	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	Paranormal represent
EDL	00:20:27,519	00:20:29,311	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	But he hasn't even come out with it yet
EDL	00:20:30,591	00:20:35,455	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	I told him I think it'll be another year before the film is finished and he says
EDL	00:20:36,223	00:20:37,759	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	But it's already been five
EDL	00:20:38,527	00:20:41,087	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	Another guy comes in and says
EDL	00:20:41,599	00:20:45,183	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	Didn't win the lottery but he's done quite well for himself
EDL	00:20:45,951	00:20:46,719	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	He says
EDL	00:20:46,719	00:20:49,535	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	He's been getting paid for all the television interviews he's done
EDL	00:20:50,303	00:20:52,607	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	Then they talked about how much he's been getting paid
EDL	00:20:53,119	00:20:53,887	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	Mucho
EDL	00:20:54,911	00:20:55,935	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	I could have you.
EDL	00:20:56,703	00:20:57,471	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	Idaho
EDL	00:20:57,471	00:21:01,567	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	For the record Kostas told me he's never been paid for any interviews
EDL	00:21:02,079	00:21:06,175	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	Conspiracy theories aside I got the feeling the people inside at the like
EDL	00:21:06,943	00:21:10,015	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	The strange Greek artist who lives on the outskirts
EDL	00:21:10,015	00:21:10,783	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	Town
EDL	00:21:10,783	00:21:15,903	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	But I also wondered if they see him as an outsider and if the lottery is made this even more pronounced
EDL	00:21:16,672	00:21:19,232	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	When I asked Marie comment about this she says
EDL	00:21:19,232	00:21:20,000	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	No
EDL	00:21:20,000	00:21:20,768	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	He's one of us
EDL	00:21:21,792	00:21:23,584	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	We just wish you'd come out with that movie
EDL	00:21:26,912	00:21:30,240	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	Economist have long struggled to figure out why people play the lottery
EDL	00:21:30,752	00:21:33,056	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	It's not a rational investment of your money
EDL	00:21:33,568	00:21:34,848	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	The odds of winning
EDL	00:21:34,848	00:21:35,872	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	Are terrible
EDL	00:21:35,872	00:21:37,152	| 99pi-0268-elgordo-1 |	Worse than blackjack
