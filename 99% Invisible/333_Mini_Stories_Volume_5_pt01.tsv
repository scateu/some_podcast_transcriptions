EDL	00:07:58,719	00:08:00,767	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Or maybe the top two floors of a church

EDL	00:08:17,151	00:08:18,943	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Hunted for all these crumbling remains of

EDL	00:08:20,479	00:08:22,783	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Across the continent especially the Mediterranean
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:23,551	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	And rescued
EDL	00:08:24,063	00:08:25,855	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Vibranium to this one spot
EDL	00:08:26,367	00:08:28,159	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	And the kind of fund it
EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:29,183	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Became a resort
EDL	00:08:29,695	00:08:33,023	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	I've never seen anything like it cuz usually you think of Hotel it's a building
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:35,071	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	But this is 35 building
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:36,607	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	In an isolated area
EDL	00:08:37,119	00:08:38,143	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	At each building
EDL	00:08:38,655	00:08:40,703	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	I mean besides the other restaurants
EDL	00:08:40,703	00:08:43,519	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Supports like a miniature Disneyland
EDL	00:08:44,799	00:08:46,847	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Except unlike Disneyland everythingfx
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:49,919	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Play real like it's all actually old architecture
EDL	00:08:50,687	00:08:51,967	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	But apparently
EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:53,503	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	I mean here I have his books
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:58,367	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	But you can even look at pictures of it these are my dad's my dad's literature
EDL	00:08:59,391	00:09:03,743	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	But it still looks quite Disney ask because it's all painted these bright colors
EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:04,511	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Yeah
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:06,047	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	It really does that mean it's like
EDL	00:09:06,815	00:09:08,607	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	I would have never thought it was real
EDL	00:09:09,631	00:09:11,167	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	From what I've seen of it
EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:15,263	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Yeah it's crazy it's almost like why would you go to the effort of doing it for real
EDL	00:09:15,775	00:09:17,823	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	It looks so fake
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:20,639	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	But it does remind me that when we look at
EDL	00:09:21,151	00:09:22,431	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Old architecture
EDL	00:09:23,199	00:09:23,711	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	We
EDL	00:09:24,223	00:09:27,551	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Expect to see the weathering of it and if you really do restore it
EDL	00:09:27,551	00:09:30,367	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	It is bright and shiny and odd and
EDL	00:09:30,367	00:09:32,159	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Brightly colored in pink and
EDL	00:09:32,159	00:09:33,695	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Bright yellows and things like that
EDL	00:09:33,695	00:09:35,487	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Public clock Williams Ellis County
EDL	00:09:35,999	00:09:38,303	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	The step further cuz he added
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:39,583	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	You like adding stuff
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:43,167	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	You put in fake windows that weren't really very like
EDL	00:09:43,167	00:09:43,935	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Pokemon
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:48,287	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	And he added stairways that didn't go anywhere just cuz he thought they looks
EDL	00:09:48,287	00:09:49,055	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Teaneck
EDL	00:09:49,055	00:09:50,847	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Aldi's wine teapot
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:53,407	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	He also kind of like
EDL	00:09:54,175	00:09:55,967	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Turned it into this Tutti Frutti
EDL	00:09:56,479	00:09:57,759	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Playground of
EDL	00:09:57,759	00:09:58,783	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Actual
EDL	00:09:59,295	00:10:01,855	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	And the cool thing was
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:08,255	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	It was post-modernism before post-modernism looks like a lot of styles that we would recognize
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:08,767	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Smashing
EDL	00:10:09,279	00:10:14,911	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	You know Colonnades on villazon Gothic clock towers
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:16,447	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	I'm painting it all bright colors
EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:19,519	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	And so in a weird way I can mess up
EDL	00:10:19,519	00:10:21,055	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Extra crazy in the 60
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:22,847	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	No one was
EDL	00:10:22,847	00:10:23,359	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Doing that
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:26,175	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Although
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:30,783	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	You may be without having gone through post-modernism you would just see it as this
EDL	00:10:31,551	00:10:33,087	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	A weird collage
EDL	00:10:33,087	00:10:34,367	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Whereas we might
EDL	00:10:34,367	00:10:35,391	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Now how the
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:37,951	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Language of
EDL	00:10:37,951	00:10:44,351	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Disney and cheesy post-modernism to apply to this thing like maybe it looks cheap to us because of our
EDL	00:10:44,351	00:10:46,143	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Our lived experience of these things
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:47,167	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	But it might have
EDL	00:10:47,167	00:10:50,751	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Just felt opulent amazing to somebody before postmodernism exist
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:52,287	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	How do you say that
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:56,383	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Architecture critic Lewis Mumford wrote in 1964
EDL	00:10:56,383	00:11:02,783	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Portmeirion is a gay deliberately irresponsible reaction against the Dulce realities of so much that passes

EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:47,071	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	I was there for the prisoner Appreciation Society weekends
EDL	00:11:47,071	00:11:51,167	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	People walking writeaprisoner costumes they were re-enacting I remember episodes
EDL	00:11:51,167	00:11:53,727	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	My dad was there for this thing called pork

EDL	00:11:55,263	00:11:59,359	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	What does basically like a giant cosplay event for the prisoner
EDL	00:11:59,359	00:12:03,711	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Where everyone they do parades and they pretend to abduct people and they the giant balloon
EDL	00:12:03,711	00:12:04,991	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Putting around
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:06,783	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Everyone's wearing striped capes

EDL	00:12:08,063	00:12:09,087	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Except my dad
EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:10,367	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	You know it was a little
EDL	00:12:10,367	00:12:12,159	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Little Matt's is a little to buy a
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:14,463	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	I enjoyed the spectacle I wasn't up for the life
EDL	00:12:14,975	00:12:16,767	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	What kind of coconut is my dad's
EDL	00:12:16,767	00:12:17,791	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Favorite show
EDL	00:12:17,791	00:12:19,071	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Who loves this show
EDL	00:12:19,071	00:12:21,375	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	And so for him it was kind of visiting
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:23,167	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	An old friend
EDL	00:12:23,167	00:12:24,959	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Cuz like they tried to remix
EDL	00:12:24,959	00:12:25,727	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	The prisoner
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:26,495	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Kind of recently
EDL	00:12:26,495	00:12:27,519	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	They tried to do
EDL	00:12:27,519	00:12:29,055	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	American version of it
EDL	00:12:29,055	00:12:29,567	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	It was Tara
EDL	00:12:30,335	00:12:31,103	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Who's terrible
EDL	00:12:31,103	00:12:32,383	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	I don't know what else to say it was
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:33,407	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Parable because
EDL	00:12:33,407	00:12:36,479	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	My dad says it just can't work without the main star and visionary
EDL	00:12:36,991	00:12:39,039	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Check my device is the one who made it weird
EDL	00:12:39,551	00:12:41,343	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	But it also couldn't work
EDL	00:12:41,343	00:12:42,623	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Without Portmeirion
EDL	00:12:42,623	00:12:45,183	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	I think if the prisoner were done in like a Star Trek thing
EDL	00:12:45,951	00:12:49,535	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	It it wouldn't work but made it so incongruous that you weren't
EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:51,839	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Natural environment of these beautiful old building
EDL	00:12:51,839	00:12:55,423	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	That's what I think made it even more horrifying because it was so pleasant
EDL	00:12:55,423	00:12:56,959	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	It was so cute and it was so Charmed
EDL	00:12:57,471	00:12:58,751	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	At Owasso analog
EDL	00:12:59,263	00:13:01,823	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	And so that's the cool thing about
EDL	00:13:01,823	00:13:05,407	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	The Prisoner and Portmeirion itself it's not trying to be too
EDL	00:13:06,175	00:13:06,943	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Attributed
EDL	00:13:06,943	00:13:07,711	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	The past
EDL	00:13:07,711	00:13:09,247	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Or a vision of the future
EDL	00:13:09,247	00:13:10,015	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	It's just
EDL	00:13:10,015	00:13:10,783	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Kind of dislike
EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:12,575	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Amalgamated alter
EDL	00:13:12,575	00:13:16,415	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Ternative reality but in a weird way in both cases
EDL	00:13:16,415	00:13:17,183	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Portmeirion
EDL	00:13:17,183	00:13:18,207	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	And the Prisoner
EDL	00:13:18,719	00:13:19,743	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	They just
EDL	00:13:19,743	00:13:22,047	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Turn into alternate realities that look like what we have
EDL	00:13:22,815	00:13:25,119	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Today Casino
EDL	00:13:25,119	00:13:29,983	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Postmodernism and Disneyland and also this like World of constant surveillance and
EDL	00:13:29,983	00:13:30,751	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Constance Uranus
EDL	00:13:31,263	00:13:32,799	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	It shows that the
EDL	00:13:33,311	00:13:35,359	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	The sort of fantastic nightmare that
EDL	00:13:35,871	00:13:36,639	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Mcgoohan was
EDL	00:13:36,639	00:13:37,151	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Predicting
EDL	00:13:37,919	00:13:40,223	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	In some cases are certainly not technologically pasa
EDL	00:13:40,735	00:13:42,271	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	That's totally why I still
EDL	00:13:42,783	00:13:43,295	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Where the shark
EDL	00:13:46,623	00:13:48,927	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	It is very soft that's awesome thank you April
EDL	00:13:49,951	00:13:56,351	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Ksenia
EDL	00:13:56,351	00:14:02,751	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Next
EDL	00:14:02,751	00:14:04,287	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	This is producer Vivien Leigh
EDL	00:14:05,823	00:14:10,175	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	So I'm just remembering right now that the first time you appeared on this show
EDL	00:14:10,175	00:14:16,575	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Was last year's many stories before you were a staff member at 9 p.m.
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:22,463	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Oh nice Ron so great so happy you're here and so what is your mini story as a
EDL	00:14:22,463	00:14:23,487	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	A staff member
EDL	00:14:23,999	00:14:26,047	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	So I'm going to start this with another question
EDL	00:14:26,815	00:14:27,583	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	So
EDL	00:14:27,583	00:14:29,631	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	You travel a lot right
EDL	00:14:30,143	00:14:30,911	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	And
EDL	00:14:30,911	00:14:31,679	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	You trouble with device
EDL	00:14:33,471	00:14:34,495	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Okay
EDL	00:14:34,495	00:14:36,287	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	So have you ever been on the road
EDL	00:14:36,799	00:14:37,823	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	And one of your batteries
EDL	00:14:38,591	00:14:43,967	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Runs out of power on the phone it's like 5 or 6 p.m. consistently that's the way it is
EDL	00:14:43,967	00:14:49,087	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Right yeah oh yeah it's it's the rule as around the battery but how useful would it be
EDL	00:14:49,087	00:14:51,135	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	If I told you that there was an AC free
EDL	00:14:51,647	00:14:53,439	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Battery powered battery charger
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:54,975	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	That would let you fully charged
EDL	00:14:54,975	00:14:56,255	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	That one battery
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:14:57,023	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	And all it needs
EDL	00:14:57,535	00:14:59,839	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Are 12 batteries of the same type
EDL	00:14:59,839	00:15:02,143	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Charge that one dead battery
EDL	00:15:02,655	00:15:06,495	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	That doesn't sound very useful that sounds a little
EDL	00:15:08,031	00:15:09,311	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	It's not useful
EDL	00:15:09,311	00:15:10,591	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	But at the same time
EDL	00:15:10,591	00:15:12,127	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	It's not entirely
EDL	00:15:12,127	00:15:12,639	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Unused
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:15,455	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	That's true that's true it's not
EDL	00:15:15,455	00:15:17,759	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Entire leg still use that thing
EDL	00:15:17,759	00:15:23,647	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	That monstrosity that you are describing a battery powered battery charger is something that
EDL	00:15:23,647	00:15:24,671	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Actually exist
EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:26,975	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Wow and it's one example of something called
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:27,743	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Chindogu
EDL	00:15:27,743	00:15:30,559	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Which is the art of Designing nearly useless gadgets
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:33,887	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Wow okay so what do you mean exactly by nearly useless
EDL	00:15:34,399	00:15:37,727	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	So I change okay with a very specific type of invention that
EDL	00:15:37,727	00:15:38,751	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Sets out to solve
EDL	00:15:38,751	00:15:39,775	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	One particular problem
EDL	00:15:40,287	00:15:45,663	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	But it actually ends up causing so much more of an inconvenience that it's almost entirely useless
EDL	00:15:45,663	00:15:49,247	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	So in the case of the battery powered battery charger you'd
EDL	00:15:49,247	00:15:55,647	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Technically solve your problem with having one dead battery but you make a much larger Problem by draining 12
EDL	00:15:55,647	00:15:58,463	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Other batteries
EDL	00:15:58,463	00:16:03,327	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	So it comes from the Japanese word chin meaning weird or strange and dogu meaning tools
EDL	00:16:03,327	00:16:04,351	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	So strange 2
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:06,655	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Another example
EDL	00:16:07,167	00:16:08,447	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	They're literally
EDL	00:16:08,447	00:16:11,519	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Thousands of them
EDL	00:16:11,519	00:16:17,663	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	A pair of high heels with training wheels attached the heels so if you're just learning how to walk in high heels you have a little
EDL	00:16:18,943	00:16:22,527	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Okay right there there's is done kitty litter box
EDL	00:16:22,527	00:16:28,927	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	So you can practice the art of sand raking while you're cleaning up cat, but do you want to know what my favorite
EDL	00:16:28,927	00:16:31,743	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Absolutely need to know
EDL	00:16:32,255	00:16:33,279	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Solar powered flashlight
EDL	00:16:36,863	00:16:43,263	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Technically could use it but you wouldn't really actually use it
EDL	00:16:43,263	00:16:48,383	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	So where do these ideas come from does anyone actually make them or they just ideas
EDL	00:16:48,383	00:16:54,527	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	So you can probably tell by the name but it started in Japan with a man named Kenji kawakami
EDL	00:16:54,527	00:16:56,319	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Meet Kenji kawakami
EDL	00:16:56,319	00:16:59,135	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Japan famous inventor of the useful
EDL	00:16:59,135	00:17:00,415	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Anixter
EDL	00:17:00,415	00:17:02,975	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	His Creations range from Umbrellas for shoes
EDL	00:17:03,487	00:17:05,023	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Two hairs flashcards
EDL	00:17:05,023	00:17:06,047	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Two chopsticks
EDL	00:17:06,047	00:17:06,815	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	With fans
EDL	00:17:07,327	00:17:10,911	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Soquel, you'd study to Aeronautical Engineering in college
EDL	00:17:10,911	00:17:14,495	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	And he's always been interested in engineering and design and
EDL	00:17:14,495	00:17:18,847	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	He came up with the concept and started making his own creation sometime in the 1980s
EDL	00:17:18,847	00:17:21,663	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	But somehow we actually ended up in publishing
EDL	00:17:21,663	00:17:23,455	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Which is kind of how
EDL	00:17:23,455	00:17:24,735	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Chindogu took off
EDL	00:17:24,735	00:17:28,319	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	So what kind of posting was he doing was he's busy polishing these
EDL	00:17:28,319	00:17:34,719	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Like these items so in the early 90s he was the editor of a Japanese catalog called mail-order life
EDL	00:17:34,719	00:17:40,607	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Which is you know what one of those home shopping magazines and so there's this one month when he realized
EDL	00:17:40,607	00:17:47,007	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	There was some spare blank pages in the back so instead of just leaving the blank he decided to include some images of these
EDL	00:17:47,007	00:17:53,407	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Unuseless inventions that he been tinkering around in his workshop with so you know they were for sale anything--but
EDL	00:17:53,407	00:17:59,807	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	So he had a solar-powered flashlight which I mentioned earlier and
EDL	00:17:59,807	00:18:02,623	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Also a pair of I drop classes which are
EDL	00:18:02,623	00:18:05,951	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Essentially a pair of glasses with funnels over the lenses
EDL	00:18:05,951	00:18:07,487	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	So you can just
EDL	00:18:07,487	00:18:13,887	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Put eye drops in a funnel directly into your eyeballs like little holes Donuts
EDL	00:18:13,887	00:18:16,703	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	The other three years ended up getting such a kick out of them
EDL	00:18:16,703	00:18:23,103	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	But you know she started putting chindogu and every issue after that it's after a few years of doing this this American Dream
EDL	00:18:23,103	00:18:26,175	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Listen translator named and Poppy I came across it
EDL	00:18:26,175	00:18:28,735	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	And he was like I have to
EDL	00:18:28,735	00:18:34,879	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Spread this to the rest of the world and so the two of them together founded the international chindogu Society
EDL	00:18:35,391	00:18:36,927	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Established the 10:10
EDL	00:18:36,927	00:18:37,695	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Chindogu
EDL	00:18:38,719	00:18:44,863	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Stewby's have rule so it was a what are some of the tenants to make it a truly a true chindogu
EDL	00:18:45,375	00:18:49,727	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Okay so the first rule is that itching dogu has to be almost completely useless
EDL	00:18:50,239	00:18:53,567	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	So if you created something that's actually useful
EDL	00:18:53,567	00:18:55,103	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	You failed your done
EDL	00:18:55,615	00:19:02,015	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	The second rule is that it has to actually exist so you have to actually build a Jindo go
EDL	00:19:02,015	00:19:02,783	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Wondering that's okay
EDL	00:19:02,783	00:19:04,063	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	You can't just make this
EDL	00:19:04,063	00:19:06,111	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Hypothetical even kneel like that
EDL	00:19:06,623	00:19:12,767	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	A picture of the mail order catalog actually have to make the cat
EDL	00:19:13,279	00:19:14,815	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Cool and
EDL	00:19:14,815	00:19:17,887	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	So the third was actually my favorite it says
EDL	00:19:17,887	00:19:20,959	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Inherent in every chindogu is the spirit of Anarchy
EDL	00:19:21,727	00:19:23,007	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	And then it goes on to say
EDL	00:19:23,007	00:19:29,407	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	They represent freedom of thought and action the freedom to challenge the suffocating historical dominance of conservative
EDL	00:19:29,407	00:19:35,551	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Utility I think I'm getting sold like a little bit of this is it
EDL	00:19:36,063	00:19:38,623	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Is an exercise in Rebellion
EDL	00:19:38,623	00:19:39,391	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Or
EDL	00:19:39,391	00:19:41,183	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	The Uber design
EDL	00:19:41,183	00:19:42,975	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Product that is perfect
EDL	00:19:42,975	00:19:46,047	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Text that had that does its job was great efficiency in his like
EDL	00:19:46,047	00:19:47,583	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	If I freeze you
EDL	00:19:47,583	00:19:50,399	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Weirdo inventions that don't
EDL	00:19:51,679	00:19:56,799	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Function but don't actually function well
EDL	00:19:56,799	00:19:59,615	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Utility and Design
EDL	00:19:59,615	00:20:01,919	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	But that is totally true
EDL	00:20:01,919	00:20:04,223	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Yeah and I mean it seems a little strange
EDL	00:20:04,223	00:20:10,623	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	To use absurdist design as a form of Anarchy but before kawakami got into publishing
EDL	00:20:10,623	00:20:11,391	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Was actually a radical
EDL	00:20:12,415	00:20:15,487	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	60s and 70s and so the spirit of
EDL	00:20:15,487	00:20:21,887	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Nonconformity and anti-consumerism there's something that's rooted in the concept of chindogu
EDL	00:20:21,887	00:20:23,679	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	A couple of other tenants that dictate
EDL	00:20:23,679	00:20:30,079	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	You can't sell the invention for money and you also can't patent it because it belongs to everybody
EDL	00:20:30,079	00:20:33,151	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Supposed to be like the embodiment of design without the restrictive
EDL	00:20:33,151	00:20:37,247	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Read materialism you can tell by the way that he talks about it like
EDL	00:20:37,759	00:20:43,135	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	I still use it kind of Purity he intended them to be fight like a fun way to change the world
EDL	00:20:46,463	00:20:50,559	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	I believe that if everybody shares my idea of changing perception for says
EDL	00:20:50,559	00:20:52,095	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	The world could change
EDL	00:20:52,863	00:20:54,143	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	One invention
EDL	00:20:54,655	00:20:55,679	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	At a time
EDL	00:20:57,215	00:21:00,287	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Is it what happened to chindogu as a movement
EDL	00:21:00,287	00:21:02,591	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Aldi's big lofty ideas
EDL	00:21:02,591	00:21:08,991	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Right right you know just spread internationally their chindogu societies and competitions all over the world but kawakami actually ended
EDL	00:21:08,991	00:21:11,551	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Putting a bunch of books out with
EDL	00:21:11,551	00:21:16,928	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	I'm useless inventions that he's made over the years or that people have submitted into the chindogu society
EDL	00:21:16,928	00:21:18,208	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	But since one of the tenants
EDL	00:21:18,720	00:21:23,584	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	I thought you can't make money from chindogu he actually ended up doing eating a lot of the money to charity
EDL	00:21:23,584	00:21:27,424	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Awesome ice
EDL	00:21:27,424	00:21:29,216	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	But I actually have one of us book
EDL	00:21:29,216	00:21:31,008	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Hear that was
EDL	00:21:31,008	00:21:35,104	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Published originally in 1995 and can you
EDL	00:21:35,104	00:21:35,616	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Tell me what you see
EDL	00:21:39,968	00:21:41,504	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	It is a camera
EDL	00:21:41,504	00:21:42,528	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	On a long stick
EDL	00:21:43,040	00:21:44,064	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	With a plunger
EDL	00:21:44,576	00:21:45,088	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	2
EDL	00:21:45,600	00:21:52,000	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Porsche the shutter of the camera this is a selfie stick
EDL	00:21:52,000	00:21:53,280	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Portrait camera
EDL	00:21:53,280	00:21:54,560	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Do it yourself without a
EDL	00:21:56,352	00:21:59,936	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	I know that it is a couple
EDL	00:21:59,936	00:22:01,984	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Target pictures with you in them
EDL	00:22:01,984	00:22:08,384	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	It can be embarrassing to ask someone to take a photo for you confusing if they don't speak your language even costly if the
EDL	00:22:08,384	00:22:10,176	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Third-party regard your camera as a gift
EDL	00:22:11,200	00:22:17,600	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	With a 57cm telescoping pole your dilemma is overspending to three times its length
EDL	00:22:17,600	00:22:20,672	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Companion in your environment
EDL	00:22:20,672	00:22:22,464	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Your only problem will be that
EDL	00:22:22,464	00:22:25,792	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	All your shots will capture you in the act of holding a pole

EDL	00:22:32,192	00:22:38,080	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Image of flan selfie stick years before the
EDL	00:22:38,080	00:22:39,616	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	The patent for the selfie stick
EDL	00:22:39,616	00:22:44,992	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	It came out so I don't know if kawakami failed at making
EDL	00:22:44,992	00:22:45,760	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	H&L go
EDL	00:22:46,272	00:22:50,880	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Or if we fail the societies because people are still using
EDL	00:22:50,880	00:22:51,648	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Healthy snacks
EDL	00:22:51,648	00:22:54,976	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	I think we felt this is society
EDL	00:22:55,488	00:22:57,280	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Thank you Vivian that's great thank you
EDL	00:23:22,880	00:23:26,464	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	So I'm in the studio with him at the church
EDL	00:23:26,976	00:23:28,000	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	How are you doing
EDL	00:23:28,000	00:23:30,560	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Good are you

EDL	00:23:38,496	00:23:40,800	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	And specifically it's about this
EDL	00:23:41,312	00:23:46,176	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Screen. In the mid-to-late 19th century
EDL	00:23:46,176	00:23:47,712	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Blue glass with a light
EDL	00:23:47,712	00:23:50,272	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Passing through a blue pane of glass
EDL	00:23:50,272	00:23:51,296	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Could solve
EDL	00:23:51,296	00:23:53,088	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Just about any problems deposit
EDL	00:23:53,088	00:23:53,856	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	We have
EDL	00:23:53,856	00:23:55,136	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	And this all goes back
EDL	00:23:55,136	00:23:56,928	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	To a civil war
EDL	00:23:56,928	00:24:01,280	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	General General Augustus J Pleasanton was a
EDL	00:24:02,048	00:24:03,840	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Soldier in the Civil War
EDL	00:24:03,840	00:24:06,144	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	And he was a gentleman scientist
EDL	00:24:06,144	00:24:07,424	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	She did a lot of reading
EDL	00:24:07,424	00:24:11,776	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	So this is Jenny Benjamin and she's the curator of the Museum of
EDL	00:24:11,776	00:24:18,176	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Asian in San Francisco
EDL	00:24:18,176	00:24:20,992	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	General Pleasanton and she says that you know
EDL	00:24:21,504	00:24:23,296	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	This armchair scientist
EDL	00:24:23,296	00:24:27,648	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	It really shooting from the hip and he had all kinds of wacky signs
EDL	00:24:30,976	00:24:34,304	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	You know that the blue color of the sky
EDL	00:24:34,304	00:24:38,400	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	There must be some inherent value to that color and that blue light
EDL	00:24:38,912	00:24:40,192	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Why was part of like what
EDL	00:24:40,192	00:24:41,472	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Facilitated the growth
EDL	00:24:41,472	00:24:43,776	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	The plants and animals in and biological
EDL	00:24:43,776	00:24:44,544	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Prophecies
EDL	00:24:44,544	00:24:46,592	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	So he built Pleasant
EDL	00:24:46,592	00:24:48,640	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	And that is felt a garden nursery
EDL	00:24:49,152	00:24:49,664	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	In his backyard
EDL	00:24:50,432	00:24:52,736	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	With alternating blue Plains
EDL	00:24:52,736	00:24:53,504	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Glass
EDL	00:24:53,504	00:24:54,272	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	And
EDL	00:24:54,272	00:24:56,064	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	He ran a quote experiment
EDL	00:24:56,576	00:24:57,856	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	I see how well they vegetables
EDL	00:24:58,624	00:25:00,160	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	This is like a greenhouse
EDL	00:25:00,160	00:25:03,232	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Yes like a drink but I didn't want to use the term Greenhouse
EDL	00:25:03,232	00:25:04,000	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Because
EDL	00:25:04,000	00:25:05,280	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	It was a blue house
EDL	00:25:07,584	00:25:13,984	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	NBC says quote experiment
EDL	00:25:13,984	00:25:15,776	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Gentleman scientist
EDL	00:25:16,288	00:25:19,104	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	But basically he was growing grapes
EDL	00:25:19,104	00:25:20,640	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Inside of this
EDL	00:25:20,640	00:25:21,152	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Glass

EDL	00:38:36,032	00:38:38,080	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Start out seeing like
EDL	00:38:38,080	00:38:39,616	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Whole mantle
EDL	00:38:39,616	00:38:41,664	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	And there was stockings on the mantle
EDL	00:38:42,176	00:38:46,016	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	It would slowly Zoom in to where you were just
EDL	00:38:46,528	00:38:47,808	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Seen the fire
EDL	00:38:48,320	00:38:49,344	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	And then
EDL	00:38:49,344	00:38:51,648	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	For the next 3 hours they would play
EDL	00:38:51,648	00:38:52,160	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Christmas music
EDL	00:38:53,696	00:38:57,024	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	It is classic Christmas music from the 1950s and 60s
EDL	00:38:58,048	00:39:03,168	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	So yeah so it's like a lot of orchestral kind of big band stuff like people like
EDL	00:39:03,936	00:39:05,728	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	The ray conniff singers
EDL	00:39:05,728	00:39:07,520	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Fred Waring and the

EDL	00:39:11,616	00:39:13,664	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	There's nobody that has more songs in the program
EDL	00:39:15,968	00:39:19,552	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Virginia log of Tombstone
EDL	00:39:21,344	00:39:22,880	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	I've always said that the program
EDL	00:39:23,392	00:39:25,696	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	If the program aired with a
EDL	00:39:25,696	00:39:27,232	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Great video of a fireplace
EDL	00:39:29,024	00:39:30,048	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Interior soundtrack
EDL	00:39:31,840	00:39:33,632	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Not done very well
EDL	00:39:33,632	00:39:36,704	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	But it's paired with a great soundtrack
EDL	00:39:36,704	00:39:37,728	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Chip loves
EDL	00:39:37,728	00:39:38,752	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Christmas music
EDL	00:39:38,752	00:39:42,592	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	He at some point he mentioned his list of top 500
EDL	00:39:42,592	00:39:48,736	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	The songs that I liked was like I didn't even know there were 500 Christmas song
EDL	00:39:50,528	00:39:51,296	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	That's great
EDL	00:39:53,088	00:39:59,488	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	So you're basically grew up with this Yule Log broadcast it was a Christmas Eve
EDL	00:39:59,488	00:40:00,256	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Tradition
EDL	00:40:00,768	00:40:06,400	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Yeah he and his family used to watch it together even though they they actually had a real fireplace
EDL	00:40:06,912	00:40:09,216	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	He did actually watch it beside me watch
EDL	00:40:09,728	00:40:11,008	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	The actual
EDL	00:40:11,008	00:40:12,800	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Program the actual footage
EDL	00:40:12,800	00:40:16,640	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Yeah like you would kind of gather around and put it on a new doll like
EDL	00:40:17,920	00:40:22,272	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Yeah oh yeah
EDL	00:40:22,272	00:40:23,808	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	It would be on one side of the room
EDL	00:40:23,808	00:40:26,112	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	The TV with the fireplace with
EDL	00:40:26,112	00:40:27,136	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	The other side
EDL	00:40:28,672	00:40:29,952	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Real fireplace
EDL	00:40:29,952	00:40:32,768	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	And we're probably watching you log more than we were the real car place
EDL	00:40:35,584	00:40:36,864	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Some New Yorkers love
EDL	00:40:36,864	00:40:39,168	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	This broadcast and eventually
EDL	00:40:39,168	00:40:41,216	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	The station decides they need to
EDL	00:40:41,216	00:40:44,800	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Therese shoot it because the film that they shot it on his
EDL	00:40:44,800	00:40:47,360	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Is deteriorating
EDL	00:40:47,360	00:40:48,896	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Who's actually a 17c
EDL	00:40:48,896	00:40:54,528	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Second Loop people Pepsi like
EDL	00:40:54,528	00:41:00,672	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	That's crazy so but you remember how like the first time they shot it they
EDL	00:41:01,184	00:41:07,584	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Play like Brenda a hole in the governor's drug will he did not forget

EDL	00:41:09,888	00:41:13,728	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	He would not let the back at Gracie Mansion because of the mishap at the rug
EDL	00:41:13,728	00:41:14,240	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	They need it
EDL	00:41:15,008	00:41:18,592	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Location he wouldn't let them go back there
EDL	00:41:18,592	00:41:22,176	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	And somehow in this part is kind of lost to history someone
EDL	00:41:22,688	00:41:25,760	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Found a very similar looking fireplace
EDL	00:41:25,760	00:41:27,040	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	And you'll never guess

EDL	00:42:06,463	00:42:06,975	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Yule log

EDL	00:42:12,095	00:42:13,375	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Is the original
EDL	00:42:13,375	00:42:14,399	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	But it's not the class
EDL	00:42:14,399	00:42:15,679	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Because most people
EDL	00:42:15,679	00:42:16,703	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Don't remember
EDL	00:42:16,703	00:42:17,215	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Original
EDL	00:42:19,007	00:42:20,031	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Wow

EDL	00:42:24,127	00:42:26,431	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	But then in 1990 Christmas Comes
EDL	00:42:26,431	00:42:27,199	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	And chips
EDL	00:42:27,199	00:42:29,247	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Turns on his TV just like you did

EDL	00:42:37,439	00:42:38,975	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Luckily for me I just
EDL	00:42:38,975	00:42:39,999	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Had a feeling.
EDL	00:42:40,511	00:42:42,303	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Love you forever and I recorded it
EDL	00:42:44,863	00:42:49,471	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Add a recording so he was fine but the rest of New York was just out of luck
EDL	00:42:49,471	00:42:51,775	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	And people were mad the station got a ton of letters
EDL	00:42:52,287	00:42:54,591	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Why did they take out there after 20 years
EDL	00:42:54,591	00:42:58,175	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	So the station got actually got a new program director
EDL	00:42:58,687	00:43:00,735	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	The new program director came in and
EDL	00:43:00,735	00:43:03,295	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	It's taking up too much
EDL	00:43:03,295	00:43:04,575	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Marshall time you'll take it off
EDL	00:43:05,343	00:43:07,647	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	Scrooge heartless
EDL	00:43:07,647	00:43:14,047	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	So it's a chip and a few other people actually started a petition to get it back on the air they set up a Wii

EDL	00:43:17,375	00:43:23,775	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	But yeah but nothing seemed to persuade the station that it was worth bringing back until actually 9
EDL	00:43:23,775	00:43:24,543	| 333_Mini_Stories_Volume_5_pt01 |	11
