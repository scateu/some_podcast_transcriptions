EDL	00:06:46,527	00:06:52,671	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	I don't think many people would say this as a church service that should be protected
EDL	00:06:54,207	00:06:57,791	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	That doesn't exclude them from obeying the walls of the United States
EDL	00:06:57,791	00:06:59,583	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	This is Ruth Ann Meyers
EDL	00:06:59,583	00:07:03,935	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	She became the ins District director for Arizona in 1984
EDL	00:07:04,447	00:07:08,031	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	She didn't oversee the investigation into the sanctuary movie
EDL	00:07:08,031	00:07:10,847	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	I meant but she was briefed on it when she arrived at the Phoenix
EDL	00:07:11,871	00:07:13,919	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Yeah I was totally surprised
EDL	00:07:13,919	00:07:17,759	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	In my experience I had no knowledge before of a church
EDL	00:07:19,039	00:07:21,855	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Breaking the law and harboring illegal aliens
EDL	00:07:22,367	00:07:24,159	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Smuggling and harboring
EDL	00:07:24,159	00:07:26,719	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Myers says the case was pretty straightforward
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:28,511	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	These people were breaking the law
EDL	00:07:29,791	00:07:31,327	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	The wall of the United States
EDL	00:07:32,607	00:07:37,215	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	I'm in favor of skews me where you go by migration but not illegal immigration
EDL	00:07:38,239	00:07:39,519	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	I think we have the right
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:43,871	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	To have our laws and to enforce them
EDL	00:07:44,895	00:07:47,711	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	And decide who comes into this country and who doesn't
EDL	00:07:49,759	00:07:54,623	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Cruising Graham along with a couple of other government agent spent 10 months Undercover
EDL	00:07:54,623	00:07:57,183	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Gathering evidence against the sanctuary workers
EDL	00:07:57,695	00:08:00,767	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Their methods would eventually come under public scrutiny
EDL	00:08:00,767	00:08:02,303	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Because they hadn't just
EDL	00:08:02,303	00:08:03,327	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Infiltrated
EDL	00:08:03,327	00:08:04,095	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Sanctuary movement
EDL	00:08:04,863	00:08:10,239	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	They were also secretly recording meetings conversations and in some cases church service
EDL	00:08:24,575	00:08:30,207	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	When they cry for help these undercover methods truck some people as offensive in over-reaching
EDL	00:08:30,207	00:08:35,583	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Here's Anthony Lewis then a professor at Harvard Law School speaking to ABC News in 1985
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:38,655	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	What's the message that bother me
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:39,935	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	I think
EDL	00:08:40,447	00:08:44,031	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Most of us Americans would believe that in America you
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:46,335	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Are entitled to a sense of
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:52,479	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Privacy when you go into a church maybe privacy of a particular kind you and your God
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:04,255	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	The state was infiltrating in secretly surveilling churches
EDL	00:09:04,767	00:09:08,607	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	In a country where the separation of church and state is a deeply held idea
EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:11,935	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	We reached out to two agents who were involved with the case
EDL	00:09:11,935	00:09:13,215	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Both declined to speak
EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:18,079	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	The people overseeing the investigation at ins. These methods were Justified
EDL	00:09:18,847	00:09:21,407	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	I saw the movement as more political than religious
EDL	00:09:21,919	00:09:23,967	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Yes there are many that thought it was
EDL	00:09:24,991	00:09:26,783	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Under the guise of the church
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:29,343	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Meaning the sanctuary workers were using religion
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:32,415	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	As a cover to push a political agenda
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:33,951	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	And undermine immigration law
EDL	00:09:34,463	00:09:39,583	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	And it's true that some Sanctuary volunteers were vocally critical of the American policy in Central America
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:43,423	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Some expressed support for the left-wing movements developing their
EDL	00:09:43,423	00:09:49,567	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	In fact there was divided within the movement itself about whether their work should be motivated primarily by humanitarian concerns
EDL	00:09:50,079	00:09:50,847	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Or political
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:55,967	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Let the beat got to the point where we decided to have a gathering
EDL	00:09:55,967	00:09:57,247	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	And
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:09:58,783	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	And try to resolve it
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:10:01,599	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	But two weeks before that meeting was supposed to happen
EDL	00:10:01,599	00:10:04,671	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	The government indicted 16 of the sanctuary workers in Tucson
EDL	00:10:05,183	00:10:05,951	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Including
EDL	00:10:05,951	00:10:06,463	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Rev 5
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:11,071	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	On January 14th 1985 federal agents swept down
EDL	00:10:11,071	00:10:15,679	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Arresting 63 Guatemalan and Salvadoran refugees across the United States
EDL	00:10:16,191	00:10:20,031	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	I'm handing out indictments just 16 of the sanctuary movement
EDL	00:10:20,031	00:10:22,079	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	That morning Reverend Fife was sleeping
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:24,383	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	When he heard someone banging on his front door
EDL	00:10:24,895	00:10:26,431	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	And so I got up and I
EDL	00:10:26,943	00:10:29,247	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Went to the door and there were two border patrol age
EDL	00:10:30,527	00:10:35,903	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Is immediate concern was for the refugees that we're staying at Southside Presbyterian Church
EDL	00:10:35,903	00:10:37,183	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Right across the street from his
EDL	00:10:37,951	00:10:39,487	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	The only thought that occurred
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:39,999	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	To me was
EDL	00:10:41,279	00:10:45,119	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	I got all these vulnerable people over in the church I need the key
EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:47,167	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Keep these guys occupied
EDL	00:10:47,167	00:10:48,447	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	So I invited him in
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:50,751	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Made coffee
EDL	00:10:51,263	00:10:52,031	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Stalled
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:54,335	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Every way I could
EDL	00:10:54,335	00:10:56,383	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	He read through the entire indictment
EDL	00:10:56,383	00:10:57,663	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	The officers have handed him
EDL	00:10:58,175	00:10:59,455	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Trying to buy some time
EDL	00:10:59,455	00:10:59,967	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	My
EDL	00:11:00,479	00:11:01,759	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Charges were
EDL	00:11:01,759	00:11:04,575	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Pretty clear in and they were pretty typical
EDL	00:11:04,575	00:11:05,087	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	If everyone
EDL	00:11:05,599	00:11:09,439	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	They were a number of counts of conspiracy to
EDL	00:11:09,951	00:11:11,487	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Violate federal law
EDL	00:11:12,255	00:11:16,607	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Harboring illegal aliens transporting illegal aliens in 1800
EDL	00:11:16,607	00:11:18,655	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Illegal aliens in everyone head
EDL	00:11:19,167	00:11:22,239	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Different counts under each of those categories
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:30,943	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Eventually the border patrol agents went on their way and Reverend Fife and the other leaders of the sanctuary movement world
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:32,479	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	The situation
EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:35,295	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	They faced an impending high-profile trial
EDL	00:11:35,295	00:11:37,599	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	In which they be facing off with the federal government
EDL	00:11:38,367	00:11:40,415	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	In the charges against them were serious
EDL	00:11:40,415	00:11:42,975	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	If convicted they could spend years in prison
EDL	00:11:43,487	00:11:46,303	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	They got to work assembling a team of lawyers to defend them
EDL	00:11:46,815	00:11:50,399	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	So is this true basis as I see it for sanctuary
EDL	00:11:50,911	00:11:52,191	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	It's very simple really
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:53,727	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	This is James Brosnahan
EDL	00:11:54,239	00:11:55,007	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	One of the defense
EDL	00:11:55,775	00:11:57,311	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	The first is religion
EDL	00:11:57,311	00:11:58,335	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	And
EDL	00:11:58,335	00:12:00,639	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Many churches many religion
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:04,223	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Have as a distinct
EDL	00:12:04,223	00:12:04,991	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Imperative
EDL	00:12:05,759	00:12:08,831	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	That you are to assist people who are on the road
EDL	00:12:09,343	00:12:12,671	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	And who are fleeing some form of violence oppression
EDL	00:12:12,671	00:12:14,207	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	It's the teaching of Jesus
EDL	00:12:14,975	00:12:21,119	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	The defense that there was an argument to be made that the sanctuary workers were just acting in accordance with their face
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:28,287	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Not only that the lawyers believed the religious rights of the sanctuary workers had been violated by the gov
EDL	00:12:28,287	00:12:30,847	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	German agents who infiltrated their churches

EDL	00:12:32,895	00:12:36,479	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	And that's intimidation of people who are pursuing
EDL	00:12:36,479	00:12:38,271	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Their Bible studies
EDL	00:12:38,271	00:12:39,295	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Eric Church
EDL	00:12:39,295	00:12:43,135	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	The second part of the defense's argument had to do with Asylum law
EDL	00:12:43,135	00:12:46,719	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	The law provides that when a person shows up at
EDL	00:12:46,719	00:12:47,231	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	The Border
EDL	00:12:47,999	00:12:50,047	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	And they are fleeing certain
EDL	00:12:50,047	00:12:53,887	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Specific kinds of Oppression or violence they have a right to come in
EDL	00:12:55,167	00:12:59,519	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	And one that is true and that can be established in an immigration
EDL	00:12:59,519	00:13:00,799	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Court that person
EDL	00:13:01,311	00:13:02,591	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Is entitled to

EDL	00:13:05,663	00:13:07,199	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	That's Asylum
EDL	00:13:07,199	00:13:12,831	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	As a defense team research the laws they started to believe that their clients hadn't really violated the law at all
EDL	00:13:12,831	00:13:14,111	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	They thought the US government have
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:16,159	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	I did research
EDL	00:13:18,719	00:13:21,023	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	How the United States government was handling
EDL	00:13:21,023	00:13:27,423	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Asylum applications from people from Central America and I also researched international law this is

EDL	00:13:29,215	00:13:31,007	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Another lawyer for the sanctuary Valen
EDL	00:13:32,031	00:13:34,079	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	And I was appalled by
EDL	00:13:34,079	00:13:36,639	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	What I discovered about how the United States government
EDL	00:13:37,407	00:13:39,967	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Was systematically it seem denying
EDL	00:13:39,967	00:13:42,783	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Asylum applications from Central America
EDL	00:13:42,783	00:13:47,135	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	This was all happening in the context of a major shift in US Refugee policy

EDL	00:20:16,767	00:20:19,839	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	The sanctuary jury deliberated for more than 48 hours
EDL	00:20:19,839	00:20:21,375	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Spread over 9 days
EDL	00:20:21,375	00:20:23,679	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	On May 1st 1986
EDL	00:20:23,679	00:20:27,775	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	16 months after the indictments in more than six months since the start of the trial
EDL	00:20:27,775	00:20:30,591	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Jury filed into the courtroom to read the verdict
EDL	00:20:31,615	00:20:34,687	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Of the eleven Sanctuary workers who went to trial
EDL	00:20:34,687	00:20:36,479	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Read work with it of all charges
EDL	00:20:36,991	00:20:38,527	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	8 more found guilty
EDL	00:20:38,527	00:20:40,063	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Including rev-5
EDL	00:20:40,063	00:20:41,599	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Which head Bates Butler
EDL	00:20:41,599	00:20:42,111	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	The lawyer
EDL	00:20:42,623	00:20:43,391	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Really hard
EDL	00:20:44,671	00:20:47,487	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	After the jury came in I was so disgusted
EDL	00:20:52,607	00:20:53,375	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Whistle system
EDL	00:20:55,423	00:20:59,263	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Now that I have worked in for so long I didn't know part of it
EDL	00:21:03,871	00:21:05,407	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Then we were so upset
EDL	00:21:05,919	00:21:07,199	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Better government
EDL	00:21:07,199	00:21:08,479	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	In our court system
EDL	00:21:09,503	00:21:10,015	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Had
EDL	00:21:11,295	00:21:13,087	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Cast aside our clients
EDL	00:21:13,599	00:21:16,672	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	With her moral positions and then we felt like the government
EDL	00:21:17,440	00:21:18,976	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	And of course were bankrupt
EDL	00:21:18,976	00:21:20,512	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	The system was bankrupt
EDL	00:21:21,024	00:21:23,584	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	But the other defense lawyer James Brosnahan
EDL	00:21:23,584	00:21:25,888	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Had known there were significant hurdle
EDL	00:21:25,888	00:21:26,656	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	They needed to over
EDL	00:21:27,936	00:21:34,080	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	You know juries are very good but they come in to the box with their own attitude and the attitude is
EDL	00:21:34,080	00:21:36,128	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	People just can't come over the Border
EDL	00:21:36,128	00:21:37,920	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	You got to do that you got to pay the price
EDL	00:21:38,432	00:21:40,480	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Ruth Ann Myers of the ins
EDL	00:21:40,480	00:21:42,016	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Thought the verdict was fair
EDL	00:21:42,016	00:21:46,880	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	The people that worked in the sanctuary movement did not present those people to
EDL	00:21:46,880	00:21:47,904	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Immigration officer
EDL	00:21:48,416	00:21:50,464	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	They smuggle them into the US
EDL	00:21:50,464	00:21:51,744	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	They gave them
EDL	00:21:51,744	00:21:54,048	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Quote sanctuary in their churches
EDL	00:21:54,048	00:21:55,584	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	They did not follow the law
EDL	00:21:57,120	00:21:57,888	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Next
EDL	00:21:57,888	00:21:59,680	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Can the sentencing by the judge
EDL	00:21:59,680	00:22:02,752	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	We really were worried that the judge was going to put them in
EDL	00:22:02,752	00:22:04,544	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Prison my attorney told me
EDL	00:22:04,544	00:22:06,592	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Take a toothbrush in your hip pocket
EDL	00:22:06,592	00:22:08,384	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	When you go to sentencing
EDL	00:22:08,384	00:22:09,408	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Because they want you bad
EDL	00:22:11,456	00:22:13,760	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	So I had made arrangements
EDL	00:22:14,528	00:22:17,088	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	With the congregation and with my family in
EDL	00:22:18,112	00:22:18,624	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	And everything
EDL	00:22:19,136	00:22:21,184	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Expecting to go to prison
EDL	00:22:22,464	00:22:23,744	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	And much to our astonishment
EDL	00:22:24,512	00:22:26,304	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	He sentenced all of us who
EDL	00:22:26,304	00:22:27,072	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	You were convicted
EDL	00:22:27,072	00:22:28,096	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Two five years probation
EDL	00:22:28,864	00:22:31,424	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	The judge gave them relatively lenient sentences
EDL	00:22:31,424	00:22:32,960	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Considering they've been convicted of
EDL	00:22:33,472	00:22:34,240	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Some cases
EDL	00:22:34,240	00:22:37,568	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Felonies so we were relieved at that point
EDL	00:22:38,848	00:22:39,616	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	I think
EDL	00:22:39,616	00:22:43,712	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	I don't know what he said but I thought that if he
EDL	00:22:43,712	00:22:46,272	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Gave these nice people to jail term
EDL	00:22:46,272	00:22:47,296	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	It would be awful
EDL	00:22:48,064	00:22:50,624	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Publicopiniononline
EDL	00:22:50,624	00:22:53,952	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	And I think he had some some senses that might be true
EDL	00:22:57,536	00:22:58,816	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Many of the sanctuary
EDL	00:22:58,816	00:23:00,608	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Workers including rev-5
EDL	00:23:00,608	00:23:03,680	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Went back to their communities and continue their work in the same shoe
EDL	00:23:05,216	00:23:06,496	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Churches continued Sheltering
EDL	00:23:07,264	00:23:09,312	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Volunteers continued helping p
EDL	00:23:09,312	00:23:10,080	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	People across the border
EDL	00:23:10,848	00:23:13,408	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Many of the sanctuary volunteers had made
EDL	00:23:13,408	00:23:15,712	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Clear in their closing arguments in the trial
EDL	00:23:16,224	00:23:17,760	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	But they wouldn't stop doing the work
EDL	00:23:19,040	00:23:20,576	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	The government may have sent
EDL	00:23:20,576	00:23:23,648	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	John 5 and 7 other Sanctuary activist
EDL	00:23:23,648	00:23:26,208	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	But it is hardly silence them nor stop
EDL	00:23:26,208	00:23:28,000	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	7 from a cross-country Crusade
EDL	00:23:29,280	00:23:35,680	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	At that point of the government just back off I mean they must have known that you were continuing to do exactly
EDL	00:23:35,680	00:23:36,960	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Play what they just tried you for
EDL	00:23:38,496	00:23:40,544	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	They backed off us here in Tucson
EDL	00:23:41,056	00:23:43,104	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	But they tried one more trial
EDL	00:23:43,104	00:23:49,248	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	In New Mexico the government charged a man and a woman who were part of the sanctuary movement for transporting undocumented immigrants
EDL	00:23:50,016	00:23:52,320	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	And the jury in that case
EDL	00:23:52,320	00:23:53,344	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Found them not guilty
EDL	00:23:54,112	00:23:55,648	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	And if that point
EDL	00:23:55,648	00:23:56,416	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	We knew
EDL	00:23:56,928	00:23:58,720	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	That the movement had
EDL	00:23:59,232	00:24:00,256	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Grown
EDL	00:24:00,256	00:24:02,816	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	To the point where juries would no longer
EDL	00:24:03,328	00:24:03,840	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Sanctuary
EDL	00:24:05,632	00:24:12,032	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Not long after the criminal trial attended a group of churches and Refugee Rights organizations filed a class action law
EDL	00:24:12,032	00:24:13,312	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Lawsuit against the government
EDL	00:24:13,312	00:24:19,712	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	They alleged among other things that the government had engaged in discriminatory treatment of Asylum claims made by Guatemalans
EDL	00:24:19,712	00:24:20,480	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Salvadorans
EDL	00:24:20,992	00:24:22,272	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	In 1990
EDL	00:24:22,272	00:24:23,808	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	The government settle the lawsuit
EDL	00:24:24,320	00:24:25,856	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	They agreed to
EDL	00:24:26,368	00:24:30,464	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Give everyone it was here without documents from those countries

EDL	00:24:37,632	00:24:40,448	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	So we essentially
EDL	00:24:41,728	00:24:43,264	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Began to wind down the sanctuary
EDL	00:24:45,312	00:24:47,104	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	But even though the churches were slowing there were
EDL	00:24:47,616	00:24:50,176	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	The whole idea of sanctuary was spreading
EDL	00:24:50,944	00:24:54,016	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	College campuses cities counties even holes
EDL	00:24:54,016	00:24:56,064	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	States began to declare themselves anxious
EDL	00:24:57,088	00:24:59,136	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	And not just for refugees fleeing

EDL	00:24:59,904	00:25:01,952	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	But for undocumented people more Broad
EDL	00:25:03,232	00:25:05,536	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	This accelerated through the 1980s
EDL	00:25:05,536	00:25:06,816	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Has continued up

EDL	00:25:07,584	00:25:09,888	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	But what exactly Sanctuary means
EDL	00:25:09,888	00:25:11,680	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Varies from place to place
EDL	00:25:11,680	00:25:12,960	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Anything you want
EDL	00:25:12,960	00:25:15,520	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	That's part of the problem

EDL	00:25:31,904	00:25:35,744	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	In some places police aren't allowed to inquire about a person's immigration status
EDL	00:25:35,744	00:25:38,560	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	Or to give that information to the federal government

EDL	00:26:01,088	00:26:05,440	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	He's threatened to pull Federal funding from cities that identify as sanctuaries
EDL	00:26:05,952	00:26:08,768	| 99pi-0250-state-sanctuarypart2--1 |	And he's also promised to accelerate deportation
