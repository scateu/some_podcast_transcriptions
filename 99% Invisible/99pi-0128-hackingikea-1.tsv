EDL	00:07:18,527	00:07:20,831	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	Materials like why aren't they just
EDL	00:07:21,343	00:07:22,111	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	Going in
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:25,183	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	Lumber and screws and nails and
EDL	00:07:25,695	00:07:27,487	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	Hammering together something
EDL	00:07:27,487	00:07:29,791	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	Maybe more lasting and less pressboard
EDL	00:07:30,815	00:07:33,887	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	Well they're not just hacking and materials right there hacking Ikea
EDL	00:07:34,655	00:07:36,703	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	They're hacking the brand they're hacking
EDL	00:07:36,703	00:07:37,983	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	What that what that
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:40,543	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	Brand actually symbolises Beyond

EDL	00:07:42,079	00:07:44,639	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	Put another way to quote Danielle and Jonathan
EDL	00:07:44,639	00:07:47,455	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	They're mocking the modularity of Ikea
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:52,319	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	Sing this stuff is so tinkertoy I can mix and mashup the hell out of it
EDL	00:07:52,831	00:07:54,367	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	It also goes back to that
EDL	00:07:54,367	00:07:56,159	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	Homogeneity right that if
EDL	00:07:56,159	00:07:58,207	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	This is the McDonald's in furniture
EDL	00:07:58,207	00:08:01,023	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	I'm going to go against the grain and make a double
EDL	00:08:01,023	00:08:07,423	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	Triple extra pickle Big Mac with no middle bun in it right is part of your identity you're saying I'm a
EDL	00:08:07,423	00:08:08,703	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	Person who transforms things
EDL	00:08:09,215	00:08:11,775	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	But this is where it gets even more complicated
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:13,055	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	According to Jonathan
EDL	00:08:13,055	00:08:14,079	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	Within that group
EDL	00:08:14,079	00:08:14,847	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	People who wanted to
EDL	00:08:15,871	00:08:17,151	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	Completely transform something
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:20,735	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	Some of them really wanted to maintain the icky aesthetic
EDL	00:08:20,735	00:08:22,527	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	So they would say about this is something we want
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:24,063	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	That could have come from
EDL	00:08:24,831	00:08:25,599	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	I didn't
EDL	00:08:25,599	00:08:27,135	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	So there's a sort of
EDL	00:08:27,135	00:08:27,647	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	Sense of
EDL	00:08:28,671	00:08:30,975	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	Sure you want express yourself but you're also trying to see

EDL	00:09:44,191	00:09:46,239	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	This is the best part
EDL	00:09:46,239	00:09:48,799	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	We're about to drill unsanctioned holes
EDL	00:09:58,271	00:10:01,855	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	So why is this your favorite song

EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:09,535	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	Is destructive
EDL	00:10:09,535	00:10:10,047	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	And
EDL	00:10:11,071	00:10:11,583	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	Wrong
EDL	00:10:12,863	00:10:19,007	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	And we were doing that and it still transgressive in Deer Crossing a boundary but it's not the destruction anymore
EDL	00:10:19,519	00:10:22,079	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	Creation and you know it felt like for once
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:23,871	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	I wasn't just saying
EDL	00:10:23,871	00:10:29,759	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	What's out there you know which which one on the menu do I want I wish we were making what we want

EDL	00:10:49,471	00:10:50,495	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	The corporate world that never was
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:53,055	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	You're 5 or 6 years ago and I think
EDL	00:10:53,567	00:10:54,591	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	Part that is is
EDL	00:10:54,591	00:10:57,151	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	Corporation seeing that this adds to the
EDL	00:10:58,431	00:10:58,943	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	Buying in bulk
EDL	00:10:59,455	00:11:05,087	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	Products and yes this is the moment in the story what we do the ironic tape to tape a juxtaposition
EDL	00:11:05,087	00:11:05,599	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	Maestro
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:14,815	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	Earlier this week Swedish flat-pack furniture manufacturer Ikea Delta massive blow to the long-running fan
EDL	00:11:14,815	00:11:16,863	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	Ikeahackers.net
EDL	00:11:17,375	00:11:23,263	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	According to a blog post published by founder Jules Yap the site was issued a cease-and-desist order in March
EDL	00:11:24,031	00:11:29,919	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	This is the news that we alluded to at the beginning around the same time that Sean and Jonathan were hacking together his bed
EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:31,455	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	Unbeknownst to them
EDL	00:11:31,455	00:11:35,295	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	A brand protection company wrote to the queen bee of Ikea Hack them
EDL	00:11:35,295	00:11:38,623	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	The woman who runs ikeahackers.net Jewels yeah
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:40,159	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	Jules isn't her real first name
EDL	00:11:40,671	00:11:43,487	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	The letter basically said that Ikea was not amused
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:47,327	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	And that if Jules didn't stop operating her website the way she was
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:49,631	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	She could be in big trouble
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:50,655	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	Hey Jules
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:57,055	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	Hi how are you
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:11:58,591	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	Jules agreed to talk to me
EDL	00:11:58,591	00:12:00,639	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	She was in Malaysia we talked by Skype
EDL	00:12:01,407	00:12:04,735	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	Before we get down to business I was just curious how she thought up the side
EDL	00:12:04,735	00:12:07,551	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	So I was checking out a few
EDL	00:12:07,551	00:12:10,367	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	Home decor websites and I found
EDL	00:12:11,391	00:12:12,159	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	IQ
EDL	00:12:12,671	00:12:14,463	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	They're scattered around on the internet
EDL	00:12:14,975	00:12:16,767	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	That was when I thought
EDL	00:12:17,279	00:12:20,863	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	How great it would be blow if I could see all these Heights in one place
EDL	00:12:21,631	00:12:26,239	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	No and that was when the light bulb
EDL	00:12:26,239	00:12:27,263	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	I knew I had to start it
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:29,311	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	So that was in 2006
EDL	00:12:29,823	00:12:32,127	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	And for some reason only this year
EDL	00:12:32,127	00:12:33,151	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	2014
EDL	00:12:33,663	00:12:34,943	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	March 12th to be precise
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:38,271	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	Did Jules get an email with the subject line
EDL	00:12:38,783	00:12:42,111	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	Notification of violation of trademark rights
EDL	00:12:42,879	00:12:43,391	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	Wow
EDL	00:12:44,415	00:12:48,511	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	So I stopped my blood drain literally no I was
EDL	00:12:48,511	00:12:49,791	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	It was
EDL	00:12:49,791	00:12:50,303	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	Scary
EDL	00:12:50,815	00:12:54,655	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	Did they want her to do I'm Hanover the domain name
EDL	00:12:54,655	00:13:00,799	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	Stop using the Ikea trademark or anything trademarks by Ikea which I think means even pictures of the furniture
EDL	00:13:01,567	00:13:06,175	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	And she'd have to close down her Twitter and Facebook accounts to another social media staff
EDL	00:13:06,943	00:13:10,271	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	The thing that's ironic about this thing that I didn't understand right away
EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:11,551	| 99pi-0128-hackingikea-1 |	Wisdom
