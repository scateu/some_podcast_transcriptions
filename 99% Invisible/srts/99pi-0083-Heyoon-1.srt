This is 99% invisible

19
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:15,776
I'm Roman Mars

20
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:20,384
Met last time I went out there was 2005 us

21
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,920
Early stages dating this lady

22
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,504
I went over to ask the guys had this crazy dream

23
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:32,160
Where you and I we're like walking through a field and and camp on a spaceship

24
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:34,720
You want to go there

25
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:37,024
You like what you talking about

26
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:40,864
I know that's a place we can go we can go it's not far

27
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,984
I finally saw this place she was just like overtaken with

28
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,384
How magical it was too to see this thing that just doesn't seem real

29
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,784
Why are you guys taking us out to the middle of nowhere

30
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,184
Don't know where we're going to go it's a secret

31
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:11,584
I was really lucky to grow up in Ann Arbor we had a great record stores in Ann Arbor

32
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,608
Palace movie theater

33
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:15,424
And of course Ann Arbor is the home of the University of Michigan

34
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,728
So there was a lot going on for small town

35
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,776
But it was a small town

36
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:20,800
And I

37
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:21,568
Was a misfit

38
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:24,384
And like a lot of young Misfits in small towns

39
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,432
I was bored and disaffected and angry

40
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:29,248
That Misfit is Alex Goldman

41
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:33,088
He's a producer at the radio show on the media may now lives in New York City

42
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,952
I hated High School I was a bad student and most of my friends went to different schools

43
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:38,976
In fact

44
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,280
Although I come by Alex my entire life

45
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,816
That's actually my middle name

46
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,352
My first name is Michael

47
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:47,168
And for at least half of my high school career

48
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:49,216
My teachers and peers all called me Mike

49
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:53,568
It was like I walked around pretending to be a completely different person for most of my way

50
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,384
I felt like I didn't belong anywhere

51
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:01,504
I desperately wanted to escape this oppressively small town that felt completely devoid of wonder

52
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,552
And then I found her

53
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,888
Okay where are we

54
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:25,312
I hope someone brought a flashlight

55
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,152
It's take my body

56
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:36,064
The only way you found out about Hayden was if someone took you there

57
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:39,136
It was like there was the secret Club of kids who knew about it

58
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,696
I got initiated when I was 15

59
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,000
You drive out in the middle of nowhere

60
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,280
Deep in the country

61
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:48,608
Impark alongside this dirt road

62
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,912
We've got to get over that fence

63
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:53,216
There's this fence that you had to climb over

64
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:59,360
The sign on a guy's I don't know about that the sign read turn back on back

65
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,408
This is private private property

66
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,712
You're not welcome here for any reason

67
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:04,736
Please

68
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:05,504
Now

69
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:09,088
Turn back and leave in peace turn back and leave in peace

70
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,904
It almost felt like a dare

71
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:15,488
This is going to change your life

72
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,280
Once you are over the fence

73
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,071
You pass along side a white farmhouse

74
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,607
The guy that owns that house

75
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:28,799
That he shot a kid full of rocks off reading near his house

76
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:33,663
In the kid alive

77
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:39,039
A path behind the house led to this thin line of trees but once you made it through the trees you're in this huge field

78
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,087
And there was something else there in the field

79
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:45,695
Something man-made something really big

80
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:59,519
Forgot to do when we get up to that clearing

81
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:05,919
Fast as you can until you see it

82
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,679
Whoa

83
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,983
Welcome to Hae Eun

84
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,775
It's beautiful

85
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,871
The structure is made mostly of wood

86
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:39,199
With a canopy of Teflon and nylon stretched over a metal frame

87
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:44,063
From the base there were stairs leading up to a platform about 10 feet off the ground

88
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,391
Suspended over a boulder up about the size of a Volkswagen bug

89
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:51,487
At the top of the stairs there were these two pieces of glass in the floor

90
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:55,327
And one night a friend stood underneath with the letter while I look down from on top

91
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,631
There was an etching on one of those pieces

92
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,167
It said

93
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,447
The Hayden Pavilion

94
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,751
Hey

95
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,847
The Hayden Pavilion

96
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,895
There was other signage to

97
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,687
One sign that Turtle welcome to there

98
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:11,967
This Pavilion

99
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,247
Is a work of art

100
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:17,343
Designed and carefully put together for more than 2 years

101
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,647
How many workmen artisans

102
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:25,791
If you buy some happenstance are now here in this place please take pleasure and serenity

103
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,095
But please do not disturb it

104
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,655
Nordic face it's Beauty in anyway

105
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:34,239
It's beauty alone is your reward for Meandering here

106
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,543
For your respect

107
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:40,127
The spirit of a designer artist will leave you in peace

108
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,919
But then right next to that

109
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,455
There was this other side

110
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:45,247
It said and I'm quoting

111
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,551
If you are here you shouldn't be

112
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:51,135
Is it privately owned Farm off-limits to Outsiders

113
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:56,767
You have crossed clearly marked keep out and no trespassing signs on fence lines and Gates

114
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:57,791
Please

115
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,071
Now

116
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:02,911
Respect the owner's privacy by leaving this place in peace

117
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,191
Thank you

118
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:08,287
Some of the no trespassing signs may have backfired a little bit

119
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:13,151
Because there was like this I feel like there's a sort of contrariness two teenagers where it's like

120
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:15,711
Well if there's that many no trespassing signs

121
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,247
Be awesome

122
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,599
I rounded up a few of my high school friends and talk to them about hey you

123
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:24,671
It seems like it's still as entrenched in their mind

124
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,207
As it has been in mine

125
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:29,023
It was a blue my mind first time I saw it

126
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,559
I'd best describe a union

127
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,375
Who's never seen it

128
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,191
Biggest

129
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:42,591
That's maybe the size of a small house or Hut and it looks like a hot air balloon with a jellyfish mushroom mushroom

130
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,871
Assertive

131
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:44,639
Telescope

132
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:49,503
Observatory spaceship a rocket ship

133
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,295
Or something that looks

134
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,319
Very alien

135
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:56,159
Foreign sitting in the middle of that Big Field

136
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:58,207
The place definitely has a Stonehenge

137
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,095
There were a number of myths about why he was there

138
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,655
That was built to commemorate the owners dead daughter

139
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,703
There was built along Ley lines

140
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:14,335
That was created for a wedding ceremony that it was designed for paganistic rituals are for stargazing

141
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:19,711
The place was such an enigma there's no way you could have known it was out there someone didn't take you to it

142
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,783
The first person who founded has been lost to history

143
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,319
By the time I was taking there

144
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:27,903
It was an oral tradition handed down from one group of teens to the next

145
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,975
Part of its power was that in being Secret

146
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,511
I created a community

147
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,047
Bound people together

148
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:37,631
Appealing for an angry 15 year olds it was

149
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:38,911
A secret

150
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:39,935
Sneaky

151
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:42,239
Teenagers only like

152
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:45,311
Kids versus adults secret time

153
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:51,711
Hyun was was mysterious beautiful and peaceful and it just kind of reassured

154
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:58,111
About all of your inner turmoil your of your deeper questions I guess it's almost like it was designed to

155
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:04,511
Inspire teenagers in the local area to come out there and hang out and drink beer and smoke pot and

156
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:07,583
You know kind of capture their imagination

157
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,935
I probably went out there once every couple of months for the next 4-5 years

158
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:15,775
We go out there and drink do drugs sometimes just talk

159
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,847
And of course it was always thrilling to bring new people out there

160
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:22,687
Indoctrinate our secret Club

161
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:26,527
Plenty of romantic relationship started out there

162
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:31,647
The first time I made out with someone who became my girlfriend happened while we were sitting on Hayden during a rainstorm

163
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,999
It was otherworldly and magical it fell out of time

164
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,303
And it felt like it was ours

165
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:43,167
Going to visit a unit was the perfect mixture

166
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,447
Danger

167
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,983
And secrecy and

168
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:49,567
To capture fifty-year-old Alex's imagination

169
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:52,639
For the next decade-and-a-half

170
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,943
Even after I moved away in 2001

171
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:57,759
I was fixated on trying to find out why it was there

172
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:02,367
7 mm and 9 I wrote a letter to the white farmhouse we always snuck past on our way to hey you

173
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,159
Asking them if they were the owners

174
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:08,255
Alexander letter back they didn't own a yoon their neighbors did

175
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:10,047
Rita and Peter Hayden

176
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,887
That's when I realized that what we've been calling the Hayden Pavilion 4 years

177
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,935
Was actually the Hayden Pavilion

178
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:19,775
That Gaelic font made the D look kind of like a second o

179
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:22,335
And we'd only ever seen it in the middle of the night

180
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:25,663
If the names Rita and Peter heydon sound familiar

181
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:31,295
It's probably because they're nonprofit the Mosaic Foundation has been underwriting public radio for decades

182
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:36,415
By the Mosaic Foundation of Rita and Peter Hayden based in Ann Arbor

183
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:40,511
Honoring the literary arts and the universe of great ideas

184
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,559
Do good work

185
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,839
And keep in touch

186
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,031
I sent the Hayden's a letter

187
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:54,079
Apologizing for my youthful indiscretions

188
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,383
And asking them if I could interview them about hey you

189
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,431
Peter Hayden Road back

190
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:06,111
So you're one of the little too invaded our privacy by visiting our Pavilion when you were told at many places along the way now

191
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,135
Not to be there

192
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:11,487
This was in 2009 before I was a public radio for

193
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,303
I was just a guy New Yorker fix computers

194
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:17,119
And a guy who used to trespass on the Hayden property

195
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:21,215
The rest of his letter was friendly but he wasn't too keen on talking to me

196
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:25,311
I couldn't let it go that I communicated with the creator of Hae Eun

197
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,615
And that the mystery could be solved

198
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,151
It drove me bonkers

199
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,199
So in 2012

200
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:33,247
After working in public radio for a couple years

201
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:35,807
Now I had a better excuse to try to talk to Hayden

202
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,599
And I decided to try again

203
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,903
Peter Hayden can be a hard man to read

204
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,719
He doesn't use email he doesn't always answer the phone

205
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:47,839
He was reluctant to give an interview for fear of attracting even more people 2 a.m.

206
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:50,655
But after a couple phone calls in a few facts messages

207
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,471
He agreed to meet me for an interview about Hae Yoon

208
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:54,751
Hey you

209
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,055
It was like meeting the wizard

210
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:08,831
Yes I am hi nice to meet you

211
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,111
Let's go back up there

212
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:16,511
Okay which fits you want to go to the first gate just south of that white residents

213
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:22,399
Yeah and during the day

214
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,543
Certainly has

215
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,591
Computer

216
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:33,151
Alex nice to meet you nice to meet you Alex

217
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:36,479
Thank you so much for agreeing to do this yeah

218
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:41,855
I have mixed feelings about as you can imagine the at-bat in my effort to try and respect the Hayden's privacy

219
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:44,671
I offered to refer to the Pavilion only as hey you

220
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,951
And not use his name

221
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:49,279
But he told me from the beginning that he wasn't interested in an annuity

222
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,815
He was interested in privacy

223
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:53,631
I don't think that I want this to be anonymous

224
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,191
I wanted to be with my name is

225
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:56,959
Attached to it

226
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:01,311
But that doesn't mean to say that we have to violate our privacy we don't have to tell where it is we don't have to

227
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:05,151
To say whatever I mean if you said Ann Arbor that's good enough note most people would not know

228
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:09,247
I was actually going to be even less specific I was going to say Southeastern Michigan

229
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:15,647
To give people less of a so my name from our credit in PR

230
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,671
Eden Peter Hayden

231
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,951
Based in Ann Arbor

232
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:24,351
Honoring the passion of NPR journalists all around the world whose stories take us there everyday

233
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,631
Harbor that's what it says

234
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,399
Always

235
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,727
Peter Hayden told me that Hayden was designed by a friend of his

236
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,775
An artist and designer named Joseph kinnebrew

237
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:36,127
1978

238
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,687
When a massive blizzard came through in snow the men

239
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:42,527
We were trapped in our house down at the bottom of the hill for 5 days

240
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,551
Just the four of us

241
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,855
We got to know each other quite well during that period

242
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:49,695
I think Joe is nuts and I like being around him I find him

243
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,975
Can a person I'm not

244
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:54,047
Close

245
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,327
That's brain

246
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,863
McKenna Breeze came back for a visit

247
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:03,263
And I we went to a downtown restaurant we got absolutely suddenly drunk

248
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:08,639
We had planned and he said I'm going to build you a pavilion I said okay will do this invite by dusk

249
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,455
But we decided we come out here and look at this field

250
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,479
Send

251
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:19,135
Position where the pavane was going to be have a flashlight

252
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:25,791
Watch these two stumbling drunk walking across the field and Joe said I can't see you nice

253
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:26,559
He said

254
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:30,655
Place an order for me to see you I've got to have a light and I said what's I going to be

255
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:31,935
Isabel

256
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:38,335
Here's a piece of the New York Times when you do a florist we'd let the stand are we could set the whole field of light we've eaten

257
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,127
And so

258
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:44,479
That was exactly the spot where I was standing with his burning newspaper

259
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,271
It was funny stuff to

260
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:50,111
Watches working at night

261
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:55,743
And running around with a burning newspaper

262
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,279
Decided to build hey you

263
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:02,143
Peter paid for the parts and labor design for free

264
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:09,311
I found that the creation of helium came out of the same sort of drunken Antics my friends and I would get into

265
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,615
2 almost two decades later the same spot

266
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,431
That you could trace its origin story back to a sleepover

267
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:19,295
Peter couldn't give me any particular reason for its existence

268
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,599
It just there because it is

269
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,135
Because it's beautiful

270
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,671
Because it's art

271
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:28,767
Do I was a professor of English at the University of Michigan for 20

272
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,047
For five years

273
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,863
Sorry in the 1960s and up

274
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:36,447
So I do not have a kind of anesthetic

275
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,775
View of what

276
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,311
Or is

277
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:42,847
It teaches you

278
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,127
Steps

279
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,919
By which wisdom is gained

280
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,991
In that sense art is useless

281
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,783
It doesn't have any Pratt

282
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,575
Golang pack and sew for me

283
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:54,367
This Pavilion was always sort of that

284
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,135
It was

285
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,159
Something that

286
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:57,695
Was

287
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,255
Place for contemplation in place for

288
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,535
Pleasure

289
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:05,375
For enjoyment for conviviality with people that I chose to be here

290
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,215
Peter's relationship with Hayden feels like an echo of the possessiveness

291
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,239
The secretiveness

292
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:13,055
The ownership that me and my friends all feel for

293
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,383
The only difference is that Peter actually owns it

294
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,687
Like us he feels protective of it

295
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:19,967
Unlike us

296
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,503
He's actually responsible

297
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,039
Over the years

298
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:27,391
He said to clean up the mess left by drunk teens and even some damage left by Vandals

299
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:31,743
Unlike you I'll explore some heads that came out here and actually did some damage

300
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,303
So we had to repair that is ax

301
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,071
The cut the

302
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,095
Covering

303
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,399
We know there were parties out here we had

304
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:42,239
Candles and things like that sometimes it looks like there maybe it have been

305
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:45,567
Religious things going on here that may have been

306
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,615
Poetry readings and it was

307
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,151
You don't think of him as a sex

308
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:53,503
You know I don't think you were orgies out here I think a couple would come out here and

309
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:54,783
Weather Berea

310
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:57,343
Compelling to be part of nature out here

311
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:58,879
Ynobe

312
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:01,951
When was the nature especially in full moons and stuff that was always a very

313
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,511
Seem to be the tractor times

314
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,279
People be out here

315
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,351
I'm sure you know

316
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:11,935
Was talking to my friends about the signage that's out front and the

317
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,727
The first sign the sign that says you know

318
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:18,591
Prospectus and leave this in peace congratulations this is your reward for finding this

319
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,527
But anyway please continue

320
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:29,855
Well I have the reason I say that is because one of my friends said to me

321
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:32,159
I kind of believe that they wanted us to go out there

322
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,951
They wanted us to find it and

323
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:36,767
And that's why there are so many signs daring us to

324
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:37,791
To visit it

325
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:42,655
No that's absolute fabricated that's that's wishful thinking on your part nothing like that of the sort we wanted

326
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:45,983
If I Choose You Liza that's my business that's my religious

327
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:46,751
Experience

328
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:47,519
It's not a

329
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,823
Kumon Temple for everyone to utilize

330
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,615
It's funny you should put it that way

331
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:54,687
Because that's exactly how my friends and I all felt about it then

332
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,711
I still do now

333
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:57,247
Even though we ourselves

334
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,015
For trespassers

335
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:01,087
One of my friends I talk to you for the story Jason vanmatre

336
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:01,855
Put it this way

337
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:04,159
They were like certain kids who would I would talk to her

338
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,695
Oh yeah that

339
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,487
That Pavilion out there I

340
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,511
I took a six pack

341
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:10,559
Wasted out there

342
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:13,887
I feel

343
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,167
A little bit hurt by that

344
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,471
You just going out there

345
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,239
Drink

346
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,007
He's talking about

347
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,543
Your 30 pack of

348
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:21,567
People riding zebras

349
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,335
Dalian like

350
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:24,895
Sacrilege

351
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,687
It's like my shirt

352
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,455
It's like

353
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:28,735
Sacrilege

354
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:29,503
My church

355
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:32,831
When we found trash at Hayden left over from other people

356
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,367
My friends and I would clean it up

357
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:36,415
Or at least try to minimize our impact on the

358
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,719
Buffer Peter that doesn't matter

359
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,511
We are all just a bunch of

360
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:41,535
Interlopers

361
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:43,327
Did you go to Pioneer High School

362
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:46,399
Actually went to all three I went to Pioneer community and

363
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:52,799
And here on in the course of my troubled High School

364
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:56,127
The English language you were able to read things especially something it's

365
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,919
Subtle like that like that

366
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:03,039
But I would challenge you to say that was an invitation it was not an invitation was really meant to say look

367
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,367
Here's the fact you're here

368
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,927
You come to this place

369
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:13,791
I don't want you to do any damage and I don't want to piss you off so here's what I'm telling you

370
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,351
You know leave

371
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,911
Admire its beauty but leave

372
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,703
Don't stay here leave

373
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:25,567
And I think that was the message that I wanted to I wouldn't want them so I didn't because you know spending

374
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:30,175
20 minutes in your sock drawer as opposed to 5 if it's for 2 minutes in your sock drawer

375
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,455
It's just

376
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:34,015
It's okay if you can kind of

377
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,575
Fluted to me in some ways when people

378
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:42,719
Didn't know didn't invite had nothing to you had no knowledge of and who

379
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,511
Whose values and whose

380
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:48,351
The sense of Aesthetics are not the same as mine I felt that he has a personal violation

381
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:51,423
Talking with Peter I can see how much he values privacy

382
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,471
And having control over the stuff he owns

383
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:57,823
He hired a former cop to drive a decommissioned police car around his property

384
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:02,175
Scott lights and sirens and a logo that says rph security

385
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:04,223
As in Rita and Peter Hayden

386
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,271
He says it's mostly to keep out Hunter

387
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,063
What I say is like we don't allow

388
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,343
Hunter's we allow

389
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,367
A hunter

390
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,903
Who hunts this property

391
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:14,463
He's entitled to take one Buck a year

392
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:19,071
His many doses he wants and when he did catch kids that we're out there to sneak into Hayden

393
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:22,655
He make them give their names and addresses and make them write letters of apology

394
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,447
He still has a lot of those letters

395
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:27,263
Gift for all Peters possessiveness of Hae Eun

396
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,799
He doesn't actually do a lot with

397
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,847
You know the place itself

398
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,663
Is not meant to be used

399
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,199
For me anyway

400
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,991
Another words it's it's

401
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:37,759
Perfectly

402
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:40,063
Good being by itself not having any Auto

403
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:40,831
Kittens

404
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:46,719
Peter has private wine tastings winter twice a year and he Yuan and maybe he'll Wander over to it from his house from time to time

405
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:47,999
But that's pretty much it

406
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,535
And it doesn't really matter

407
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,583
Peter's the actual owner of

408
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:53,119
He can do anything he wants with it

409
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,399
He can use it

410
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,423
You cannot use it

411
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:58,239
Even talk to me about how he thought of tearing it down

412
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,287
And you can it's his prerogative

413
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,847
The way he can get to it doesn't get you

414
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,151
Is under total control of the Hayden

415
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:07,455
But when you think about design intent

416
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:09,759
What humans actually designed to do

417
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:14,111
Then one other person for whom it might be fair game to weigh in

418
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:16,928
This guy so happy

419
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:21,024
In spite of Peters unhappiness about Interlopers

420
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:21,792
That

421
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:22,816
Young people

422
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:25,376
Amen to sneak a peek

423
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,424
This of course

424
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,448
Is Joseph kinnebrew

425
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,984
The designer taehyung

426
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:34,080
The guy who got drunk and set newspapers on fire with Peter Hayden back in the day

427
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:39,456
He left Michigan decades ago and never had any idea that a unit become such an underground attraction

428
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:40,992
He's taken

429
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,528
Somewhat different than Peter

430
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,856
I'm delighted I'm absolutely delighted

431
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:47,136
How could I not

432
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,160
Feel

433
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,280
Good about what you did even though you weren't supposed to you're all quite naughty

434
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:55,584
That's quite alright

435
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,656
It's one of those things that life should include

436
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,216
Granted

437
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:02,240
Joseph kinnebrew

438
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,520
On my Peter Hayden

439
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,056
Doesn't have to deal with

440
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,080
Interloper

441
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:09,408
Coming on his property doing god-knows-what under the cloak of Darkness

442
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:12,736
But Canterbury says that it's bigger than a question of property

443
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:15,552
Is the impact that the Pavilion has a maslansky

444
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:17,856
On the psyche of the people who come into contact

445
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,904
Through means legitimate or not

446
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,440
For kenebrew

447
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:23,232
Hanging about in the world

448
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:28,352
Pasadena tomato paste you have this wonderful thing that used to say you know once they're peeled are packed

449
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:35,776
Referring of course to the tomatoes tonight

450
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:39,360
I'm gone I'm out of the picture doesn't even belong to me anymore

451
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,456
I'm not even sure that thing belongs to the Head

452
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:45,504
Is he

453
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,576
Possessing it has nothing to do with it

454
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:51,136
Actually nothing

455
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:57,280
I remember as a youngster sneaking off to look at something called Peabody's to which is left

456
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:59,072
Is a mausoleum

457
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,864
Tibetan monastery

458
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,424
Visited on occasion

459
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,264
6 bus to Chicago

460
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,288
Where I grew up

461
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,360
Legislative

462
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:13,920
Peabody was in this glass coffin with

463
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:22,368
Years old for God's sake

464
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,160
You're still holding on to it

465
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:33,632
Even though I'm sure it pisses peterhead enough to say this

466
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:36,192
I can't help but feel like part of a unit belongs

467
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,776
I think that other people I know have a similar feeling

468
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,336
There were a couple of people who refuse to talk to me

469
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,664
Because to them to share Hayden with the world

470
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,432
Is the ruin

471
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,760
We found a photographer quit taking some pictures of hey you

472
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:53,088
But when we asked him if we could post them to our website

473
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,880
He replied with an emphatic

474
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:55,648
No

475
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,720
He did not want the secret getting out on his watch

476
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,536
And I have to admit I understand where they're coming from

477
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,168
When I put out a call to friends on Facebook to see you would talk to me about

478
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,192
Summer

479
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,472
What say you

480
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,288
And they gave me the same sense of exclusivity

481
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,568
Hopalong

482
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,104
That I had when I was a teenager

483
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,640
And now

484
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,432
Over the course of producing the story

485
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:23,296
I've actually gained a kind of buy-in from the grand Arbiter of hating himself

486
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,600
I no longer just a little

487
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:27,648
Peter hate Alex look you're a different person

488
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:28,416
So then you were then

489
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,440
Secondly

490
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:30,464
As you know

491
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,000
The radio guy

492
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,536
I like voices

493
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:34,816
And I like

494
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:37,376
The word pictures that people can

495
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:41,728
Weave on the radio you you you came credentialed because

496
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,288
I hear your voice I hear your name

497
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:48,640
Alexson at this morning I heard your name on on the media again

498
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:50,944
You know so what are you what you associate producer

499
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,736
Yo I'm proud of you for doing that

500
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,696
I'm grateful that I ever got to see her

501
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:04,000
But I live in a world where

502
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:09,632
But I'm also grateful that I live in a world where their magnificent structures that are made without me and mine

503
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:10,912
With nobody in

504
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,984
And while I'm out of it

505
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,312
And attempted to protect it by only gifting at the certain people

506
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,616
They are just trying to do the same thing

507
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:22,688
So even though this feels a little hypocritical

508
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,968
I have to say it

509
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:28,064
If you ever find yourself out in the middle of nowhere in Southeastern Michigan

510
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:31,904
You happen to come across some foreboding sign the side of the road

511
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:33,952
As a favor to the Haydens

512
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:35,488
And me and my friends

513
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,512
Please

514
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:37,536
Now

515
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,584
Turn back

516
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,120
Leaf

517
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:42,656
Don't stay here
