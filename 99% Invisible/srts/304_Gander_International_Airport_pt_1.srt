Is the island of Newfoundland

25
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:21,408
The island is as far east as you can go and still be in Canada

26
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,712
So far east in fact that it has

27
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:24,736
Stone time zone

28
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:27,040
Half an hour later than anywhere else

00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:30,624
If you seen a photograph of the island

30
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,928
Is probably the one that went viral last year

31
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:35,232
A small village on the eastern coast

32
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:38,560
In the foreground are Rolling Hills in a couple of houses

33
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:39,840
In the background

34
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:40,864

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,008
Yeah icebergs Float by occasionally

39
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,032
But that one was

40
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,312
Actually scary bear

41
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:52,384
Anais pronunciation of Newfoundland by the way

42
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,688
A lot of people say Newfoundland

43
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:57,248
And it's a bit of a sore spot without locals

44
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,784
Betty's Newfoundland native

45
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,808
Luke Quinton

46
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,880
And I want to take us to a different part of the island

47
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:06,208
To a little town on the northeastern side called

48
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:06,976
Gander

49
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:10,304
No Looking Back eyes are all the 20 years old

50
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,352
Condors how do I change

51
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:16,704
It's Christmas Eve 1972 Indian Blackmore's working

52
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,776
My name is Ian Blackmore and I was

53
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:23,616
Photographer with the gander Beacon after I finished

54
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:26,176
High School in before I went to college

55
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,200
Contrato

56
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:31,296
Ian's co-worker Gerald vokey was an editor on the same local paper

57
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:33,088
He's going to help tell the story

58
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,368
It was Christmas Eve

59
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,160
And their mother was

60
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:39,232
You know getting things ready for Santa Claus

61
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:41,536
Gerald was home that day in 1972

62
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:45,376
His family is getting ready for Christmas and he wants to get his daughter out of the house

63
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:48,448
So they decided to go hang out at the local Airport

64
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:52,544
As you do when you live in a tiny town in Canada

65
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,592
Airport is the best thing around

66
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,896
Also this is not a normal Airport

67
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,432
But we'll get to that soon

68
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:01,504
You never knew what the airport being up there who am I

69
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:04,064
Come through at any given time

70
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:06,368
Regardless of our the day or

71
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,648
Night or whatever

72
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,952
Kevin Gerald got to the Gander Airport

73
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,000
He started asking around

74
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,280
Astrid idiot

75
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,840
The security there you know what was going on

76
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,632
And they said that

77
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,424
Fidel Castro

78
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:22,496
It's here and I see why

79
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:26,336
Fidel Castro was there in the airport and he was more or less just

80
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,104
Hanging out

81
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,128
I had dinner with a

82
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,784
Yeah in the dining room. Shirley traditional fatigues

83
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,064
Women's combat boots

84
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:39,648
Spring fatigue snow metals or nothing just

85
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,440
Said playing uniform

86
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:44,768
Turned out Castro had a pretty long layover

87
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,816
So at some point he basically says

88
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:49,120
Give me a tour of your town

89
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,400
He wanted to see the town

90
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:57,056
Sew-in in Gerald and Fidel Castro all pylons and cars and go driving around the little town until they come

91
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,080
Come across a kid

92
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,640
Sledding there is a young fellow with his

93
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:05,504
Dog and probably another friend there and they were taking turns going down on there

94
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,272
Bog

95
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,856
Course mr. Castro decided that

96
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:12,416
That book that arresting and figured he might

97
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:13,696
Siwa

98
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,000
Thing was and how it worked

99
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,559
Nothing at cameliard snow

100
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:21,631
Castro gets on his sled and starts down the hill

101
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,679
Annie Blackmore snaps a picture

102
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:30,079
I got ahead of him before he started on the slide down so I was in position for the catch him on his way.

103
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,639
Photograph

104
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,271
Ian Blackmore's photograph of Fidel Castro sledding with end up in time Maggie

105
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:42,623
And the amazing thing about this anecdote isn't how unique it was

106
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,391
For Gander

107
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,695
But he'll totally normal

108
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:50,559
The gander airport was used to hosting really famous people from all over the world

109
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:53,631
It wasn't just a tiny airport in some Tiny Town

110
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:58,239
It was a very large very important airport in some Tiny Town

111
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,543
But before we hear how this place came to be

112
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,847
I want to take you inside the airport

113
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:05,151
Because it's an incredible building

114
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,991
Okay Airport

115
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:14,879
Beginner airport you such a mid-century modern Time Capsule that I actually think I could bring up some Lounge music right now

116
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:17,695
This place is straight out of an episode of Mad Men

117
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,999
Mad Men with

118
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,279
Newfoundlander accent

119
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,839
If you follow me across here

120
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,119
Over on the

121
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:28,191
Capron Jerry cram is a commissionaire at the gander Airport

122
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,495
The job is part fixer

123
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,519
Part security guard

124
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,079
Jeriel probably be the one to give you a tour

125
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:37,663
If you ask her ass flooring is all from Healy

126
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,991
Right here is what we called the

127
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,271
The birds of welcome

128
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,903
Jerry's pointing at a bronze sculpture of seven birds that greets you when you walk into the lounge

129
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:53,535
The blue and the gray Furniture is all from the late 50s early 60s

130
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:59,167
The international Lounge of the gander airport is this big area space

131
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,703
Super high ceiling

132
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:04,031
And when you walk in your immediately a wash

133
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:06,335
In the orange glow the 1950s

134
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:11,967
Vinyl chairs and couches are arranged in U shape seating

135
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:17,087
They were designed by famous mid-century designers like Charles and Ray Eames and Robin bush

136
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:22,463
The gander International Lounge has been called the single most important modernist room

137
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,743
In Canada

138
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,815
Even the bathrooms are their own amazing time

139
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,863
The women's restroom especially

140
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,655
Jerry calls out a warning

141
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,703
So that we can go in

142
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,751
We're good to go

143
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:38,079
This is not a gross airport bathroom

144
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,639
It's beautiful mid-century luxury

145
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:44,479
There's a row of swivel chairs in front of a counter and a wall-sized me

146
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,039
It is two showers because he has

147
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,575
People used to shower

148
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,343
At the airport

149
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,391
There is two showers in this way

150
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,439
As well as

151
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:56,255
But now you can say you were in the washroom

152
00:06:56,767 --> 00:07:01,375
Aternos being on June 19th 1959

153
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:06,239
When is International Lounge of the gander airport opened in 1959

154
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:09,055
The Queen of England herself came for the opening

155
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:11,871
And yeah the townspeople hobnob with her to

156
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:14,431
A lot has happened in this Airport

157
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:19,039
And the story of how it came to be and what it's become is really also

158
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:21,087
Story about the history of air travel

159
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,879
Finance

160
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,415
Because the shortest way

161
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,511
You've got to look at it on the glow

162
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,327
Is a trace a direct course from New York to Paris

163
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,375
You'll see that it takes you right over nothing

164
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,167
Remember Lindbergh

165
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:40,287
In the 1920s before Gander exist

166
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:45,663
Newfoundland grassy Fields were the jumping off points for transatlantic Daredevil pilot

167
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:48,735
Amelia Earhart Alcock and Brown Lindbergh all of them

168
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,527
Because it was so far east

169
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:55,135
It made sense to start there if you were worried about getting across the Atlantic with enough fuel

170
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:58,463
Eventually the British government which control Newfoundland

171
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,231
The time

172
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,511
Started to take note

173
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:04,095
Maybe there is something to this whole air travel thing

174
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:09,727
In 1936 the British shows what was then basically a patch of woods on the Eastern side of Newfoundland

175
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:13,311
As the site for over a million square yards of runways

176
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:20,223
By the spring of 1938 the gander airport was fully operational but the massive runways were mostly on you

177
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,015
There just weren't enough

178
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,319
Planes in operation that could actually survive

179
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,855
Crossing of the Atlantic Ocean

180
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:28,415
It was a very very risky

181
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,183
Attorney

182
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,743
In the two decades before the war

183
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:34,559
Only a hundred planes across the Atlantic

184
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,095
50 others had tried

185
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:36,863
And fail

186
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:38,655
People that died

187
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:42,751
In the 1939 World War II began in Europe in Allied Force

188
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:45,823
Wanted his many fighter planes if they could get their hands

189
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:49,407
Americans and Canadians have been shipping planes over by boat

190
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:55,807
But that wasn't working out so well they were being torpedoed by the Year by German submarines

191
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,855
Rare finds Denver actually making it over

192
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:58,879
Can UK

193
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:01,695
That's historian Informer air dispatcher Dean call

194
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:06,047
And he says to get planes to the UK the British had to come up with a new idea

195
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:09,631
They would have to put up what we call a bladder inside it was a

196
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,167
Spare fuel tank basically

197
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:13,727
To give them enough is enough fuel to make Crossing

198
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:16,799
Process of flying the planes from Gander to Scotland

199
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,591
Began in 1940

200
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,359
And was called

201
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,127
Eureka Math

202
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,431
The first Crossing was 7 playing

203
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,735
And it took place in a freezing night in November

204
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,039
The pilot had to fly in the dark

205
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,575
Because lights could alert the Germans

206
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:31,135
Miraculously all seven made

207
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,695
But that was just the first day

208
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:40,095
Over the course of the war 20,000 planes were brought to Gander to be flown across the Atlantic for the war

209
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:42,911
Some days are being hunted airplanes that would go over

210
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,727
Churchill's even quoted at one point in

211
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:49,311
Refer to Gander is the largest aircraft carrier in the North Atlantic

212
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:53,407
I guess it was the turning point of the war really trust for Britain

213
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:57,247
Jenna was making history even though at the

214
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:59,551
The time there was no actual town

215
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,623
Gander say there people living between

216
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,415
Intersections of runways

217
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,695
That's where the

218
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:09,023
Americans are the Canadians in the British had built

219
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,303
Morton Buildings

220
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,095
Printables of former aircraft

221
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,119
Controller at Gander

222
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,399
History of the airport

223
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,471
And he says the early town of Gander was basically just a

224
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,239
If you live in court

225
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,775
Right next to the runway

226
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:22,847
I will show you in a hundred yards or so or even closer than that

227
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:26,687
And I made a hell of a lot of noise it was a those aircraft

228
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:30,015
Because the gander airport started as a military operation

229
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:33,855
It wasn't until the war was over and civilian air travel began

230
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:37,439
They decided to build a separate Town away from the runway

231
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:43,327
And then in the late 1950s the Canadian government built that fancy International Lounge

232
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,351
At the airport

233
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:47,935
In 1958 just a year before the new Lounge open

234
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:51,263
Jets like the de Havilland comet in the DC 8 rent reduced

235
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:56,895
These planes could make the long Trek across the Atlantic without having to stop and refuel in Gander

236
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,199
But they took a while to go mainstream

237
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,223
And 4 years

238
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,015
Gander served as a stopping

239
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,551
For international travel

240
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,111
These are the Glory Days of candor

241
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:10,719
When celebrities from all over the world would wind up stopping through on their way to or from the state

242
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:14,303
The Beatles first step in North America wasn't in New York

243
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,095
It was in Gander Newfoundland

244
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:19,679
The gander airport became by far

245
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,983
The hottest place to be in Gander

246
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:25,567
Oh yeah used to go hang around up there and watch the

247
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,871
What's the people coming in on the plane

248
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:30,431
Escalator

249
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,223
It was a hotspot

250
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,783
John beard grew up in Gander

251
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:38,367
Everything revolves around the airport mean that was 1 in

252
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:41,695
It's a quieter place now than it was in

253
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:45,279
In the 1960s air travel was still pretty exclusive

254
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,327
A lot of North American tourists

255
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,863
Still travel to Europe

256
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:49,631
Bicep

257
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:53,471
But celebrities and heads of state from all over the world were paying big bucks

258
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,239
The fly

259
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,031
And many of them were stopping and gander

260
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:58,079
In that beautiful mid-century modern Lounge

261
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:02,943
A lot of famous people who came to the Gander airport tried to go unnoticed

262
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:06,015
But some really one of the cocktail from the bar

263
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:09,599
If they were in the airport bar they probably were interacting with the

264
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,623
People of Gander

265
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,647
Security

266
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,671
Pretty Wings back then

267
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,439
To say the least

268
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,743
I'm at the

269
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,303
Marilyn Monroe

270
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,655
Bob Hope

271
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:27,007
Kings and queens of Summer berries country's king of Jordan

272
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:31,359
King of Saudi Arabia Mikhail Gorbachev Macho Man Randy Savage

273
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:33,151
I met President Bush

274
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:35,199
That's the former mayor of Gander Claudel

275
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,783
The Queen of England

276
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,551
Flu

277
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:40,831
With Prince Philip

278
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,111
On a chopper

279
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:46,463
The locals also love to tell a story about Frank Sinatra trying to cut in line

280
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,487
The airport bar

281
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,535
Getting told to go to the back

282
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:57,215
But it wasn't just a scene of people drinking cocktails on their way to London

283
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:04,127
By the late 1960s most commercial Jets could make it across the Atlantic without needing to refuel but gander

284
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:07,199
Was still serving an important role in international travel

285
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,247
Especially to communist country

286
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:12,319
Please who couldn't fly to the US or use at their space

287
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:16,671
Gander was D major stopping point between Moscow and Havana

288
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,975
But this occasionally invited defect

289
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,023
Seeking asylum in Canada

290
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,095
And in particular the fair number from Cuba

291
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:26,399
That's Gary vokey Gerald Loki's son

292
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:30,239
And he said sometimes people would get off their plane coming from Cuba or Bulgaria

293
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,543
Or some other communist country and seek Asylum

294
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,591
Not that this was easy

295
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:39,455
Vokey remembers witnessing one incident in particular in which a woman from a Cuban

296
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:43,807
Attempted to escape down the lounge escalator to Canadian authorities

297
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:46,367
Well the Cuban flight crew tried stopper

298
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,927
They had lady hold buyer fees

299
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,719
The Canadians Hatter

300
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,511
Ahold buyer Huebner arm

301
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,303
So she was upside down

302
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,583
Going up the escalator

303
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,887
And

304
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:00,191
She had a dress on her dress was back over

305
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:00,959
Riverhead

306
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,519
It nearly turned violent and it was

307
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:07,615
For me as a kid it was one of most iconic things I've ever seen

308
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:15,039
Residents of Gander life was also about living alongside people from all over the world who work for the airlines

309
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:20,927
Aeroflot the Russian airliner had over a hundred and fifty crew in-flight planners in Candor alone

310
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,695
Gander

311
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,719
In its day

312
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:23,743
Was

313
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,791
A lot more multi

314
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:26,559
Cultural

315
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:29,119
Then a bigger cities in Canada

316
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:32,703
Did the Brits have people there Germans had people there tours

317
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,751
Canadian military

318
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,823
Cubans and Russians

319
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,615
Everybody Mingle

320
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:45,759
Particular Cubans were famous for buying find bicycles and then shipping them back to

321
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,039
Back to Cuba

322
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:53,183
The airport turn cancer into an amazingly diverse play

323
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,207
And Beyond

324
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,255
It was a portal from the town

325
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,791
To the rest of the world

326
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:02,143
There are stories about local people with the right connections shopping on last minute flights

327
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:02,911
Cuba

328
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:03,935
And Europe

329
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,959
In New York City

330
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:06,239
Just by clearing

331
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,007
With the captain

332
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:13,407
And maybe it was all those trips to New York that prepare the people of Gander for September 11th

333
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,175
2001

334
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:20,575
As much as mention we have a breaking news story to tell you about apparently a plane has Jeff

335
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:23,903
Crashed into the World Trade Center here in New York City at

336
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,671
Happened just

337
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,695
A few moments

338
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,767
Testing my wife's sister

339
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:31,071
Had the news on in the morning

340
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,607
He said it looks like an airplane

341
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,887
Crashed in the

342
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,679
What are the buildings in New York

343
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,495
In the morning of September 11

344
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:42,847
An unprecedented decision was made to close all American airspace

345
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:47,199
Hundreds of flights were diverted to land at airports in Canada

346
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:51,039
I was only going about 10 minutes from the town manager called me and said that

347
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,831
You better come in

348
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,623
We may be getting some playing

349
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,863
As the plane came in one by one

350
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,655
The people of Gander gathered

351
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,423
Outside the airport

352
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,191
What to watch

353
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:13,311
Well I'm quite remarkable actually because you would see airplanes airplanes aircraft

354
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:16,127
Miles and miles and miles in the distance

355
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,663
Esl lineup

356
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,431
Tallinn

357
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:20,735
So it was quite a remarkable scene

358
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:27,647
38 planes and nearly seven thousand passengers ended up in Gander

359
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,439
They called the stranded visitors

360
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,463
The plain people

361
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:33,791
When people weren't there just for a few hours

362
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,327
They were there for three days

363
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,863
And they got nothing

364
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:40,191
The passengers weren't allowed to take their luggage so

365
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:43,775
It arrived in Gander with nothing but the clothes on their backs

366
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:47,103
After each passenger was registered with the Red Cross

367
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:50,431
A loose network of volunteers from Gander and nearby communities

368
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,479
Provided thousands of hot meals

369
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,271
Toiletries and prescriptions

370
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,295
To the plane

371
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:59,391
Bus drivers who were on strike came back to work to drive them around town

372
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,695
It was a job I was born

373
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:05,023
Howard job fair how our people came

374
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,047
Truancy

375
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,607
We are here we are here to help you

376
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,399
Until you're ready to leave

377
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,959
Gander has 500 hotel rooms

378
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:14,751
7000 new gas

379
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:18,591
The population of the little town had nearly doubled overnight

380
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:19,871
It's a residence

381
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,639
Stepped up

382
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,919
Mental people in

383
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:24,735
And yes there was people took people into their homes

384
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,039
Even though we were told

385
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:29,599
Not to do that because at that time

386
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:32,927
They didn't know how widespread that this terrorist attack

387
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:33,695
Would they

388
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,999
Do they have no food

389
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:44,447
Some of the stranded passengers ended up forming strong bonds with their hosts

390
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:47,007
At least one marriage is reported to a Combat Evolved

391
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,799
And a bunch of friendship

392
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:51,615
One group of plain people who stayed at a high school

393
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,639
Stardust

394
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:55,199
That's not worth over $1000000

395
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:58,271
The passengers organized all this on their flight home

396
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,831
After they finally got cleared to leave Gander

397
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:07,231
Even today we still have people come back to visit people in people's homes that stayed here we have people in Gander that goes to the

398
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:12,095
U.s. 11-story is where the famous because the Broadway musical come from away

399
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:14,655
In which the gander mayor Claude Elliott

400
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,679
Is the central character

401
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:19,263
Andres just five or six of us from the community that

402
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,543
Portrayed in that place

403
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,639
Represent this whole community

404
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:28,223
Well he's not like me I mean I'm beautiful okay about tetanus

405
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:34,367
American

406
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:45,119
I understand

407
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:59,711
These days the gander airport is pretty quiet

408
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,735
Do people

409
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,527
It's never quite as packed I guess it wants

410
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,063
I know

411
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,855
That's Luke injury cramp

412
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:06,623
Inside ear

413
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:10,463
Are we still getting International traffic today

414
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:15,839
But they're nowhere near the extent before they had to stop somewhere to refill

415
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,119
Refuel

416
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:20,191
But now you got the planes that can go on without

417
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,215
Have him to stop

418
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:26,591
St John's the capital of Newfoundland has the Island's major International Airport now

419
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:28,639
And aside from a few daily flights

420
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:32,735
Gander traffic is mostly military planes and emergency landing

421
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:36,831
Between the military base the air traffic control center in the airport

422
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,391
Gander has found ways to stay afloat

423
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:41,951
A few years ago

424
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:45,279
The airport Authority was thinking of tearing down the international lamb

425
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,583
I'm building something small

426
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,119
And much much uglier

427
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:52,703
But there was a huge outcry from architecture enthusiast

428
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,471
Around the world

429
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:56,031
Full disclosure I was one of them

430
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,615
In the end thanks to organizing by people like Luke

431
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:03,711
The mid-century Time Capsule that is the international Lounge was saved

432
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:06,527
And Jerry cram promises it will stay that way

433
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:07,807
Party words

434
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:12,671
Mark my words but I'm not always going to be around either so

435
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:17,023
And so as long as Jerry cram is round

436
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:21,375
The international Lounge stands as a kind of Monument to a bygone era

437
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,423
Mine was luxurious

438
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:26,751
When you didn't have to take your shoes off to go through security

439
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:27,775
When actually

440
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:29,567
There was no such thing as security

441
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:32,383
When the bar in your Airport terminal

442
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,919
Was open to anyone

443
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,455
Ticket or not

444
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,527
And if Sinatra cut in front of you in line

445
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,551
You just tell him

446
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,319
Please

447
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:41,855
Wichita

448
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:03,615
What do those big numbers painted on Airport runways really mean

449
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:06,175
Kurt Kolstad will decode them for you

450
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,199
Right after this

451
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,391
Between the beats

452
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,696
Bongs and Charter of our devices

453
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:21,280
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

454
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,304
If

455
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:28,704
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife isn't

456
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,800
Another

457
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,592
Technology talk to us

458
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,640
It is a creation of Sonic trap

459
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:39,712
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

460
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:43,296
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

461
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,344
To make them more human

462
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:49,184
Turn the living room lights on

463
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:50,976
Okay

464
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,024
Dim the living room lights to 50

465
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:53,792
80%

466
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:55,584
Okay

467
00:21:56,352 --> 00:22:01,984
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

468
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,800
Makes for a much more natural experience

469
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,848
Turn the living room lights on

470
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:10,944
Dim the living room lights to 50%

471
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:18,368
We're presenting to special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

472
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,904
About how are sounds gay

473
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,184
Is impacting our health

474
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:23,744
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

475
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:26,816
Look for them Fridays May 17th and May 24th

476
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:28,864
Right here on the 9th 9 p.m.

477
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:33,216
We need to talk about something

478
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:36,544
Constipation abdominal pain and bloating

479
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:42,944
It's not that bad you take laxatives modify your diet and exercise routine but thinking about it all the time is frustrating.

480
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,808
Doesn't have to Define constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again

481
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:51,392
And you don't know why then it may be time to seek help

482
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:54,464
Go to oh my God. Info podcast

483
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,584
We can learn more about your symptoms that's oh my God. Info / podcast

484
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,120
Oh my God. Info

485
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,144
Black podcast

486
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:06,496
So a few years back the Oakland International Airport changed

487
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,776
Two of its Runway number

488
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:10,336
27 peking 28 +

489
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,104
29b

490
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,128
30

491
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,968
99 guys on Kirk Kolstad lives in beautiful downtown

492
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:16,992
Oakland California

493
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:21,344
And he's here to explain why it was really important that they make that change

494
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,648
First though you have to understand how

495
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:24,928
Runway numbering work

496
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:28,512
Airports around the world use this Universal system

497
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:30,816
That's based off Earth's magnetic north

498
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,864
So basically you

499
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,888
Figure out the

500
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:37,216
Magnetic compass direction of the runway up to 360 degrees

501
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,008
Then you round that off to the nearest

502
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:41,312
10 and then drop the zero at the end

503
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,336
And and then you have your number

504
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:44,640
I can see you in for the sub numbers one

505
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,688
236 instead of

506
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:47,456
10

507
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,224
236

508
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:52,832
All right that's it and each one way as a complimentary number to that goes in the other tracks

509
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,904
And that's of course I 180 degrees difference

510
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,232
So Runway number 18 is the flipside of wrongdoing number

511
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,000
36

512
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,280
And so on sofa

513
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:03,584
And if you see letters

514
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,888
That actually means there are multiple runways

515
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,168
Running parallel to each other

516
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,704
So Alice for the left

517
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:09,984
Are for the rain

518
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,312
And if there's one in the middle they use letter C for a center

519
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,592
So

520
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:15,872
By necessity

521
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:18,944
If it was 18 L the other side would read

522
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:19,968
36

523
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:20,736
Pixar

524
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,528
Okay I'm going to make that don't make sense

525
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:25,088
No it's not obvious to me why they do use

526
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:26,880
Compass directions rather than just

527
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,416
Then bring them one two and three

528
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:32,512
Will you do with all the high-tech stuff that guides plates fees.

529
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,328
Magnetic directions serve as a kind of backups

530
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,912
Help planes land in case something goes wrong

531
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:43,264
Also make it easy for pilots on the ground to double-check that their Runway and compass

532
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:45,056
Online before they take off

533
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:46,848
They know they're in the right place doing the right thing

534
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:48,384
Do it all else fails

535
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,408
You can use a compass

536
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,712
It begs the question

537
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:52,736
Why

538
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:53,504
Do the numbers

539
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,272
Ever change

540
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,320
That's the really crazy part

541
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:58,112
I knew that

542
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:01,952
The planet's magnetic poles reverse every few hundred thousand years

543
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:06,048
But they're also be smaller but significant ships going on

544
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:06,816
Constantly

545
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:09,888
And we tend to think of North in terms of true north

546
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,472
That is no single point of the top of a globe or map

547
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:17,568
Compass reading of magnetic north differs from one place to the next

548
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,336
And

549
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:20,640
It moves around all the time too

550
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,432
By the flows of the Earth

551
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,224
Molten metal outer core

552
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:27,040
And when those cumulative changes are big enough

553
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:33,696
Then the airports have to repaint the runways or the numbers don't make sense anymore

554
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,720
Gradle could just be

555
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:38,048
It goes from point for 2.6 and that tips in the other direction

556
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:38,816
Right

557
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:39,584
Around 3

558
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:45,984
And these ships happen even faster closer to the poles so airports that are really part of the North or really hard as a child

559
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,776
Actually have to make these changes more often

560
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:55,456
I just have to keep an eye on this for their own sake because if they're traveling on a plane they want to make sure these things are right

561
00:25:55,712 --> 00:26:00,576
And it turns out it's a huge project magnetic monitoring stations all around the world

562
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:02,624
And satellites that also help keep track

563
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:05,184
I was actually just talked to my dad about this

564
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:06,720
He's a geophysicist

565
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,816
And apparently the poles may also Rivers entirely again soon

566
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,096
It's hard to say

567
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:16,192
And when that happens it could actually cause problems for the world's electrical grids

568
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:20,032
Among other things not to mention causing entire repainting of airport

569
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:26,944
I need when you say soon what do you mean by soon should I be

570
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,224
Prepping right now

571
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:34,368
Well if you look at the historical record we're actually overdue already but it could still be thousands of years

572
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:38,976
Soon in get out geological time can be pretty long in terms of

573
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:39,744
Ceiling tile

574
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,560
Buyer can the soup is what your say

575
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,496
I mean well if you want to geek out with more about Runway fonts and other

I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

605
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:55,424
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that kind of

606
00:28:56,704 --> 00:29:02,848
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

607
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,176
Was found dead in my private gym

608
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:09,504
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

609
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,856
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

610
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:17,184
Now I need to clear my name

611
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,560
