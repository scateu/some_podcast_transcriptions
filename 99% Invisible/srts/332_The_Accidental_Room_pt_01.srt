In a grand effort to revitalize the sea

35
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,168
And with much fanfare

36
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,472
The Providence Place Mall was open

What was known as a super Regional

41
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:56,224
A One-Stop shopping destiny

42
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:00,064
Housing everything consumers could possibly want or need

43
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,112
In a totally enclosed space

44
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,464
Partially funded by taxpayer money it's been 13 acres

45
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,792
Offered 1.4 million square feet of retail

46
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:11,328
And dominate

47
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,096
The riverfront

48
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,632
It was

49
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:14,912
The largest

50
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,472
Construction project in providence's history

51
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:21,056
Obviously this one building and

52
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:21,824
We

53
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:24,128
So does student all watching it

54
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,152
Get built

55
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,808
Michael townzen is an artist who live nearby when the mall was still under construction in the 1990s

56
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,624
The daily running route took him past the construction site

57
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:38,208
And Michael says that if he wants to go out he had an open mind about the

58
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:38,976
Project

59
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:40,768
He was cautiously optimistic

60
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,816
That would be a welcome addition to the neighborhood

61
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,376
Yeah yeah

62
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,912
Itsfunneh

63
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,936
Devotion

64
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:51,264
To a building like that doesn't really kick in until the skin gets put on

65
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:57,920
When something is in his Erector Set mode where you just sing the skeleton like I have a pretty full skeleton but as soon as

66
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,712
The Flash is there like

67
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,504
Not Freddy

68
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,808
Providence Place is going to be a big

69
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,088
Boxy Soccer Shop

70
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:07,392
Without much in the way of architectural nicety

71
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,792
And his runs Michael watched as that big box was slowly filled with the things that make them all Amal

72
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,328
As it's being built

73
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,376
I start to sort of

74
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,168
Do mental Maps

75
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:20,960
Spaces

76
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:25,056
Does that seem to store that's me a storage space that's going to be parking

77
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:30,176
But amidst all the construction there was one part of the building that kept catching Michael die

78
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:36,576
Weird space in the guts of the architecture that didn't make sense

79
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:42,976
It didn't seem to meet the profile of either sore space or parking space or store

80
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:46,304
Space Michael wasn't sure what the spaces for

81
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,192
It seemed to exist only by virtue of the Wold intended for the more legitimate spaces around it

82
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,472
But the result was this

83
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,240
Room

84
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:56,544
It was an accidental room

85
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:00,896
A remainder left over by the long division of the malls architecture

86
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,944
I've never seen anything like it

87
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,248
Maritime Iran

88
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:08,064
It was something I would never think about

89
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:13,952
Michael eventually put the strange room out of his mind he probably would have forgotten about it entirely

90
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:19,839
Except that 4 years later a second group of developers encouraged by the success of Providence Place

91
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:22,655
Set their sights even closer to Michael

92
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:27,263
This time they wanted to build right on top of the historic Mill District where Michael

93
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:32,127
And a dozen or so other artist lived and worked in an old industrial building they called

94
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:32,895
Fort Thunder

95
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:39,807
The developers had to use the computer algorithm to figure out where to place a new Supermarket so that it wouldn't compete with others

96
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,343
Supermarkets in the area

97
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:47,999
And I got to see this computer printout and it is it like a nuclear explosion map

98
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:52,351
The radius of each supermarket and their theoretical reach

99
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,375
And

100
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:57,215
Indy Blank Spot that was our neighborhood

101
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,495
They put an X

102
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,799
Directly on the building we were live

103
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,103
And that was just the start

104
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:06,175
The developers wanted to tear down all of the Old Mill

105
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:10,783
And replace them with yet more retail with little to no pedestrian

106
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:15,135
And it appears that they only Mantra they have is

107
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,183
If you see a space at

108
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,207
Underdeveloped

109
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,743
You have a

110
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:22,303
God-given responsibility to development

111
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,863
That it was basically like having

112
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,423
A complete stranger

113
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,215
Women thinking about it

114
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,519
And we think we want to knock your house down

115
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:36,895
And and make it a parking lot of it

116
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:37,663
It's cool with you

117
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,551
Normally this would be the part of the story we tell you that Michael and the other residents of Fort Thunder

118
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:47,903
Banded together to save their home in the face of the Relentless March of capital

119
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:48,927
But

120
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,463
No it's not that kind of story

121
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:52,767
When did they did save some buildings

122
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,303
But as for Fort Thunder

123
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:57,375
Or actual home

124
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:00,191
They came out with bulldozers and crane and knock that sucker

125
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:00,959
Are flat

126
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,007
Fort Thunder was gone

127
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:06,591
The reason we're telling you this story is because of what happened next

128
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:10,431
Because when I see something like that on my ho ho ho

129
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:17,343
Really game on Michael and his friend

130
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:19,391
And have lost their home and in their mind

131
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:25,791
It all started with that first mall that was the original see that development that has led to everything else

132
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:31,935
And so talk again of a mall related action call it art call it a stunt

133
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:38,335
Anaplan started to take shape in the mall

134
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,103
7 days

135
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,127
Live

136
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,687
In the mall and they said a rule for themselves

137
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,319
They couldn't leave and without a second thought of thinking about how unfeasible that is

138
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:52,159
For own well-being we really thought that we had to do it

139
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,439
And if this sounds like

140
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,999
Clark well yet I kind of was

141
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,279
But I secretly

142
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,303
Serious Clark

143
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,839
The four friends

144
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,375
They would eventually number eight

145
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:04,191
Wanted to assert that space is like them all

146
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:06,751
Long dresses much to them after the debate

147
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:14,943
To really do this right they would need to find a space in the mall where they can hide themselves away

148
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:18,527
And Michael have the perfect place in mind

149
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:23,135
You begin to search for that Mysterious Room that he'd noticed when the mall was under construction

150
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:29,535
All those years before was connected to a kind of crevice a narrow Gap in

151
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:35,935
In the building structure that eventually LED out to an exterior wall so one night Michael went to see you

152
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:39,519
Entrance to that crevasse had ever been sealed off

153
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,823
Amazingly it hadn't

154
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,639
It was small and sort of hidden

155
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:47,455
But there was still a crack in the exterior of the mall

156
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:51,551
So he and his then wife Adriana turn themselves sideways

157
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,831
And slept inside

158
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:57,695
And then once you're once you're at that point you are exploring

159
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,231
A system of

160
00:07:59,487 --> 00:07:59,999
Caverns

161
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,303
Long weird

162
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,839
Vertical Caverns

163
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,655
And there are places where it is false

164
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:09,215
Down into the lower levels of the mall

165
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,263
So you've got about

166
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,543
A foot-and-a-half

167
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:15,359
A blessed we are looking into a black abyss

168
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,895
And then

169
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:17,919
This

170
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,711
Series of Chambers

171
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,527
Ultimately give you access

172
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,295
To this

173
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,319
Space

174
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:30,463
The room was tall and wide filled with the byproducts of the mall's construction from the years before

175
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,999
Broken two-by-fours

176
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,791
Screws and plastic zip ties

177
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,839
That hadn't even been worth removing

178
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,119
The space

179
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,911
Have literally been forgotten

180
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:41,215
And it was

181
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:42,495
Big

182
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,287
He was a big space

183
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,311
That

184
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,359
Serves no other purpose

185
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,639
That wasn't the storefront

186
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,687
I wasn't a star while it was just

187
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:51,967
Big

188
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:52,735
And it was

189
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:53,759
A

190
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:54,783
Thrill

191
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:55,807
Tube

192
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:59,647
Physically find it be like this is it this is what I remember

193
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,207
The room was in the guts of the building

194
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,767
The part that no one was ever supposed to use

195
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:05,791
Even really see

196
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:08,863
But Michael and Adriana saw that it could still be access

197
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,399
I multiple-hit an entry point

198
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:13,215
Including from inside the shopping center itself

199
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:16,543
If you know how to get there you could walk there from the Macy's

200
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,079
But as far as they can

201
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:21,151
Hell they were the only people who knew this really exist

202
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:25,247
It was at that moment but the friend scheme started changing

203
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,807
Initial planning to spend a week in the mall

204
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,087
But the way they saw it

205
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:34,207
They were sitting on 750 square feet of underutilized space

206
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,487
Monastic

207
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,791
What would a developer do

208
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,327
Because after all

209
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,887
If you see a space is underdeveloped

210
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,167
You have a

211
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:45,727
God-given responsibility to develop

212
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:47,263
So

213
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,359
When we decided that perhaps the absolute best thing we could do is just build a condo

214
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:56,991
Like that is that is always the you that's always the answer you're not sure what to do with the space

215
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,527
Just make it a condo

216
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:02,111
The new plan was no longer to live in the mall for a week

217
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:04,671
It was now simply to live in the mall

218
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,695
Days of time

219
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:06,975
Using the room

220
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:07,999
Is an apartment

221
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:13,119
Well that may sound like a nightmare to everyone but a few weird artist from Providence

222
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:15,935
Michael and his friends at work on this little project

223
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,215
The excitement

224
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,239
New homeowner

225
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,311
Step 1 of course was cleaning

226
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,103
They had to get rid of all that debris

227
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,383
It sounded like

228
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:28,991
Irritated I get a prison break movie we were literally filling up our backpacks

229
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,015
Swift Just

230
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,807
Dirt and grime and then

231
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:34,367
Brandon carrying it out of the mall and getting rid of it

232
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,439
And for every backpack full of debris they took out

233
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,999
They bring a pack full of something in

234
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,791
Gallon jugs of water for drinking

235
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:42,559
Cleaning

236
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:47,423
Clamp lights and extension cords for illumination which they plugged into the malls internal power system

237
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,727
Parts for an ad hoc kitchen

238
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:54,591
They even built a cinder block wall to hide the space from anyone else who might venture into the cavern,

239
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,383
Commence various other entrance

240
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:01,503
We went and got a door that was an exact mirror of the doors that use in the mall

241
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,039
So if you were to find it

242
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,343
Unless you're looking really closely

243
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,903
At first glance it just looks exactly like a

244
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:11,487
Like it had been built originally

245
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:17,887
Finally it was time to decorate anything we could buy at the mall we would low table came in on

246
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,655
On top of that

247
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,471
Probably perch with a television at our PlayStation

248
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,239
But

249
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:26,591
If you couldn't buy it at the mall we have to bring it in tomorrow that's for the large

250
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,895
Pieces like the China hutch for the

251
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,175
4 piece sectional couch

252
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,479
No but nobody looks

253
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,015
Twice that you brought

254
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,551
Pieces of a couch

255
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:36,831
Through them all

256
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:39,391
How did you get that in there

257
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,439
In broad daylight

258
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,719
We avoided the night

259
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:46,047
And sort of work for the ebb and flow of

260
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,327
The mall we were just

261
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,423
Heart of the hills the living organism of it

262
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,471
Pets daily activities

263
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,799
Amazing risky trying to furnish

264
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:59,359
A secret apartment with a nested coffee table

265
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,639
But anyone watching

266
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:05,759
It was just a person walking through a mall with the nested coffee table that they just bought at the mall

267
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:10,367
There's simply no such thing as a suspicious consumer item in a building

268
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,647
What is dedicated

269
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,671
Consumerism

270
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,999
Friendswood sometimes stay in the secret

271
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:19,071
Apartment for several weeks in a row just living

272
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:23,679
Watching television and making collages with shadow boxes they bought at Pottery Barn

273
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,215
Even cooking in the ad hoc

274
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:29,567
Michael remembers burning some waffles with waffle iron and wondering if

275
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,847
Smoke weed give them away

276
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:34,431
And when the eight friends were enjoying their secret apartment

277
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,223
They were enjoying the mall

278
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,503
Not at Shoppers

279
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,527
But as residents

280
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:42,879
Thanks to its late night movie theater the mall almost never closed

281
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:45,183
So sometimes it would just roam the building

282
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,719
With no goal in mind

283
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,511
Observing its many moods

284
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,303
There are times in that in

285
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,583
Haier building

286
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,375
Probably had maybe

287
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,911
10 people in it

288
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,447
Like in the middle of the night

289
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:00,031
Dippy security officer to be cleaning staff

290
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,847
And it's a really wonderful time because it's

291
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,383
It's like having

292
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,199
A public park

293
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:11,551
4 levels deep all to yourself

294
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:13,855
Tend

295
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,391
In those moments

296
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,671
There's a sense of

297
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,207
Ownership

298
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,279
I just feel really good

299
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,863
Weeks turn to months

300
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,399
And eventually years

301
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:30,751
Out of the emotional Rubble of Fort Thunder they finally found their ref

302
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,055
And all thanks to the mall develop

303
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,871
Quit accidentally provided a sanctuary

304
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,663
Ameriworld they were busy developer

305
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,967
But as the old saying goes

306
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,015
There Comes A Time in every man's life

307
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:44,831
Woody must stop living at the mall

308
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,367
Unfortunately

309
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,159
The seed got planted

310
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:50,207
Dad this whole thing was going to unravel

311
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,511
And that's because we had a we had a break-in

312
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,559
One day they came back to the apartment

313
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,839
Only to discover

314
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:58,655
That someone who kicked open the door and still on the PlayStation

315
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,447
Along with several other smaller

316
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,495
Including the art they had made

317
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,263
Photo

318
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,311
But it left a silverware

319
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:09,151
They left the TV right this is a very odd burglary

320
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:13,247
I didn't take the things of value they only two things that were like

321
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,295
Super personal

322
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,831
Michael and his friends were

323
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:20,671
They had managed to hide the apartment for 4 years

324
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,975
But now someone knew about the room

325
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,535
Someone could come back at any time

326
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,583
Who seem to be interested in them

327
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,119
So they change things up

328
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:32,191
They decided from now on they only stay there at night

329
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,983
When the chances of being caught were low

330
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,519
Never during the day

331
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,311
And crucially

332
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:41,663
I would double down on another rule they had since almost the very beginning

333
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,943
Don't share it

334
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,223
It with anyone don't

335
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:47,295
Physically bring anyone here wasn't involved in the making of it

336
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,343
It's a lot of my very

337
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,367
Very good

338
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,647
Ban best friends

339
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,439
Never saw this face

340
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,815
And I'm the one who

341
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,119
Took that rule and broke it

342
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:05,215
Michael is hosting a visiting artist from Hong Kong

343
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,239
Her name is Jaffa

344
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:09,055
He was driving her to the bus station on her way out of town

345
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,847
And we're driving

346
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:13,407
Pass them all I say to myself

347
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,943
What can it hurt

348
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,991
How could this possibly backfire me

349
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,295
Self

350
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,063
I

351
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:20,831
Brought her

352
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,855
Into the space

353
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:27,999
Her mind was absolutely blown and it got remember that this is at the peak of its

354
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,023
It's Bill.

355
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,071
Michael show Java everything

356
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,607
Couch the light

357
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,375
Television

358
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:36,191
They were just days away from installing a water tank

359
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,215
And a wood floor

360
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:43,615
In spite of the break-in after 4 years of work the apartment was on the verge of feeling like a real home

361
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,151
But

362
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,943
When we're leaving

363
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,759
I hear walkie-talkie on the other side of the door

364
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,295
Within 2

365
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,575
Feet of us

366
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,623
And with the door open

367
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,391
It's

368
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,927
Three dudes and ties

369
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,719
Anta sports jackets

370
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:00,255
And

371
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:04,095
I realized in that moment I internalize that

372
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:04,863
It's over

373
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:10,751
It turned out that the earlier break-in have been the work of two of the mall's newest Security card

374
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,799
Instead of removing everything

375
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:16,895
Did taking the personal items in hopes of figuring out who Michael and his friends were

376
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:20,479
Now that Michael have been foolish enough to come back during the day

377
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,759
They had their man

378
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:25,087
General Growth Properties the company that owned them all

379
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:27,391
Did not take kindly to the secret apartment

380
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,159
And its walls

381
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,439
You don't say

382
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:32,255
After being handed over to the police and interrogated

383
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,047
Java was eventually let go

384
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:38,143
But Michael soon found himself standing in front of a judge in Criminal Court

385
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:41,215
Charged with breaking and entering and felony tree

386
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,287
By the time I get to court

387
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,335
The mall is hired a lawyer

388
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,127
And

389
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,199
They launched into all these details about

390
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,223
The

391
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,527
Illegal things that I have done

392
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:55,551
And I keep my mouth

393
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:56,575
Shut

394
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,367
But

395
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:00,671
After they've gone to this laundry list of

396
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,695
Illegal act

397
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:04,255
They use the phrase

398
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:07,327
This gave mr. Townsend axis

399
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,863
To an apartment that

400
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,143
They had built

401
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,679
Over several years that had

402
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:14,239
The following things in it and goes on to Blythe

403
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,031
In detail

404
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,823
What department look like

405
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:22,175
Including the coffee table the television a copy of the game Grand Theft Auto

406
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,711
An 8-foot China hutch

407
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,991
4 piece sectional couch

408
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:27,295
Silverware for 8 with matching glass

409
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,855
6 ft decals

410
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:33,695
This player gives the more the judge just looks around and he's like

411
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,231
What's Happening Here

412
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,023
The judge

413
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,047
Hustle

414
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,071
Advisors

415
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,887
Klosterman and hearing whispering

416
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:45,471
Any looks that looks me dead in the eyes and he goes

417
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,519
This is not a criminal act

418
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,847
We're not sure exactly what it was

419
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,383
But

420
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:53,663
This is not a crime

421
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:59,807
When the judge was receiving a deep legal Truth at the heart of this case

422
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:05,183
Where Michael was just the beneficiary of an incredible amount of white privilege

423
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:07,231
Michael may never know

424
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:11,071
In the end he was slapped with a misdemeanor for trespassing and release

425
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:15,679
He lived on and off in a secret apartment for nearly 4 years

426
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:18,239
And it was going to cost him almost nothing

427
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,823
But that doesn't mean he got away entirely scot-free

428
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:26,943
Just before Michael left the mall the mall security team handed him a piece of paper

429
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:33,087
The same piece of paper they hand to Brawlers shoplifters and anyone else who has overstayed their welcome

430
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,367
In this most private

431
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,647
Public spaces

432
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:36,927
This is

433
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:37,951
Standardized

434
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:41,535
Manila piece of paper which has a map of the mall

435
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,839
It has red line around the whole thing

436
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:47,935
You have to sign it and it says you can't cross that red line

437
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,495
How to make it clear you're never coming back

438
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,079
Now

439
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,615
Over a decade later

440
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,895
Michael still live

441
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:58,175
Right near the mall

442
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:02,015
But his days are running anywhere near is 13 acres

443
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,039
Are over

444
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:06,367
And the biggest bummer for me is that

445
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:09,951
If I want to go to downtown

446
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:10,719
The

447
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:12,511
That you bring your bike

448
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,279
Through is

449
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:17,119
Do the center of the mall where bridges over the river

450
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:19,935
I'll have to bike around it

451
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,751
Eric biker Roundup

452
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,823
Diligently

453
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,871
I have never broken this rule

454
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,663
Seriously can never go back

455
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,199
I could never go back

456
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:45,023
The story was a co-production with a KCRW podcast Nocturne which is produced and hosted by Vanessa

457
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:49,631
Solo Nocturne is an exploration of the night and the landscape of the Unseen

458
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,447
With a link on the website and in the show notes

459
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,263
We go back to the mall

460
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,543
Specifically

461
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,871
After this

462
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,271
Between the beats

463
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:08,575
Bongs and chatter of our devices

464
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:12,159
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

465
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,183
If

466
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:17,791
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexis

467
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:23,679
Talking to me and my wife is in another room and another hearing. Voice

468
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,447
Technology

469
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,471
She talked to us

470
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,519
It is a creation of Sonic trap

471
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:30,591
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

472
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:34,175
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

473
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:36,223
To make them more human

474
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,063
Turn the living room lights on

475
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:41,855
Okay

476
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,903
Dim the living room lights to 50

477
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:44,671
2%

478
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:46,463
Okay

479
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:52,863
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

480
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,911
Makes for a much more natural

481
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:55,679
Experience

482
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,727
Turn the living room lights on

483
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,799
Dim the living room lights

484
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:01,823
50%

485
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:09,247
Representing two special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

486
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:12,063
About how are soundscape is impacting our health

487
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:14,623
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

488
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:19,744
Look for them Fridays May 17th and May 24th right here on the 9th 9 p.m.

489
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:24,096
We need to talk about something

490
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:27,424
Constipation abdominal pain and bloating

491
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,264
It's not that bad to take laxatives you modify your diet and exercise routine

492
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,312
Thinking about it all the time is frustrate

493
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:38,688
It doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again

494
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:45,088
You don't know why and it may be time to seek help go to oh my God. Info / podcast

495
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:50,464
We can learn more about your symptoms that's oh my God. Info / podcast

496
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,232
Oh my God

497
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,024
Flask podcast

498
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:56,864
Now that we've sneaked into this weird public

499
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,656
Private space that is the mall

500
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:04,544
I thought it'd be fun to revisit the origin story of this incredibly intriguing location which Avery reported for us

501
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,080
A few years ago

502
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,432
We've all done it

503
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:14,528
You go to the store for a pair of socks and come out with a mega pack of soda

504
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,368
Go out to get shampoo and come back with a fancy razor

505
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,672
It's hard to stick to what's on your list

506
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:22,464
I challenge you to go to IKEA

507
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,280
And leave with only the thing for what you game

508
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:29,120
Just try to buy a lamp without buying a cutting board it can't be done

509
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:34,496
You absolutely knew this but retail spaces are designed to do this to you

510
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:36,544
Producer Avery trufelman

511
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,872
The store is trying to look so beautiful

512
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:40,896
So welcoming

513
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:44,992
The items so enticingly displayed in such vast quantity

514
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,016
That you cannot help

515
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,296
To be drawn in

516
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:49,600
And I'm drawn towards something you don't need

517
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,904
This is the Gruen effect

518
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,696
The Gruen effect

519
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:56,000
Or sometimes called the Gruen transfer

520
00:22:56,512 --> 00:23:01,632
If that moment when you walk into a store and the design of the store is so overwhelming and

521
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:02,656
Dazzling

522
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:04,960
That you being mindlessly consuming

523
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:07,008
The Gruene effect is named

524
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,288
Victor Victor Gruen

525
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:12,896
The who was growing complicated complex contradictory guy

526
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:15,712
Jeff Hardwick wrote the biography of Victor Gruen

527
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:18,784
Who is born Victor grunbaum born in Vienna

528
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,576
In 1904

529
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:24,928
And he is Jewish in Vienna leaves

530
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,976
1038 good call Groupon

531
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,768
And makes his way eventually

532
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:29,792
2

533
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:30,816
New York City

534
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:35,680
Once a New York grew and made a name for himself designing shops and Retail spaces

535
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:39,776
And this was a particular challenge during the lean years of the late 30s

536
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,824
People had no money

537
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,640
I just wouldn't go into shops at all

538
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:47,456
The girl figured out how to lower people inside

539
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:51,552
Basically by using amazingly appealing window displays

540
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,880
Go into these window

541
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:56,672
Display area

542
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,208
Look at

543
00:23:58,976 --> 00:23:59,744
Jewelry

544
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,280
Handbags

545
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:02,560
Chocolate

546
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,096
Venue.

547
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,632
Tempted and lured into

548
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,936
The store I mean that's the Gruen effect

549
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:11,008
Gruene argued that good design equals good profit

550
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,288
And he

551
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,568
Equate those

552
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,592
One to one

553
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,896
If you do more

554
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:18,688
People are going to stay there longer and spend more

555
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:25,344
Bruins started making storefront all over the country and he moved from New York to Los Angeles in 1940

556
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,416
Gruen was from the beautiful city of Vienna

557
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:32,000
Which is lined with shops and Greenery and places together

558
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:36,352
It's not how most Americans we're just riding around in their cars all the time

559
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,400
Cut off from the city in from each other

560
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:40,960
He knew this problem was even worse

561
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:41,984
In the suburbs

562
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:46,592
The suburb lacked what sociologist Ray Oldenburg calls

563
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:47,616
Places

564
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:50,176
I think of home as your primary place

565
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,712
Work as your second place

566
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:55,808
And that third place is where you go to build communities hang out

567
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:57,856
To Simply feel connected

568
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:00,416
Gruen wanted to give the American suburbs

569
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:02,208
That third place

570
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,744
Image

571
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,816
Abreva inconclusive communication with other people

572
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,352
Image of

573
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:11,936
Petting zoo possibility from walk to one place to another

574
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:15,520
That's archival footage of Ruin from the University of Wyoming

575
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:20,384
See image of participating in events outside of your own little house

576
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,688
Become a desired effect

577
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:26,272
Victor Gruen imagine designing an environment

578
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:27,808
Full of greenery in shops

579
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,344
An indoor Plaza

580
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,880
A modern for him

581
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:33,696
Island of connection in the middle of the sprawl

582
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:36,512
One that would only be accessible to

583
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,048
Because

584
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,632
Old man Victor Gruen hated cars

585
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:43,424
He Rants and Raves

586
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,448
Against cars

587
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:47,008
One technological event

588
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:52,128
Advent of the private car

589
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,224
It's means of mass transportation

590
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,344
Human life intense is Justice great

591
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:02,880
Effect of exposure

592
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:09,024
It's hard understanding with the tape hessney accent but what Gruen is saying there is

593
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,840
The threat of cars that human life in hell

594
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:14,144
Is as great as the exposed

595
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:14,912
Sewer

596
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:20,544
So gruhn's objective was to get people to park their cars far away from these third places

597
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,568
And walk

598
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:23,104
Stroll within them

599
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:27,200
Has grew inside his structure would be an architectural Panacea

600
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:31,552
It would remedy environmental commercial and sociological problems

601
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,576
With the creation

602
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,856
I'm a single building

603
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:38,976
And so Gruen presented his solution for America

604
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,512
The shopping mall

605
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,888
Good actually wanted the shopping mall to be more than just shops

606
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:48,448
You want some D mixed-use he want

607
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:49,984
Apartments

608
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,592
Send offices or medical centers attached to the shopping center he

609
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,872
Cases that have

610
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:58,688
Childcare facilities Library

611
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:00,224
Bomb shelters

612
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,016
Whole range of

613
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,040
Different

614
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:03,808
A function

615
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:08,928
Ingrown dreamed and wrote about the enclosed shopping center way before he ever built one

616
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:11,744
Until he finally land the commission

617
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,024
For the very first

618
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:16,096
Indoor climate controlled Shopping Center

619
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:21,216
In Edina Minnesota a place not known for the welcoming climate

620
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,312
Southdale represents an entirely new and dramatic

621
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,848
Retail merchandising

622
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:30,944
Southdale Center opened in 1956

623
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,248
And it was the mother of all shopping malls

624
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,272
Seriously

625
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:39,648
Bruins subsequent malls were all mostly based off this original Edina design

626
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:42,976
When he's doing the first enclosed shopping mall

627
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:43,744
Southdale

628
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,280
In Edina Minnesota

629
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:47,584
Gruen really emphasize

630
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:49,376
And what the media ends up

631
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:50,400
Celebrate

632
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,680
Is this massive

633
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:52,704
Center Court

634
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:55,008
This cord isn't closing skylighter

635
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,544
Store

636
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,336
Photoshopping cyborg

637
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:01,664
In fact the whole area in front of the stores

638
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:04,224
Is air conditioned and Temperature Control

639
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,040
A year-round climate of 72 degrees

640
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,320
For grilling

641
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,344
He's creating a

642
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:10,880
A Town Square

643
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:12,416
Southdale Center wasn't

644
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,440
Quite mixed-use

645
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,720
Migraine imagine

646
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,000
People didn't live in it

647
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:18,304
And something like a daycare center or app

648
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,096
Post office couldn't afford that rent

649
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:23,168
The Tell-Tale did have local shops of all kinds

650
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,704
And plenty of shopping

651
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:25,984
Southdale

652
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,776
Tomorrow's Main Street

653
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:28,800
Today

654
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,360
But from the outside

655
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:33,664
Southdale Center is not much to look at

656
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:35,200
I mean it looks like a mall

657
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:38,016
What does ominous Amorphis boxy shape

658
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:39,552
In designing the shopping mall

659
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:43,392
Ruin ended is Razzle Dazzle storefront and window displays

660
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:44,928
Southdale hardly has a

661
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:49,792
Exterior windows at all the moves away from the original concept that in some ways they're going to

662
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:50,560
Track

663
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:51,840
By being Austin

664
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:55,168
The drawn now is what's inside the mall

665
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:58,240
Congruent mind it should have

666
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,264
Pretty much

667
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,872
Blank facade no signage on it and then you enter that

668
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:07,456
Space and then you walk into the shopping center and that's that

669
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:10,272
Set of transformational Gruen transfer moment

670
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:13,856
Mold are designed as the sort of suburban pilgrimage sites

671
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:14,880
Which of course

672
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,416
You have to drive to

673
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:17,952
It's a commitment

674
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:22,816
You're driving 20-30 minutes your parking your getting out of your car your walking in

675
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:25,120
Good new that Americans love to drive

676
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:26,656
So the mall with his compromise

677
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:29,728
You had to walk and stroll once you're inside

678
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:31,776
But the customers could drive over

679
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,312
So he just hates

680
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:36,128
The automobile but he never will acknowledge

681
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:39,712
That he's creating the shopping centres which are

682
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:41,504
Largely

683
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:44,064
Only accessible through cars

684
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,624
Brewing with rice

685
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,416
Americans love

686
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:53,024
Driving to his balls he got commissions for them all over the country

687
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,304
But over time

688
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,608
Truancies that in erecting these malls

689
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:58,144
Is Tiny Suburban cities

690
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:00,960
He's helping to drain the real City

691
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,264
So for a while

692
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:05,056
Current shifts his Focus

693
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,592
Urban planning

694
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:07,872
B12

695
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:08,640
Urcp

696
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,688
Which because we have neglect

697
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,552
Enter Gruen ends up

698
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:18,112
Being involved in urban renewal project

699
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:18,880
Next wear

700
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:20,928
He draws directly on

701
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,720
The Lessons Learned in his

702
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:24,000
Suburban shopping malls

703
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:26,304
And proposes bringing them back downtown

704
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:31,424
Municipality Tire Gruen and Associates to make their downtown

705
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:35,008
Gruen turns City centers into pedestrian-only spaces

706
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,824
Full of public art and Greenery and line

707
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,592
What shops

708
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:40,384
He made plans for Boulder

709
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,944
Fresno Fort Worth Kalamazoo

710
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,712
Actually

711
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:47,552
His plan for Kalamazoo became the first outdoor pedestrian shopping mall

712
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:53,952
Open the US even had a concept to turn 5th Avenue into a pedestrian Mall

713
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:56,768
Close down 5th Avenue for a couple weeks as a test

714
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,584
What is City's downtown is not a mall

715
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:05,984
Not so easily quote-unquote fixed not so perfectly designed and controlled cities

716
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:11,104
We're going to become the pleasant sterile shopping environments That Grew and wanted them to be

717
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:12,640
After

718
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:19,552
The Riots of the 60s he is shocked into the taken aback by those and it was

719
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:20,576
It's very much I'm prepared

720
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:26,976
And I thank God that may have been somewhat of his reason for the retreat to Vienna

721
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:33,632
In 1968 from Los Angeles back to Vienna back to the greenery

722
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:35,424
You've been trying to imitate

723
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:38,496
But he could not Escape his own creation

724
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:41,568
There's a shopping mall that's being built on the edge of Vienna

725
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:47,200
And he points to that as how original Vision had been completely skewed

726
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:49,760
After being in Vienna about 10 years

727
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:51,040
He gives

728
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:51,808
The speech in

729
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:54,368
Paper where he says

730
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,416
I refuse to pay alimony for the

731
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,184
Bastard

732
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:00,000
Victor Gruen the mall maker

733
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:02,304
Became the foremost Mall critic

734
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:06,144
Meanwhile America's love affair with malls continued

735
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:12,544
Do you want to catch them all pretty girl like you doing sitting alone in the middle of this Monument to consumerism

736
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:17,408
I know I remember in my own experience

737
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:23,808
Growing up in New Jersey when the first Mall opened anywhere near me when I was in high school this is Ellen Dunham

738
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:27,648
Jones she's a professor of architecture and Urban Design at Georgia Tech

739
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,696
It was cool to go to the mall

740
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:32,512
But I mean literally it was air condition

741
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:36,096
My home wasn't air-conditioned my school wasn't air-conditioned

742
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:39,936
Today most of us are

743
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:45,056
Spending our days and our nights in completely thermally controlled environments

744
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:47,616
A lot of us are craving

745
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:49,408
Being able to

746
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,200
Be outdoors

747
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:57,344
In recent decades our tastes have beard away from climate controlled environments and away from the indoor mall

748
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,720
Mall construction actually peaked in 1990 it's been declining ever since

749
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:06,560
And by mmvi is really the last

750
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:09,888
Brand new standard conventional Mall

751
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:11,168
That's been dealt in the US

752
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,728
And a new product has entered the scene

753
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:19,104
I kind of shopping center that the icsc the international Council of shopping centers

754
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,896
Kohl's a lifestyle

755
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:23,968
Lifestyle centers started appearing

756
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:24,992
In the 90s

757
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:26,784
And they

758
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,320
Tend to be

759
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,600
Open air

760
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:32,672
So when you don't have that roof anymore

761
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:39,328
But you have a lot of boutiques and a lot more restaurants Lodo centers are malls the sky

762
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,608
Guys as main streets

763
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:42,656
And even though they're full of chain stores

764
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:46,240
Lifestyle centers are sunny and walkable and bustling

765
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:48,288
And kind of what Victor Gruen imagine

766
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,616
And some of the old style indoor shopping malls

767
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:52,384
Are being read

768
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:55,200
Arby's

769
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,992
Retrofitted

770
00:33:57,248 --> 00:34:00,320
Into the Hispanic community centers

771
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:01,600
Like in Plaza Fiesta

772
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:02,624
Outside of Atlanta

773
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:08,768
A lot of the stores have been cut up into much smaller mom-and-pop

774
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:15,168
Small shops selling Western Wear selling quinceanera dresses Plaza Fiesta also has a steady

775
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:16,192
The events calendar

776
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,472
Performances

777
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,384
In this two was kind of what growing imagine

778
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:28,992
These sort of community malls are truly places together and spend money

779
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:31,296
In the Shell of the failed design

780
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:33,600
Most people architectural historian

781
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:34,368
Especially

782
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:36,416
Fake ruin was a horrible Act

783
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:38,208
And you know

784
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,256
I I can see where they're coming

785
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,280
Physics

786
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:42,816
Barriers of his building

787
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:44,608
Are uniformly boring

788
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:47,424
It's a grueling that wasn't the point it was the interior

789
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:48,448
That we're really

790
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:51,520
Point does fountains the cheesy statues

791
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:54,336
Elevator music piped in through all those speakers

792
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,384
Those are all part of the Gruen effect

793
00:34:56,896 --> 00:35:00,224
And I helped turn shopping malls into spaces where we felt comfortable

794
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,528
Staying and spending time and money

795
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:06,112
A lot of the original indoor malls are abandoned now

796
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:08,672
Growing weeds inside

797
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,792
Website this becomes a graveyard of dead malls called deadmalls.com

798
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:17,632
Users can log on to submit stories of the Dead malls in their towns

799
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:22,752
There are around 450 malls listed are submitted as sort of oral history

800
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:24,032
In particular what

801
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,592
Interesting I think about deadmalls.com is

802
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,872
How to spell check

803
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:31,456
A lot of fishes and it does make sense

804
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:38,368
So many Suburban communities the mall became the de-facto Town Center it was really the center

805
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:40,672
Of social life other than the school

806
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,232
I would be very sad if all of them

807
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:46,304
Victor Gruen Smalls were demolished we should certainly

808
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,584
Work to preserve

809
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:49,632
At least one

810
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:57,824
The most famous Mall in Minnesota maybe the Mall of America with roller coaster at zipline at the

811
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,360
Aquarion water park

812
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:01,920
The most architecturally significant law

813
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:02,944
It's grandfather

814
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:06,016
Is it one that's just a 12 minute drive away

815
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,296
In Edina

816
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:21,120

Before we go I want to tell you about the body Genie

832
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,888
Series from Bellow radio TV show the truth

833
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,704
The body genius is a Dark comic mystery

834
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,984
That whines through a

835
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,032
Treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

836
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:33,568
We're looking the part

837
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:35,104
Might cost you your life

838
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:40,480
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

839
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:44,832
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

840
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:48,160
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like

841
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:49,184
A dad

842
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,536
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

843
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:57,888
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main guy to know how to do that kind

844
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:58,912
I think

845
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:05,312
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

846
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:08,640
Was found dead in my private gym

847
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:11,968
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

848
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:16,320
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

849
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:17,600
Now

850
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:19,648
I need to clear my name

851
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:25,024
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes

852
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,048
To find them

853
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:33,984
