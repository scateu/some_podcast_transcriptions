This is 99% invisible

00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:08,864
I'm Roman Mars

32
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:15,264
In the 1960s American cities were in crisis

33
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,032
Infrastructure

34
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:18,336
Crumbly traffic and pollution

35
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,104
Terrible

36
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,456
Cities particularly nice places to live

37
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:30,112
White people were able to flee Urban centers for the suburbs thanks to Federal help with mortgages and new freeway

38
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,416
That process would come to be known

39
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,696
As white flight

40
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:40,352
Meanwhile black populations in cities were dealing with housing discrimination and police brutality

41
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:43,680
Riots were breaking out in cities all over the country

42
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:47,264
And this awful time was referred to by Scholars as

43
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,800
The urban crisis

44
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,336
Methrone Katie McCoy

45
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:54,432
The Civil Rights Movement was happening in parallel

46
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:59,552
Go to the urban crisis but it wasn't really addressing the problems for black people

47
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,600
The overarching

48
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,880
Question

49
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:05,184
Can the cities be saved

50
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,976
How can we make

51
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,000
Urban life

52
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,560
Better for people

53
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:11,328
For all people

54
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,120
That's Rodger biles

55
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:15,424
Professor of history at Illinois

56
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,192
State

57
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:16,960
Varsity

58
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,240
In-N-Out

59
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,264
There were some folks

60
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:20,544
Situation in

61
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,360
Now we just

62
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,896
We just can't Salvage

63
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:25,920
What's here

64
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,968
The answer is

65
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,248
Starting Over Again

66
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:36,928
In other words urban planner thought maybe the problems facing cities were too big and too complicated to fix

67
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,720
And it's within this context

68
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,792
Of the urban crisis and the Civil Rights Movement

69
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,584
But the federal government

70
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,984
Would come to consider an idea like Soul City

71
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:56,384
Call for the nydia today a new city to be built in the country in North Carolina to be calls so

72
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,784
And to be populated mainly or entirely by Negroes he says would move there from the

73
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:11,232
This tape is from a 1969 NBC national news broadcast and this new city was

74
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:15,328
Being proposed by a civil rights leader named Floyd mckissick

75
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,656
Publishing on new city in North Carolina

76
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,960
We will create new jobs

77
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,520
A new career for black people

78
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,824
As a response to the urban crisis

79
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,944
The federal government had announced plans to provide financing to about a dozen brand-new town

80
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:33,760
Floyd mckissick wanted seoul City

81
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:39,392
To be one of those persons will be able to control their own destiny

82
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:42,464
We have the power to actually

83
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,488
Be a part of

84
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,072
Building a town come-ons it's a story of America

85
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,120
And to be a part of it

86
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:55,776
That's Jane Ballroom she was working as a secretary for mckissick and Harlem when he first started developing the ID

87
00:03:56,032 --> 00:04:02,176
BF4 Soul city which would be a place built for and by black people Al and black oportun

88
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:08,320
Unity in rural North Carolina Jane says going to Seoul city was like being a pilgrim

89
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:13,952
You know we had our own Mayflower ship we came down the card you know it's the same thing

90
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,256
But really hard

91
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,559
The pilgrims did have it really hard

92
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,351
But this wouldn't be easy either

93
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:26,751
The government would eventually come to support this project but there would be politics and compromises and very strange bedfellows

94
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:30,335
And that was all before breaking ground on Soul City

95
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:37,247
When Floyd mckissick first pitch the idea of an all-black town

96
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,319
There was one question he got asked a lot

97
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,623
Visibility of a city like this

98
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:45,439
Form part of the trend toward separatism

99
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:48,511
This is a reporter at an early press conference

100
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,047
A lot of people were curious about

101
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:56,447
Was Soul City a departure from the idea that black people and white people should integrate together in society

102
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:59,263
Was this instead of black people starting their own thing

103
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:00,799
Separate from white people

104
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:04,127
And you can hear mckissick struggle to answer

105
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:11,039
It does the same thing as the Chinese have done in New York

106
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:17,439
Chinese area Chinatown

107
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:24,863
To understand all the ways that this question about separatism was relevant

108
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:28,191
You have to understand a bit about who Floyd mckissick was

109
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,495
This Photograph here with kill my

110
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,775
Barbara

111
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:35,871
I'm left here hand-in-hand with dr. King this is Floyd mckissick

112
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:36,639
II

113
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:42,271
He's a lawyer and a state senator and he's showing me pictures of his dad that are hanging in his office

114
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:44,063
Durham North Carolina

115
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:50,463
Freedom famous March on Washington Dr King gave his I had a dream speech

116
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:54,047
My father and daughter Kayla said that Mark that day

117
00:05:54,303 --> 00:06:00,447
TDC years after that March Floyd mckissick senior would become the executive director of an organization called

118
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,215
LabCorp

119
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:04,287
That's the Congress on Racial equality

120
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,079
And he was part of the handful of

121
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:09,151
Really important civil rights leaders in the 60s

122
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,687
Along with people like

123
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:13,759
Dr. King Wilkinson NAACP

124
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:17,087
Whitney Young of the Urban League and Stokely Carmichael of

125
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,111
Snake

126
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:21,695
Snake being the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee

127
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:25,023
Because of these leaders and the members of their organization

128
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:29,631
Huge legal gains were made in civil rights and integration in the 50s and 60s

129
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,191
And then in 1966

130
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:34,751
There's this kind of pivotal moment

131
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:35,519
The movement

132
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:43,711
A civil rights activist named James Meredith is shot by a white gunman while leading a March in Mississippi

133
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:48,575
Stokely Carmichael and Floyd mckissick both go down in Mississippi to continue the March

134
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,367
Carmichael is arrested

135
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,415
And when he gets out of jail he makes a speech

136
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,183
Recess

137
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,463
Don't be afraid

138
00:06:54,719 --> 00:07:00,863
Don't be ashamed we want Black Power

139
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:08,543
And we back the president with the federal government

140
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,591
That's all we've been doing back in Vegas

141
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,383
It's time we stand up and take over

142
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:15,199
On that day in 1966

143
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,271
The Black Power movement was born

144
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,319
And mckissick of core

145
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,855
And Carmichael is snake

146
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:24,415
Become two of the most vocal advocate

147
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,207
And this New Movement

148
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:29,279
What do we need black power when we need it now

149
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:33,119
Starting my dad will probably the two leaders in articulating what that meant

150
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:39,007
For Carmichael and mckissick Black Tower was a step further than civil rights and integration

151
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:43,615
It was essentially the idea that black people should control their own communities

152
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:46,687
Should have proportional representation in government

153
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:49,759
Again Stokely Carmichael in nineteen

154
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,527
6

155
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:57,695
We have to do whatever group in this country did we got to take over the community where we outnumber people so we can that.

156
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,511
The Weeknd

157
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,559
So we can have deeson Road

158
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,095
So we can have json

159
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,143
So we can have.

160
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:06,911
Injustice

161
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:14,591
Mckissack & Carmichael both very much believe

162
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,639
And the idea of black power

163
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,199
But in the late 60s

164
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,479
They began to diverge

165
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,015
About how to achieve it

166
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:28,927
Carmichael and many others in the Black Power movement thought that capitalism was inherently exploitative sis

167
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:31,487
That would always leave someone at the bottom

168
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:34,047
Another hand mckissick began to believe that

169
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,839
Capitalism was the answer

170
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,119
Mckissock

171
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,679
Actually Associates himself

172
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,727
Very important

173
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,519
Tendency

174
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:44,543
In Black Power

175
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:51,199
That's Sundiata charge you a professor of history and African-American studies at the University of Illinois

176
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,223
Urbana Champaign

177
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,807
And the Tendencies talking about is one toward black

178
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,831
Capitalism

179
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:00,927
What it means since we is that black people should

180
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,207
I want to control

181
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,767
Their own caplis Enterprises

182
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,071
And it comes to suggest that

183
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,351
Business ownership

184
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,887
Is the path

185
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:14,495
To equality freedom justice social transformation

186
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:18,079
Too long have we attempted to divide

187
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,103
Economics

188
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:25,503
From Politics the question that becomes Paramount in saying 1970s is strategy

189
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,527
General principle

190
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:32,927
That's Floyd mckissick an archival interview with political writer Walter DeVries

191
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:45,727
Cooley pragmatic you might lose everything that you gave at all those games that you've made

192
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:50,335
Mckissick believes that the time for idealism was over

193
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:54,687
What time for black people to claim their piece of the American Pie

194
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,991
Now what the hell are you

195
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:00,319
What are you going to do to become a full-fledged America

196
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:08,511
Actually Stokely Carmichael Africa

197
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:14,911
Leaving behind the black power movement in America African people

198
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,935
Revolutionary party

199
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:19,775
And Floyd mckissick did indeed stay in the states

200
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,079
He resign from core to start

201
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:25,151
For-profit company called mckissock Enterprises

202
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,711
And set his sights on building

203
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,735
Seoul City

204
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:33,599
The town he hoped would create as much Economic Opportunity for black Americans

205
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,367
Opossum

206
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:41,535
And we can bring together the private sector Industries

207
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:47,935
Educational resources to really build a town

208
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,895
The building of black tiles is an expression of a desire for autonomy

209
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:01,503
Mckissick Soul City wasn't a first for Blacktown building in the US

210
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:08,159
Quite a few towns were settled in the Great Plains between 1890 and 1910 by African-American sharecroppers

211
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,439
Shoppers Food in the south

212
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:13,279
But these weren't intentionally planned communities with government support

213
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,607
Amazingly in the late 1960s just as mckissick

214
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,631
Becomes convinced

215
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,167
Building a new town

216
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,215
The way to achieve Black Power

217
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:22,495
The government

218
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:25,311
Struggling to deal with the so-called Urban crisis

219
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:29,151
Announces their program to help Finance several new cities

220
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:32,479
Art of the urban growth and new communities Act

221
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,295
The legislation was passed

222
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:38,367
Which provided a process

223
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,391
Rebuilding me

224
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:46,559
That's historian Rodger biles again and he says these new cities would be meticulously planned in order to avoid

225
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,607
Play the problems of existing cities

226
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:52,447
Now we're going to bring all of the knowledge and all the insights

227
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,727
Urban planning

228
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,263
To doing it right this

229
00:11:56,031 --> 00:12:01,151
The program would be managed by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development also known as HUD

230
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:04,991
Private developers could propose ideas to hide for Newtown

231
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,527
If they were approved

232
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:10,623
The New Towns could sell government back to bonds to investors on Wall Street

233
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:17,279
And as mckissick starts talking to people within Hood about this all-black Town idea they're like

234
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:23,679
Look there's no way we're going to approve something that's perceived as being separatist so

235
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:27,775
Mckissock dials back the language he was using to describe Seoul City

236
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:33,919
If you look at the things that he wrote and said before he fills out the actual applications

237
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:39,039
Right it's all about you know at least he's talking about building

238
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,575
Ideal black communities

239
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,927
After he's going through that process

240
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:47,999
In the literature is about building

241
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,535
Middle class

242
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,583
Communities that are open

243
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:57,471
Mckissick never envisioned a place where white people would be specifically

244
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,239
Excluded

245
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:02,079
He did a Maginot majority-black town with majority black leadership

246
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,383
He couldn't really talk about it like

247
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,455
Politics concessions must be made

248
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:11,039
I'm the next big one would come in the form of an important

249
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:14,879
Ally Brooke Jessica understood that to be approved to build one of these new cities

250
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:17,183
He leave friends in high places

251
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,999
He first pitches the idea to the current president

252
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,279
Lyndon Johnson

253
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,583
Andre Johnson teams interested

254
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,399
But then he decides not to run for re-election

255
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:33,567
And so in 1968 mckissick looks at the new field of presidential candidates and asks himself

256
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,127
Who is the most viable person to support

257
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,663
Seoul City

258
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:42,783
That's Devin Fergus he's a professor of African-American studies at Ohio State University

259
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,551
Varsity

260
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,343
Sport Richard Nixon

261
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:49,951
We've had enough of big promises a little action the time has come

262
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:50,975
We're honest

263
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,511
Government in the United States

264
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,679
Shockingly nixon-egli

265
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,079
Nixon believed in Black

266
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:09,151
Capitalism because Nixon believed in capitalism

267
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:12,735
He believed that when people own property and businesses

268
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,783
They had more of a stake in the car

269
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:15,551
Tree

270
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:19,391
Apart from that the Republican Party wanted to bring in Black

271
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:24,255
Vote the party early 60s and 70s was a was a much more

272
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,791
Big tents

273
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:29,631
Party the way to win in a way to create a door wood Republican Party

274
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:32,191
Is by casting Suarez

275
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:39,103
It's unclear how much Nixon support help makesex cause since the final decision was made by an agency with

276
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:39,871
Pain hard

277
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,407
Early 1970s

278
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:46,271
Soul city did become one of these 13 New Towns to receive government backing

279
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,551
And Floyd mckissick

280
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,831
Black power leaders

281
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,367
Became a Republican

282
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:53,183
And one of Nixon's most vocal black supporter

283
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,583
Of the 13 new cities

284
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,607
Seoul City

285
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,399
It was the only so-called

286
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,447
Free-standing New City

287
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:11,359
Meaning it wasn't being built right next to an already existing City that it can lean on for employment opportunities

288
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,127
An interest

289
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:15,967
It was being built on an old tobacco Plantation

290
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:18,015
About an hour away from Durham

291
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:22,623
Warren County North Carolina

292
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,927
We really were mine is cuz

293
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:25,695
Youku

294
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,463
Dunno but this

295
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,743
Facebook

296
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:33,375
It was a farm it was the green dude Plantation and

297
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:35,423
59 slaves there

298
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:41,567
That's Jane ball Grimm you heard her at the beginning of the story and Doris Terry Williams

299
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:47,967
I interviewed them together and Jane's house in Warren County in 1970 Jane packed up her family

300
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:53,855
And left her crowded housing project in New York for the wide-open farmlands of North Carolina

301
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,671
For me coming out in October

302
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,951
Randy was safe

303
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,535
When Jane got to Warren County there were just a

304
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,351
Handful of other new settlers living in trailers

305
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:10,495
These early planners had developed a 30-year strategy for soul City that laid out everything

306
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:13,823
Including their plan for 3 residential villages with mix

307
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,591
Income house

308
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,359
Clothing

309
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:20,479
Floyd mckissick II actually got a degree in urban planning to help his dad design Soul City

310
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:24,063
The design was inspired by the planned community of Columbia Maryland

311
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:27,647
What which was meant to have racial diversity and a small town feel

312
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:31,231
Soul City had a choir 3600 acres of land

313
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:35,839
They hope to have a population of about 2,000 people by 1978

314
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:40,959
By the end of 30 years they wanted to be up to around 40000 people

315
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:44,287
Jane says his early days at Seoul City just felt

316
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,055
Olaf

317
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:45,823
Potential

318
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,383
Growing up in America even New York

319
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,503
You know you have limitations because you were

320
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,271
Nick Rowe

321
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,831
You have to understand that

322
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,903
You can understand that you got my point

323
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,951
Then you here you get all of this

324
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,791
It's a miracle

325
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:09,375
David seems to me was just an amazing time to be

326
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,655
Young

327
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:11,935
Gifted and black

328
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:17,823
Floyd mckissick continue to support the Republican Party

329
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,687
We spend some time traveling and campaigning for Nixon when he ran for his second term

330
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,455
President

331
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:28,575
But most of mckissick time was spent at seoul City when he was here

332
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:29,855
She was

333
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,391
In the middle of the community

334
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,695
He was never a part of above

335
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:36,767
You know I didn't have his education to have a statue

336
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:37,791
But he was

337
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,071
He's my brother

338
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:44,447
Mckissick I decided on Warren County because he grown up in North Carolina

339
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,471
Estate

340
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:51,871
But also because black residents had left the south in droves during the Great Migration to cities of the North

341
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:56,479
He wanted to give Urban blacks up place in the South to return to if they want it

342
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:58,527
And give people who are already there

343
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,807
A reason to stay

344
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:03,135
In order to create jobs makesex Hope was to attract

345
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,159
Industry

346
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,951
She wanted a big company like

347
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:08,511
General Motors to come down and build a

348
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:13,631
But before that can happen Soul City needed basic infest

349
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,935
Like Water and Electric

350
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:22,591
Soul City built-in electrical grid and partnered with a few other counties to build a huge Regional water system from a

351
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,359
Nearby lake

352
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:26,431
Between 74 and 76

353
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:31,807
Vance's growth in the morning out here bulldozes outside I see the trucks coming in

354
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:35,135
Digging up the bread by putting down concrete

355
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:38,463
What is everyday you smelled it was so fantastic

356
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,487
How many C

357
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,767
They build a health clinic

358
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:43,071
Elko public swimming pool

359
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:49,727
Both of which brought people from all over the county the road

360
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,519
And they built a huge sick

361
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,799
60000 Square

362
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:54,591
But industrial building

363
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:57,663
Divided into separate sections with loading dock

364
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,991
Call the soltek1h

365
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:07,647
Soltech one completed in 1975 was designed by architect Harvey Gantt

366
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:14,047
And it was meant to be an incubator for new industry could get started and then moved bigger facilities

367
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:19,167
If need be but despite there being moments where I felt like real growth was happening

368
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:21,471
Soul city was not hitting his targets

369
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:25,567
By the mid-1970s the population was fewer than 200 people

370
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:29,151
Do small manufacturers set up in the soltec building

371
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:32,479
But no one that could offer a substantial number of jobs

372
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:35,295
Without enough residents it was hard to attract industry

373
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,831
It without the industry

374
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,367
It was hard to attract new residence

375
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:41,695
And then there was the problem of the name

376
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,743
And then the name

377
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:44,767
So

378
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,607
I meant they were people who said you should change the name

379
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:52,703
Have a project and though you know Floyd just refused

380
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,983
To do that

381
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:58,847
We have three Souls on my cell phone

382
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:02,943
It was a time to receive the name as being to Black

383
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,575
SolarCity was not

384
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,343
An all-black

385
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:14,207
In fact Gordon Carey who played an important role in the leadership was white

386
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,743
And some of the residents

387
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,559
But it could never really escape the

388
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:19,327
Perception

389
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,351
Being an all black

390
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,119
Town

391
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,399
And in some ways

392
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,935
It never really wanted to

393
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:28,031
How many people over the years have said oh yeah why is it all black

394
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:30,847
I'm not just after an old enough to say now

395
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:34,431
Why not it was a multiracial community always was

396
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,711
Still got it

397
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:39,807
After all the years we've been through what we've been through I look at my my history

398
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,343
Why not

399
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:47,999
Apart from Soul cities identity issues mckissick Sally in the White House President Nixon had resigned

400
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:54,399
I'm in disgrace and the economy was in a slump

401
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,167
Console City

402
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:57,471
17 negative articles over 8 days

403
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:00,031
Accusing seoul city of all kinds of Wrong Turn

404
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:04,639
Put a payoff cronyism nepotism in financial misappropriation

405
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:07,711
And then with this expose as rational

406
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:10,015
Tim North Carolina senator

407
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,039
Jesse Helms

408
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:13,343
Ready to battle it was Soul City

409
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,159
Here's Floyd mckissick II again

410
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,184
Helms

411
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:19,744
Launch attacks against Old City then

412
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,304
Literally brought development to home

413
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:28,704
During his long tenure as a Republican senator in North Carolina does he Holmes gain the reputation of being

414
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,472
Enough

415
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:31,008
Seoul secret racist

416
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:33,824
And he just like the soul city project from the beginning

417
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,592
Remember

418
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:37,408
Mckissock Ann Helms when the same political party

419
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,248
Stihl Helms was determined to destroy mckissic city

420
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,784
Senator Helms ordered

421
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,344
Fiscal audit on Soul City and HUD

422
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,160
Froze funding until we thought it was over

423
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,208
I never found any wrongdoing

424
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,024
They already gave us a clean bill of health

425
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:55,328
But it it damaged us

426
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:57,632
Significantly

427
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:59,424
In terms of

428
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,448
Public perception

429
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:08,128
It's true most of the charges leveled against Soul City by Helms or the Raleigh News & Observer or not substantial

430
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,152
Cheated during the audit

431
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:12,992
The bad press had further scared away industry and investor

432
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,784
Growth in Seoul City

433
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,808
It was at a standstill

434
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:18,880
And after a certain point again

435
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,416
Historian Rodger bio

436
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:21,952
Bankers in

437
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:22,976
And HUD

438
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:26,048
Simply withdrew to the position that

439
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:30,912
Well we're not going to advance you anymore loans were not going to invest in this anymore

440
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,704
Until we see some growth

441
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,496
Ann mckissick

442
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,264
Come back why

443
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,032
Roswell

444
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:39,872
The point where the growth isn't going to come unless we have more in fast

445
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:44,224
Despacito

446
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:57,024
10 years ago Floyd mckissick a civil rights activist set out to build a city for blacks

447
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,376
Mckissick said that in 30 years it would be home to 46000 people

448
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:08,032
But today Soul city is a broken dream in the government has begun foreclosure action to seize the property

449
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,064
It was forced into foreclosure

450
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,880
And most of the land at Seoul said it was sold off

451
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:27,744
But if the Thirteen towns develop just part of the urban growth and new communities Act

452
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:30,304
Solecity wasn't the only one.

453
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,120
Fail only one of them actually

454
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:35,936
Thrived and that was

455
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:37,728
A place called The Woodlands which is

456
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:38,496
Is just North

457
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:39,520
Buy Houston

458
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:42,592
The Woodlands was more generously subsidize from the beginning

459
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:44,640
And had the benefit of being on the outskirts of

460
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:46,688
Houston Texas during an oil boom

461
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,248
The other twelve towns all failed

462
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,016
Meaning

463
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,552
People might still live there

464
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:54,112
They did not continue on autonomously

465
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,440
Some became suburbs or neighborhoods a bigger town

466
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:59,232
Summer Maine unincorporated

467
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:01,024
Most of the failed towns

468
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,816
Cited a lack of investment

469
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:04,864
Is the primary reason for failure

470
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,656
Butthole City face

471
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,424
Additional

472
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:11,264
They were the only stand-alone town

473
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,568
So they were truly starting from nothing

474
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,640
Is that a strong dose of races

475
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:22,016
That might be the way you laugh when you ask

476
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:22,784
Actually want to

477
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,552
Scream

478
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:28,928
In any case it's not hard to imagine that racism played a role in Seoul City's demise

479
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:32,000
There was the investigation by Jesse Helms

480
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,280
The negative press

481
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:37,376
And the government play junior size was always looking over their shoulder

482
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:40,960
We will always under a special level of scrutiny

483
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:43,776
Any special level of review

484
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:51,200
To make the right turn at the yellow sign down there that was the Mets

485
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:54,016
Entrance to Soak City

486
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:57,344
I'm driving around with doors Terry Williams in what was once

487
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,368
Seoul City

488
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,696
It's now an unincorporated part of Warren County

489
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:08,352
This little strip right here was built as the beginning of

490
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:12,960
Kind of a commercial place there were several little businesses

491
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,776
Still feels like a really rural area

492
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,568
There's a pond and some Woods

493
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,616
Few clusters of houses

494
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:23,456
Some of the buildings are abandoned like the health clinic

495
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:29,088
And this building here on the aleph this was healthco healthco

496
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,904
When we get to a new building

497
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:32,928
Big one

498
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:36,256
One that was built after the soul city project

499
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,024
Failed

500
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:43,424
And this is the prison

501
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,240
In 1993

502
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:49,056
The Warren County Correctional Facility was built

503
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:52,640
It's a high-security prison designed to house about 800 inmates

504
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,176
And next door to the Press

505
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:56,736
In the building that used to be sold techone

506
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:59,040
Is now correction Enterprises

507
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:04,672
So take one remember was the building designed to incubate new industry in Seoul City

508
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:06,720
Add correction Enterprises

509
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,536
Prison laborers make janitorial products

510
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:10,304
Soap

511
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,608
About $3 a day

512
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:19,264
All of this on the former slave plantation that Floyd mckissick had to transform into a place for black

513
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,800
Black people to succeed

514
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:24,640
It's not hard to see the tragic irony in this

515
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:27,968
Back at Jane's house I asked her and Dora's how they felt

516
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:29,248
When the prison came

517
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,064
I lost my freaking mind on Beyonce shirt

518
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:35,904
Cereal industry

519
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,696
Instead of a prison

520
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:40,000
Black person

521
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,792
It happens all over

522
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:48,192
You know Road America particularly low-income and and and communities of color

523
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,008
But the promise that is going to bring jaw

524
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:56,896
It is an insult is an insult to Floyd memory is an insult to all the

525
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:59,200
The things that he was trying to do here

526
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:02,784
Floyd mckissick passed away in 1991

527
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:06,112
So he didn't live to see this final insult to his

528
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:06,880
City

529
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:11,488
Before he died he served as a judge in North Carolina and as a pastor

530
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:13,024
The First Baptist Church of

531
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:13,792
Seoul City

532
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:16,096
He found a way to continue

533
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,632
The struggle

534
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,936
But Soul city was a hard defeat

535
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:20,704
To get over

536
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,264
This was his architecture this was his

537
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:31,712
This was his Fountainhead this was his this was it it is and it is his legacy I mean can you imagine and I tell you I

538
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:34,784
I sort of resent him he was just a different man

539
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:37,344
You know something happened shaken away

540
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,392
He wouldn't tell you

541
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,440
But something happened shaken away

542
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:44,768
Itsfunneh

543
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:47,584
I never heard of mckissick

544
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:53,984
I heard of a lot of his contemporaries in civil rights Martin Luther King jr. of course Roy Wilkins and Whitney Young

545
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,800
I also heard of a lot of his peers in the Black Power movement

546
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,592
People like Stokely Carmichael

547
00:27:58,848 --> 00:27:59,872

Huey Newton and Angela Davis

549
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:03,712
But not mckissick

550
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,808
These younger Scholars who do what called black power studies

551
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:13,440
They tended to study the right about the organizations and individuals

552
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:15,232

Mckissock isn't seen as heroic

558
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:30,336
But that doesn't mean he's not important

559
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:41,600
He still a less appealing character to Scholars who are interested in the more radical ideas generally associate

560
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:42,624
With black power

561
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,928
So we get written out of the history

562
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:50,560
Mckissock

563
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:52,864

History because they don't see him as a hero

589
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:57,888
