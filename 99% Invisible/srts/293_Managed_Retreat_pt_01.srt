I'm Roman Mars

25
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:13,472
Off the coast of North Carolina

26
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:17,056
There's a stretch of islands called the Outer Banks

27
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:21,920
Picture a narrow ribbon of sand that runs along the coast for 200 MI

28
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:25,760
These islands are three miles across at their widest

29
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:28,576
Only 200 yards at their narrowest

30
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:33,440
And there's one part of the outer banks that used to be especially treacherous for ships

31
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:35,232
It's called Cape Hatteras

32
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:37,024
That's reporter Gordon Katic

33
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,560
Of a podcast called

34
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,328
Cited

35
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:43,168
The Cape is known for choppy seas and strong ocean currents

36
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:48,032
Since the 16th century these waves have caused a lot of shipwrecks

37
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:51,360
Over a thousand according to the National Park Service

38
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,408
The area has become known as

39
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:59,040
The graveyard of the Atlantic so many sailors were dying. In the late 1700s

40
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:02,624
Congress authorized the construction of a giant lighthouse

41
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,232
It would eliminate the dangerous passage and make the Outer Banks less deadly

42
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:10,816
The lighthouse went up in a small town called Buxton North Carolina

43
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,608
Right near Cape Hatteras

44
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:16,448
And the people of Buxton they love this lighthouse

45
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,776
Generations of families there helps maintain it

46
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:23,360
But you know this what your grandfather did it's what your great-grandfather did

And his family goes back nine Generations in North Carolina

I see some people on top

Observation deck

65
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:23,008
There's a crowd of people waiting outside

66
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,312
Park ranger is standing near the entry

67
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,128
Buddy ask because this is all a national park

68
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:31,968
This is the tallest brick lighthouse in North America that you all are about to

69
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:33,248
How to climb today so

70
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,272
Hope everybody's ready

71
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:40,928
It's hard to overstate just how important this Lighthouse is to the people of Buxton

72
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,744
There are three Lighthouse gift shops in town

73
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,096
Practically every business here has a lighthouse in its logo or its name

74
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:50,400
Like the lighthouse View Motel

75
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:53,984
Or the lighthouse Sports Bar and Grill even the churches

76
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,032
Like the Lighthouse Christian Assembly

77
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,896
But back in the seventies it look like Buxton might lose their beloved lighthouse

78
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:04,736
He was getting closer and closer threatening to swallow it up

79
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:07,040
And people were torn over what to do

80
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,576
The lighthouse

81
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,904
Leave it in place and try to defend it against the forces of nature

82
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:17,280
Next 30 Years the people of Buxton fought in intense political battle over this decision

83
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,607
Is the kind of battle we can expect to see a lot more of

84
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:24,447
As sea levels rise and threatened Coastal communities around the world

85
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:29,823
It all started with a scientist who had a radical idea about what to do with the light

86
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,895
An idea almost nobody like

87
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:36,991
Let it fall in nothing is so important that a can't fall into

88
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,551
Why don't you introduce yourself

89
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:43,135
Oh yeah I'm I'm a horn trophy I'm a retired

90
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,927
Marine geologist

91
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:47,487
Two started out in the deep sea and ended up

92
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,511
On the beaches

93
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:52,095
Orange County is a professor emeritus at Duke University

94
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:55,679
He typically wear short-sleeve button-up shirts with

95
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,727
Two or three pens in the front pocket

96
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,519
And she studies beaches

97
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:02,335
But there aren't any beaches at Duke

98
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:05,407
Because Duke is right in the middle of the state

99
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:08,991
So in the 1980s or would pack his students into a bus

100
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:09,759
Maddie

101
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,575
All the way to the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse

102
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,623
It's usually a pretty exciting place

103
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,415
The average wave height

104
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:21,023
Cape Hatteras is higher than anywhere else on the East Coast except possibly northern Maine

105
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:26,655
Oren would tell his students at the waves at Cape Hatteras don't just calmly roll onto Shore

106
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,935
They slam into

107
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,983
And spray up into the air

108
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:33,311
Paula student stared out into the water or unexplained

109
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:36,895
These waves are washing away the beach we're standing on

110
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,687
And soon they'll reach the lighthouse

111
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:43,551
The shoreline of the Outer Banks the entire Charles and the Outer Banks is

112
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:46,623
Is a routing and partly

113
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:53,279
This is simply a matter of the ways I think of way at the continent 90% of the

114
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,815
Azar roading

115
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:58,911
Some very very slightly and then some very quickly

116
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:01,727
The beach in front of the lighthouse can a road fast

117
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:08,127
The rates vary wildly from decade to decade sometimes the coast loses 50 ft air other times the beach

118
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:11,455
Actually gain sand is an erratic natural process

119
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:17,087
Good morning says climate change is also part of the story it's speeding up the erosion process

120
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:22,463
4 decade a bunch of different government agencies have been fighting back against the seat

121
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:25,279
I tried barriers to slow the waves

122
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,583
Put down a wall of sandbags

123
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,143
Even tried this thing called Beach nourishment

124
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:34,751
That's just a fancy way of saying pumping a ton of sand onto the shore

125
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:36,543
Other

126
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,335
Inventive ideas to

127
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,383
They put in what they call Seascape

128
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,919
It was plastic

129
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:44,735
Strips of plastic that floated

130
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:47,039
Strips were supposed to act like seaweed

131
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:53,439
And keep the sand from washing away and here it was a very cheap way to stop a road

132
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,719
But it didn't even

133
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:55,999
Begin to work

134
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,791
In fact none of that stuff for

135
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:03,423
The Decades of fighting back against the waves the ocean was getting dangerously close to the lighthouse

136
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,983
Less than half of football field weigh

137
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:08,543
Basically we would stand

138
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,591
Besides a lighthouse

139
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,127
And see

140
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,407
How this

141
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,943
Precious historic

142
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:20,063
Structure was due to fall in I mean it was easy to see where

143
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,855
A good storm

144
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,135
Would have

145
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,671
Taking out the lighthouse

146
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:29,791
Is it wouldn't have to be a wind blank or storm but it has gotten to that stage

147
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:33,887
And so 1974 Oren wrote an academic article

148
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,447
He said we tried pretty much everything

149
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,727
Texas lighthouse

150
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,007
Time to give up

151
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,543
Hero quote

152
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,615
It is difficult but necessary to come to grips

153
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:47,199
The ultimate result of living with nature at the shoreline

154
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:51,551
And then he started telling the people of Buxton to let the lighthouse go

155
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:54,111
Which made them really mad

156
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,647
The whole idea of

157
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:58,463
Letting things fall in with was absolutely

158
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,767
Outrageous of course we're going to

159
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,047
Defender

160
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:05,119
Corps of engineer Colonel said

161
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,143
We're not.

162
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,703
Hold up our hands of slink away

163
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:13,567
Most North Carolinians did not want to see the lighthouse fall into the sea

164
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:17,407
In 1981 photographer and conservationist named Hugh Morton

165
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,455
Started a group called save the lighthouse

166
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:23,295
School children across the state raised money to support the group

167
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:27,135
And they recruited prominent North Carolinians like University presidents

168
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,183
Business Leaders and politicians

169
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:32,255
The tour guide from the beginning of the story

170
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:35,839
He became the local representative for Save The Lighthouse

171
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:38,911
In terms of uniting political philosophies and

172
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,471
You know contradictory elements of

173
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,519
Society developers and environmental

174
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,055
Everybody

175
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:47,615
Can rally around the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse

176
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,383
And that was

177
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,407
Essentially yes

178
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,967
What was going on nothing else mattered

179
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,759
It was to do right by

180
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:54,527
The lighthouse

181
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,807
What's in our heritage in disguise

182
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:59,135
Eventually Danny settles on one big idea

183
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,439
Build a solid concrete wall

184
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,231
All the way around the lighthouse

185
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:07,071
I think you can pick and choose your fights with Mother Nature you're not going to win all up

186
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,607
You got to pick a fight

187
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,631
But you can win

188
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:16,031
That was a very common attitude in those days

189
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,567
My idea was to

190
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,103
Live with nature at the shoreline

191
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:21,407
Warrants at the seawall would be

192
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:24,735
Extremely expensive and ultimately counterproductive

193
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,015
Busse walls

194
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:31,391
This is one of the more controversial things that I was saying others to that's a wild destroy Beach

195
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,927
Orrin had Maps

196
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:33,951
Diagrams of

197
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:34,719
East Coast

198
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:38,559
And they showed that seawalls made erosion happen even fast

199
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,887
He argued that that's exactly what would happen at the light

200
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:44,447
A wall would make the beach smaller

201
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,215
And smaller

202
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:47,775
So now you're a Beach Community without a beach

203
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:53,663
With the seawall plan the lighthouse would eventually become a walled Island out in the water

204
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:56,223
Not ideal but even if you were fine with that

205
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,527
The wall probably wouldn't hold

206
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:03,903
Oren said it's hard to imagine building a seawall strong enough for the waves at Cape Hatteras

207
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,719
Lots of big storms at the cape

208
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:13,631
Half the size of the lighthouse the storm server top over the C11 and

209
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,167
Top of a lighthouse

210
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:18,751
Then one day or met an engineer Named Dave fischetti

211
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:19,775
Dave Sadler

212
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,335
People don't want the lighthouse to fall in

213
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,127
We don't want to see wall

214
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,919
But there's a compromise

215
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,455
Nothing can be moved

216
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:29,759
It's around 200 ft tall

217
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:33,599
About one and a quarter million bricks in 4800 tons

218
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,135
But believe it or not

219
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:37,439
Engineers have moved bigger buildings

220
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:40,511
This presented a pretty good opportunity for Warren

221
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:44,095
He could use the lighthouse to test something that planners call

222
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,631
Managed retreat

223
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:46,911
The idea is that

224
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,447
As sea levels rise

225
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:52,287
We won't be able to defend every Coast with a giant wall

226
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:56,127
Instead we're going to have to make plans to abandon certain areas

227
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:58,175
And move some things out of the way

228
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,455
Foreign thot

229
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:02,783
Buxton could be convinced to move this big light house

230
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,087
It might show that managed retreat

231
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:05,855
Is doable

232
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:09,695
So she and Dave fischetti along with one of Orrin students

233
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,719
Steve bush

234
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,743
Form their own

235
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,815
They called themselves the move the lighthouse

236
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:15,583
Committee

237
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,143
We met together alive and reproducing

238
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,679
Blizzard of papers

239
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:24,287
Documenting things about a rosian to think about moving buildings

240
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:27,103
Mainly aimed up at the media

241
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:34,271
Why did you why did you care so much to spend so much of your time

242
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,855
I guess I guess I got emotionally involved off

243
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:42,719
I wasn't going to let that Lighthouse fall in spite of that first article online

244
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,535
So now you got these two groups

245
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:48,095
They both want to preserve the lighthouse

246
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,375
But they're debating how

247
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:52,959
Ultimately it's up to Congress and the National Park Service

248
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,263
Because this is federal property

249
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:59,359
So the two groups are trying to convince the Feds that they have the better plan

250
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:03,199
The town of Buxton flatly rejected orange move ID

251
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:08,575
A local magazine did a poll over 90% of residents wanted to keep the lighthouse in place

252
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:12,159
Many were offended by the very idea of retreat

253
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:15,487
Hugh Morton said retreating from the shoreline would be quote

254
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,303
Cheating man's historic battle against nature

255
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,351
And it would make Buxton the laughing

256
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:21,631
The coast

257
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,911
Danny's group stats

258
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,191
Save the lighthouse

259
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:26,751
They feel confident they can win this fight

260
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,567
I didn't like these Outsiders telling them otherwise

261
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,383
It was a situation of

262
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,175
Yashow again with a local people

263
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:34,943
Kind of

264
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:40,831
Claim ownership of that and how dare somebody with some out-of-state plates come in here and want to tell these

265
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,647
For dwellers on these shifting lonely Sands

266
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,695
What to do with their lighthouse

267
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:50,303
I mean we are we're not afraid to pick a fight we're very independent people

268
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:55,167
Danny told me a story to explain the tension between orange group in the locals

269
00:12:55,423 --> 00:13:01,567
He said there was a Duke grad student who would drive down to give talks in Buxton Danny remembered meeting him

270
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:07,967
And he proceeded to waltz into a gas station that I was running at the time Filling Station automotive repair shop

271
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:12,063
And we're changing out us semi tires for a for a

272
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,111
Tractor trailers and stuff and Eagles

273
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,391
Search wagon

274
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:17,695
Finger

275
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:20,767
Don't you know that this Lighthouse we're going to lose this lighthouse

276
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:23,583
And y'all are obstruction is y'all are you are

277
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,887
Not y'all he didn't use he one day y'all

278
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:28,703
You said you were holding this up you're holding this project up

279
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:32,543
Standing there would like a tire iron in my aunt

280
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:36,895
Boren and his group has serious credibility problem in Buxton

281
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:39,711
And they understood why people like Danny

282
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:40,479
Where it's at

283
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:43,039
Of course ofcourse we were outside and we were from

284
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,599
From Land far away in Durham

285
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,159
Did this ever give you pause

286
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,439
I suppose so

287
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,999
Going into the community and thing

288
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,047
Hey I know the truth

289
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:57,631
And after I felt that there was a

290
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,655
The pit of arrogance

291
00:13:59,167 --> 00:13:59,679
And Napa

292
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,727
What was the choice

293
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,519
I didn't know anything about her

294
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:07,103
How you deal with people I guess in in this sense

295
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,663
Hi understood sometimes

296
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,967
That I was

297
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:16,319
Speaking over their heads are facing things that they that they did not

298
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,855
Understand that did not want under

299
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,903
And there were other reasons

300
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,439
People didn't like orange group

301
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:25,023
Many words a lighthouse was so big and so old

302
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,047
That it would break

303
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,071
If you try to move it

304
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:31,167
I just had strong feelings about the location of the lighthouse

305
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:34,751
They said it would lose historical value in a new spot

306
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:37,311
And then there were also some big money interests

307
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:42,175
Business owners and real estate developers thought a move would hurt their bottom line

308
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:44,223
If you own something with a name like

309
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,271
The lighthouse View Motel

310
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:48,575
People move a lighthouse out of you

311
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:56,767
Throughout the 80s and 90s there were lots of scientific committees commission studies and reports

312
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,607
They all decided that moving the lighthouse was the best idea

313
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,911
But that didn't do much to convince the local

314
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,239
Except for these two local Lighthouse historian

315
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,775
Bruce and Cheryl Roberts

316
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,567
Bruce

317
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,615
Nice to meet you

318
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,407
How you doing

319
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,967
Yeah she'll wasn't around when I met Bruce

320
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,783
She was busy working on a new Lighthouse book

321
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,831
My wife does most of the writing in

322
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,599
I take

323
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,623
Pictures of lighthouses

324
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,439
I'm actually photographed almost every

325
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,719
American lighthouse

326
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:30,815
Recent Cheryl have basically turn their home into a shrine

327
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:31,839
4 lighthouses

328
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:34,143
I got over a hundred Lighthouse books

329
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,215
There's a bunch of miniature lighthouses scattered about

330
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:40,287
I see countless Lighthouse paintings and pictures

331
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,335
And in their study there's a giant

332
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,615
3 panel room divider

333
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,919
It looks like one of those Japanese screens

334
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:49,503
Only it's got the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse painted on it

335
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,575
There is something about a lighthouse iPhone

336
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,599
Especially

337
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,999
Back at the time of the controversy

338
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:03,583
Bruce and Cheryl were writing a book about the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse

339
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,887
That's when they started to do some research

340
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,423
We had read the reports

341
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,495
The White House would be lost in

342
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:13,823
We talked to some of the other scientists who have studied

343
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:17,151
And made an interesting discovery

344
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:21,503
The scientist told them that the lighthouse it's on yellow pine Timbers

345
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:24,575
They're submerged in a pool of freshwater

346
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,111
It's a strange design

347
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:30,463
The Builder who constructed the lighthouse knew that if he kept those beans in freshwater

348
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,999
They be preserved

349
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,535
And his plan had work

350
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,071
For over a hundred years

351
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,351
Here's the problem

352
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:40,191
The ocean was coming closer and closer to the lighthouse

353
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:44,287
The ocean is filled with microorganisms that could degrade the wood

354
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:47,359
If the salt water seeped into the foundation

355
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,639
The beams wood rot

356
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,943
And that was the reason that

357
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:51,967
Channel 9

358
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,527
Realized that

359
00:16:54,783 --> 00:17:00,671
If nothing else happened Lighthouse will begin to tip is that what Foundation was eating away we actually

360
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:04,255
Went and talked to several of a scientist who it's on the study

361
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,791
Saying it had to be moved

362
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,399
And we got convinced that they knew what they were doing

363
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,423
This was a

364
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,191
Huge gap

365
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,727
14 move the lighthouse

366
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:17,055
Bruce and Cheryl weren't technocratic Outsiders

367
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,335
They were like us finale

368
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,871
I never seen you look

369
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,895
Like it or not

370
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:23,199
Scientists are actually right

371
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:27,551
Then in 1996 two major hurricanes hit North Carolina

372
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:28,831
Hurricane Bertha

373
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:35,231
Hurricane Fran North Carolina and Ocracoke Island and Hatteras Island or under an evacuation map

374
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:40,863
Mandate

375
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:45,727
Hurricanes are becoming more frequent and more intense

376
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:48,031
And this created a new sense of urgency

377
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:52,127
So 1997 Congress started planning a potential move

378
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:55,199
17 years after save the lighthouse formed

379
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,223
And after almost

380
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,759
Two decades of debate

381
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:00,575
A public meeting was held to discuss the move

382
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:04,415
It was organized by a US senator from North Carolina

383
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:06,719
As well as a state senator from the region

384
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,535
It was April 1998

385
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,351
About 400 people filed into an aquarium

386
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:14,399
The largest building in the Outer Banks

387
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:16,703
Children are busting from every school

388
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:19,775
There were 11 news crews their reporting on the event

389
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:23,871
The people of Buxton new the fate of the lighthouse might be decided here

390
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:29,247
Today they had their move it or lose it signs and then the others are like save not move

391
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:32,319
Guy came up to me grabbed me by the arm said here's your sticker

392
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:36,415
And I looked at it and said move it or lose it all out on that damn sticker

393
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:41,279
Politicians and their aides watched as people got up to testify for each sign

394
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:43,583
Every time somebody said something

395
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:49,983
That was beneficial to their side they would a corrupted cheers like you were some of the Roman Colosseum

396
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,263
And what about your gladiators

397
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,823
And Bruce who was there along with Danny

398
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:56,639
But the crowd was clearly against the lighthouse movie

399
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,735
I think I felt

400
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,087
We were going to lose

401
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,927
Bruce went back home feeling defeated

402
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:12,511
He was convinced Congress was not going to fund the movie

403
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:14,815
I think the back

404
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,911
That your tube I heard the phone ring back in the office and Cheryl

405
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,983
We're back in

406
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:28,383
North Carolina state senator Marc basnight was on the other end of the phone

407
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:29,407
He said

408
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:34,527
Before the meeting I supported moving the lighthouse but then I saw just how unpopular that was

409
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,575
And now I don't think I can do it

410
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,343
And

411
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,879
I said wait a minute

412
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:39,903
Here's Cheryl

413
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,951
Do you know about that

414
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,255
Foundation

415
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,791
And the danger

416
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,583
Collapsing

417
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,119
He said no

418
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,679
Bicycle Denmark

419
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,239
You should not be making a decision

420
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,263
In this matter

421
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,567
You need to listen more to the facts

422
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,359
Cheryl told the senator about the

423
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,151
Pine boards in the saltwater

424
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:04,991
She told him if we don't move it the lighthouse might just fall over

425
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,271
And he did he say

426
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,319
What's a tariff

427
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,367
Hour hour and a half

428
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,695
And she want them over

429
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,463
He had to know

430
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:15,999
Scientific

431
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:22,399
This was the critical moment Cheryl got the senator back on board and he urged

432
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,935
Congress to act fast

433
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:26,495
A few months later Congress funded the Moon

434
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:29,567
In a last-ditch effort the local County sued

435
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:35,967
But they lost it was a stinging reminder that even though it may have felt like buxton's lighthouse

436
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:36,735
It wasn't

437
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:43,135
Skip Along to the federal government

438
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:50,815
Began on June 17th 1999 journalist swarmed

439
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:51,583
Boxden

440
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:54,143
Because nothing like this has ever happened before

441
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:59,519
No one had picked up a 4800 ton Lighthouse and moved it over half a mile

442
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:00,799
People called it

443
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,591
The move of the millennium

444
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:08,991
Make sure they know we're Romo tape from the truck when you're hearing tape from a documentary made by a local TV station

445
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:15,391
Already there have been 1,800 visitors to the park this morning that's about double what they usually seek

446
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,928
Coming here this time of year

447
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:20,256
The Park Service put in Orange fence near the base of the lighthouse

448
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,304
Antorus lined up along it

449
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:26,400
Local sold them t-shirts and hotdogs at everyone waited and

450
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:29,472
Brian what do you think about the lighthouse what do you think about it

451
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,592
Big

452
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:36,128
It sure is big

453
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,408
How we going to move that

454
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,432
Can I pick it up

455
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,480
I'm sorry but

456
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,040
It is heavy

457
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,344
The process was pretty simple

458
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,904
First the engineer's cut through the granite base

459
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,672
Satellite house

460
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:55,072
Banana Splits 7 giant steel beams underneath it the beans created a New Foundation

461
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:58,400
A grid under the lighthouse

462
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:04,800
The pressure at 44 under the steel grid and using hydraulics

463
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:09,152
Who sing up onto a track leading to the lighthouses near home

464
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:20,416
Ajax the engineer's for all ready to roll

465
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:22,464
They pulled a giant lever

466
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:29,120
I know Lighthouse started 2-inch former if you were there that day in the crown

467
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:33,216
This all would have looked inside come after because the lighthouse moved

468
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:34,240
So

469
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:40,896
Can you see if you couldn't even tell

470
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:43,456
The Rangers had to put markers along the track

471
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:46,016
Just so you could be sure that it did in fact

472
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:51,392
It's just going real

473
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,184
And you're lucky to be

474
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:55,232
The end of the first day

475
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:57,536
The lighthouse it only move 10 feet

476
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:00,864
This whole process would take weeks

477
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:05,472
My word is still going out

478
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:06,496
Slowly

479
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:10,592
Bruce remember showing up one day near the end of the move

480
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:13,408
Decide Danny coming towards him through the crowd

481
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:14,944
Danny told him

482
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,480
They're moving it too fast

483
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,272
I'm limestone.

484
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:19,808
What

485
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:23,136
What's wrong with Lily get too fast

486
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,184
Is his look

487
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,976
Every restaurant is

488
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,256
Making money

489
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,792
Kerry Hotel smoking

490
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:30,560
Money

491
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:33,376
We have never had friends like this ever before

492
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:38,240
If you can just slow it down till September

493
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,032
We'll all be rich

494
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:43,104
Slow Down slow down slow down

495
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:45,920
Orange

496
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,584
At the lighthouse in to its new home

497
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:09,472
It was again 1600 feet from Shore the exact same distance it was in 1870

498
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,752
For the sea

499
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:12,032
Wash the beach away

500
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:18,432
Before the move the people of Buxton felt something terrible and undemocratic was happening to them

501
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:22,528
These out-of-towners were destroying the heart and soul of their Island

502
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,320
The community fought hard

503
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,344
And they lost

504
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:27,392
But in a strange way

505
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:29,184
Things actually worked out for them

506
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:32,256
I look back at this you know after this is all said and done

507
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:35,072
Was moving that Lighthouse the right thing to do

508
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,352
Yes it was

509
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:38,912
Daddy got a ton of Business from The Tourist

510
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:42,496
Is repair shop in gas station had never done so well

511
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:44,800
So he's had a complete change of heart

512
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,080
And he's not alone

513
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:50,944
In fact most people think that the move was the best thing that ever happened to Bucks

514
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:54,528
Something as Monumental as moving America's lighthouse

515
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:58,112
Put us on a national radar on an international radar

516
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:00,928
And people started thinking about the Outer Banks

517
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:02,208
It was a raging

518
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,232
Success

519
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:08,864
Danny doesn't look back now and see the movie as a cowardly retreat

520
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:11,680
He sees it as a testament to human ingenuity

521
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,472
Is all makes orange

522
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:14,240
Hopeful

523
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:16,032
Is if Danny can change his views

524
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,824
Maybe others will too

525
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,384
They'll I think the moving the lighthouse was a

526
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,408
The profound event

527
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:24,736
In terms of our response to sea level rise

528
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:27,296
I think the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse

529
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,112
Is kind of a good example

530
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:32,416
We're going to be doing a lot in the future

531
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:35,232
If you can move a 3000 or whatever it is

532
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,512
Tongue

533
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:39,072
Lighthouse you can move a lot of colleges

534
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:41,888
But it's not just lighthouses in Beach cottages

535
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:45,472
There are thousands of miles of vulnerable US coastline

536
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:50,592
The Battle of Buxton is just a preview of the tough choices will have to make

537
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:54,688
We have three thousand miles of Barrier Island show and so whatever happens

538
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:55,456
Cher

539
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:57,504
Is also happening in Galveston

540
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,832
And also is happening and Myrtle Beach and then

541
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,624
Jekyll Island Georgia

542
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,160
And they're all going to be

543
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:11,072
Asking for money from the FED that we need money we need money we need to nurse the beach or we need to we need help.

544
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,144
It ain't going to be there

545
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,192
That's why Retreat is important

546
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,824
But the year 2100 at least 500 us communities will be at risk from sea-level Rise

547
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:23,616
Including major cities

548
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:25,408
It's like Miami and New Orleans

549
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,968
That's according to the union of concerned scientists

550
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:31,552
And then there's the millions of people in other parts of the world

551
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,600
In countries like Bangladesh

552
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:34,624
Guilin

553
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:37,184
Better already being badly affected

554
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,232
People get this worked up

555
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,256
About a lighthouse

556
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:44,864
Imagine how hard it will be when we start talking about moving entire cities

557
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,216
How can you do that fairly and in a way that doesn't devastate communities

558
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:52,800
We're going to be fighting this battle over and over again

559
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:58,432
And after all of this the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse will probably have to move again

560
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:01,504
It might last 100 years at its current location

561
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,296
But some scientists say

562
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:05,088
Maybe even less than that

563
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,640
We've another high-stakes story of a building being rude but this time

564
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,944
All the people were in it when it

565
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:32,224
But after that

566
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:49,120
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices were immersed

567
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,680
The cluttered World a man-made sound

568
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:57,312
If I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexa

569
00:27:57,568 --> 00:28:02,688
Is talking to me and my wife is in another room and another hearing.

570
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:04,992
Voice technology talk to us

571
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:07,296
It is a creation of Sonic trash

572
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:10,112
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

573
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:13,696
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

574
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:15,744
To make them more human

575
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,840
Turn the living room lights on

576
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:21,376
Okay

577
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:23,168
Dim the living room lights

578
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:23,936
50%

579
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:25,984
Okay

580
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:32,384
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

581
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,200
Makes for a much more natural experience

582
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:37,248
Turn the living room lights on

583
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,832
Dim the living room lights to 50

584
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:41,600
80%

585
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:48,768
We're presenting to special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

586
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:51,840
About how are soundscape is impacting our health

587
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:54,144
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

588
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:57,216
Look for them Fridays May 17th and May 24th

589
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:57,984
Right here

590
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,264
NPR

591
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,616
We need to talk about something

592
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:06,176
Constipation abdominal pain and bloating

593
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:12,576
You tell yourself it's not that bad you take laxatives you modify your diet and exercise routine but thinking about it all the time is free

594
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:18,208
Frustrating but doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again

595
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:19,488
And you don't know why

596
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:21,792
Then it may be time to seek help

597
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:24,864
Go to oh my God. Info / podcast

Dot and Bo

601
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:32,544
Back pocket

602
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:37,408
Sometimes moving a building is about preserving historic architecture or

603
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,432
Cultural heritage

604
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:40,480
But a 99 Pi fan named

605
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:44,064
Tomorrow solorzano notice about unusually high stakes moved

606
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,344
What happened in her hometown

607
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:46,880
Guadalajara Mexico

608
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:48,416
And cripples to this

609
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:49,440
To talk about it

610
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:53,792
So back in the 1950s City officials in Guadalajara decided

611
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,072
Why didn't major app

612
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,608
More traffic

613
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:59,168
And a lot of buildings were just demolished

614
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:01,216
There is a problem

615
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:04,800
There's this one 1700 ton brick structure occupied

616
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:07,104
By the Mexican Telephone and Telegraph

617
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,432
Mismo Kalahari lantigua

618
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,968
Compania telefonica

619
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:13,248
Eataly grafica

620
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:14,528
So

621
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,064
Why not demolish

622
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,856
This building along with the rest of it

623
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:21,184
Will it would have been more expensive

624
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:26,560
But it also would have knocked out Regional telephone service for at least a week

625
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:28,864
And that's where Jorge

626
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:30,912
He's a civil engineer

627
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:36,032
The dean of the city's University and he has this idea to move the building while leaving everything wired up

628
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:37,824
And keeping the operators at work

629
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,592
Inside it

630
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:47,040
I've been pretty nervous

631
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:49,344
Reassure The Operators and make them feel safe

632
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,648
So his wife Esmeralda

633
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:55,232
Agreed also go into the building while it was being moved

634
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:58,816
And she even took along their seven-year-old son one Jorge

635
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:01,120
Assassin's path on butt

636
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:01,888
Here's this

637
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:05,216
Webley clip of his widow talking about the move on television

638
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,520

639

641
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:15,968

El Menor

643
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:20,064
So she says

644
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,088
She and her son

645
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:23,392
1 Jorge went inside the building to gain their trust

646
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,696
And they didn't even feel the tiniest movement

647
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:27,488
When they moved the whole building and all the Opera

648
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,024
That's so cool

649
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:29,792
Yeah

650
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:31,584
Basically

651
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:33,376
It all went really well

652
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:35,680
The building was slowly shipped about 40 ft

653
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:36,704
Switch new location

654
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:37,728
And

655
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:40,288
The other people inside didn't feel a thing they kept working

656
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:42,336
And the whole boob has done just five days

657
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:47,968
No Interruption to phone service very critical and Lead it on a budget around $100,000

658
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:49,248
Which was a fraction

659
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:51,808
Of what it would have cost to demolish the structure and then build

660
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:55,136
Into this was about

661
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:58,464
About 70 years of the building

662
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:01,280
Is it still there is it along this new widen Road

663
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,048
It is

664
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:03,328
San Matias Ramos

665
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:05,376
Has a pretty unique Memorial

666
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,912
Statue right outside the building

667
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:08,960
If this life-size figure of him

668
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:15,360
And actually positioned it so it looks like he's physically pushing the structure by hand so cool

669
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:20,992
Yeah and next to that sculpture of course there's a plaque dedicated to his civil service and Engineering Junior

670
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:25,856
Yeah it really is a special thanks it tomorrow for a city

671
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,136
Really need story

672
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:29,952

724

00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:15,840
I'm one of the main guy to know how to do that

729
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:23,520
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

730
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:26,848
Was found dead in my private gym

731
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:30,176
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

732
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:34,528
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

733
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:35,552
Now

734
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:37,600
I need to clear my name

735
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:41,952
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do what

736
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:44,000
Whatever it takes to find them

737
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:52,192
