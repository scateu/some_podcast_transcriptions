I'm Roman Mars

27
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:31,136
Welcome to the

28
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:33,696
Interaction design

29
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:37,536
Our producer Sam Greenspan has seen the color of the future

30
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:38,560
I have seen it

31
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:39,840
You have seen

32
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,632
We all know

33
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:42,912
The color of the future

34
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:43,936
Is blue

35
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:46,240
Lesson 1

36
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,008
Are mostly

37
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,312
Science fiction becomes science fact

38
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:53,152
The team colors have already been chosen pretty much science fiction is

39
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:55,712
Denim blue

40
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,576
Inhuman

41
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:01,600
Future looking

42
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,624
Kind of mystical

43
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,648
That's Chris nozzle

44
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,184
Sci-fi aficionado

45
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,488
There's not a lot of blue in nature

46
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,048
Right there's not a lot of blue food

47
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,840
So I think there is something

48
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:12,864
Fundamentally

49
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:19,008
Inhuman about that color or unnatural that really fits the Technologies

50
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,032
Of the future world

51
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:21,824
As contract

52
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,592
Yeah

53
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,128
The other guy is Nathan shedroff

54
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,408
Also into sci-fi

55
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:30,784
And like many sci-fi guys there love the art form that takes on an obsessive quality

56
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:31,808
And here's the thing

57
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:34,112
Chris are also designers

58
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,160
Chris is with a firm called Cooper

59
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,440
And Nathan is on fact

60
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,232
California College of the Arts

61
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:45,120
Sci-fi Obsession Matt design of session in the resulting glorious nerdfest

62
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:48,448
Was a book where the author of the book make it so

63
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:50,752
Interaction design lessons from science

64
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:57,664
Make it so is a comprehensive compendium of real-world lessons that designers can and should end do take

65
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,432
From science

66
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,272
So to give you an idea of how exhausted their line of inquiry

67
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:05,344
That lesson about future screens being mostly blue

68
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,136
Lesson 1 future screen

69
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,720
Bethany Kris actually figured this out in

70
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:11,488
Accurately

71
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,512
They build the database

72
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,048
More than 10000 image

73
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,072
Sci-fi movie

74
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:21,984
Out

75
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,752
The keys

76
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,032
Streams of interfaces

77
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,592
I'm stuck into Photoshop for a given year

78
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,128
Shrunken down to a single Pixel

79
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:34,528
Ion pump saturation

80
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:39,136
They can determine the average color of all interfaces

81
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,440
From every sci-fi movie that

82
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,976
Came out in a given year

83
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:46,048
And when you lay those average colors next to each other

84
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:48,864
You can see 1968 to 2011

85
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,400
Pretty much science fiction

86
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:57,056
There are some exceptions

87
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,336
Very red Terminator 2

88
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,616
But for the most part

89
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,408
You just blur your eyes and glanced at it

90
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:02,944
Always blue

91
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,768
Queens of the future may or may not actually

92
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,887
But syfy's about letting our imaginations run wild and great imagine world

93
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:27,007
And someone has to design the experience of characters moving through that imagined world

94
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:30,335
And even if your sci-fi world is a thousand years in the future

95
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:33,151
Those choices are in constant dialogue

96
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,175
With the present

97
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,967
When Chris and Nathan started this project

98
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:37,759
It went back to the very first sight

99
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,063
Levi Austin Ally

100
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,343
A trip to the moon

101
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,367
By George menu

102
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,159
Is that you in the first film

103
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:44,927
.

104
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,207
1902

105
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:50,303
And the thing that I noticed when I saw that movie was wait a minute

106
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,839
With where the hell are the interface

107
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,375
Because there aren't any

108
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,423
In this future as seen from 1902

109
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,959
You sent people to the Moon

110
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,751
Putting them inside a giant canister

111
00:04:59,007 --> 00:04:59,519
Latinx

112
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,823
Canister into an enormous Cannon

113
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,407
How do you get to the moon

114
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,967
The audience and even the filmmaker still had an

115
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,759
Industrial Age paradigm

116
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:13,087
In their lives they only ever encountered lovers

117
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:13,855
Buttons

118
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:14,623
Maybe

119
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,695
Technology in electricity we're kind of a strange and off-putting things

120
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:21,791
To audience did not require any type of UI for a lunar space

121
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,583
Which tells you something

122
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,375
About living in 1902

123
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:28,959
Chris Nathan say sci-fi doesn't just reflect reality

124
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,751
Reality sometimes reflects

125
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:31,519
Syfy

126
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:35,359
Components of Science Fiction saturate the public imagination

127
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,383
It can affect

128
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,663
How we design things

129
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:38,687
Casein

130
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,991
What a Motorola first cell phone

131
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,015
The Microtel

132
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:46,367
It was not a particularly successful phone now the microtac was a flip phone

133
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,135
The open

134
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,951
Downward you have the device in your hand in the mouthpiece

135
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,743
Flipped down so you can talk into

136
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:52,767
And the microtac

137
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:53,535
Wasn't selling

138
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:56,095
So the Motorola engineers in Illinois

139
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,399
Took it down the road to the Argonne National Lab

140
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:01,727
And the Argan Engineers immediately said oh you made it wrong

141
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,287
Islamorada folk survival

142
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:07,871
What do you mean no one's no one's ever made one of these how do you know it's wrong

143
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,407
You know like on Star Trek

144
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,455
And they said it has to open up like this

145
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,991
The Argonne Engineers just

146
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,527
Expected the phone to open up work

147
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,319
My Captain Kirk's communicator

148
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,111
Downwards just felt weird

149
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,647
And they went back in

150
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:23,743
And made it open the right way and then and then the next

151
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:24,511
Generation

152
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,815
Phone went gangbusters

153
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,351
It was called

154
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,119
The startac

155
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:33,471
Motorola accidentally happened into a system where

156
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:38,847
Their customers had been trained for 30 years of reruns on the right way to do mobile communication

157
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,151
Is actually a whole host of design lesson

158
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:44,991
Lesson to establish a comprehensive

159
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:45,759
Visual Center

160
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,575
Star Trek the Next Generation Excel

161
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:51,135
Creating a holistic visual syntax

162
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,951
It was probably thanks to extreme budget

163
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:57,535
They didn't have the production budget just require tons of

164
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:02,911
Surfaces with dummy buttons and have them lit individually so that they could control them

165
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:05,727
And as a cost-saving move they should have

166
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:08,799
Develop this idea of what we can just print out film

167
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:15,455
And backlight it under surfaces and that can serve as visceral wow factor of man is a lot of control

168
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,735
For this it must be a Starship

169
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:17,503
Working

170
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,903
If you've seen one episode you know what

171
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,719
A flat screen with a black backdrop

172
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,767
And a bunch of brightly colored buttons

173
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,791
Underneath a glass

174
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,095
They're everywhere on the ship

175
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:32,863
The bridge

176
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,631
The Sick Bay

177
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,399
Engineering

178
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,167
Turn on the tablet

179
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:38,239
Computers essentially all of the controls show up that way

180
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,775
They all have this uniformity.

181
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,799
Did not only looks

182
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:44,127
It also tells you from a very quick glance that it's related to

183
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,431
But even give the interfacing name

184
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,711
Elkhart

185
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,759
Steven Library

186
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,527
Computer data

187
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:54,111
Provide full access

188
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,951
The operator

189
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,767
I do have the definition

190
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:01,535
For those curious

191
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,351
It stands for library computer access

192
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,143
Slash retrieval system

193
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:11,519
The archetype of the image under glass Paradigm that governs our virtual live

194
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,287
And people

195
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,591
Really latched onto it to this day

196
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:18,687
There are still people modding their computers and tablet devices to make them look like

197
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:21,503
Anel cars device from the 24th century

198
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:22,527
By way of

199
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,831
Late 1980s and early 90s

200
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,623
But here is a really brilliant

201
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,183
Every single species

202
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,975
Has their own equivalent of Alcott

203
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,767
What's the Klingon racetrack

204
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,303
It's already trying

205
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:37,119
The bajorans have the sort of bluish purple oval thing

206
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,935
And the Borg have an array of green circle

207
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,471
Green lighting everywhere

208
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:45,055
If it's amniotic lesson for storytelling right green equals

209
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,079
Borg

210
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:48,895
And wherever green creeps you know the Beauregard

211
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:52,223
Assertive essentially a visual Macro for an entire class

212
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:56,063
The story is fix their own brand and the really good brand manager

213
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:57,855
The Chris and Nathan are

214
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:58,623
Quick to point out

215
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:01,183
Did not everything we see in sci-fi is Nessa

216
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,207
Really good

217
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,231
Feasible

218
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,815
The minute we started our interview they could not wait to go off

219
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:09,119
How much of a waste of time they think

220
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,143
Gestural inter

221
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,447
Think minority

222
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:16,543
You're when you move your arms in space that's called cardio

223
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,127
Aerobic exercise and it's tiring

224
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,151
Lesson 3

225
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,431
Avoid gestational age

226
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:25,503
Supposedly Tom Cruise had to keep taking breaks

227
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,527
Set because

228
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,551
Tire demount

229
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,599
That future flow

230
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,623
Exhausting

231
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,951
Even if conducting your computer like an orchestra turned out to be

232
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,231
A dead end

233
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,511
That bad in her face

234
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,047
Of that imagined future

235
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:43,935
Actual user interfaces of the present and that's how we can get into apologetic

236
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,215
Lesson 4

237
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:47,007
Employ apologetics

238
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,031
Wherever Papa

239
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:53,407
Apologetics is a term borrowed from religion primarily is the practice of coming up with

240
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:58,527
Rational explanations to reconcile the apparent contradictions inside of a face

241
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:02,367
Basically making sense of the plot hole that surface when

242
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,159
Various religious stories

243
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,439
Are stacked on top of

244
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,231
Each other this can become applicable

245
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:10,047
If you just assume for the sake of arguing

246
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,863
Everything in sci-fi is there for a reason

247
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,167
You can find some really interesting less

248
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,191
Design

249
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,727
So let's consider Star Wars

250
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:21,823
Name of that part when Luke and Han Solo or in the Millennium Falcon blowing up

251
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,183
If you really in space watching this ship

252
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:37,951
Glow up

253
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,231
Wouldn't hear anything

254
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:45,887
I mean really takes that that moment where you have to describe it you realise wait a minute they are fighting in the vacuum of space

255
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,703
Where exactly is the sound propagated

256
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,287
Because sound is how our brain interprets the vibration of air molecules

257
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,823
Of which there aren't any

258
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:54,591
In space

259
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,639
So why do we hear these ships

260
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,663
Exploding in the film

261
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,991
The easy answer would be oh that's just Lucas

262
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,783
Trying to make something that feels right

263
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,063
People who were used to

264
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,855
World War II films

265
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:07,647
But in fact

266
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,463
If you imagine that scene without the audio

267
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,511
It's a lot more miserable of attack

268
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,815
To Nowhere In

269
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:17,119
3D space of these Tie fighters around me

270
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,655
How would I find them

271
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:23,263
Sure you could give me a screen but that requires me that I take my eyes off of the action

272
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,287
You can give me a heads up to

273
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,079
Display which might work but

274
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,359
Audio is

275
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:31,711
360° much more than my what is 120 degrees of vision

276
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:34,527
So that if that audio wasn't there

277
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,319
Then you would expect somebody to put

278
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:39,391
Sensors on the outside of the Millennium Falcon and provide

279
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,951
3D sound inside the gun ownership that would

280
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,487
Put that audio there

281
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,023
So the so the sound is an interface

282
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,047
The sound is

283
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,327
But the main part of interphase

284
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,863
Right at yes

285
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:52,447
Luke can look at this TIE fighter but he's also aware that

286
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:55,007
Coming over his right shoulder is another one

287
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:58,591
But as soon as he this one explode he's got to turn his gun into

288
00:11:59,359 --> 00:11:59,871
That's

289
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,175
That's vital to that interface of working

290
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,711
Are you going to get there by

291
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,503
Trying to reconceive

292
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,039
Why does that thing

293
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,063
Seems broken

294
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,087
Would really work

295
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,647
Okay so here's another one 2001 A Space Odyssey

296
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,927
Directed by Stanley Cup

297
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:18,559
2001 Dr Floyd is on a satellite and making a video call to his daughter back on Earth

298
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,839
Bad

299
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:20,863
Hello

300
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:22,911
Are you a square

301
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:24,703
What you doing

302
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:28,799
Where is Bombay

303
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,103
Country shopping

304
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,383
And then you see his daughter

305
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,663
Start button mashing

306
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,943
Controls on the video

307
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,759
But strangely you don't hear any of the button

308
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,039
Now you can sing

309
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:41,343
Hey that's wrong what was the sound designers

310
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,367
Sleeping on the job

311
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,415
But with our apologetics hat on

312
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,439
But in fact

313
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,719
That's the way it is

314
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,487
Thoughts to work

315
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,767
If you had a

316
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,839
System that was context aware and that would include awareness of

317
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:52,607
The identity of a

318
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,375
What's user

319
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:56,447
It would say I've looked at this conversation

320
00:12:56,703 --> 00:13:01,567
No one has asked at this little girl to push a button she's a little girl of about 5 or 6 years old

321
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,359
And it's indiscriminate mashing

322
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,919
I can safely disregard this is input

323
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,943
It's not a crisis

324
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:07,967
It's not a select

325
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:12,831
So if you were designing a system that was truly context-aware that's exactly the way you would

326
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,111
And anyone with a

327
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,415
We had to have a telephone call with a kid would know this

328
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,951
Is actually the way it should be built

329
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,487
Into the inputs to the interface

330
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,279
Or just not getting relay

331
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,047
The interface

332
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,071
Is actively

333
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,351
Russian five

334
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,911
Interfaces should not just interpret

335
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,447
But but also report

336
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,215
That's

337
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:32,287
Only broken if you presume that the

338
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:35,103
Interface is a dumb capturing device

339
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,127
Television

340
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:39,455
If instead you re conceive of it as sort of a real time

341
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,223
Scanner

342
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,759
Interpreter and

343
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:42,527
Presenter

344
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:46,111
You got an opportunity there to actually interpret the information

345
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,135
Let's do one more

346
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,183
This one's kind of tricky but stick with it

347
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,463
Lesson 6

348
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,255
Find the human factor

349
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,791
And technological shorts

350
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,607
For this lesson we go to a movie called Logan's

351
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,399
Where there's this interface

352
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,423
It's called the circle

353
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:02,495
Which people of this post-apocalyptic World used

354
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,263
Define

355
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,359
Ex-partner skits Craigslist it's

356
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,919
Even weirder than crack it is so hot

357
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,199
Energy audit sayings

358
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,527
So Logan is hanging out

359
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,807
Department of the future

360
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,855
Insurance on this thing called the circuit

361
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:20,415
Which basically lets him tune in different

362
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,439
People who are

363
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,487
Ostensibly available for

364
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:28,095
Couple anyway the thing about the circuit is that it's a really clumsy piece of

365
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:28,863
Technology

366
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,143
We can see that takes

367
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,447
Kind of a long time to turn someone in

368
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,727
Events at the Logan

369
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:36,031
Decide quick yes or no as to whether he wants

370
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,055
Pull that person

371
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,335
Into his apartment

372
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,871
Or send them back out

373
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,919
Either as an interface

374
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:42,943
It's

375
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,223
Unbelievably bad

376
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,015
For lots of rain

377
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:48,831
Like the male gaze problem alone in this case

378
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,879
Morally reprobate

379
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,647
Isabel

380
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,439
But if you can get past that for second

381
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:56,511
I just noticed that the circuit only lets you tune in one person that

382
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,815
Do you have to give a quick yes no answer

383
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,863
As to whether you want that person

384
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,143
Coming into your apartment

385
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,959
If he's going along and he sort of suzhou

386
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:11,359
Number one's not good number two is not good number three is not good number for okay maybe it was a two or one that was better

387
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,383
Maybe I can go back but

388
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,175
You don't see a mechanism to go back

389
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,455
And to make things worse

390
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:18,271
There seems to be no ability to adjust the settings of

391
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,039
What

392
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,575
Who you might want

393
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:25,695
Like the first person that Logan Tunes in is a guy and you can see right away that our hero

394
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,999
Triple him or any other dude

395
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:28,767
Hinduism

396
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,559
Pardon my

397
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:36,959
Gender or sexuality binary here but one of the most fundamental things you would name is what's the gender of

398
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:37,727
My

399
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,751
Possible partners

400
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:42,335
And that he didn't have a single preference setting on this interface

401
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,615
So it just seems horrible

402
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:44,639
But

403
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,663
There is evidence

404
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,711
If this design has some Merit

405
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:50,015
If you can think of an apologetic for it

406
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:52,319
I used to play this game with

407
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,087
Friends of mine

408
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,879
I called the 11th Man game

409
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,671
An 11th Man game

410
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:59,231
Or XI woman game depending on how you're playing with

411
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,535
I works as follows when

412
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:06,399
You're sitting in a public place you pick a doorway and you challenge that friend who say Okay want you

413
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,167
2Pac

414
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:07,935
One of the neck

415
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:10,751
10 people to walk through that doorway to

416
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:11,775
Date work

417
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:14,079
If you have that sort of friendship have sex with

418
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:16,127
And or you will be forced

419
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,919
To do that same thing with XI

420
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,479
Okay so you're with me is he person

421
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,503
Yes or no you say

422
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,271
I know you can

423
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,551
Yes or no

424
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,319
I know you

425
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:27,903
Three you can't go back and pick a previous person no going back

426
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:30,975
And if you say no all the way up through the 10th person

427
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:32,767
You have to take the 11th

428
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,839
So according to Chris when you start off playing again

429
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,119
Can you begin to play this

430
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,655
People are looking at negatives

431
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,191
Oh well let's

432
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:43,263
Pretending playing with a heterosexual man he be like I don't know she's

433
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:49,663
Shih Tzu short or I don't like her hair color whatever I'm eventually would get to 11 and I didn't expect that I deal with a gram

434
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,711
And then he

435
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:52,479
Freak out

436
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,015
But after playing for a while

437
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,807
There's the shift in strategy

438
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,111
I'm looking for reasons to reject someone

439
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,391
Looking for reasons to

440
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,159
To accept

441
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:02,719
Over time the strategy shifts from that

442
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:05,279
Negative view Twitter positive language

443
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,815
What is wrong with this

444
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,095
But what is right

445
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,399
And then being satisfied with

446
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,167
Choice

447
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:13,727
I'm in over time people begin to

448
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:14,751
Adopt that

449
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,775
Positive

450
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,311
Search mode

451
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,847
If the designer of the circuit

452
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:19,615
Computer

453
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:22,687
Wants Logan to find a mate that he's going to be happy about

454
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,735
And the limits of the technology

455
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:28,831
Are such that Logan can we specify yes or no and can't go back to

456
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:33,183
The previous choice

457
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,743
More likely to find an acceptable Choice sooner

458
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:36,511
Because

459
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,559
He's immediately Prime to look

460
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:40,095
For the positive attributes

461
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,655
In the candidates that follow

462
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:45,727
I'm at Super subtle in fact I think when I first started talking about this

463
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,263
I kept talking about how bad it was

464
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:51,615
Ottoman stumbled across this goodness which is as good a way to get to apologetics is any

465
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:54,175
I love this game of design apologetic

466
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:57,503
Because greater knowledge and awareness usually leads us down a path

467
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,295
Of miserable nitpicking

468
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:03,391
And I'm over good criticism but if you can apply a design solution

469
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,183
Two account for a bad design

470
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:05,951
Decision

471
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:06,975
In a Sci-Fi movie

472
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,023
It uses the same

473
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,559
Critical muscle

474
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:13,631
But in a different way and the Apologetics

475
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,655
Are endless

476
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:18,751
Like for example let's take lesson number three about bad gestural interface

477
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,055
Maybe in The Minority Report world

478
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,079
People work

479
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,359
Wheelie sedentary

480
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:25,919
And these types of interfaces where the way to get people

481
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:28,735
Get some freaking exercise

482
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:31,551
Gestural interfaces might be okay

483
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,087
And it leads us to our final

484
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,623
Lesson 7

485
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,671
Find your own design

486
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,207
In science

487
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:40,255
Who's talking sci-fi apologetics

488
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,023
Chris and Nathan

489
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:43,327
I can't help it look for them everywhere now

490
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:44,863
I even found one.

491
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:48,447
We had gone off on some tangent about the Star Wars

492
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,775
Queen Amidala has an interface for which we cannot

493
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:56,639
Apologized which is ironic because I believe I deserve an apology for every aspect

494
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,919
Of the Star Wars prequel

495
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:00,479
On her giant silvery spaceship

496
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:04,319
I'm and I'm sure it has a name somewhere in the Star Wars Canon but I can't remember

497
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,879
A shirt that serve big panel of controls

498
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:10,719
But when you review it the three times that she uses

499
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:12,511
Uses an interface aboard the ship

500
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:15,839
Are they are for routing a hologram or volumetric

501
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,119
Projection across the Galaxy

502
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,167
Second time she uses it is

503
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,959
For summoning a star chart of a

504
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:21,983
Distant planet

505
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,799
And the third

506
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:27,615
Is to land her spacecraft on corset

507
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,151
But when you look at those interface

508
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:31,199
The actual interaction she has it

509
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:33,247
Did you press the exact same button

510
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,527
On the panel

511
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,551
On the ship

512
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,111
To do all three things and nothing else

513
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:41,183
Is that you see her using the same single button

514
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,719
Burberry different tasks

515
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,487
Right

516
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,767
But I actually came up

517
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:45,791
With my very own app

518
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:46,559
Apologetic

519
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:50,143
You know if she's the queen she probably has love underlings

520
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,935
Probably someone

521
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,751
Somewhere offscreen who does everything for her

522
00:19:55,007 --> 00:20:00,383
And this is the make it sew button that I like that computer management

523
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:06,783
Communications management room somewhere on the ship and they're just like oh she wants to do something but why I like that be hilarious as you press the button

524
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:11,903
Annabelle ring in another room literally a little. LOL

525
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,487
Right

526
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:17,791
Do that thing we were discussing vague

527
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:40,063
99% invisible was produced this week by Sam Greenspan

528
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:42,367
We are project of 91.7

529
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:45,695
Local public radio kalw in San Francisco

530
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:48,767
An American Institute of Architects in San Francisco

531
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,351
Between the beats

532
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:54,655
Bongs and Charter of our devices

533
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:58,239
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man made sound

534
00:20:58,751 --> 00:20:59,263
If

535
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:05,663
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife isn't

536
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,759
All hearing that voice

537
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:10,527
Technology

538
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,295
Talk to us

539
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,599
It is a creation of Sonic trash

540
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:16,672
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

541
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:20,256
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

542
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,048
To make them more human

543
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:26,144
Turn the living room lights on

544
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:27,936
Okay

545
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:30,496
Dim the living room lights to 50%

546
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,544
Okay

547
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:38,688
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

548
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:40,992
Makes for a much more natural

549
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:41,760
Experience

550
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:43,552
Turn the living room lights on

551
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,880
Dim the living room lights

552
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:47,904
50%

553
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:55,328
We're presenting to special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

554
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:58,144
About how are soundscape is impacting our health

555
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:00,704
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

556
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,520
Look for them Friday is May 17th and May 24th

557
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,288
