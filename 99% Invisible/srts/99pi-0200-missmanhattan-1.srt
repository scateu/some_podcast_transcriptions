All over New York City there are semi clothes or nude women

38
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:39,840
And they are so baked in architecture that we don't even see them

39
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:43,424
For example when you enter the New York Public Library on the left hand side

40
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,752
Is a sculpture of a young woman leaning against the horse

41
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,032

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,664
107th Street and Broadway there's a woman

00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,688
Reclining on a bed

45
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:57,504
That's former New Yorker Avery troubleman

46
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,552
100th and Riverside Drive

47
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:00,832
Stone woman sits

48

In a chair

00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,368
The child

50
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,904
And on a very

51
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,184

00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:05,952
Support building

53
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,488
There's a golden woman

00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,256
Holding a

55
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,024
Crown

56
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:11,072
And these women

57
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,096
Or actually

58
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,120
The same woman

59
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:14,656
Audrey Munson

60
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,960
Was the most famous artist model

61
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:17,728
In the United

62
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:24,128
Midstates statues at the Met are made in her likeness in the memorial

63
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:26,688
Regal buildings all over New York City

64
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:31,552
She basically was the equivalent of a supermodel at the time this is Andre Agassi

65
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:34,368
An artist herself and author of Queen of the artist

66
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,672
The story of Audrey month

67
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:40,512
Everybody knew who she was her picture was in the papers

68
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:44,864
And if one trust Legends I call every boy had a crush on her

69
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,912
She was a very desired

70
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,192
A young woman

71
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,472
In her lifetime

72
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:52,288
She would go on to decorate buildings and Memorial

73
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,568
Is all over the United

74
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,336
It states

75
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,872
Before becoming a movie star

76
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:59,712
And eventually getting embroiled in a sensational murder scandal

77
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:05,088
And although Audrey Munson's body has been immortalized in iron and marble

78
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,880
Her name is mostly forgotten

79
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:12,000
But she was a prolific writer and pandas series of Articles telling her life in her own words

80
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,048
Sometimes and the third person

81
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,608
Where is she now

82
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,400
This model who was so beautiful

83
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,448
What has been horrible

84
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:22,496
Is she happy and prosperous

85
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,288
Arshi sad and forlorn

86
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:25,824
Her beauty God

87
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:28,128
Leaving only memories in the way

88
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:32,480
Like so many supermodels that would come after her

89
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,528
Audrey Marie Munson with scouted

90
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:36,064
On the streets of New York City

91
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,344
19

92
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,112
06

93
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,208
Audrey's mother and father were divorced which was very unusual at the time

94
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:45,280
And her mother decided to get a fresh start in the big city

95
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,352
Audrey was 15 enrolled in music school

96
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,376
And one day

97
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:52,704
She was picked up on the street by a photographer

98
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:58,592
When she walked around with her mother this photographer gave Audrey his card and asked if she would pose for some portrait

99
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,664
Her mom was invited to so intentions were good

100
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:04,224
These photos were fully clothed

101
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:05,760
Audrey

102
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:09,856
By chance was picked up as a model and then in the studio

103
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,648
Proof that she was somebody

104
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,696
Who was very good with the camera

105
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:16,512
Very good in creating and generating poses

106
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:21,375
This photographer recommended that Audrey me to front of hits the famous sculptor Isadora Conte

107
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:23,935
At first, he thought he didn't really need Audrey

108
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:27,007
But as Audrey herself later recall

109
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,055
Suddenly he rose from the table

110
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,359
What about me asked me to stand and walk

111
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,407
And then said that he thought he could use me

112
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,199
But significant

113
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,015
You will have to pose in the altogether

114
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:41,343
Posing in the altogether mint posing naked

115
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,879
Audrey's mother consent

116
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,695
If they would have been wealthy people

117
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:49,279
I don't think her mother would have let her pose in the nude

118
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:51,839
From that encounter the resulting sculpture was

119
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:52,863
The three muses

120
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,423
Three nude women with their arms around each eye

121
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:56,703
All three

122
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,471
Model.

123
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:01,311
For decades the sculpture was in the lobby of the hotel

124
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,615
Audrey called this statue quote

125
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,175
A souvenir of my mother's consent

126
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:10,271
And this was the first of many sculptures that you would model for his Door County

127
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:13,599
Audrey began to work from many other famous artists in New York

128
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:19,231
As a reputation grew she's recommended from Studio to studio and slowly

129
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,511
Her likeness appeared

130
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,303
Mostly naked or half-naked

131
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,095
All over the city

132
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:28,447
1913 the New York Sun dubbed her Miss Manhattan

133
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:34,591
But Audrey is not always recognizable in sculpture her figure is different in different artist dies

134
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,127
Sometimes she's lying

135
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,919
Sometimes she's Fuller

136
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:42,783
In sculpture the sculpture there are no obvious giveaway is that you're looking at Audrey's body

137
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,575
The clues are interface

138
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,111
It's the expressions

139
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,391
Of the eyes

140
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,183
Is in the mouth into nose

141
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,511
Like once you know how she looks you can see her everywhere

142
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:56,607
It's really fascinating I would like to look at sculptures in the map and be like

143
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:59,935
That looks like her and then research and be

144
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,471
Yeah be right that was her

145
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,263
Before it was easy for artists

146
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,543
The snapper reference

147
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:07,103
Audrey could pose in a way

148
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,383
I could have booked a mood

149
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,711
She must have been a very empathetic person she could really

150
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,759
Translate emotion

151
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,295
Fully into her body

152
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:19,647
Battery can hold the same pose for hours sometimes for an entire day

153
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,695
And she worked closely with the artist

154
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:25,279
Learning their temperaments

155
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,583
She thought of herself as a collaborator

156
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,887
That she told the New York Herald in 1915

157
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,935
Study yes indeed I do

158
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:35,775
Every model who is a real success must study the work of the persons

159
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:36,543
She is with

160
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:39,359
Audrey's unique set of skills aren't her a decent salary

161
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,151
About $35 a week

162
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:43,711
Which today would be like $800 a week

163
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,039
She made enough to give a day's salary to the suffragists

164
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,087
Which is in full swing around

165
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,391
Audrey with an independent

166
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,415
Confident Woman

167
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,951
Had a good time to be

168
00:06:55,487 --> 00:07:01,631
Because the architecture that was in Vogue in the United States from the end of the 19th century through World War I was the

169
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,399
Bozart Style

170
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:07,263
And this style required a lot of sculptures and detailed ornamentation

171
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,543
It was

172
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,079
A great time in many ways

173
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:13,919
To be an artist this is architectural historian Karen McNeil

174
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,199
Whether you an architect

175
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:15,967
Skelter

176
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:16,735
Painter

177
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,527
Across person making lamps

178
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:23,135
Using Bozart style architecture virtually all state capitals are in this style

179
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,439
That image of an authoritative building with

180
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,767
Columns and statues all around maybe a big dome

181
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,791
That's Bozarth

182
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,095
The style is a cross between like

183
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,375
Italy Greece

184
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:36,447
Parthenon and Flowery French Versailles

185
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,239
So opposed our building

186
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:44,383
It's a greek temple but then you do have the sculptures on it you do have the freeze work you do have all of this

187
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,455
Ornamental detail that is integral to the building

188
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,247
An architecture and sculpture

189
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,295
Are we bound together in this movie

190
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:55,135
When you take the decorative elements off of a bozar building

191
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:58,207
It started looking weird the dimensions don't

192
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:02,815
White work anymore but also the sculptures are signs of a building

193
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,631
The very overly representational

194
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:12,031
Like in a private home the statues are of domestic scenes or on a market there of harvest and eating

195
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:18,687
Free government building say San Francisco City Hall it's all going to tell us about this is the seat of government

196
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,991
In California so great and fabulous and

197
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,783
But it's all going to be allegorical

198
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,063
In a government building

199
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,135
Might find a statue of a woman holding an olive branch

200
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,183
Or the scales of Justice

201
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,231
Representing the state liberty

202
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:32,511
You name it

203
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,559
Just women placed on this

204
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,327
Pedestal

205
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,119
Virtue

206
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,143
Morality

207
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,191
Motherhood nurturing

208
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,215
Strength

209
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,263
Women decorated the seat of power

210
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,543
They didn't set in it

211
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:47,103
Why's it gotta be a lady because women are pure

212
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,407
You know a woman with a spear

213
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,991
She would only use that Spirit to really defend her kids

214
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:54,527
Right

215
00:08:56,575 --> 00:09:02,463
And for several years as pure uncorrupt symbol of virtue in the US was Audrey Munson

216
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,999
She was everywhere

217
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:07,327
The World's Fair in 1915 held in San Francisco

218
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,655
Audrey posed for 3/4 the statues on the premises

219
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:13,471
Her face and body appeared

220
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,007
Everywhere throughout the grounds

221
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:18,335
But Aaron Garcia of the California Historical Society

222
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:22,687
She curated an exhibit about the 1915 Panama Pacific Exposition

223
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,711
In San Francisco

224
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:27,295
Where Audrey Munson was dubbed the exposition girl

225
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:33,695
In the court of Four Seasons she was the seasons of the Fountain of energy

226
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,463
She was

227
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:40,863
The Priestess of culture at the Palace of Fine Arts she posed for 91 figures meant to represent the Stars

228
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,143
She was all over the

229
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:45,983
What about 24 years old Miss Manhattan had won the West

230
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:48,287
And there was a new form of RN during the scene

231
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,311
Cinema

232
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:52,639
The obvious next stop for Audrey Munson was Hollywood

233
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,919
And Hollywood was

234
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:54,687
Unfortunately

235
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,479
The beginning of the end

236
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,247
Friday night

237
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,575
Cheers cast in a few films after the exposition

238
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,367
But in every case she has cast

239
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,415
As a nude model

240
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:07,743
As an artist model and she appears nude

241
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:12,095
Audrey was acting the first leading woman in Hollywood to appear naked on film

242
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,399
Audrey may have been a good model

243
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,447
But she honestly wasn't much of an actor

244
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,495
If you heard films

245
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,519
She actually had an

246
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,287
I cleaned up

247
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:23,359
To basically do everything except the naked posing

248
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:26,943
And the movies that end up really being worth it for her financially

249
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,967
She's paid very little

250
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,527
And none of them seem to have been critical C

251
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,295
Excessive

252
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:35,391
That might have been okay for her her career might have

253
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,159
Survived

254
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:36,927
Scott

255
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:39,999
But then unfortunately she was involved in a murder

256
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,023
Scandal

257
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,327
Audrey and her mother had an apartment in New York

258
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,607
And the landlord

259
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,887
Dr. Wilkins

260
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:50,495
Fell in love with Audrey her landlord apparently became obsessed with her

261
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:51,775
And

262
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:58,431
Killed his wife so that he could be with Audrey

263
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:04,831
Murder or any kind of romance with dr. Wilkins actually moved out of the

264
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,879
Before this happened

265
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:10,463
But they were questioned they had to testify in court

266
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:13,023
And they were should have dragged through the mud in the Press

267
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,559
The so-called Wilkins case

268
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:17,119
Became a phenomenal media scandal

269
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,911
As Audrey told the daily variety

270
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:19,935
In 1920

271
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:22,495
The Wilkins case ruined my career

272
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:24,799
I'll never count for anything again

273
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:28,383
From loving and admiring me the public seems to have grown to hate

274
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,431
Badri couldn't find any work

275
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:36,319
In Fillmore in artist Studios of Audrey's career wasn't just because of the Wilkins can

276
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,111
She was after all

277
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,135
Totally innocent

278
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:42,719
They're just a lot of factors changing in the culture around here

279
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,791
I want the Bozart style wasn't

280
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,071
Very popular anymore

281
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,631
The Bozart style came out of Europe

282
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:52,447
And there is this thing called World War 1

283
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,007
Where Western Europe kind of fell apart

284
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,543
And so there was a questioning

285
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,335
About whether or not

286
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,871
We want to be using

287
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,407
That kind of symbolism

288
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:05,759
Both European and American Architects were trending towards modernism

289
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:08,319
Away from the old world bosarts presidents

290
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:11,391
Also the economics of Bozart style wearing possible

291
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:14,719
It became increasingly expensive to

292
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:18,559
Construct these buildings and pay for all of the artists and artisans

293
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:22,143
To design all of the elements of the building and install it

294
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,471
The architectural world didn't need Audrey like it used to

295
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:28,543
And also at 30 she was aging out of the business

296
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:34,175
Audrey's 15-year career as an artist model had come to an end and her money started to run out

297
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,967
She moved Upstate with her mother

298
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:38,015
You clean homes that support them both

299
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:40,319
As they tried to carve out a place for themselves

300
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,367
In the small rural town

301
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,903
Of Mexico New York

302
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:45,951
It's not an

303
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,999
Kind of open easy going

304
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:53,887
Andrea Geyer went up there to talk to people about Audrey nobody was unfriendly to me but

305
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,423
There's something

306
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:59,519
About these close-knit Community Square as a stranger you don't

307
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,799
Feel welcome

308
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,359
Audrey could not get used

309
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,127
Small town life

310
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:07,199
Her whole adulthood she been traveling around the country

311
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,223
Studying art

312
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:11,295
Working with artist engaging in intellectual discussion

313
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,831
And wearing fine clothes

314
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,367
Information lost

315
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:17,183
Well she still had the clothes

316
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,487
People told me that she was

317
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,767
Very flamboyant

318
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:27,423
She like to dress up and colorful garmin's I mean I'm sure she had a pretty

319
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,215
Impressive wardrobe that

320
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,751
Was very outlandish

321
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:35,871
For a small community but it wasn't just Audrey's style that set her apart

322
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,687
She would dress up on that and then part of her

323
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,735
Workout routine in the city was

324
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:47,135
Roller skating so you know you can imagine a beautiful woman with long hair and a turban on her head

325
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:50,207
You know trying to roller skate on a country

326
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:53,023
Unpaved country road that was quite a scene

327
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:57,375
The town new Audrey as that crazy woman who used to get naked for money

328
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:00,703
Parents would close their Windows whenever she came roller skating by

329
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,775
The kids of course we're totally fascinated with her

330
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:04,543
But

331
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,615
There was a general consensus that she was

332
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,383
Crazy

333
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,175
Just because she was different

334
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:13,247
So it's not hard to imagine why she

335
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,271
Would have

336
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,063
Falling into a depression

337
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:21,951
In a May 27th 1922 Audrey Munson attempted suicide by swallowing poison

338
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,999
I don't know how

339
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,559
Committed her suicide attempt

340
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,327
Was

341
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,423
Maybe it was just an expression of being some her at the end of her line

342
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,727
After her failed suicide attempt

343
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,007
Several years went by

344
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,543
And Audrey's mother was

345
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,847
Struggling to provide for her depressed daughter

346
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,383
Just

347
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,919
Couldn't do it anymore

348
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:45,503
But Audrey Munson 40th birthday

349
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,271
June 8th

350
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,551
1931

351
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:50,111
Her mother checked her into the state mental institution

352
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:53,695
At that time it was extremely common for families

353
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:54,719
To put

354
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:56,511
Relatives into these in

355
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,279
Tutions

356
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,327
In moments of

357
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,887
A financial hardship where they felt

358
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,935
They couldn't care for a person

359
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,215
Body remained in the

360
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,751
Institution into her nineties

361
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,543
Then she was put in a nursing home

362
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,079
About 30 miles up the road

363
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,871
But this home for the elderly

364
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:17,503
Well situated on this little four-lane Highway

365
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:18,783
Which handlebar

366
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:21,855
And she was known

367
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,391
2

368
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:26,207
Sneak out of the home for the elderly and
