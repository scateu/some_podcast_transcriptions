I'm Roman Mars

32
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,520
During the Cold War a so-called Iron Curtain separated eastern and western Europe

33
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,056
Communism capitalism

34
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,080
The Soviet Union

35
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,360
From everyone else

36
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:22,944
In some places it was an actual wall like in Berlin

37
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,736
In another place is it was just a bar

38
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:25,504
Wire fence

39
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:27,552
This border was Wong

40
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:30,112
Stretching from northern Finland through Central Europe

41
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,672
It covered 12 and a half thousand km

42
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:34,720
Or almost 8000 Miles

43
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:37,792
Is 8000 Mile border

44
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,072
There was a no man's land

45
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,608
Couple hundred yards across

46
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:43,168
Where there was almost no human activity

47
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:48,800
When the Cold War ended and the walls and fences came down people notice something interesting

48
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:51,104
Beth reporter ended Fitzgerald

49
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,944
This neglected strip of land

50
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,712
With Forest

51
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,736
Stanfield's

52
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:57,760
It was a Haven

53
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:00,064
Particularly for migratory Birds

54
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:05,952
Soon after the Berlin Wall fell conservationists from east and west

55
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,488
Came together to protect this

56
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,512
Accidental Refuge

57
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:09,792
For birds and animals

58
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:12,352
Because the no-man's-land was so long

59
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:14,656
They realize that it could link habitat

60
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,936
Throughout Central Europe

61
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:19,008
Today the so-called European green belt

62
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,312
Traces the path of the Old Iron Curtain

63
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,848
It connects National Park

64
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,128
Books and nature preserves

65
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:26,688
And helps animals move around in a landscape

66
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,224
Dominated by humans

67
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,528
It's what's known as a wildlife corridor

68
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:37,440
Wildlife corridors can link to extremely large habitats like to National Parks or to National Forest

69
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,232
National forest and National Park

70
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:42,048
Across a very large freeway

71
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,704
Or it can link relatively small hat fragments of habitats within very developed metropolitan area

72
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:50,496
Louise Mozingo

73
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:56,640
She's chair of the Department of landscape architecture and environmental planning at the University of California Berkeley

74
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,176
And she says

75
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:02,784
The wildlife Corridor doesn't have to be a massive Greenway for Europe

76
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,088
Tubidy is something as simple as our

77
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:09,184
Concrete pipe or a small kind of vegetated ditch under

78
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,208
Freeway

79
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:14,304
Wildlife corridors might be the most critical in urban areas

80
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,328
Because

81
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:20,192
Sprawling cities and highways have fragmented a lot of wildlife habitat

82
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:23,008
And if forced animals into isolated pockets

83
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,544
What is the problem

84
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,592
Because animals need to move around

85
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,640
In order to find different food sources

86
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:32,736
In Southern California in abandoned highway underpass

87
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:37,600
Began to link two important pieces of habitat in an otherwise industrial area

88
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,416
What they found is that

89
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:45,536
Both of these habitats zones actually were able to support much larger populations than expected

90
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,560
Because this

91
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:49,376
Relatively small concrete underpass

92
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:52,192
Was able to connect the two habitats ranges

93
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,728
And so you had

94
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:57,824
Even very large a predator species like mountain lions being able to be seen

95
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,592
Supported

96
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,360
Buy these

97
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:02,944
Fragments of habitat in a very urbanized situation

98
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,808
Today the abandoned underpasses purposely protected

99
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,112
And maintained as a wildlife corridor

100
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,952
But Wildlife corridors don't technically have to be court ordered

101
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:19,583
They can be any piece of design the facilitators the safe passage of animals through the human built environment

102
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:22,143
From one piece of habitat to another

103
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,167
And they're not

104
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:25,727
Always a product of accident and neglect

105
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:28,031
Sometimes they're very intention

106
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,567
And carefully designed

107
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:36,223
One of the oldest examples of humans designing a passageway for Animals is the fish ladder which helps mug

108
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:42,623
Dory species of salmon and steelhead trout get over dams that block their annual migrations up river to spawn

109
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,719
First patented by a Canadian lumber mill owner in 1837

110
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:49,791
The standard fish ladder is a series of Terrace pool

111
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:54,655
With just enough space between them

112
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:57,983
Slowly climbing the ladder to the other side of the dam

113
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:02,591
The design takes a natural ability to swim upstream

114
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,895
Rapids Andover small waterfalls

115
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,199
So quick lesson in Salmon migration

116
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:10,783
7 babies hatch in the upper reaches of a river and immediately

117
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:16,159
Are making their way down the river to the ocean they hang out at sea for a few years and then

118
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:22,815
Miraculously swim their way back up the exact same river to lay their eggs using magnetic fields

119
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,095
Can smell to navigate

120
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,399
But in the early 20th century

121
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:29,471
Company started building giant hydroelectric Dam

122
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,263
On almost every major river

123
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,287
In the United States

124
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,359
And they were way too big for a salmon to jump over

125
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:39,967
And so at some of these dams Engineers installed fish ladders

126
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,247
To help the salmon out

127
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:43,551
And fish water temp worked well over the years

128
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,367
Part of the problems with fish ladders is that they

129
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,647
They tend to be very expensive

130
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,695
To build that's Todd delegan

131
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:55,071
My name is Todd delegan I am the vice president of Business Development with whoosh Innovations

132
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:57,119
You'll understand where the name music

133
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:57,887
Comes from

134
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:58,655
Amazon

135
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:02,495
Today there are about 8288

136
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:05,055
8000 barriers in the country that

137
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:05,823
Have

138
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,871
An elevation of 5 feet or more

139
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:14,527
88000 dams that fish have to get around a little hard to tell how many actual fish Passage

140
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,831
Installations are at these barriers

141
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:17,855
All around.

142
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,623
Check the country

143
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,671
But it is somewhere between

144
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,975
10 + 15%

145
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:23,999
We estimate

146
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:27,839
There are a lot of places where a lot of fish aren't getting anywhere

147
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:28,607
At all

148
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,631
Because of the barriers that

149
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,399
Exist

150
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,447
And that's where Todd's company

151
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,215
Whoosh

152
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:33,983
Comes in

153
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:40,127
Becoming flying fish

154
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,687
The whoosh

155
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:49,087
Fish Cannon

156
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,183
The salmon

157
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:56,511
Cannon & Cannon actually started out as an apple

158
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:59,071
The founder of the company Vince Bryan

159
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:02,143
Owens Orchards along the Columbia River in Eastern Washington

160
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,191
Any notice that the pickers were

161
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:07,007
We're spending a lot of their time carrying fruit from the tree to

162
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:07,775
The storage bin

163
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,311
What's in the center of the orchard

164
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,335
It was inefficient

165
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:13,151
So Vince and Todd built this softube

166
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,431
Kind of like a fire

167
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,223
Inside the tube

168
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:21,087
They generated a pressure differential capable of sucking an apple hundreds of feet

169
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:23,391
And depositing it gently in a storage bin

170
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:26,463
So they have this effective device for apple picking

171
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,999
But pretty soon they're thinking

172
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:28,767
Bigger

173
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,047
In the Pacific Northwest

174
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,583
Nothing is bigger

175
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,351
Insane

176
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:35,679
The Columbia was once one of the world's great Salmon Run

177
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:38,239
But today 14 Dam

178
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,775
Block the fishes path home

179
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,615
And the Columbia salmon migration is a thing of the past

180
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,431
We were

181
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:51,295
Working in the or apple orchards in Eastern Washington right along the Columbia River

182
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:57,695
Visit Todd could actually see two of Columbia's dams from The Orchard and Wheatley serve looked at each other and said will what if you could

183
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,231
Put a salmon in the tube

184
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:01,023
The idea seems ridiculous

185
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:01,791
The first

186
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,071
But they couldn't let it go

187
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,887
So Benton Todd head back home to their shop

188
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:08,191
We set up a fruit tube in our shop and it was about

189
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,727
25 Ft Lauderdale

190
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,031
And we went to the store and bought it

191
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,055
A dead salmon

192
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,871
Small dead salmon in a couple dead trout

193
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:18,431
Did they put the fish in the tube

194
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,479
Popped out on the other side

195
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:23,551
And then we went out and bought some live tilapia

196
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:30,719
To see if he was transported through our old agriculture or air filter tube would cause any effects

197
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,767
The fish are the fish going to live

198
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,303
And attitude was about 22

199
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,583
25 feet long also

200
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,119
Hawaii floppy anma

201
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,423
Went flying into a tank of water and they just

202
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,215
Slammer and immediately and had no issues

203
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,495
Use I in a WeChat I-5

204
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,567
It was it was great

205
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:49,151
So from there they said about retrofitting there apple tube

206
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:50,175
To transport fish

207
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:54,015
And a few months later the salmon Cannon was born

208
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,295
But

209
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,319
Okay it's not

210
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,343
ReliaCard

211
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,391
They aren't being blasted out

212
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,927
In any way shape or form

213
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:03,487
Canon by whoosh innovation

214
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,023
Works like this

215
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,351
First they have to get the fish to swim into the tube

216
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,143
Salmon evolve to swim upriver

217
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,167
Pass Rapids

218
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,191
Hanover waterfall

219
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,471
And they're attracted to

220
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,239
Well

221
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,543
To the company built a false rapid

222
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,311
In front of the

223
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:18,591
In essence

224
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,383
Samaire small waterfall with

225
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,431
Spinoza fishing float

226
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,199
To get the

227
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:25,503
The salmon to a particular place

228
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,551
A Wong the barrier

229
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,623
They are attracted to the flow

230
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,159
Up and over they come over this way

231
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:32,927
First

232
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:33,951
Step

233
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,511
And literally they will

234
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:42,143
Speak directly guided right into our tube itself once inside the tube

235
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,959
A pressure differential moves the fish forward

236
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,751
So that fish then

237
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:47,519
Accelerate

238
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,311
Through the rest of that to Weatherby

239
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,335
50 ft

240
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,103
300 ft

241
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:53,151
They're traveling somewhere between

242
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,175
15 + 22

243
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:54,943
2 feet a second

244
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:57,247
Inside the tube it's soft and slippery

245
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,783
With almost no friction

246
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,575
They are in essence

247
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,343
Say slippy slide

248
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:04,415
And see some videos where the Fisher actually

249
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:07,487
Almost swimming they're doing their natural

250
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:11,583
Swimming action through the tube itself and when they reach the top of the dam

251
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,375
Then they find themselves

252
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:15,167
Right back and right back in the river

253
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,959
So they can continue their jaw

254
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,239
On the other side of the

255
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:22,079
The salmon Cannon is still pretty new

256
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:25,407
Right now it's being used on the new Sugar River in Washington State

257
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:28,223
And they're trying to sell the system to fish and wildlife agency

258
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:28,991
Throughout the region

259
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:35,135
A lot of scientists who have tested the system seemed excited particularly because it seems to cause that's little stress

260
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:35,903
For the fish

261
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,951
But not everyone who cares about

262
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,487
It's so gung-ho

263
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,023
It seems like if your

264
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,071
Need to resort to a cannon

265
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,351
To get a fish

266
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,167
Moving through a river system

267
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:51,775
That maybe there's something more fundamental wrong with the infrastructure along the river system

268
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,311
This is David Montgomery

269
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:56,383
I'm a professor of geomorphology at the University of Washington

270
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,919
And I'm the author of the book

271
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,735
The king of fish the Thousand-Year run of salmon

272
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,783
And David's point is look

273
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:08,159
The fish can it may very well be able to get an adult salmon over a damn safely

274
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:08,927
Ncpa

275
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,975
But that's just treating a symptom

276
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,255
A deeper problem

277
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,303
In some cases

278
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:17,631
Rivers with lots of dams are even really Rivers anymore

279
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,423
Just look at the Columbia River

280
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,519
Lititz a series of lakes

281
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:29,919
Let me you can go water skiing on it on the Columbia

282
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,687
Reservoir

283
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:31,711
And that creates

284
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:35,551
Problems that things like fish ladders and Salmon cannons camp

285
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,855
When Salmon eggs hatch

286
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,903
The babies need to get back down the river

287
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,671
To the ocean

288
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,327
They just got out of the car

289
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:50,911
Oriented themselves and the river took them to the Sea

290
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:56,543
Now what happens if the river is no longer River insist series of lakes to swim all the way down

291
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,591
They didn't evolve to do that

292
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,407
This has been a problem for a long time

293
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:06,783
But not enough

294
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,063
On some Rivers

295
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:12,927
People have resorted to transporting baby salmon Downstream with boats and

296
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,999
David's not trying to single out the same thing

297
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,047
There's been a whole host of Technology

298
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,071
The people have experiment

299
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:26,239
Really the underlying problem is that you've ecologically turned a mighty River into a series of lakes

300
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:36,223
The Washington state government spends millions of dollars every year on fish ladders and other efforts to get fish around

301
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,503
Dams but the numbers

302
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,783
Are still way down

303
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:42,367
Around the Puget Sound where I live around Seattle

304
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:46,463
We're estimated to be down about 10% of the salmon that we had historically

305
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:52,863
Throughout the region it's somewhere be like 5 or 8% in the Columbia River at his down to 2% by river

306
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,399
Salmon decline is complicate

307
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,191
It has to do with several factors

308
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:58,239
You're such as overfishing and habitat

309
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,287
And I think that that's

310
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,919
Characteristic of a lot of environmental systems they're actually more complex

311
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:12,063
Then we realize and the worry is that many of these technological solutions to environmental problems

312
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,855
Only saw the piece of the problem

313
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,159
Without dealing with the overall health

314
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:16,927
Tobiko

315
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,743
You might be able to get the fish up the river

316
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,023
The river itself

317
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:21,791
Is still broken

318
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,071
With that in mind

319
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:26,655
People have recently started calling on the government to remove old dance

320
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,447
And return entire Riverside

321
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,239
Their free-flowing stay

322
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,287
The idea that you

323
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,847
Could actually take a major Dam out

324
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,895
20 years ago is crazy talk

325
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:40,223
I mean that was just not something that you would certify

326
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:44,831
That people would talk about as a serious political or social possibility

327
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,367
But now it's happening

328
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,671
After years of protest

329
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:51,231
Spy indigenous people and conservation groups

330
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:54,559
Danza come down on the Sandy River in Oregon

331
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,607
And the elwha river in Washington State

332
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,911
And the salmon have begun to come back

333
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:01,727
We're not going to get rid of every damn damn in the country

334
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:06,591
But a lot of them are reaching the end of their structural lifetimes and some are just not

335
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,615
Profitable anymore

336
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:13,247
And in those cases David wants us to look at each one on a case-by-case basis and ass

337
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,783
Well what about this damn

338
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,319
Does this one still make sense

339
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,391
Todd deligan

340
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,671
Supports taking out

341
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,207
Nonprofit

342
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:24,255
Spell concern for anti-dam act

343
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,559
Devices that Technologies like the salmon Cannon

344
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,607
Could slow down these effort

345
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:31,935
Or even enable more dams to be built because companies

346
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:35,775
Don't worry about the same in migration people design solution so that

347
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,359
And that's a worry with Wildlife corridors more generally

348
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:43,711
Why my quarters cannot be a substitution for preservation of

349
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:44,735
Quijada

350
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,575
That's Louise Mozingo again from UC Berkeley

351
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:51,647
The reconnection of fragmented landscapes

352
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,671
Should not

353
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:57,535
Be an excuse to destroy existing really high-quality have

354
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,327
That's we have too few of them

355
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:05,471
And we need to preserve the ones that are functioning really well that are supported large and diverse

356
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,263
Iyy population

357
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,639
Corridors only really make sense she says in places where habitats have already been fragment

358
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:19,295
And now you can knit them back together in ways that support if not a robust population it

359
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,599
Adequate population for the species to survive

360
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,903
Situation

361
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:26,975
Humans have already had a huge impact

362
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,535
Design for the benefit of Na

363
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,839
Could be the key to keeping Wildlife around

364
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:38,495
We spent most of the twentieth century carving up and dividing the landscape with impossible objects

365
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,287
Made up Asphalt and concrete

366
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,079
If you zoom in

367
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:48,735
You can see the effort to stitch together habitats with the tiniest of threats that can make all the difference

368
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,527
Crab ladder hair

369
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,087
Salamander tunnel there and that's great

370

We can't fix every problem we created by building something new

372
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:04,607
For a species like salmon to survive in the modern world it's going to take a patchwork approach of addition and

373
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:09,215
Subtraction Sometimes the best thing for wildlife is for us to just do our best

Sonic trash
