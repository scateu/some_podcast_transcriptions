00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,448
White cranes that pulled Giant

42
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,728

Does off the ships

45
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:53,664
People say the trains are the inspiration for the AT-AT walkers in The Empire Strikes Back but that's not true

46
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,968
It's a good story to tell when you pass by

47
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:56,736
Under bridge

48
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:02,112
The Port of Oakland and its container ships have always captured my imagination

49
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,136
It turns out

50
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:07,488
They also captured the imagination of my colleague and friend Alexis Madrigal

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,072
I went out and visited a ship that was docked in Okla

52
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,632
And when I went out on the ship

53
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,168
I walked into this

54
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,448
Room that's all wood

55
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,216
Paneled in this

56
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,264
Old Romanian captain

57
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,080
Walks in with his Marlboro Reds needs to come down

58
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,872
On the table he looks right in my eyes mean

59
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,176
What is your

60
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,968
Tent

61
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,904
And I was just thought I was in love like from his love at first sight I was just like no one else

62
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,208
Ever hear these voices there so amazing

63
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:42,560
The car to head people on a ship one of the cats and the other is the chief engineer down in the engine room

64
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,864
And so we can we look at Bridge

65
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,472
And we went back to that wood-paneled room and the chief engineer comes in another Romanian dude

66
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:50,496
Enikos

67
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,800
You visited the head of a ship

68
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,080
Top Chef

69
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:55,872
Now visit the heart

70
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:59,200
He takes his time into the engine room you know where these is a

71
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:02,016
Wrenches that are like you know 5 ft tall

72
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:05,856
I really cannot imagine not doing

73
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,136
A series of stories after that

74
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:11,744
And I went home and I had some wine and I was like drunk tweeting about how amazing would it be

75
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,024
Just tell the stories of all these

76
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:13,792
People on earth

77
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:14,560
Supply chain

78
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,840
And that's what happened

79
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:19,936
Alexis decided to embark on an eight-part series called containers

80
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,472
About how the shipping container

81
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,264
Has changed the global economy

82
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,592
We're going to feature one of the stories from that series on the show today but first

83
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,896
I wanted to talk a little with Alexis

84
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:31,968
About what the world was like before the container

85
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,528
So like before the 1970s or so

86
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,064
Starting with the ports

87
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,624
So if you want to think about what a port was like

88
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:39,648
In the old days

89
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,672
Go just look at the

90
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,208
Appears look at how they're shaped

91
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,256
Are these long fingers coming off

92
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,024
The shoreline

93
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,328
Will the ships would have pulled up into what those are

94
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,096
Finger piers

95
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:52,704
And then we would have unloaded their stuff they would have probably hundreds of people running around

96
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:56,800
And they would have unloaded their stuff directly onto this. Which would have been gone into cargo

97
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:02,176
So you got guys working winches you know, like little Mini Cranes on the boat

98
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:05,760
And you got all the stuff stored inside the hull of the ship

99
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:06,528
That was

100
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,296
Container

101
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,832
They're dropping it onto the docks

102
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:11,648
Other people are forklifting around trucks are pulling out there's all these

103
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,928
Is Cruz running everywhere

104
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:15,232
And so that the notion of the docs

105
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,000
Like the water

106
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,280
Charismatic play

107
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,583
The people know understand

108
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,863
It's because they were

109
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,911
All these people from all over the world

110
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:27,775
And the goods themselves literally the stuff coming from all these places is visible to your view

111
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,055
So

112
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,847
You can smell the coffee

113
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:33,407
When the spaceships come in you'd smell the cardamom

114
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,759
When there was something that was disgusting like hides that was being worked

115
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:40,063
You smell green hide being handled by

116
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,623
You have seen big rolls of newsprint

117
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,695
Way the world worked

118
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,719
Was actually served

119
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:49,791
Boast you before it got reput into factories

120
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:50,559
Simpatico

121
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,863
It was actually it's incredible

122
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,655
Citing an old longshoreman

123
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,935
When you graduate high school

124
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:56,703
But only High School

125
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,775
He said you know there was an entire education about the way the world war

126
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,055
Just looking at the goods

127
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,079
They were sitting on the docks

128
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:07,199
When people started shipping things in containers Goods could be loaded in offloaded more easily

129
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:10,783
The container is full of stuff could go directly from the ship

130
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,319
Two trucks and trains

131
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,855
And everything was standard

132
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,391
All over the world

133
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,951
Containers unlimited a lot of inefficiency

134
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:18,719
She's from the system

135
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:19,743
Imports

136
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,023
Completely change

137
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,815
Airports nowadays

138
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,607
Long flat bursts

139
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,143
The ships come in they dock

140
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,423
And then you at least

141
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,447
Largely White

142
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,239
Container cranes drop over them

143
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:35,871
Those cranes are really a wild thing when you think about it the reason their necks are so long that called The Boom

144
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,663
Because the ships are so wide

145
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,967
And they go out over the whole ship

146
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:40,735
And then a little

147
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:43,551
Person in a little cab

148
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,575
Go out

149
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,855
All the way

150
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:48,671
Across the ship they look down through their legs

151
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,439
Drop this

152
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,719
Then call the spreader

153
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,487
Auntie Dee's

154
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:55,839
For locking mechanisms on the box they pull it up and bring it they drop it onto a

155
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:58,655
Intermediate truck that takes it into the holding yard

156
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:05,311
Venom Rio Drayage truck comes in drive-thru West Oakland spraying diesel all over the community and then takes it out to it District

157
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:09,407
You should Center in Tracy or wherever it is you know and that's kind of a pretty normal flow

158
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,479
But container is didn't just have an effect on Imports

159
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,783
Band effect on port cities

160
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,807
All over the world

161
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,343
Oakland included

162
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:19,391
Cuz absolutely

163
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:22,463
Everything about the way that cities work and global trade War

164
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:25,023
Was changed by the system of containers

165
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,303
They should not just the Box

166
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,839
But everything that went along with

167
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,375
The locking mechanism

168
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:32,703
The operations of the yard the ships that had to be developed

169
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,495
In order to carry more containers

170
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:38,335
In a one way that I have thought about it

171
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,871
Is there were computers

172
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,407
Before and it was networking before

173
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:43,967
Then there's this thing called the Internet Protocol that allowed

174
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,783
Like a package to be moved around no matter what was inside them

175
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,807
And that allows for the sick

176
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:48,831
Explosion of networking

177
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:51,135
That's essentially what containers do

178
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,159
For Stuff

179
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,183
You can just

180
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:57,023
Put NEX thing into a box and it can go to any port

181
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:59,327
And as I was reading this

182
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,631
Defining work on this process

183
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,911
Containerization called The Box

184
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,959
Canon Mark Levinson is in the series

185
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:05,983
There's a

186
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,007
Droll Four Oaks

187
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:11,615
For most intensive purposes Sealand is a first major container Shipping Company

188
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:14,175
They really get there

189
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,199
Explosive growth

190
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:18,271
How's the Vietnam War shipping things from Oakland to Vietnam

191
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,343
And that was so fascinating to me

192
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,391
Particular because almost immediately

193
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,439
They go to Vietnam to

194
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,207
Container

195
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,743
Rapport-building cam ranh Bay

196
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,535
And they start going back by Japan

197
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,327
And if they go back by Japan

198
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,863
People trying to come back to you

199
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,887
California Science

200
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,423
And that

201
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,191
Becomes

202
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,727
This dominant mode

203
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,263
A trade in the world and it

204
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,799
Literally reshapes

205
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,079
The world economy

206
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:44,639
And it's coming from these three you know

207
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:47,967
Cranes that are sitting over there still sitting there unused

208
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,247
In the Port of Oakland

209
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:52,319
How is not a better known story

210
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,855
After you get started after

211
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,135
Talking to your Romanian

212
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,415
Captain and Trump tweeting

213
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,695
What were you most surprised by

214
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,719
We started doing this

215
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,511
Bluetooth

216
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:01,791
When is the

217
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:02,559
Credible

218
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:03,839
Containerization

219
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,375
Had on cities

220
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,423
And it continues to have on cities

221
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:08,959
The first wave of

222
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,983
Containerization

223
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,775
Wipes out so many jobs

224
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,079
In urban America

225
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,359
Urban Coastal

226
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,407
Really really

227
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,943
Does bad things

228
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,967
For a lot of cities

229
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:22,271
Like you know that empty Warehouse Brooklyn aesthetic

230
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:25,087
Like that was the warehouse that used to before we Goods

231
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:30,975
And then containerization came along and wiped out all the warehouses and that's what created the ability to have these kinds of

232
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:36,863
Creative workspaces that you have now that's your leader in the energy in the carcass of the old system of trade

233
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,143
When you're in one of those space

234
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,007
That was what I didn't I just had no idea that this happened all over the world in London and New York

235
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,287
San Francisco

236
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:48,383
Even though the invention of the container wiped out shipping jobs all over the world

237
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:51,199
There are still a lot of people working in the industry

238
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:57,599
What those people do and whether they will be able to hold on to their jobs as the shipping industry continues to change

239
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:01,183
Is what Alexis Explorer is in episode 3 of

240
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:01,951
Containers

241
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,231
And you have all these

242
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,511
People out there

243
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:05,535
Good job

244
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,863
Is Arlington one way or another two things made around the world

245
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,911
And most of them tend to

246
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,191
To be in place

247
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:12,959
It's like

248
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:15,263
California Virginia New York

249
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,055
These big Coastal ports

250
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:19,359
And their job

251
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,639
Send what those jobs are

252
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,431
I had no idea it like what is it

253
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,223
To work in a warehouse what is it to work

254
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,015
On a tugboat what is it to work in a

255
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:28,575
Port there no stories about these things ever

256
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:31,135
Take away from me is Maybe

257
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,671
Collage

258
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:35,231
Of all these different work experiences and trying to get

259
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,767
The texture of those lives

260
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,535
How those

261
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,071
People see the world

262
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,095
I like the point

263
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,375
Containers

264
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:46,495
This is episode 3 of containers

265
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,031
Call the ships

266
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:48,799
Buttocks

267
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:49,567
And the poor

268
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,359
Here's Alexa smack

269
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,943
You need a lot of tough people near the docks

270
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:59,551
Intense Captain's Burley longshoreman salty Skippers rugged old timers

271
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,367
But I want you to meet the most hardcore person

272
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,415
I met during my time reporting

273
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,183
On the waterfront

274
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:09,791
And I thought to myself well I'll go in this career in this industry and kind of see what

275
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:12,863
I'm not thinking that this is my dream

276
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,655
To grow up and be a ship captain

277
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,935
This is Lynn Court watch

278
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:19,775
She became the first female captain of an American cargo ship

279
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:20,799
Under remark

280
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,079
Circumstance

281
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:25,407
And during those first years I had the opportunity to sale

282
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,687
Initially as a

283
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,479
I made on an oil tanker

284
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:31,039
And was in Southern California when a tanker blew up

285
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:34,879
Inside me and maybe this is really not

286
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,671
The gig that I want

287
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,231
So she joined the master mates & Pilots Union

288
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:42,047
And began selling on all kinds of ships around the world

289
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:45,119
I quickly kind of decided that you know going to places like

290
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,143
The Far East

291
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:52,799
And South America was a little bit more of a challenge you know in the 1970s and early 80s they had never seen

292
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:53,823
Women on ships

293
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,871
Every time she entered a poor Chadwicks

294
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,663
Explain to skeptical dockworkers

295
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,711
But she wasn't the captain's wife

296
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:01,247
And that the men had to listen to her

297
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:02,783
The stuff work

298
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:06,879
So she decided to try to work her way up at the American shipping line mat

299
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:07,903
Wood Randa

300
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,671
It still runs

301
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,207
Ship from Oakland to Hawaii

302
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:13,279
I have the opportunity over the years to advance

303
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:18,655
To the chief mates position at Mattson they were very good to me

304
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:19,679
And

305
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:24,543
When an opportunity came up to be promoted on a temporary basis to Captain

306
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,079
When did turn it down

307
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,103
Yeah of course not

308
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:30,431
Why would you he never knew when that opportunity was going to come along again

309
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:33,759
Only one hitch so despite the fact that

310
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:37,087
I was 8 months pregnant there's no doctor on board a container ship

311
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,903
Let alone OB or Midwife or a doula

312
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,183
I said God

313
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,719
You know I think I got to do this

314
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:46,303
And who knows you can appreciate being pregnant is not handicapped

315
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,583
Or

316
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,399
You know something that should limit your opportunities it's

317
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:53,215
It's just something that happens and you kind of carry on with life

318
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,495
So that's what happened

319
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,287
I was 8 months pregnant

320
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,335
Probably more than 8 months pregnant

321
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,871
And said yes

322
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,639
Let's go

323
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,431
What's your plan if you got into labor

324
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:06,015
It was kind of funny because my chief made at the time

325
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:09,599
Had recently delivered his own baby in his car

326
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:15,231
So he was delighted with the idea that all man I get to do this and won't that be really fun

327
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:18,303
You needless to say it didn't turn into a reality

328
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,583
But what

329
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,935
Did kind of complicate the situation was after I got off the ship

330
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,263
About five days later I did go into labor

331
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,055
And found out

332
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,591
15 RMB notes to me

333
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,895
My son was breech that means feet first

334
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,943
Which makes for substantially more dangerous labor

335
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:41,855
So should I have gone into labor on the ship it would have been a much bigger challenge than I think any of us ever into the

336
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,903
And to link or watches

337
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:47,743
Down-to-earth groundbreaking woman in the field of shipping

338
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,559
And the longtime part of the bay is maritime economy

339
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:53,375
She's respected by all for her toughness

340
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,399
IntelliJ

341
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:59,519
Her track record made her natural fit to become the head of the San Francisco Marine Exchange

342
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:03,103
Which may be the oldest institution in all of California

343
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:09,247
So the Marine Exchange is an organization that was founded back in 1849 to really kind of track

344
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:12,319
And monitor ships as they arrived in San Francisco Bay

345
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,623
We put the telegraph on Telegraph

346
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,463
Kill in order to communicate that information down to our Maritime partners

347
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,487
We had several

348
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,279
Relay stations around the bay

349
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,071
You know I'm primarily

350
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,351
Yeah we were

351
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,399
Moving that information around

352
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,167
There was

353
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,191
The trading floor

354
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:31,007
So that when we pass this information down to our

355
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,031
Our membership

356
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:35,615
You know they were traded Commodities right then and there on the floor

357
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:37,151
They knew that the shipping

358
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,175
Coming from

359
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,455
South America

360
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:40,479
East Coast

361
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:41,503
China Beach

362
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,271
Because that would be

363
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,807
Do semaphore

364
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:44,831
Orthrus

365
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:45,599
Flags

366
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,415
It's not a stretch to say that San Francisco

367
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,719
And all the surrounding towns exist

368
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,743
Basically

369
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,279
Because the bay had a good poor

370
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:57,375
San Francisco became a part of the global archipelago

371

Important cities

372
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,447
The Waterfront area

373
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:03,007
Along the Embarcadero is where those brake bulbs

374
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,031
Came

375
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,055
Announce really

376
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:06,847

Gruen Gruen

379
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,711
Kangaroo nowadays

380
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:15,039
The Marine Exchange nips together the many different pieces

381
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,831
Of the current Maritime economy

382
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,879
The honest broker

383
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,927
Did everyone works with to address stuff like

384
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,463
Trade stuff

385
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:25,791
Mission really haven't changed we do exactly the same thing

386
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,583
We don't control ships

387
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,375
We don't directions

388
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,143
Weimar

389
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:34,495
Because we do have management part of our organization as well as labor

390
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,031
We

391
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:41,151
Have become somewhat of a neutral provider for services

392
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:48,063
And one of those Services is that they publish a book A book

393
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,599
Redis entire series

394
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,879
That you're listening to

395
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:54,207
It was all the businesses that ply the waters

396
00:14:54,463 --> 00:15:00,607
Anchor chains indexing barging boating Services boiling water tree

397
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:03,679

By the Waters and the supply ships

400
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:16,479
The people who bring supplies and service lifeboats and make ropes and haul trash and so anchors so many

401
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:19,039
Types of businesses that you need to have a functioning

402
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,575
Maritime economy

403
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:27,231
Container ships are the big animals these companies are the little Nimble creatures that make the ecosystem work

404
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,815
Like inside

405
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:34,655
One of these small businesses works these jobs

406
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:41,055
I want to know so I called appetite but companies listed in the Marine Exchange handbook a few days later I was sitting across from

407
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:44,639
Ted blankenburg messy office inside a manufactured building

408
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,431
Right at the foot of the Bay Bridge

409
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,223
What you say he was

410
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,247
Adventurous

411
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,271
Young man

Fencing

417
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,559
And taking a horse

418
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,095
Hopefully over a course

419
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,375
Ted works for Eminem

420
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,423
One of the tugboat companies that service

421
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,191
Eastbay

422
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,007
Like the rest of the maritime economy

423
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:13,823
Voting is inextricably linked with a business

424
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,591
Global Shipping

425
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,895
He's also worldclassbullshitter

426
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:17,663
Hilarious

427
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:20,735
Well that's a picture of me falling off a horse into a brick wall

428
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,295
He's been around the type of mystery for

429
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,063
30 years

430
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,599
I was tending bar

431
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,391
And a friend of mine's

432
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,439
Mother on the tugboat company

433
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,999
And my friend heard my line of

434
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:35,327
Pattern from behind a bar to go to we got to get you on the air we need a night

435
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,095
Dispatcher

436
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,887
So I started working

437
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,447
3 days a week this is the best job I ever had

438
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:42,495
3 14-hour days a week from

439
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:43,775
Fortnite

440
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,055
Till 6 in the morning

441
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,591
And you could sleep a few hours on

442
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:50,175
On the job tells a good gig but the business of voting is changing

443
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,223
The customers the big Shipping Lines

444
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:55,039
I've been locked in Fierce competition with each other

445
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,319
And I mean let's be real

446
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,855
They've been in a race

447
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,623
To the bottom

448
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,927
I did that in the shipping companies in the past

449
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,975
Probably since 2008

450
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,511
Convergence losing their

451
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,279
Shorts

452
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,047
Mumbai

453
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,839
Billions of dollars a year

454
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,119
Two consulting firms

455
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:14,751
Drewry NC intelligence estimated 2016 shipping industry losses at 8

456
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:17,311
Maybe 10 billion.

457
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,847
Nissan dealerships

458
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,895
150 million dollars

459
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,175
So you have a big old invest

460
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,199
And

461
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:25,247
United making money you're going to

462
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,271
Paula Stern

463
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:28,063
How do you stay in business

464
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,343
I seriously don't know

465
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,415
How they got to this point

466
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,183
Was

467
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,207
Mirrors

468
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:34,975
Twitches

469
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:35,743
The biggest

470
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,047
Shipping Company the world are Danish

471
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,351
Decided to build

472
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,631
Ships that work

473
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,655
Twice as big

474
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:44,191
As as all the other ones

475
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:51,103
Nazca Lines New Tripoli class will be the world's largest ships a record 400m

476
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:57,503
As long as 59 meters wide Triple E stands for Energy Efficiency

477
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,551
Environmental performance

478
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:06,207
A bunch of Shipping Lines followed Maris lead and building mega mega mega show

479
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:09,279
This creature is Spike in available shipping Supply

480
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,815
The man did not

481
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:11,839
Follow suit

482
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,375
So you might expect

483
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:14,655
Prices have

484
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,423
Plummeted

485
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,263
That's really really cheap shipping for people importing exporting

486
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:20,799
Historically

487
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:24,895
The Journal of Commerce says that it cost about 18 hundred or two thousand bucks

488
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,943
To ship a box across the Pacific

489
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:31,551
Right now the price for a big retailer is more like seven or eight hundred

490
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,343
If you're making

491
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:36,671
Brake pads and pantyhose and toothbrushes in China

492
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:38,463
UShip animal versus Nebraska

493
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,511
They're going to get shipped

494
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,791
Somebody's going to ship them

495
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:44,095
In the shipping companies are really

496
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,167
And that means they become desperate

497
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,447
Somehow survive

498
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,471
They're scared

499
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,031
The number 7 in the world

500
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:58,431
Went bankrupt apply for bankruptcy protection

501
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:02,015
Your calls means less revenue for all the companies that service ships

502
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:02,783
Coming in

503
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,831
Industries getting tougher

504
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,111
Suffer to survive in

505
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,647
No slack left

506
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,415
System

507
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,975
The local companies that respond with

508
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:12,255
Consolidation themselves

509
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:16,095
Antonym for example was purchased by the Marine Resources Group

510
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:21,471
Which became fast Marine which is owned by the seattle-based salt check resources Incorporated

511
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:24,031
A conglomerate that controls 30 logistic

512
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:24,799
6 businesses

513
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:27,359
Everybody needs some bigger entity

514
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,127
Protection

515
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:31,711
And that was before Donald Trump started at least

516
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:35,039
Talking about its so-called America First Trade policy

517
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:38,111
In which presumably more things are made in the United States

518
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:40,415
Unless things are made in Asia

519
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:43,231
If you've already got too much shipping capacity

520
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:43,999
3 out of the ocean

521
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:47,327
Let me USMLE start importing fewer things

522
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:50,399
That could send an already stress industry

523
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,679
Into implosive

524
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:52,447
Decline

525
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,239
And the blast radius

526
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,775
Extend far beyond

527
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,055
The West Coast ports

528
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,847
12%

529
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,127
Of US GDP

530
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:06,015
Roughly 2 trillion dollars worth of the economy is dependent on Goods flowing through the West

531
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:11,135
With that and you're literally gambling with the national economy

532
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,183
And yet

533
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:15,231
Little Maritime businesses Soldier on

534
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,255
Doing the work

535
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:17,791
Despite the corporate

536
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:20,095
Squeeze and the Darkness on the horizon

537
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:22,399
Just like all the rest of the companies

538
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,423
And unions

539
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,215
Make the supply chain go

540
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:28,287
Every time a ship comes in this like putting on a wedding

541
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,311
When you've got

542
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:31,615
A myriad of details

543
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,895
And you forget one

544
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:33,919
And

545
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,455
It's just

546
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,223
Awful

547
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:40,319
You got to notify the Coast Guard and Order of Longshore Gangsta unload ships and

548
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:42,623
Line handlers to tie the big boat up

549
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,671
Tugboats in a bar pilot

550
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:47,743
Pilot the cargo ship into the bay dressing movements

551
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:48,767
The Tugs

552
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:50,047
Bishop shows up

553
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:54,143
12 miles west of the Golden Gate Bridge a pilot will board

554
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,935
And take it in

555
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:58,495
2 into the bay all the way to its birth

556
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:02,591
Learn about the business I wanted to see what the actual work was

557
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,639
I just work get accomplished

558
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:06,175
What's a tugboat do

559
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:10,271
And he got me in a boat called the Patricia Ann

560
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:13,343
Will is the skipper of the Patricia Ann

561
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:18,208
Our job for the afternoon is to guide a medium sized container ship called the cap Palliser

562
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:20,512
Off the dock and out of the Oakland shipping channel

563
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:24,096
It's tied up at Birth 59 of the Oakland Container Terminal

564
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:27,168
It's a pretty standard to Tugboat job

565
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:33,568
We'll be pulling it off the dock taking it up to the Turning Basin turning Basin spinning it around and

566
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:39,968
Pipe getting released somewhere along the Inner Harbor

567
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:46,368
Ship up here by the stand

568
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,136
The industry

569
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:47,904
It is

570
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,672
Enormous

571
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:50,208
By any other standard

572
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,328
We cruised past the cat Palliser and we'll Snuggles the tug up against the dock to await orders

573
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,120
Waiting for the call

574
00:21:57,632 --> 00:22:00,448
We look at it the big Oakland International Container Terminal

575
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:03,008
One of the busiest terminals on the West Coast

576
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:07,360
There's stacks of boxes bearing the name of the big Shipping Lines

577
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,384
Maersk

578
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,408
MSC

579
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:11,712
CMA CGM APL

580
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,480
Costco

581
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:17,600
It used to be that individual lines operated ships and their own terminals

582
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:21,184
Now what it called stevedoring companies run these places

583
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:25,536
Leasing the land in the Port of Oakland and servicing a bunch of different ship lines

584
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:32,192
This particular one is run by SSA stevedoring Services of America the guys unloading the ships are all members

585
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:34,496
ILWU the Longshore Union

586
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:36,800
What was looking out at

587
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:40,640
Is it huge and highly diverse slice of the working class

588
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:47,040
Call Doug

589
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:53,440
Angotti and good afternoon

590
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:08,800
And Patty so wanted to turn will have you a question on the four battle once we make art

591
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:15,200
We have a line on our tag that attaches to a line on the ship container ship

592
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:18,528
The tug stays attached on these ropes

593
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:19,808
Very very strong

594
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,600
Peanut partially woven

595
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:22,368
Kevlar

596
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:29,024
Once this line gets up we'll get receive a signal and then what I'll do is I'll come back and push on the side of the ship so that they

597
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:35,424
Taking the lines in the ship will still be pressed up against

598
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:41,824
Longshoreman release the lines I'm sure to keep the ship from bobbing around

599
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:48,224
You often see tugboats in this position Fresh Step at a 90 degree angle to the ships are about to work

600
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:54,624
Now it's time to start pulling a cat Palace or off the dock

601
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:01,024
Easy way Packaging

602
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:07,424
It happens almost imperceptibly the ship is so huge and it moves so slow

603
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:13,824
Slowly and smoothly and it was so calm that was not actually sure what was going

604
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:26,624
Ship off the dock we power down to What's called the turning Basin the wide area of the shipping channel

605
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:33,024
Spin the container ship turned around to exit the bay into the Pacific Ocean

606
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:39,424
We pushing from the other side of this massive ship causing it to spin like a revolving door

607
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:52,224
Daddy

608
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:58,624
Incredible moment being right up against this thing

609
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:05,024
Crunch more or something to really feel like we were muscling it but it doesn't

610
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:11,424
Sound of metal straining Pawtucket hardly seems to move the water simply Parts in the wall

611
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:17,824
All of metal looming above us rotates the last

612
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:24,224
Get a ride alongside the ship as we head out the tugs active brakes to the big ship doesn't get going too fast

613
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:30,624
We're going alongside right now so some OC ships that are like if you put it in

614
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,744
Terms of a car their first year is like eight knots for 9 knots

615
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,608
So that's only 9 or 10 miles per hour that kind of speed and an arrow shipping channel

616
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:43,168
Can rock the other ships alongside the dock

617
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:49,568
Damaging them to the tugs dragged backwards on airlines

618
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:55,968
Stop and dry patio released to go home to take our line in

619
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:06,208
A couple of hours the most of the action takes place in just a few moments

620
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:11,072
Soon

621
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:12,096
We're back at the dock

622
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,192
The truck to begin streaming into pick up containers from another big ship

623
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,472
That come to shore

624
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,800
What bigger ships mean less business for the tugboats

625
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,080
It also put pressure

626
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:23,104
On the truckers

627
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:26,176
As a whole they need to pick up more boxes

628
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:28,480
And they still only have the same amount of time about

629
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:29,248
4 days

630
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,552
Clear the containers out of the terminal

631
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:34,368
That creates a bigger trucker demand Spike

632
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:36,160
Causing congestion around the court

633
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:37,696
In other words

634
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:38,976
If you were bigger ships

635
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,768
Makes the water to empty

636
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:41,792
In the land

637
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:42,816
Too crowded

638
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,144
Who is Sharon Oakland

639
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:49,728
Some places have done very well in the mega ship error

640
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:52,544
In general the China One port

641
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,568
Has been increasing

642
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,592
Centralization

643
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:56,384
So

644
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,664
Imagine a map of the world

645
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,200
Wood lines connecting differ

646
00:26:59,456 --> 00:26:59,968
Imports

647
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:04,064
In the sickness of the line represents how much stuff gets shipped along that route

648
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,856
In a free container day

649
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,928
Should be lots of skinny lines going all over the place

650
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:12,000
Is containerization too cold in 1970s

651
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:15,072
And later China enter the WTO in the 90s

652
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,608
The lines connecting China

653
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:19,168
To a few ports on the west coast get really fat

654
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,960
Swallowing up other trade

655
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,520
The way it played out in the US

656
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:25,056
Is it the San Pedro Bay

657
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:29,152
Which is were the competing but connected ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles are located

658
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,944
Begin to dominate everyone

659
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:35,552
In 2015 for example these two Port handled 78%

660
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:38,112
Are the import containers along the west coast

661
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,648
All the West

662
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:40,416
Sky Sports

663
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:42,720
62% Imports came from China

664
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:44,512
Dinner 50%

665
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:48,352
All the import trade from Asia to the West Coast is just running back and forth

666
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,632
From San Pedro Bay

667
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:50,400
China

668
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,752
I end up talking all this over in a conversation with Tim Wong

669
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:59,104
Berkley educated lawyer and local polymath who published the container gajda

670
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,920
Wonderful little book on the shipping industry disguised as

671
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:02,688
The Dockside

672
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:04,224
Companion to spotting boxes

673
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:05,760
Imports

674
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,040
Azan ships he said

675
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:09,088
Everything has become a lot size

676
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:09,856
Efficiency

677
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:14,720
Can you get big enough to stay alive and keep your whole Maritime business ecosystem healthy

678
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,768
Oakland was able to survive for

679
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:17,536
Period of time

680
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:19,072
Technology gets better

681
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,888
The cost of choosing one poor or

682
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,424
On

683
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,192
The Western

684
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:27,264
Rat the office

685
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:29,568
I'm in the same trouble that's happened

686
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,592
With the Container company

687
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,664
Where they're basically selling

688
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,432
Commodity

689
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,968
Which always is dropping

690
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,064
Overproduce capacity

691
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,600
In ways that completely

692
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:42,368
Lee Drive everybody

693
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,672
Or make it so that only the large

694
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:45,440
Just company thickens

695
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:47,232
Jaime pennies out of

696
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:49,280
You know huge numbers of transaction

697
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,304
Actually can survive

698
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,352
And I wonder you know food

699
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,632
Accurate time basically

700
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:54,400
Geography

701
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:56,704
Esports

702
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,752
Backin it up all the smaller Regional One

703
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:00,800
Much larger

704
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,592
But as both get

705
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:04,384
You know more efficient

706
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:05,664
Way they move

707
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,432
Suddenly

708
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:07,456
They basic

709
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:08,736
Pee on the same footing with

710
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:10,528
Sports

711
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:12,576
Ends in there than geography

712
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:13,344
Does it help you anymore

713
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,392
Like what we're really trying to help you with

714
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:16,928
Can you really scallop

715
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:19,232
Maybe Oakland

716
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,000
Expanse

717
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,072
Across the world

718
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:26,912
More and more businesses centralizing if fewer and fewer ports

719
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:31,776
Anything need to maintain the whole ecosystem of services like tug boats and all that stuff

720
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,872
The import game is never going to be that much bigger for Oakland at this point

721
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,944
But they might be able to scale up their exports

722
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:41,504
That's because geography remains important

723
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:44,832
Think of it almost like a watershed for cargo

724
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:45,600
A cargo ship

725
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:46,624
If you will

726
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:48,928
Oakland naturally drains

727
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:50,208
The whole Central Valley

728
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:52,512
Not to mention Napa and Sonoma

729
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:54,816
Which are some of the most important agricultural region

730
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:55,584
Country

731
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,864
So the port officials

732
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,912
Want to expand on that strength

733
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:01,472
Building a huge refrigerated facility

734
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:05,056
That would allow Midwestern meat producers to put their pork on a train

735
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,848
Isn't it all the way to the ocean

736
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:07,616
Teleport

737
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,384
From there

738
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,664
It shipped out to China

739
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:11,712
You end up with this capitalist

740
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:12,992
Virtuous circle
