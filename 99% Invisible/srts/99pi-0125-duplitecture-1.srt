Also really large-scale imitations

30
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,400
Like fake Apple stores that are so dead on

31
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:44,192
Can employees of the store

Venice's with complete canals in replicas of the Doge's Palace

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,856
Developments are actually living breathing Community is where Chinese families are raising their children

70
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,136
Living out their lives

71
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,416
The place that looks like orange

Dior Paris but a smack dab in the middle of the

73
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:17,120
These buildings are not just novelty is like that pyramid or the Eiffel Tower in Las Vegas

74
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,144
The biggest

75
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,680
Property developer

76
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:20,704
In China told me

77
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,728
2/3

78
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,520
Are there residential development

79
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:24,544
Are being built in

80
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,568
European style

81
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:31,968
Nor they like American Chinatown their German towns which were established by immigrants

82
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:34,528
An American or European style buildings

83
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:37,856
Which are often designed by Chinese architects

84
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,160
Visiting China

85
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:42,720
Copy of Paris on the outskirts

86
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,024
I found a place

87
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,072
In some ways was very emblematic

88
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,376
Paris with the Eiffel Tower

89
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,144
Square

90
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,192
But there was no new

91
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:59,104
Meaning the Chinese were interested in duplicating the newer buildings parents just the old classic looking ones that

92
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,896
That are iconic of the city

93
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,688
At the same time this is

94
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,968
Really easy

95
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:06,528
Most brand-new sparkling Paris I've ever

96
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:20,351
Even though these are intended to be copies it's pretty much impossible to pop a building onto a completely new environment without modifying

97
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,887
A little or a lot

98
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,423
Oven time for duplexer

99
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,447
Is

100
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,471
Larger

101
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,263
Or smaller than the real thing

102
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:31,615
Or different elements or features might be bloated bigger than others

103
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:36,991
Sometimes two protector get so twisted and warped until it's a freakish caricature of the original

104
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,527
One of the

105
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,807
Chris Sanders

106
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:40,831
Architectural

107
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,135
Has been the creation of

108
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,671
Mega high-rises

109
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:47,999
That are built in a baroque or near

110
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,815
Picture of Versailles stretched

111
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:51,839
20 floors

112
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,631
The air and you'll have some ID

113
00:04:55,423 --> 00:05:01,567
Developers can take a lot of liberties with to protector construction like making the replicas work in accordance with Feng Shui

114
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,591
But nevertheless

115
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,151
A lot of these duplicate or compound

116
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:11,551
Have rules that actively discourage any type of modification that they think might subvert the simulacrum

117
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:14,367
They're very strict rules in place to ensure that

118
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,927
Chinese elements are formed elements

119
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:17,951
Don't crop in

120
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:21,023
And spoil the impression of other Paris

121
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,119
The European

122
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,655
CEO of this development

123
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:29,983
No hanging laundry outside

124
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,775
Installing air conditioner

125
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,543
Keeping

126
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,823
Chickens in the backyard

127
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:38,943
To further create the impression of Paris there might be a French bakery or a Bastille Day celebration

128
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,807
There might be a pub in an Irish town or real Canal Network in a knockoff Venice

129
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:47,647
Azan and uncanny as these building that communities can be

130
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,951
Do protector is pretty impressive

131
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,743
These buildings go up

132
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:56,095
Quickly on a massive scale and they show no signs of stopping

133
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:59,679
Baskets on new development popping up around China all the time

134
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:02,495
The Protector is not exactly a new trend

135
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,031
They have a lot of practice

136
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07,615
In pre-modern China you had China's

137
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,895
Imperial ruler is he

138
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,431
Copycat

139
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:12,223
Buildings as a way of showing off

140
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:14,527
Their power and establishing their

141
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,295
Authority

142
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,831
The third Century BC

143
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,367
One of the rulers showed off

144
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,135
His Conquest

145
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,231
Kingdom by recreating their buildings

146
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:31,679
You also had Imperial hunting parks where would import Flora and Fauna of all kinds

147
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,983
Stone Landscapes within their own domain

148
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:39,359
Isn't real rulers would copy as a way of showing that they could literally move Heaven and Earth

149
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,895
They now possess

150
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,175
This foreign

151
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:42,943
Building

152
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,967
Or place

153
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,991
It was there

154
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:51,391
And even without tradition one of the most copied buildings in China is the very seat of Western power itself

155
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,463
The White House is generally credited

156
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:55,743
Demos

157
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:56,767
Copied

158
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,047
Building

159
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,839
An excuse for everything

160
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,607
From

161
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,655
Hotels to restaurants to

162
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:03,935
Courthouses

163
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:04,703
2

164
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:08,287
Just like the White House has a China collection

165
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,311
China

166
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,847
Has a White House Collection

167
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:16,479
The different Chinese white houses serve different purposes so they morphed into various permutations

168
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:23,135
But they all have those signature columns and square Portico built in the true blue Unique Style holy

169
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,927
Original to the US of a

170
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,207
I hate to break it to everyone

171
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,487
That's not

172
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:29,023
Original building

173
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,095
What's the white

174
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:34,143
Phases design

175
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,447
Huge

176
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:38,239
Building in Dublin

177
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,519
That is now the

178
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:40,799
Of

179
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,335
Parliament of Ireland

180
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:48,479
Arousing Dublin elements of classical Greek and Roman architecture

181
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,527
And it pretty much looks like the White House

182
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,807
Even though it's kind of Grey

183
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:52,831
Instagram

184
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:55,135
The founding fathers were really into

185
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,671
2 dupli textured as well

186
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:59,487
They were their own form of architectural plagiarize

187
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:04,095
And this is so obvious have you ever seen the buildings at Thomas Jefferson designed

188
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:10,495
They're also covered in columns eBay's the Virginia state capitol on this ancient Roman Temple and that design intern

189
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:16,639
