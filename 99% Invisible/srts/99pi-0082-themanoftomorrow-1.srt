I'm Roman Mars

23
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:58,272
I'm willing to concede from the get-go that I might be wrong about the entire premise of the story

24
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:02,112
But Superman has never really worked for me as a character

25
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:05,952
I prefer the more grounded Marvel comic book characters like

26
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,512
Spider-Man who lived in real cities

27
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:10,560
And human thoughts and feelings

28
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,608
Superman is basically

29
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,888
Invincible

30
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,168

Establishment

34
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:25,408
And even though I really love the first Christopher Reeve Superman movie

35
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,760
It contains a perfect example of why I don't really dig the character

36

The business a twenty-five-year-old spoiler alert but at the end of the 1978 movie

37
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:40,768
All the greatness of that film is nearly undone by the fundamental flaw of having a character that is all

38
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,560
Powerful than Superman

39
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,096
Flies around the Earth

40
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,120
Backwards

41
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,400
And turns back

00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,168
Time

43
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,520
Person got to get clear is that he's not share

44
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,312
He doesn't turn back time

45
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,944
Superman one that's Glen Weldon father of Superman the unauthorized biography

46
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:01,248
Grasping for an explanation

47

Travels in time

50
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,696
So that's exactly what he's doing except he's just spinning round and round

51
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,024
So the reason everything goes

52
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:13,792
Backwards

53
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,072
He's not because he's actually

54
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,608
Spinning your ass backwards on it

55
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,144
Axis making time go

56
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,936
We're just watching

57
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,216
Kim travel back

58
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,008
In time we're seeing it through his eye

59
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,288
So that's what

60
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:29,152
What's going on this is my Wackadoo series that I'm going to a standby

61
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,688
Fork friendly

62
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,760
Despite the fact that there's some stuff in the in the movie that kind of

63
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:34,528
Contradict

64
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:40,928
I still plugged for this music that I'm talking over is from the Superman movie soundtrack you know what it's called it's called

65
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,976
Turning back the world

66
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,864
I'm teasing Glen Weldon because I feel like I know him because in addition to being

67
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,912
The unauthorized biography for a Superman

68
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:55,520
He's also a panelist on NPR's pop culture Happy Hour podcast which is

69
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,568
Great it comes out on Friday

70
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,848
I listen to it

71
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,128
Friday

72
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:04,992
So I got in touch with Clan because I thought if I can appreciate Superman as a character

73
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,040
Maybe I can appreciate him

74
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,320
As a design

75
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,392
A supremely successful design

76
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:15,232
And the first thing Glenn told me is that I need to dispense with this notion

77
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,256
That's Superman

78
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,791
Should be relatable

79
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,583
The thing you have to understand about Superman

80
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,607
Is that he was

81
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:21,887
Never intended

82
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:24,191
The character that we identify with

83
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,471
He's not a hero like Batman

84
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,007
Set a hero like Spiderman

85
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:27,775
Man who have

86
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,335
Psychological Hang-Ups that we recognize

87
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,103
Empathize

88
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,383
He's not the hero

89
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,919
We identify with

90
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:34,943
He's the hero

91
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:35,967
We believe in

92
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,783
Different he's an inspiration he supposed to be

93
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,551
Better than us

94
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:40,831
That's right there in the name

95
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,623
Movie called Superman for a reason

96
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,671
He exists to say

97
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,975
We can be better we can achieve these eyes

98
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:47,743
Ideals

99
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:53,887
There are so many things that the creators of Superman Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster

100
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:58,751
Got right in the design is Superman from the very beginning the first thing they got right

101
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,287
Was being first

102
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,823
1st and Market

103
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:05,151
It difficult to pinpoint which character qualifies as the first

104
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,175
Superhero

105
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:09,759
Yoga Master Hercules or the Phantom or the clock

106
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,807
It's worth looking into the clock

107
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,599
But Superman is certainly

108
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,135
The first of a type

109
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:19,487
The dominated popular culture from the moment he debuted in 1938

110
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,023
Any idea

111
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,047
Was simple

112
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:25,375
Well he was created to be basically a circus strongman

113
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,143
What's that word

114
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,167
Design the costumes

115
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:31,519
And that's what Siegel and Shuster intended he was just like us

116
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,543
Only

117
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,079
Bigger stronger

118
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,639
Better so he could do everything that we could do

119
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,663
You only do it

120
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,455
More that's where the Superman ID

121
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,039
It's very simple that's why this character stuck around

122
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,831
Cuz the iconography of simple

123
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:49,183
Red blue and yellow even the color blind can see red blue and yellow that's that's important

124
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,999
You have to keep everything about this character as simple as possible

125
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,023
Couldn't fly at the

126
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,071
He denied any of the other sensory

127
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:59,679
He was at the guy that Siegel and Shuster would drop into the middle of a scene

128
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:00,959
With a bunch of fog

129
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,519
And they would try to attack him and he would shrug them off

130
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:06,335
This was the engine of the story this is where the

131
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,359
The adventures

132
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,383
Funnel

133
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,663
Those early stories came from

134
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,711
Just him showing over and over again

135
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:12,991
That he was wrong

136
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:17,087
Thundamentals Siegel and Shuster

137
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:20,415
Nailed it they did they created something great

138
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,439
And everyone knew it

139
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,231
Read Superman endured

140
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:26,047
They had this fantastic public R&D.

141
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,583
They just keep upping the ante

142
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:28,607
They kept making

143
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,375
Bigger

144
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,143
And more powerful

145
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:34,239
Started throwing in all these other

146
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:35,519
Door trying to

147
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,823
Mission trying throwing all these other powers

148
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,151
Song which really didn't

149
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,431
One of the first

150
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,455
Weird

151
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,735
Powers he had early on

152
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:47,551
Was the ability to contort the muscles

153
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,319
Look as face

154
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:52,415
To change his appearance and pass himself off as somebody else

155
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,463
Now that doesn't Square

156
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,487
With the iconography

157
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,023
Hi who's really

158
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,303
Better than you can just

159
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,327
What we can do

160
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,351
Only more

161
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,631
It went away

162
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:04,447
Because it's not the power of a superhero That's The Power of a

163
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,263
Adopting somebody else

164
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,031
Disguise

165
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:08,799
Can go undercover

166
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,591
It's not that doesn't square with

167
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:14,943
And when you have powerful enough iconography you can make mistakes like that

168
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,991
And it doesn't have a lasting effect

169
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,271
The other powers

170
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,063
Are things like

171
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,087
Super hearing

172
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:22,623
Super

173
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,647
Vision diesel

174
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,695
And telescopic Vision x-ray vision these things

175
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,719
Are about

176
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,255
Traits that we possess

177
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,023
That just

178
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:29,791
Skip boost

179
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:30,559
That's what the

180
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,327
Is characters about

181
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:35,167
Later on the course we get things like super hypnotism

182
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,703
Man super ventriloquism

183
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,751
Products of an age

184
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:41,055
Of comics, Superman

185
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,591
When things got really

186
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:45,919
Happens to be my favorite era of this character

187
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,711
Because things just get bananas

188
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,479
And

189
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,783
Superman has become so powerful

190
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,343
That the focus starts to shift away from

191
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,623
12 Lois Lane

192
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,671
The people around him

193
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:57,695
Superdawg

194
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,231
Super Monkey the super cat

195
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:01,023
Super horse all these other things around

196
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:01,791
Can you become to the

197
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,071
Patriarch of this

198
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,095
Extended family

199
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,631
Of people in blue long john

200
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:11,775
But beyond the comic book superfan none of that stuff filter too far out into popular culture and stuck around

201
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:14,335
The one power that they develop later

202
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:17,663
I got folded into the very core of the character

203
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,687
Was flight

204
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,967
Original you could just jump around

205
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:23,039
Turn on the page that's fine you see him in mid-air

206
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,343
But as soon as the Fleischer animated shorts

207
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,391
The very first couple

208
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,159
He jumps around

209
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,695
And it looks

210
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,023
It just doesn't work

211
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,559
So very soon

212
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:38,399
In on the radio show you know the sound of him jumping around

213
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,935
Suspended sound of

214
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,703
Wind noise

215
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,983
It was clear

216
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,263
Flying through the air

217
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,031
Defying Gravity

218
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,335
And that's what happened in the Flasher

219
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,383
Bridge of the comics a long time

220
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,919
To agree that y'all cake

221
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,455
Because

222
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:54,015
Beat the thing you could do was be better than us

223
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:57,599
But this idea of somebody being able to hover in mid-air

224
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,391
Was just too much of a break

225
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,183
From from the kind of

226
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:01,951
Grounded

227
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,231
Grounded stories

228
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,255
Matt Siegel intrusive

229
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,023
Retallack

230
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,303
But once he did

231
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,863
Once he did become a

232
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,631
A capable of

233
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,911
Flying Defying Gravity

234
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,543
You will believe a man can fly

235
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,335
Because there's something Primal about

236
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,103
That there's something that

237
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:22,175
Man is always wanted to do and so we got this guy

238
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,455
Can bring it along.

239
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,479
Unemployment

240
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,527
You can do it and that's what we looked

241
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:27,807
Recognize

242
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,855
Now today but it wasn't always the case

243
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,815
As you go to the history of Superman England weldon's book

244
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:42,655
You find a character that adapts in strange ways to reflect

245
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,471
The Zeitgeist and anxieties of the time

246
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:48,543
But certain qualities get written into Superman zna

247
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,615
The phone the real basis of what makes Superman

248
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,639
Superman

249
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:55,199
And it has nothing to do with the way he looks

250
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:57,503
Ultimately what I found over the course of the

251
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,575
Writing a book is that a lot of the stuff comes and goes

252
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:03,647
What's the red shorts can come and go espectro goes away it's comes back

253
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,951
Gets a different costume you gets this

254
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,231
Weird electrical blue

255
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,023
Costume in the 90s everything psycho

256
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:10,815
But

257
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:11,839
It's not what he looks

258
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,887
Even though that is considered the iconography

259
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,167
He looks like

260
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,215
It is what he does

261
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,287
Number one he puts the needs of others

262
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,311
Overdose

263
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,847
And be he does

264
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,639
So those two Elam

265
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,687
Either one of those two elements are missing

266
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,991
Our brain instinctively reject

267
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,527
Don't feel like a Superman

268
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:35,391
Which makes telling compelling and nuanced Superman stories

269
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,415
Pretty difficult

270
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,695
Butwell Nikes

271
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:43,327
And you want is not what Superman is about age where we don't trust altruism

272
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:48,447
That's what he's there for he's there to represent it is there to say

273
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,471
Here's truth

274
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,263
Is what looks like yours just as usual

275
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,543
Looks like your compassion

276
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:53,567
Is a big part of

277
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:58,175
And also you know he's called the man of tomorrow because that's been part of his DNA from the

278
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,967
Beginning of Tomorrow long before

279
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,735

280

Nickname

282
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,063
Because you help

283
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:07,135
Put away the future to say here's what we can be

284

Hughes

285
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,439
If we're better to each other

286
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,975
And better ourselves

287
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,255
Here's what we can do

288
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,303
So that's that
