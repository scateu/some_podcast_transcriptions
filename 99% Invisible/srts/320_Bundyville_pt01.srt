I'm Roman Mars

26
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:35,744
Most of the American West is owned by the federal government about 85% of Nevada

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,840
61% Alaska and 53% of Oregon

28
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:46,240
The list goes on and I've always been questions about how this immense swath of land should be used

29
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,288
Should we allow ranchers to graze cattle

30
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:53,152
What should the western land be a place where wild animals can roam free be protected

31
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:59,808
Or is it land we want to reserve for recreation as you can imagine there is no consensus on the answers to those

32
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:02,624
Questions but there are a lot of strong feelings

33
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,768
And over the years those strong feelings have sometimes bubbled up to the surface and manifested in protest

34
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:10,304
And even violence

35
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,704
In 2016 a group of armed militants occupied malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Western Oregon

36
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,568
They were led by a cattle rancher by the name of Ammon Bundy the son of Cliven Bundy

37
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,848
Perhaps you heard about it

38
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:25,920
Never really understood exactly what it was all about

39
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:32,320
Well today we bring you a story from long reads in Oregon public broadcasting reported by Leah sottile

40
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:38,720
And it's the first in the series they put together that looks deeply into the fascinating and even sometimes wonky details about

41
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,256
How the American West is managed

42
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:42,816
Why the Bundys are so angry about it

43
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:47,168
And the religious ideology that undergirds their fight against the federal government

44
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,520
It's amazing series that spins a good yarn but also resonates

45
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:54,336
So many aspects of current US politics

46
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:57,920
It's also about Land Management but she's really exciting for me personally

47
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,480
This is episode 1 of bundyville

48
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,760
Here's Leah sottile

49
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:09,440
By his own account Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy never wanted to start a war with

50
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,464
The federal government

51
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:16,096
He says that if they just left them alone out here in the desert

52
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,888
This would have ever started

53
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:23,776
If you want to see him as a folksy hero of a modern-day Western

54
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,824
You can choose to see him that way

55
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,176
Here's a good starting point

56
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,224
It's a random YouTube video

57
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,528
Inches a blonde haired little boy

58
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,552
Toddler

59
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,856
He's wearing a Dusty red Polo shirt

60
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:38,880
Blue jeans

61
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,184
Elaine stand in the dirt

62
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,976
Having just been knocked down

63
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,536
He's considering whether or not he wants to cry

64
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:46,816
Help you up

65
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,496
I hope I begs not broke his Cowboy hat-wearing Grandpa

66
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:57,824
Putter's away from Cowboys

67
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:05,504
Please come see how heavy is he got run over by horse and he's out there and going already

68
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:10,112
Nothing to it he says the toddler looks back at his grandpa

69
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,648
Points of the West

70
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,440
In the camera follows

71
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:17,536
Patch of bright green grass comes into view against the Nevada desert

72
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,071
The color of life

73
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,119
It stands out in place

74
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,143
For everything else look

75
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:25,727
Dead This Land is Our Land This land is a free land

76
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:28,543
This land is a place that we can enjoy

77
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,311
And you

78
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:32,127
That's Cliven Bundy as he'd like to be seen

79
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,663
Diesel farmer

80
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,223
Homesteading on a 260 acre ranch

81
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,503
Bunkerville Nevada

82
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,575
2014

83
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,879
Just a few weeks after this video was shot

84
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,671
On the same piece of land

85
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:47,743
Cliven Bundy and his sons were anything but peaceful

86
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,303
Did raise the militia that was

87
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,095
Pointing guns at federal agents

88
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,631
What the Bundys called

89
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,911
Tyrannical government

90
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,471
Siri is onstage in Bunkerville

91
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,775
Whipping the crowd into a frenzy

92
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,823
Demanding that the local sheriff

93
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,639
Bulldoze the buildings nearby National Park

94
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:08,735
Does its surrounding Community might have free reign of the land

95
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,527
UK cronut

96
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:14,623
He says get the county equipment out there

97
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,671
What are those things down this morning

98
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,487
The sheriff Just Dance quietly on stage

99
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:22,047
He's got two stones hitch in his belt

100
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,583
The mob hackleton

101
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:30,495
He has more demands

102
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:34,847
The sheriff also have to disarm the Park Service Rangers

103
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:37,663
Bring me those guns in one hour he says

104
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,431
Where else

105
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:45,855
Luke Bryan Detroit

106
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,439
Depending on how you look at the way this is all played out

107
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,743
Cliven Bundy is either profit

108
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,791
Is leaving his people to Salvation

109
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,327
Percolator

110
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,631
Is lettuce follower straight to jail

111
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:58,655
Even death

112
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,727
How you see Cliven

113
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,775
Message just as much about you

114
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,055
Is it does about the Bundys

115
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:10,943
From longreads in Oregon Public Broadcasting

116
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,479
This is Bundy

117
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:19,135
7 part series about the Bundy family and how they're changing the American West

118
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:25,535
Leah sottile in a 2016 I set out to write a single breaking news story about the Bundy

119
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:31,935
But one story turned into several because every time I learn something new it would just bring it

120
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:38,335
More questions things that seems unbelievable would turn out to be real even when I wasn't

121
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:44,735
Writing I couldn't stop finding new pieces in this really complicated puzzle

122
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:51,135
Most people know roughly what happened in Nevada and Oregon if not this first episode

123
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:57,535
He's going to bring you up to speed and then we're going to dive into all the weird stuff that didn't make it on the Nightly News

124
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:03,935
Only come to light months and years after most people stopped paying attention

125
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:10,335
Because the Bundy story is bigger and Stranger than I expected

126
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:16,735
Forget about facts and laws more than anything else the story of The Bundys is about belief

127
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:23,135
Truth is figuring out which one of those things has more power if you

128
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:29,535
If you believe the Bundys then you believe the federal government is trying to enslave the American people

129
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:35,935
You believe the feds and you believe a remote cattle rancher is a domestic terrorist

130
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:42,335
So did the Bundys on the truth or is that the property of the US government

131
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:48,223
That's what I set out to find

132
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,159
Let's think for a second about all the things in history

133
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:58,975
I've started armed revolt against the government

134
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,511
Food shortages

135
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:01,791
Dictatorship

136
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,839
Widespread corruption

137
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,655
Where do reptiles fit on that list

138
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,727
For Cliven right at the top

139
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,519
Here's Aaron Wise

140
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,567
From the conservation advocacy group

141
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,103
The center for Western priorities

142
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,407
The whole reason that

143
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,199
Cliven Bundy has been

144
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:23,295
Breaking the law and running his cows illegally is because

145
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,575
His cows

146
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:29,695
Posed a danger to the desert tortoise it was an endangered species problem to begin with

147
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,743
Early 1990s

148
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,535
Populations of desert tortoise

149
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,327
Plummeting in the American southwest

150
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:39,167
The tortoises have been around for 15 to 20 million years

151
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:39,935
In the desert

152
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:43,519
But they compete with cattle for what little grass or is to eat out

153
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,823
In cattle usually win

154
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:49,407
In the 90s that land of the tortoise on the endangered

155
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,175
Species list

156
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,503
It's a common story in the West

157
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,295
Endangered species

158
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:58,111
Is threatened by ranching or logging or mining

159
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,207
Regulators and environmental is step in to preserve the animal

160
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,487
The group's go to court

161
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,535
And fight over this one Central Quest

162
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,351
Are the wide open spaces in the West

163
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,399
Meant to support rural communities

164
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,679
Or should they be kept for

165
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:16,799
Historically the people working the land have had to back off

166
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:19,359
Give up resources in old ways of life

167
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,895
Change with the times

168
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:25,247
Certain point the bunnies decided they just weren't going to change

169
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,551
They were done with Federal rules

170
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:32,671
We're in cattle here grazes natural resource office public land

171
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:35,487
And I abide by all of Nevada state law

172
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:39,071
But I don't recognize United States government

173
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,119
Even existing

174
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,423
1948

175
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,263
The bunnies have been growing melons and raising cattle on their hundred and sixty-eight

176
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,055
And for decades

177
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:54,943
The family also paid the federal government for grazing permit so they can legally Ranch on the public land

178
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:55,967
That surrounds the property

179
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:01,855
Nevada ranchers the tortoise listing meant 3-4 months each year that they can

180
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:02,623
Greaser hair

181
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,415
The Cliven Bundy

182
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:07,999
In 1993 he started simply ignoring the ruling

183
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,791
Kept his cows on the land

184
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:14,143
You should know that the rates ranchers pay for grazing are like

185
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,191
$1 per cow each year

186
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,495
Ranchers by the permits because

187
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,031
Land is expensive

188
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:22,079
Majority of land in the West

189
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,615
Is actually federally owned

190
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:28,479
But Aaron Wise says that's one of the things that's Up For Debate in the eyes of the Bundys

191
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:32,831
Whether or not grazing your cattle on a piece of public land gives you any rights

192
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:33,599
To that proper

193
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:38,719
Cliven Bundy believes he is grazing his cows on his land

194
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:43,327
And he's going to claim it's not federal government land it's actually County Land

195
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:49,215
Ranchers in Clark County Nevada or eventually offered buyouts for their grazing permits

196
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,007
Help save the desert tortoise

197
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,055
Nearly all of them took the money

198
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,591
And their permits were retired

199
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,127
Everyone

200
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,407
Cliven Bundy

201
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,527
For more than 20 years

202
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:06,111
He fought in and out of court with the Federal Bureau of Land

203
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,439
You'll hear about the Beyond a lot in this podcast

204
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:13,791
Is the agency that President Truman created after World War II

205
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:16,607
To manage millions of Acres owned by the US government

206
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,399
Most of it in western states

207
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:19,935
The bunny said

208
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,727
That was unconstitutional

209
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:28,639
If you're around the bunnies and their supporters for any amount of time will hand you a pocket-sized copy of the Constitution

210
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,943
And I'll tell you about the favorite part

211
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,223
Article 1

212
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:32,991
Section 8

213
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:39,647
Let me read that lost to you that again this is Article 1 Section 8 Clause 17

214
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:46,303
Now it starts out that says Congress shall have power to Colors called The Enclave clause

215
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:52,191
And it basically says the government needs to get State permission to use land outside of Washington DC

216
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,519
The bunnies claim even when they have that permission

217
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,567
The feds can only build things like forts

218
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,103
Military dockyard

219
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:04,735
The problem with this interpretation is that it completely ignores the rest

220
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,759
The Constitution

221
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,575
There are other Clauses and long settled

222
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,599
Supreme Court cases

223
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:12,415
The government definitely can own land

224
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:20,095
We'll get into that later but it's also important to know that the other ingredient here is Sovereign citizen ideology

225
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:24,703
Sovereign citizens believe they are independent nations unto themselves

226
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,751
And when you're your own Nation

227
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,055
You don't have to abide by the country's laws

228
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:32,127
Federal courts aren't valid federal judges

229
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,407
Aren't real judges

230
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,431
Things like

231
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,503
Federal agencies

232
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,527
Don't apply to you

233
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,623
Cliven and Son Ryan

234
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,159
They flirt with these ideas

235
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,719
They don't recognize the US Justice

236
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,487
System

237
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:53,887
Cars and spent two decades in court fighting over his interpretation of this clause

238
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,423
Few people have even heard of

239
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:56,959
All the while

240
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:57,983
Is cattle grazed

241
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:00,799
Far far beyond his property on public land

242
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,847
Which belong to everyone

243
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:05,663
The cattle grazing so far from the ranch

244
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,223
Official surveyed his cows

245
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,271
They found lots of them are feral

246
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,831
Some didn't even have a brand

247
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:15,391
They were probably born wild

248
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,743
These fights over endangered species in land use

249
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,535
I've been going on for a long time

250
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,071
For two decades

251
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:25,119
Funny fart about those things in court

252
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,911
You just kept losing

253
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,959
By 2014

254
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:32,799
The government said Cliven had racked up more than a million dollars in fees

255
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,847
Funny cide differently

256
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:40,479
I would be happy to pay my grazing fees if I owed old grazing fees to the proper government

257
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:44,319
That brings us to the point of who does own this land

258
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,623
How does the federal government own

259
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:49,439
90% of the state of Nevada

260
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:52,255
I thought we were sovereign state

261
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:55,071
Buy I'm the manager of this land

262
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:57,119
Because of my my ride

263
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:01,471
Record says Cliven Bundy is trespassing on United States

264
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,239
Property

265
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,263
Just an aside

266
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,079
Cliven often refers to himself in the third person

267
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:10,431
Is this idea of trespassing that really set him off

268
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:14,015
Because he was giving this interview in 2014

269
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,575
Federal agents were indeed Staffing up

270
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,111
To take his cattle as payment

271
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,391
For his backlog of feet

272
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,951
Who is the trespasser

273
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,743
Who's the one out here with

274
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,047
200

275
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,583
Arms agency

276
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:31,935
Drowning my home in my rank import of

277
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:37,567
Courts of Clark County is Cliven Bundy doing those things or is the United States government doing these days

278
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,615
That was his Breaking Point

279
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,919
He refused to give them a towels

280
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:44,735
And I have spent 20 years

281
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:51,391
Legally clinically in the media and now it's time to get on the bar boots and I guess

282
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,415
Lakers fan

283
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:58,047
The bunny never publicly calls for an armed standoff implies that's his only option

284
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:02,399
It seem like it's down to We the People is if we're going to get it done

285
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:05,215
Building things like Malaysia

286
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:12,127
No I haven't called or anything like that but hey it looks like it's about let's go where at

287
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:18,527
By this point it was April 2014 and the Bureau of Land Management was coming to get clivens cattle off the land

288
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,807
Once and for all

289
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:27,487
People from across the country with all kinds of grapes with the government it picked up in the Bundy story through right-wing media

290
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:30,815
Many of them didn't know the first thing about raising livestock

291
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,863
They were just looking for a fight

292
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:40,031
One of them is James Yeager

293
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:43,615
About a year earlier a video he posted got a lot of

294
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,383
Attention

295
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,943
He was angry at the Obama Administration

296
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:53,343
Over proposed ban on assault rifles

297
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,983
These are the type of people who start flocking to Bunkerville

298
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,775
Jaeger became 105 in

299
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,055
Personal bodyguards

300
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:18,687
About 5 days after BLM agent showed up on Clements Ranch

301
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:20,479
There was really chaotic

302
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:23,807
They're protesters yelling at BLM agents

303
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,343
Agent of dogs

304
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,903
They're trying to let some trucks through the crowd

305
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,183
When all help

306
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,207
Breaks loose

307
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:39,423
What agent causes an older woman on the ground

308
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:42,751
And then all of a sudden Cliven son Dam and speeds up on Annie

309
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:43,519
ETV

310
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:48,383
Stop sit in front of the truck

311
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,407
Gets out

312
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,199
Trades words with the agents

313
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,991
Dog Snapchat in

314
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:53,759
Etekcity

315
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,551
Agent teaser

316
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:00,415
Kid rips out the taser prongs

317
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:02,719
It keeps yelling

318
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,959
That video goes viral

319
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,751
And it brings even more protests

320
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:15,775
Bunny Ranch

321
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,591
It's helped Along by this network

322
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,383
Right-wing YouTubers and bloggers

323
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:24,223
They're inciting their followers and in some cases telling them

324
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,759
Bring even more guns

325
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:26,527
The desert

326
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,807
Again I'm going to say it again

327
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:31,903
Anyone in the general vicinity you can get the Clark County Nevada

328
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:35,999
And show some support for our US Constitution our sovereignty

329
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,303
And stand in the face of tyranny

330
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,327
Nspl

331
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,655
Pressure mounts on the government to avoid a potential shootout

332
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:46,239
The further people the fact that there could be a shootout

333
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,543
I guess I'm driving toward Nevada

334
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:51,103
Malicious like the three percenters

335
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,151
The Oath Keepers assemble at the ranch

336
00:17:55,199 --> 00:18:00,831
2 days after that video was shot Albanese cows in a pain underneath interstate

337
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,623
15 few miles from the ranch

338
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:10,047
People hop in their trucks and speed a couple of miles away toward the cattle

339
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:13,887
Mel Bundy is there on horseback

340
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,127
Holding the animals are surrounded

341
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,663
Avenue overpass

342
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,223
They're people pointing sniper rifles at them

343
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,527
Bunch of Clive & Sons

344
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:32,575
M&L Ryan

345
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:33,855
Are there two

346
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:36,415
They're telling me agents to let the cows go

347
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:40,255
And they do

348
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:44,607
Down along the banks of the lawn

349
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:51,775
There's video showing a group of people riding horses

350
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,567
Turn the American flag

351
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,871
Hurting Clements cattle back to the ranch

352
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:58,175
Ryan Bundy climbs a light pole

353
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,199
Endless hat

354
00:18:59,455 --> 00:18:59,967
Sky

355
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:13,535
You might think the feds would bring charges in the days and weeks after the standoff

356
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,351
The bunnies had to fight a court order

357
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:18,399
Pointing guns at federal agents

358
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,447
But the government doesn't

359
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,727
They just leave

360
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,287
In the bunnies get what they wanted

361
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,103
Not by court rulings by compromising

362
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,407
The one by playing cowboy

363
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,687
Bringing bigger

364
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:34,783
And Morgan's to shoot out at the crowd it was like the old west

365
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,575
Where the Outlaws

366
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:38,367
Told everyone they were the heroes

367
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:42,975
And soon in the desert of Eastern Oregon they tried again

368
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:46,815
But this time the feds would be the ones pointing the weapons

369
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:57,055
Burns Oregon is a real sneeze and you'll miss it town in the remote Southeastern part of the

370
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,359
There's a grocery store

371
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,383
Some restaurants

372
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,663
A motel or two

373
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:04,223
People who live there drive 2 hours

374
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:04,991
To go to the mall

375
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,015
Costco

376
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,575
Everybody knows everybody and burn

377
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:11,135
They notice when Outsiders are in town

378
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,719
So in the bunnies appeared in late 2015

379
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,999
People took notice

380
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:21,887
They came because Ammon Bundy had taken an interest in a local ranching family

381
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,167
AR

382
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,191
Wonderful people

383
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:24,959
They are

384
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,263
Salt-of-the-earth

385
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:31,359
He's talking about Dwight and Steven Hammond

386
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,151
Father and Son Ranchers

387
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,943
Were convicted of setting fires

388
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:37,247
Public lands in the early 2000s

389
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:40,063
Prosecutors tried to get them sent away

390
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,599
For destroying government property

391
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:42,879
Meaning the land

392
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:45,439
Which carries a mandatory jail sentence

393
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:46,463
5 years

394
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:48,255
The judge said no

395
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:50,559
Find the hamster

396
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,327
15 months

397
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,887
Prosecutors weren't happy

398
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,679
They appealed the ruling

399
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:57,727
In January 2016

400
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,519
Cynthia Hammonds back to jail

401
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,543
Falafel fiber

402
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:03,615
Hundreds of people and burns were upset

403
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:06,431
All the March through town in support of the Hammond

404
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,759
They saw the burn as an effort to protect their property

405
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,039
The wildfires

406
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,063
Rage across the West

407
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:12,831
Beach summer

408
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,367
The FED said

409
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:17,952
One of the fires was actually started to cover up an illegal deer

410
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,256
Either way

411
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:25,376
Ammon Bundy saw a federal government persecuting a ranching family in order to take their land

412
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:30,752
It's crucial that you understand what's going on here what does he she was truly about

413
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:33,056
It's about our federal government

414
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:36,640
Taking over private property adversely

415
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:41,504
Or using the taxpayers dollars after they ruined the Ranchers

416
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:43,040
To buy it

417
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,600
It was part of a broader conspiracy he said

418
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:47,136
Government run amok

419
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,184
Predators

420
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,488
Any of the day can get control

421
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,536
The land and resources

422
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:56,096
So they can control for example the water

423
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,400
Then they can have

424
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,680
Full control over the people

425
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,752
To Ammon Bundy and his brother Ryan

426
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:04,288
The case was a chance to get cash

427
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:06,080
Controls the land back from the Fed

428
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,384
It was an opportunity to take a

429
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,432
Discontent over the Hammonds

430
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,200
Nurturing

431
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:17,088
After the protest March in Burns Ammon Bundy kinda snowbank in the parking lot

432
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,112
The town's groceries

433
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:25,024
He started making a speech know what's going on here and have seen it for many many many many years

434
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,096
Those who are ready to actually do something about it

435
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:34,496
I'm asking you to follow me and go to the malheur National Wildlife Refuge

436
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,288
We're going to make a hard stand

437
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,568
And that's what they do

438
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:40,128
Ammon Bundy picks up where his father Cliven

439
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:40,896
Left off

440
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:49,088
Under the cover of Darkness the bunnies marched a group of men to the malheur National Wildlife Refuge

441
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,160
The federal bird sanctuary 30 miles from town

442
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,744
They broke into locked buildings at work

443
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,768
Closed for the winter

444
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,352
And they quickly started to tell the media their version of events

445
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:02,656
They claim The Refuge was unlocked

446
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:04,192
And they waltzed right in

447
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:10,080
They said they had more than a hundred and fifty armed men ready to defend the Refuge law enforcement came

448
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:11,616
In reality

449
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:13,408
They only had a couple dozen at most

450
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:16,736
What was in a few days the militias showed up again

451
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:20,832
People from out-of-state flooded the wildlife refuge and dug-in

452
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,880
The band was back together

453
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:25,440
It was Bunkerville in snow

454
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:32,096
The bunnies dared the federal government

455
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,120
Just try to stop them

456
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:35,168
They held daily press conferences

457
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:36,704
Talk about how the government

458
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,728
Can't own land

459
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:42,080
But there were differences from the standoff in Nevada two years earlier

460
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:45,408
Many townspeople didn't buy the Bundy story this

461
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,176
Time

462
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,456
They posted signs

463
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,224
Crossburn

464
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,272
Militia go home

465
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,880
They held meetings asking the sheriff to turn off the power to the Refuge

466
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,160
Mother bunnies freeze

467
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:59,744
When the occupier is called for supplies

468
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,048
People from around the world sent boxes

469
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:02,816
Sex toys

470
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:05,120
This one was really funny and a bag of dicks

471
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:07,680
They called them

472
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,728
Y'all queda on social media

473
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,008
Vanilla Ice

474
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,312
Waist and waste their money on all this

475
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:15,360
People stop to send out here

476
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,640
But the biggest difference

477
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:19,200
Between Oregon and Nevada is at this time

478
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,736
Shots are fired

479
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:26,880
It happens on a remote Oregon Highway 26 days after the occupation started

480
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:29,440
An informant tipped off the feds

481
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:33,280
That the bunnies and other leaders of the Takeover are driving into cars

482
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,560
To nearby town

483
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:37,888
They plan to hold a meeting in the next County over

484
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,168
Lucy the sheriff

485
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,704
Who supported their cause

486
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:45,312
Federal and state law enforcement set up roadblocks

487
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:49,920
Ammon Bundy gives up immediately

488
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:50,688
Gets out

489
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,248
Hands up as Oregon State Police clothes in

490
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:56,576
But the people in the other truck don't give up

491
00:24:57,344 --> 00:25:00,928
Occupation spokesman Robert Lavoy finicum is behind the wheel

492
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:03,488
He was once a model Rancher

493
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:04,768
Paid his grazing fees

494
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:05,792
To the federal government

495
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:09,120
But he converted to bunnies way of seeing things during bunker

496
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:12,960
I'm going to make the chair is waiting for

497
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:15,264
So you do what you damn well please

498
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,544
We're not going anywhere

499
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,920
You bet Dad are you coming out

500
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,736
What does do mean

501
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,856
What you're hearing is a video taken from inside finicums truck during that stop

502
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:32,928
Inside the truck with finicum was Ryan Bundy

503
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,488
19 year old girl named Victoria Sharp

504
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,536
And the person shooting the video

505
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,304
Shawna Cox

506
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,888
Depending on who you ask

507
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,168
What happens next

508
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:45,216
Is either an assassination attempt

509
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:51,872
We're Justified police shooting never have thought he says

510
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:52,640
Patience.

511
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:55,968
Lasers from rifles flash inside the truck

512
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,016
Officer shout to get out

513
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:02,112
It doesn't take long before finnicum hit the breaking point

514
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:12,864
Steps on the gas barrels around the curve Road

515
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:16,192
When he gets the roadblock he swerves at the last minute

516
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:22,848
The vehicle narrowly misses an FBI agent

517
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:27,968
And before the truck is fully stopped

518
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:29,248
Finnicum wechat

519
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:36,928
Someone fires two shots that hit the truck he stumbles through knee-deep snow

520
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:43,328
Keep shouting his hands are up at first then he reaches for his jacket

521
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:46,656
The pocket inside is a loaded handgun

522
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:49,728
He puts his hands up again and he reaches

523
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:52,544
And reach

524
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,592
Finally

525
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:57,664
Police to shoot him

526
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:04,064
He never managed to grab the gun

527
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,760
Police were shooting balls of pepper spray

528
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:37,344
Lavoy was bleeding out in a snowbank on the side of the road

529
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:41,440
Enforcement had been trying hard to avoid a shootout

530
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:48,096
They waited 26 days for the bunnies to leave the compound and the roadblock was on an isolated Road

531
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:54,496
Are the bunnies can call for backup within days of Memorial pops up world

532
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:59,872
Lavoy had died in the Bundy crew were talking about it like an assassination

533
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,200
Who's the ultimate example of a tyrannical government

534
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:12,672
Ammon and Ryan Bundy were arrested at the roadblock and went to jail in Oregon

535
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:14,464
Cliven Bundy was arrested days later

536
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,512
As he got off a flight in Portland

537
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,304
He was coming to help his son

538
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,888
Instead he was indicted on a Litany of charges

539
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:23,680
Stemming from the Bunkerville standoff

540
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:24,448
Nevada

541
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:27,264
Prosecutors have been waiting two years

542
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,080
Spring this trap

543
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:33,664
It wasn't looking good for the Bundys

544
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:36,736
The malheur occupation had led to a man's death

545
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:43,392
And they were about to have to argue in front of a federal judge that the stand us were Justified because the Federal

546
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:45,184
Sermon on state land

547
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:47,232
But then in court

548
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:49,024
Things did not go as expected

549
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:52,608
The court case in the verdict

550
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,144
Bundyville continue

551
00:28:55,424 --> 00:29:01,568
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices were immersed in a cluttered world of man-made

552
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:02,336
Sound

553
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:08,992
If I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife

554
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:13,600
Wife is another remedy for all hearing. Voice

555
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:15,392
Technology talk to us

556
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:17,696
It is a creation of Sonic trash

557
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:24,096
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer in composer who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

558
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:26,144
To make them more human

559
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:30,240
Turn the living room lights on

560
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:31,776
Okay

561
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,824
Dim the living room lights to 50

562
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,592
80%

563
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,384
Okay

564
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:42,784
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

565
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,600
Makes for a much more natural experience

566
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,648
Turn the living room lights on

567
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:51,744
Dim the living room lights to 50%

568
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:59,168
We're presenting to special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

569
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,704
About how are sounds gay

570
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,240
Is impacting our health

571
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:04,544
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

572
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:07,616
Look for them Friday is May 17th and May 24th

573
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:09,664
Right here on the 99.

574
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:18,368
We need to talk about something constipation abdominal pain and bloating you tell yourself it's not that bad

575
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:24,768
Take laxatives modify your diet and exercise routine but thinking about it all the time is frustrating but doesn't have to Define you

576
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:31,168
If your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again and you don't know why and it may be time

577
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,192
Nancy kulp

580
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:42,944
Flat pocket

581
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:45,504
Here again is Leah sottile

582
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:48,064
The bunny's legal fight took years to

583
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,112
Play out across Oregon and Nevada

584
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:52,672
And I was there for most of it in both States

585
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,536
Don't worry I'll spare you the monotony of actually sitting through a federal trial

586
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:00,352
Not nearly as exciting as the movies make it out

587
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:07,520
The trials are when I really started to understand the power of the bunnies belief in their own story

588
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:13,152
For years they talked about fighting for freedom and some of America's wildest places

589
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,432
Places

590
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:16,224
Few people in this country have been to

591
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:18,784
And then

592
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,344
For two months in Oregon in 2016

593
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,904
And a month in Nevada in late 2017

594
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,208
The bunnies were forced to argue their case

595
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:28,000
Urban areas they despise

596
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,280
Las Vegas

597
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:30,304
Portland

598
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:35,168
Liberal enclaves the Bundy said we're ruining the lives of rural Americans

599
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:42,848
It's worth talking for a second about the Las Vegas Federal Courthouse itself

600
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,432
It's that far back from a long Palm tree-lined Road

601
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,480
Treatments front doors

602
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:51,296
You've got to walk across this massive concrete Plaza

603
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:57,952
Later I found out that's because this is the first building to comply with blast-resistant codes put in place

604
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:00,768
After the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing

605
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:03,328
That was the work of an anti-government

606
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,096
Extremist

607
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,376
Name Timothy McVeigh

608
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:08,192
It left 168 people dead

609
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:10,496
Orchids

610
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:12,544
The bunnies

611
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,824
To have been labeled

612
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,360
Is anti-government extremist

613
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:19,200
People have called the Oregon occupation domestic terrorist

614
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,016
And within their ranks of followers

615
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:26,880
You will find people who agree with what Timothy McVeigh did back in 1995

616
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:30,464
1 Bundy supporter a guy named Gary hunt

617
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,744
Talks about McVeigh like

618
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:38,144
He's the first one to actually take an active action against the United States government was a government building

619
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:42,496
And in that respect he is the first Patriot of the second American Revolution

620
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:47,360
Not that I agree with it from an objective observation

621
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:49,152
I give him credit for

622
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:51,456
Doing what other people have talked about

623
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:54,016
McVeigh murdered 168 people

624
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:55,552
19 of them kids

625
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,904
And some people within this movement see him as something of a hero

626
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,048
I think about that when I'm standing in this long line of people waiting to get into the courtroom

627
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:07,840
Apple trials

628
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:09,632
In Oregon and Nevada

629
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:13,984
Their homeland security officers with dogs walking around looking for threats

630
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:16,544
Before they walk through the metal detectors

631
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:19,872
All these bunnies supporters huddled together in a circle

632
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,152
Take off their hats

633
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:21,920
Pray

634
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,504
And then I wonder why it isn't afraid of them

635
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:27,808
Because the government is telling me to be

636
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:29,600
Because they're actually violin

637
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:34,208
Once I make my way into the courtrooms and the trial starts

638
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:35,232
I'm surprised

639
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,048
I thought the bunnies with Flounder in the city

640
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,072
Instead

641
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:39,840
They thrive

642
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,912
In downtown Las Vegas

643
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:45,216
The bunnies come alive with the atmosphere

644
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,776
From the lobby outside the courtroom

645
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:51,104
A Neon Cowboy flickers on the corner of Fremont Street

646
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,944
He's in the saddle a Topper giant rearing Bronco

647
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:58,016
The family seems like they feel right at home in Vegas

648
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:00,064
A rebel and having an audience

649
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:02,368
The first day of the trial

650
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:05,952
Ryan buddy pulled up to the courthouse in a white stretch limo

651
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,768
During the trial in Portland

652
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:11,840
Riders on Horseback Gallop down busy city streets

653
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:15,936
Tailgate party with hot dogs and burgers fills the sidewalk

654
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:18,752
The creative circus everywhere they go

655
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,288
Even in court

656
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:23,872
As a trial starts

657
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:26,944
Prosecutors and the bunnies only agree on a few things

658
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:28,224
First

659
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,784
What happened at Bunny Ranch was important

660
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:32,320
Second

661
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:33,856
Cliven Bundy is a lot

662
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:34,624
Grazing fees

663
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:37,696
They just disagree on who he owes them to

664
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:42,816
Cliven centamin and Ryan brought armed mend Oregon

665
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:43,584
2 years later

666
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,632
Take over the malheur national Wild

667
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,192
Was it a protest

668
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:49,728
Armed occupation

669
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,520
Beyond those points

670
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:55,104
It was like I was watching the national debate over alternative facts

671
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,408
Fake news play out in a courtroom

672
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:00,736
1st and Oregon and then in Nevada

673
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:04,320
Attorneys for the government would tell the jury these cases were simple

674
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:06,624
Describe the bunnies as a menace

675
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:10,208
Issaquah Ivan and his sons trespassed on Federal Land

676
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,512
Stole from the American people

677
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,304
Used intimidation

678
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,352
Stop federal workers from doing their jobs

679
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:19,168
It was all there in the evidence they said

680
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,728
Salmon and the others on video

681
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,008
And they did

682
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,288
We have

683
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:30,688
Basically taken over the Malian National Wildlife Refuge and we're planning on staying here for several years

684
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:37,088
Prosecutors talked about the main charge in both cases this idea of the Bundys and their followers conspiring to

685
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:39,904
To keep federal officers from doing their jobs

686
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:46,304
It showed a lot of maps they talked about things most urbanites probably don't care much about grazing permits

687
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,840
Water rights

688
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:54,240
The FBI described how they picked up evidence of The Refuge how they put in a baggies

689
00:35:54,496 --> 00:36:00,640
Consign it to lab technicians then the technicians with lauded why did I come to court today

690
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:06,784
The jurors look bored in the front row I watch this one woman not off

691
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:12,928
And not just for a second the judge's clerk had another awake she giggled to herself

692
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:19,328
Prosecution had presented its case as if the details were going to be picked apart by other lawyers

693
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,376
But they weren't up against lawyers

694
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,704
Ryan Bundy was acting as his own attorney

695
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:26,752
When he stood up to present his case

696
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:29,056
He painted a very compelling picture

697
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,080
About life out west

698
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:35,968
He talked about him and his brothers as children

699
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:38,016
Waiting in the waters of the Virgin River

700
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:39,296
Sunrises

701
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:40,576
Moon Rises

702
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,112
Chasing frogs

703
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,392
Hunting rabbits

704
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:45,952
Running across a desert dog that

705
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:46,720
The Kills

706
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:51,328
Ryan talked about a family living in an unforgiving land

707
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:57,984
Finding Beauty in Solace among the Desert Shadows finding life in a place where so many things cancer

708
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,264
Survive

709
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:05,664
Talk about jackbooted agents armed for war

710
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,992
Federal snipers surrounding the Nevada Ranch

711
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:15,648
Cliven Bundy said the FBI mounted cameras to record his every move was a story about a tariff

712
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:20,000
Cornered and needing to defend its way of life

713
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:24,864
For his side of things the woman in the jury box

714
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:25,888
Wide Awake

715
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:30,240
Starbucks I certainly did not see this result coming I think it did

716
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:35,872
Kevin Sally is a portland-based defense attorney who watch the Oregon trial play out in 2016

717
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,224
He says prosecutors had to decide how to deal with a bunny versions event

718
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:46,880
What are the choices you always have to make as sort of a lawyer when you're when you're facing kind of a counter argument is

719
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:49,184
How much do you want to

720
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:53,280
Engage and thereby sort of dignified at argument as opposed to sort of

721
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:54,304
Dismiss

722
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:58,144
Oregon prosecutors didn't engage the Bundy version of the story

723
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:02,240
Even after a man talk for days and Court about the Constitution

724
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:06,336
About how he believes it's illegal for the federal government to own land

725
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:08,896
Legal Scholars laugh at

726
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:11,456
Prosecutors didn't touch it

727
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:13,760
I may well have done the same thing

728
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:18,112
Because if you if you think that your opponent's argument just really really weak

729
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:21,440
Then you're arguably doing a disservice to your case by time

730
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:24,000
He'll bring it up and elevating It And discussing it

731
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,536
So they hid it away

732
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:29,888
Didn't want to talk about the Bundys disproven views on the Constitution

733
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:32,704
How many years did been working the land

734
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,544
3 days talking

735
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:38,848
Telling jurors his family's way of life

736
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:39,872
Under attack

737
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,456
When it came time for the prosecutor to cross-examine him

738
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:46,016
They questioned him for less than 15 minutes

739
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:48,320
Nevada

740
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,624
Prosecutors hit away other things to

741
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:56,256
Didn't tell defense attorneys the cousin was right about guys with guns camping out near his property

742
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,072
His family was being recorded

743
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,608
At one point

744
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:05,472
FBI agents disguised as a film crew actually infiltrated the Bundy family home

745
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,776
All of these government Miss stats

746
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:09,824
The dismissive tones

747
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,384
The evidence they had because they said it was irrelevant

748
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:13,664
It all came across it

749
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,432
Arrogant

750
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:17,504
You could hear in the prosecutors voices

751
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,296
Etsy felt like they had a slam dunk

752
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,088
They were right

753
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:22,368
The bunnies were not

754
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,904
Not couldn't be clearer

755
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:26,464
In the end Sally says

756
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:28,512
That seemed to be the government's down

757
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:31,072
But the more I thought about it. You know it also

758
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:32,352
To some degree kind of

759
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:33,888
Presupposes the answer

760
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,960
What a lot of this case was about Italy some people's mind which is

761
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:40,032
Citizens going to have a right to a

762
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:41,568
Subject and disagree with

763
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:43,360
What the government

764
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:45,408
Does with land of the considered to be its own

765
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:47,200
You're so one Oregon juror

766
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:48,992
Grass to remain anonymous

767
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:50,528
Phrase the defenses message

768
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,856
This case is about the death of

769
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:55,136
Rural America

770
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,696
It's got me thinking

771
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:58,720
If

772
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:03,840
If your Farmers don't have the ability in this area to prosper in those venues in which they're going to raise

773
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,424
Logging or animal stuff it's

774
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:09,216
Got me thinking a lot about time

775
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:12,544
That message about the death of Rural America

776
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:13,568
It worked

777
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:17,920
At malheur there armed men patrolling a government

778
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:18,688
Facility

779
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,992
They took their guns of a fire tower

780
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:25,600
Doug battle trenches in case the FBI try to come in but in court

781
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:27,904
The fact that all those things are illegal

782
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:28,928
I didn't matter

783
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:30,720
The Bundys one

784
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:34,816
In Oregon ammon Ryan Bundy were acquitted by a jury

785
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,352
Nevada

786
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:37,888
The case never even got to the

787
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:38,656
Obituary

788
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,216
The judge declared a mistrial

789
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:43,776
Because prosecutors withheld evidence from the defense

790
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:48,128
Evidence that actually might have made the bunnies look good in the eyes of the jury

791
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:51,200
Like how it really was surveilling the Bundys

792
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:54,784
And prosecutors didn't mention that FBI threat assessment

793
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,320
Determine the bunnies themselves

794
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:57,856
Unlikely to be violin

795
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:02,464
I came into the trial skeptical the bunny world

796
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:08,864
But after listening to expert after expert explain why Cliven and his sons were wrong in their actions

797
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:10,400
Wrong for their beliefs

798
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:11,936
I can tell you

799
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:17,568
At times it's tough to tell which side of the courtroom is actually telling the truth about what the family did

800
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:19,872
Because the truth about this family

801
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:21,664
About the movement they Spark

802
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:23,200
Isn't that simple

803
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:32,928
It's it's a steak that's what your dinner that's where I'm headed

804
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:38,048
And God bless America today after having been arrested two years earlier

805
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:41,888
Cliven Bundy walked out of jail in the first days of 2018

806
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:44,192
Cowboy hats back on his head

807
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,216
His legs

808
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:46,240
Free of shackles

809
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:53,407
You raised a fist in Victory

810
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:55,199
Protesting or County Sheriff

811
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:58,527
Even the question of whether it was a standoff was still up for debate

812
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:05,439
Everything wasn't bunnies eyes have no contract with the federal government

813
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:11,839
Jurisdiction over this matter is federal government have a supposed to have an army that comes against me

814
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:16,447
He called out as he had in 2014 for people to stand up to the government

815
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:23,103
It happened on Bundy right they stuck their guns down our throats within days of getting

816
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:23,871
Out of jail

817
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:26,175
Ivan was on the steps of the Sheriff's Office

818
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:27,455
Out loud speaker

819
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:28,735
Making demands

820
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:31,039
Just as he had done in 2014

821
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:34,879
That's when I realized the Bundy story is hardly over

822
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:41,535
We're not done with this again we will definitely tell him

823
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:42,303
The truth

824
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:43,839
The truth

825
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:48,959
After the trials it felt like the truth was even more difficult to figure out

826
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:53,311
People traveled from around the country to see the Nevada trial

827
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:54,335
Journalist

828
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:55,103
Critics

829
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,383
Bunny sympathizers

830
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,663
Environmentalist

831
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:02,271
They came to see the wheels of Justice turn out long-desired answers

832
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:03,807
About what this is all meant

833
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:08,159
To understand what the Bundys actions mean about the teacher protest

834
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:10,463
But the future of the American West

835
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:15,583
Say something definitive about the movement the family tapped into three years prior

836
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:19,167
Play Mistral doesn't settle any of those questions

837
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:25,567
Is anything the proceedings raise new questions for people on the fence about the Bundys

838
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:26,847
Everything they stand for

839
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:30,175
Is a bunny sad loss

840
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:34,271
Their occupations will be a footnote to the fight over public lands in the West

841
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:38,111
Their story would be about a fringe Uprising that fizzled out

842
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:40,927
But because of the government's missteps

843
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:42,719
The Bundys Court victory

844
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:45,791
Reviews on who owns the West Bend legitimised

845
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:48,351
Least in the eyes of their followers

846
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:55,519
So if you want to know what the fight over public lands in the west is going to look like going forward you have to understand the bun

847
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:57,311
How they think

848
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:58,847
How did thinking Seducer

849
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,127
Is there followers

850
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:07,039
Understand the Bundys you have to trace their long and twisted family tree and understand the history

851
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:11,135
Backroom deals by politicians trying to undermine the federal government

852
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:15,231
It's a story of white supremacist

853
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:16,767
Nuclear weapons

854
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:22,143

The body genius is a Dark comic mystery

That whines through a

Treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

Might cost you your life

880
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:18,879
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

881
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:23,231
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

882
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:27,583
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like a dad

883
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,935
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

884
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:36,287
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main guy to know how to do that kind

885
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:37,311
I think

886
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:43,711
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

887
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:47,039
Was found dead in my private gym

888
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:50,367
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

889
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:54,719
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

890
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:58,047
Now I need to clear my name

891
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:04,447
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes to find them
