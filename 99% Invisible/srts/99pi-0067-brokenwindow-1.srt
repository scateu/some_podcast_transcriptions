This is 99% invisible

18
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:08,864
I'm running

19
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:11,168
My name is Melissa Lee

20
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:13,728
And originally I'm from Hastings-on-Hudson New York

21
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,008
A small town is

22
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:16,032
Projects to make your own fun

23
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:18,592
Everybody makes their own fun if you don't make

24
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:19,872
Get yourself it ain't fun at 10

25
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:20,640
Entertainment

26
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:24,992
I guess the big activity would be walking downtown

27
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:26,528
After school

28
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,808
And

29
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,624
You can hang out by the wall and watch people

30
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:34,976
But you knew go by

31
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:38,560
Not to square miles but it's right outside New York city so it's sort of like

32
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:42,400
You know there's a lot out there to do but there's not actually a lot to do

33
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:43,680
Right where I was

34
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:47,776
Besides people watching Melissa and her friends are also collected go

35
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:52,640
Sweden collect you break your own geodes

36
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:57,504
Brown and lumpy on the outside but when you smash my part would be some crystalline structure

37
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,552
And you've no idea

38
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,088
I'm outside what you're getting

39
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,136
It time to take a chance on it

40
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,160
The inside you

41
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,184
Got something great

42
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:10,560
Usually Melissa and her friend Liz would buy a few geodes at the store downtown and take him home and

43
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,096
Smash robot with a hammer

44
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,120
One day

45
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,912
When was Louis XIII

46
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,472
We are too impatient we just had to know what was inside

47
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,264
There's a parking lot nearby

48
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:22,080
It was an apartment building and we decided to start again

49
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:22,848
Side of a wall

50
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,920
It's hard as we could and hope that it would crack open that way

51
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,736
I think that was the first time that we had

52
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:31,040
Try to open them that way without a hammer

53
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,320
Just by throwing a

54
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,624
So I threw mine a few times

55
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,904
And

56
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,672
Finally did

57
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:37,696
Crack open

58
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,720
Against the wall

59
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:42,048
And Lucas doing hers and it wouldn't crack opens only one

60
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,328
Little window in the

61
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,120
Back of this apartment

62
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:46,656
My friend list

63
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:48,192
Tarzan

64
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,776
And Lucas wouldn't crack open

65
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:54,336
Sorry I threw mine and we saw it

66
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,896
Going towards the window and then

67
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:04,064
Kareem just went wild and

68
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:11,232
Then the geode went right through the window breaking with glass and shattering it

69
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:14,560
Everywhere you're this huge crashing sound

70
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,608
Glasses broken in

71
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,424
Is now lying all over the parking lot floor

72
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,960
Energy it was inside

73
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:22,240
My first reaction was to

74
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:25,312
Just pure full-on fear I hate doing things wrong

75
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,848
I hated getting in trouble

76
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,384
And I just got

77
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,176
Terrible singing

78
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,456
Feeling in my stomach

79
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,504
I just wanted to get out of there

80
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,808
We were such good kids I mean this is what we did

81
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:36,576
Find me

82
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:39,392
We broke up in geodes we never did anything wrong

83
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,184
And now you're committed this

84
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,000
Heinous act and it was sort of like the quintessential

85
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:47,840
Wrong thing that kids can do and you always I always saw

86
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:51,680
TV shows are read comic books where kids break a window

87
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:58,080
And then they have their face with a dilemma do they go back

88
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,360
And tell the guy

89
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,384
And they did it or not

90
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,968
We froze

91
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,248
For about 10 seconds

92
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,296
And then

93
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:09,344
My friend Liz ran forward

94
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,136
To reach into the broken glass

95
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:13,952
And grab the Geodon and we both ran

96
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,959
After initially running

97
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,495
Moral compass started

98
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,543
Nothing we realized we had to go back

99
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,359
Where to find this person and tell them what we did

100
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:35,711
Listen Liz went back to the apartment building

101
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:37,759
Figure out where the window

102
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:43,135
LED tube around to the front it was very confusing which door might lead to that window

103
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:47,743
And said that it wasn't their window

104
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,815
I did it for 10 minutes and I think we're like well

105
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:53,631
I think we did all that we can do and we're probably really

106
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,167
Glad have you tried

107
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,215
But we weren't able to find

108
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,263
Who's window it was in the end

109
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:02,847
Still feeling guilty Melissa avoided downtown and

110
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:03,871
The window

111
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:04,895
For a couple of months

112
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:07,199
Switch wasn't easy in a small town

113
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:12,831
I thought that we would just go about our business and somebody would fix the window and I would never

114
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:13,855
To think about it again

115
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,415
But when Melissa finally did go back to the window

116
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,951
It was still

117
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:18,719
Broken

118
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:20,255
Like a cartoon just like us

119
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,535
Jagged Edge

120
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,071
Keyshia Cole I was sitting there

121
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,607
Even though

122
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:28,191
Glass shards had fallen into the parking lot we're still lying there

123
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,727
It was pretty much

124
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,519
Like in pristine condition

125
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:34,335
From the day that we had broken it until

126
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,871
Months and months later

127
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,175
It stayed almost exactly the same

128
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:40,735
It was clear that the apartment was aqui

129
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:43,551
Actually we could see it TV on inside

130
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,319
Sometimes

131
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,879
So we knew somebody did live there

132
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,183
And sometimes the window would be

133
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,487
Raise up or lower down

134
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:55,071
The song was moving this window around but the whole was always still in it

135
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,887
We just could not even imagine

136
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,423
Who this person was

137
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,983
It wasn't doing anything to fix this window

138
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,287
They weren't even putting tape over it

139
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:07,103
Are we even go by in the winter and see that

140
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,383
The hole is still there

141
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,663
The window stay broke

142
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,711
Is Melissa finish Middle School

143
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:15,295
And those High School just hadn't gone away like I wanted it to

144
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,855
The one with the college and I was shocked to find that

145
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,623
Still broken

146
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:24,511
Even after I left town Melissa should go away do some growing up

147
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:30,911
When she came home she see that one don't feel exactly like the 13th kid she was when she broke the window

148
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:37,311
I think about 13 my most awkward horrible age the sight of this window would just bring me right back to feeling like a middle C

149
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,079
School Oregon

150
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,127
Melissa is 36 now

151
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:47,039
Think of all the Milestones you pass between 13 and 36/4 years and by the end of that

152
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:53,439
Pretty grown up

153
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:57,791
The world for 9 months so the window

154
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,839
Graduate school

155
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,607
Go to Washington DC

156
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,655
Saw the window

157
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,679
You get the idea

158
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:06,239
As much as I was changing is part of my past

159
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:07,775
Completely Frozen

160
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,847
As soon as I saw the windows just brought right back

161
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,895
To those middle school days when we broke

162
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,711
So in 2011

163
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,479
3

164
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,343
Years old 22 years after she and her friend broke the window

165
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,391
I decide to find out

166
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,439
Once and for all whose window it is

167
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,207
And apologize

168
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:27,743
And I guess

169
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,511
You know offer.

170
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,863
Now I'm recording stuff for real

171
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,399
So

172
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,167
I

173
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:37,471
Go downtown with my sister accompanying me

174
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:38,495
Courage

175
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,799
What the hole is still there

176
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,335
In the window

177
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:43,615
And

178
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,151
My heart is beating

179
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:49,503
So fast should I just say I'm tired of being upset you I just believe that

180
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,783
I know who

181
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,319
Pocket window

182
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:56,415
And I very very nervously blurt out

183
00:07:56,671 --> 00:08:00,255
I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm not trying to bother you I'm just trying to actually make amends

184
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,023
Explorer

185
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:05,887
I think that years ago I'm not sure but I think my friend and I broke that window until I kind of

186
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,191
Make amends for it

187
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:13,311
I think so well I actually tried to find you at the time

188
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,615
And I couldn't find you and then

189
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,151
20 years later I

190
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,943
Came back to my tone how I left

191
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,735
And I'm going back since then and

192
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:24,063
Basically that's what happened

193
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:29,439
So I just wanted to kind of find out you know whose it was and

194
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,463
Good

195
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:34,815
Give me looking for me please just that you found me you believe it

196
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:41,215
Who I left town for a while

197
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,519
But you didn't want to talk to me

198
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,055
He thought it was amusing

199
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,335
But I was now

200
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,359
Fessing up

201
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:52,479
And when I offered to pay for it he said window

202
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:59,135
I'm surprised I know why it why did you just decide to leave it like that

203
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:01,439
You got a nice breeze in the back there

204
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:05,791
The landlord never fixed it

205
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:08,607
And when I offered to pay for it he said no

206
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,887
American used to it

207
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,167
He just left it

208
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,751
Cricket Lubbock

209
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:21,151
Anyway I'm sorry I did but I'm glad that you've come to like the broken wind

210
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:28,831
Thank you I would like to meet you after all these years I've wondered about it

211
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,623
That's kind of an understatement

212
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,231
Whatever it was I was keeping me

213
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,303
You know stuck in middle school there was sort of Cuba

214
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,839
I'm stuck with this broken window

215
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,655
Was content to live with it

216
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:51,359
The broken windows theory proposed in 1982 says that a seemingly small Act of vandalism if it goes on

217
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,127
Fixed

218
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,711
Precipitated further vandalism and even more serious crime

219
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:58,271
That really didn't happen here

220
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:00,831
Except for Melissa's life on the land for 20 years

221
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:03,903
But the broken window did way on Melissa

222
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:07,231
I'm guessing it affected the man in the apartment more than he's letting on

223
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,791
In a random passerby leso

224
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:12,607
And Hastings-on-Hudson New York soldiered on

225
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,887
Without missing a Beat

226
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,703
Architecture is personal

227
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:20,543
The strangest part of our interaction with the built environment

228
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:24,127
Is what can be so evocative and meaningful for you

229
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:26,431
Can mean absolutely nothing

230
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,711
Does someone else

231
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,015
This time when I was in town.

232
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,295
I just didn't really even

233
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:36,415
I think I was even in town for a few days before I even thought about the window I didn't really even wonder about it

234
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,207
Very much

235
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:40,255
And then in the end I didn't even

236
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,023
Go down in

Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices were immersed in a cluttered World a man-made

241
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,279
Sound

242
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:19,935
If I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife

243
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:24,543
Wife is another word for all hearing that voice

244
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,335
Technology talk to us

245
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,639
It is a creation of Sonic trash

Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

To make them more human

248
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:41,183
Turn the living room lights on

249
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:42,719
Okay

250
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,279
Dim the living room lights to 50%

251
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,327
Okay

252
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:53,727
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

253
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:56,543
Makes for a much more natural experience

254
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,591
Turn the living room lights on

255
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,175

That whines through a

278
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,895

281
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:45,087
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

282
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:49,439
Or lose a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

283
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:53,791
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like a dad

284
00:13:55,583 --> 00:14:00,447
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff actually if I'm being honest

285
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:03,775
I'm one of the main guy to know how to do that kind of thing

286
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:10,175
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

287
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:13,503
Was found dead in my private gym

288
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,831
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

289
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:21,183
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

290
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,207
Now
