Roman Mars

40
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:56,736
There was a rubber shortage in the US during World War because we were fighting Japan in many of the country

41
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,272
Raise that supplied are rubber

42
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:02,368
So the government funding Research into synthetic rubber to make up the shortfall

43
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:08,768
What are the products of This research was a new material made by mixing boric acid and silicone oil

44
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:11,584
Bounce said he could stretch it was rubbery

45
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,704
Sadly it could not be used to make tires or rafts or gas masks

46
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,520
It had no practical use at all

47
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:23,616
But a marketing consultant discovered that it was pretty fun to play with

48
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:26,944
So we put it in tiny plastic eggs and sold it

49
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,224
And silly putty

50
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:34,624
Hey hey it's silly putty time yesterday

51
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,208
Hours of hours of fun in the little egg that silly putty comes in

52
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,096
We're surrounded by products that were designed for one purpose but found their true calling in another line of work

53
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:49,728
That is Amy standing co-host and co-creator of the new KQED podcast the leap

54
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,008
Play-Doh was invented

55
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,288
Clean Coal set off

56
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:54,592
Walls with Viagra and Rogaine

57
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,384
Are designed to lower blood pressure

58
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,176
Before they found their real purpose

59
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,224
Making boners and growing hair

60
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,624
In all these cases the original designs Were Meant to solve big important problems but they had to settle for less

61
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,232
Less meaningful get no maybe slightly more delightful rolls in the world

62
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:17,888
But in rare cases The Story Goes the other way and something designed to be a trifle

63
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:18,656
A gag

64
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:19,680
Joke

65
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:24,032
Stumbles upon its true destiny as something heroic

66
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,312
An honorable

67
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:29,664
Ladies and gentlemen may I introduce you to the heroic and honorable product

68
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,200
Known as liquid ass

69
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:36,320
Liquid ass is a bottled smell and you can probably guess

70
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,368
It does not smell good

71
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,136
That's an understatement

72
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:41,696
It's important that you get how bad the smell

73
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,232
Kind of Lynch

74
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,512
This whole story

75
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:48,096
So while I was reporting this I made a bunch of people in my life smell like

76
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,680
White throat constricting

77
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,984
It's super

78
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,520
Real

79
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:58,592
Do you feel like there's a sense of Shame associated with that smell

80
00:03:59,104 --> 00:03:59,872
Yeah like

81
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:00,640
If you feel like you should

82
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,688
It smells like exactly

83
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,480
That you did

84
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:10,624
This terrible smell it was invented by a guy named Alan Whitman

85
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:13,440
A teenager Allen's main interest was pranks

86
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:14,976
Smell related

87
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,536
There's one with Limburger cheese

88
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,559
Something else he called the

89
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,839
The ketchup situation

90
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:26,239
But it wasn't until he began experimenting with a chemistry set his parents gave him that he created his master

91
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:31,615
When asked what exactly the ingredients were but he is a very comfortable describing

92
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,383
How it smells

93
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,407
It smells like ass

94
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,455
It's like it's a butt crack

95
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,527
Kind of sewer smell with a little head of

96
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,551
Some dead animal in there

97
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,111
But crack with a hint of dead animal

98
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:48,511
15 years liquid ass languished in smell obscurity Ellenwood use it to pull the occasional prank but it never

99
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,047
Ever found a larger audience

100
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:56,447
And then when he and his friend Andrew Masters lost their jobs at a trucking company they decided to turn this terrible

101
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,215
Herbal smell

102
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,239
Into an income

103
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:00,287
Enter now and didn't even have to advertise

104
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,591
Liquid ass radio talk shows did it for them

105
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,127
Have you ever seen that does a bottle

106
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:11,039
You don't liquid ass liquid assholes

107
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,319
Hitman the liquid ass

108
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,599
Howard Stern

109
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,415
The opium

110
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,911
The orders poured in you can probably imagine the

111
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,703
Clientele teenage boys playing

112
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,471
Extremely stupid

113
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:35,615
But then it 23 years after its invention liquid as found a higher calling

114
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,663
Pinterest

115
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,223
See who produced a bunch of television shows in the 90's

116
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,063
Including the shows Hunter Renegade

117
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,343
He was a cop

118
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,623
I'm good at his job

119
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,159
He committed the ultimate sin

120
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,695
And testified against other

121
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,975
The cops gone bad

122
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,511
And Silk Stockings

123
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:59,423
Silk Stockings with one of those shows you might have watched on the USA Network on the people you were babysitting for didn't have HBO

124
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:04,799
Stu's business was thriving until right about September 11th 2001

125
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:07,359
My business changed after 9/11 because

126
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,919
The networks want to get away from violence

127
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:13,759
You want to get away from shooting things and blowing stuff up and

128
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,831
What is dramatic change

129
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,623
Flatline my business for

130
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,391
Quite a while

131
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,671
One day we were

132
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,439
In

133
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,487
Sick of making television

134
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,535
And the next day we weren't

135
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:30,143
Set seat belt we're just sitting there

136
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,167
Gathering dust

137
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:33,215
Vacation idea for only business

138
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:37,311
Maybe cops who needed training could get some use out of those old sets

139
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,591
We did quite a bit of training

140
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:42,687
How best to respond to a school shooting

141
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,223
Or had to carry out a drug busts

142
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,015
Where to position the officers

143
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,295
Break down a door

144
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:51,903
This was good business and then in 2003 the US invaded Iraq

145
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,719
Reservist for being called up to go overseas

146
00:06:54,975 --> 00:07:01,119
And a lot of them stew already knew because he's for the same people cops me like they've been training on his set one day

147
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:01,887
He got a phone call

148
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,167
Call me open today

149
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:03,935
I got a hundred

150
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:07,007
50 guys sitting here on the tarmac we're going to a place called The Rack

151
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,031
We got about a week

152
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,311
Don't you help us out

153
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,615
So that's how it started

154
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:16,735
Stew's big idea was that he could use not just the stats but the whole lineup of Hollywood effects

155
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:17,503
To create effect

156
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,271
Assimilative

157
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,551
Combat show soldiers

158
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,575
Exactly what they were

159
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,647
He says no one else was doing this

160
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:29,791
18 and 19 year olds were being sent to a rod with almost no sense and how the place would look what the culture was like

161
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,327
How to communicate with people

162
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,631
Always training was pretty much sterile

163
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,423
Are make believe this is a dork

164
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:38,751
They would take the Marines and turn your shirts Inside Out say okay

165
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,543
Those are the bad guys

166
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,103
It's not raining it's not realistic training

167
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,919
She says the military has gotten a lot better at training

168
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,455
But in the beginning

169
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,223
KissAnime

170
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:53,087
Mission was to try and make trainees forget that they were on a TV set in Southern California

171
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:59,487
His SATs should look and feel as much as possible like the kind of place a group of Marines might go out and Patrol

172
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,255
Anorak

173
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:06,399
We're in a simulated Iraqi Village

174
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:09,727
Upon this Tower here will have two huge speakers

175
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,007
Playing card prayer

176
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:16,383
In a simulation this whole place would be full of actors

177
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,735
Actual araki's who live in San Diego and now get hired as extras to

178
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:21,759
Like a rocket

179
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:24,575
The Village has a complete fake araki Marketplace

180
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,599
Benzoplast

181
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:29,695
The cucumbers and yams stand selling Dusty old Sony Discman Zayn

182
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,463
Clock radios

183
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:34,047
Can others hear work very hard to make this place look

184
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:34,815
Realistic

185
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:40,959
Android can do this because he did two tours in Iraq as a medic in 2007 and in 2008

186
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:45,055
And he remembers exactly what it felt like to walk into a village like this

187
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:47,103
How unwelcome he's out there

188
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:52,223
And how much the Iraqis wanted him to go away they feel they're just trying to live their lives

189
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,783
And now we set up the space right outside their Village

190
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,575
7 a simulation the whole place

191
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,855
Supposed to feel on edge

192
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,391
Like Anything Could Happen

193
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,415
And then

194
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:10,399
He well sometimes well pipe in the sound of a scene from Saving Private Ryan

195
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,423
Just to pant

196
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,447
Things up a bit

197
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,311
You can talk about it

198
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,359
Intellectually beforehand

199
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:23,455
But once the gunfire goes and people are screaming and yelling

200
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,991
All the things that happen

201
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:26,783
Israel

202
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,343
Except

203
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,135
I know he bleeds out

204
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,927
We can do it again

205
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:39,839
Stu says kissing recruits wet their pants even throw up in a simulation

206
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,375
That's normal reactions

207
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,911
The screaming the smoke

208
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,959
Explosions the disorientation

209
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:51,359
Have it all teenagers some of them are going to have to make decisions in the midst of all that

210
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,639
Life-or-death decision

211
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:55,967
Some of them the Medics will have to deal with horrible injuries

212
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:58,271
Amputations severed arteries

213
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:02,623
For this they use a cut suit that was invented here at strategic Ops

214
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:07,231
Kept in a locked storage shed

215
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,095
So

216
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,887
The main thing we do here

217
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,191
Yaz with this

218
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:16,959
Wow

219
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:21,055
Tattooed as in a suit that you cut Works kind of like a fat suit

220
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,591
Arms go through here

221
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,663
So the bass goes on

222
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:26,943
Skin goes up

223
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,711
Over top

224
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,247
You step into the legs

225
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,319
The front side goes over the top of the best

226
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:33,855
Zips up in the back

227
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:39,999
It's a realistic-looking body that you wear over your own body and then with the help of makeup artist

228
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:40,767
Inflict

229
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:41,535
Horrible

230
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:44,351
Very realistic injuries on to

231
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,631
Bullet holes

232
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:48,703
Shrapnel wounds even disembowelment

233
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:55,103
Chinese can learn how to perform or assist surgery on a cut suit where the intestines are literally hanging outside the

234
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:58,687
And for that scenario there is something very important

235
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:03,551
They need to learn and it is in the context of these very realistic combat scenario

236
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:06,623
That we will be reunited with the true star of the story

237
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:07,903
Liquid ass

238
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:13,279
As A Firefighter knows the smell of smoke as a barista can sniff sour milk

239
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:15,327
Surgeons know this smell

240
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:16,863
They fear it

241
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,911
Because this smell is a signal

242
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:19,935
But something has gone

243
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,983
That there's a tear in the end

244
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,543
Then and feces is leaking into the air

245
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,311
Abdominal cab

246
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,383
No pun intended ocean

247
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,175
This is a huge infection risk

248
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:30,943
People died this

249
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:34,271
Whatever surgery you were just doing or attempting to do

250
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:36,063
You just complicated it by 10

251
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,599
Strategic Ops

252
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,879
Prides itself on areolas

253
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:39,903
Hypertrophy

254
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:42,975
So they needed to recreate that oh s*** moment

255
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,279
Show young soldiers what it would be like today

256
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,559
Encounter this in the midst

257
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,375
There was only one smell

258
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,143
For the job

259
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,447
We found a bottle of liquid ass in the

260
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,239
Take It Outside

261
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,287
Will Smith

262
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,079
In his hand

263
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:58,847
Greg holds

264
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,639
Auction that Alan Whitman in

265
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,223
Oh it's so

266
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,271
It's it's like

267
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,855
It's so bad so many ads

268
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,135
Years

269
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,695
Yeah fecal

270
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,231
Dried

271
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:17,791
Nasty

272
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,351
If liquid asked for a person

273
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:23,167
I don't think it would be totally farfetched to call this

274
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:30,335
Because to strategic Ops this ridiculous disgusting prank product is also indispensable there one

275
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,383
Liquid ass is most loyal customers

276
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,431
Stu says 750

277
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,967
3000 people have trained

278
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:36,991
Strategic

279
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,271
Liquid ass

280
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,063
Some of them might be better prepared

281
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,087
To save the life of a

282
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,111
A fellow Marine

283
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:44,159
He or she screams in pain

284
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,183
Mystic

285
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,463
Exploding RPG

286
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,231
Machine gun

287
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,583
Surrounded by a miasma cloud

288
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,375
Of the worst smell

289
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,399

Bongs and chatter of our devices

302
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:38,943
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man made sound

303
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:39,967
If

304
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:46,367

It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

318
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,695
Makes for a much more natural
