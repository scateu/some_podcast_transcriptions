42
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:36,928
They're a kind of unique set of spaces that were required to be provided by the developer as a kid

43
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:41,280
Addition of approval for the developers building on private property

44
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,840
Their own most likely by the owner of the building

45
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,632
They look like public space they

46
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:52,032
Boa covered space in the most part this one that were standing in is granite walkways in the fountain and

47
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:56,640
Grasp but technically speaking these are totally privately owned

48
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:57,920
The only

49
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:58,688
Patches

50
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,712
Set the developer is

51
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,992
Legally obliged

52
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,016
To make this open to

53
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,552
The public and fill out anyway

54
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:07,648
And no one's quite sure what allowed here who's in charge and what

55
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,440
The codes of behavior should be

56
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:11,232
And just because they're public

57
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,024
Doesn't mean they're easy to find

58
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,632
The walkthrough to get to a public

59
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:18,656
Yeah

60
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:20,448

00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,056
Security

64
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:28,896
W this moment where you're like okay I just crossed the threshold

65
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,432
Making eye contact

66
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,736
People in authority and sort of acknowledging them

67
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:37,088
That's not something I ever feel in a park right if you don't like walk into Dolores Park in

68
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,624
I feel like nod

69
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,904
Somebody like you

70
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,672
It's okay that I'm here

71
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,952
There's cameras

72
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,232
1 2

73
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,768
3 cameras in here

74
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,328
You want to try some bad

75
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,120
Yeah why not

76
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,912
Yeah let's do it

77
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,752
There's a whole set of invisible

78
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:55,520
Codes

79
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,288
And

80
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:58,592
Regulations that shape our Behavior

81
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,872
Most of us aren't really

82
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,152
Play where them

83
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,944
You hold yourself in public

84
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,712
Were you thinking

85
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,248
You can talk to

86
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:07,552
It's only by doing something that

87
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,576
Push back again

88
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:09,600
Text codes

89
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,368
That you actually can

90
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,416
Turtle eggs

91
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,720
Science is firing an electron

92
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,488
Add an atom

93
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,512
Where is

94
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,839
If you fire an electron in an atom he actually change

95
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:25,215
The course of Adam when you're in one of these faces when you start to push back against the codes of behavior if you actually

96
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,239
Change Kodi

97
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,007
Behavior

98
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,103
Look like

99
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,127
All right

100
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,175
We definitely played

101
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,711
Long enough probably to be noticed

102
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:40,575
Score one for

103
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:44,927
But if you really want to test the tolerance of a privately owned

104
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,207
Public open space

105
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,767
Batman may not be the best test

106
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,839
I mean if you really want to make someone in Authority uncomfortable

107
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,631
The most subversive Act

108
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,911
Especially right now

109
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,959
Maybe doing nothing at all

110
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,263
There's a few behaviors that you can

111
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:03,103
Sort of possibly do that allow you to the idol

112
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,127
Like

113
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:06,175
Cuddling with your phone or

114
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,711
Smoking

115
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,783
Or reading a book but

116
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:13,599
Just like lie down and do nothing

117
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,623
Not okay

118
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,159
I dropped attention to do nothing

119
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:21,023
The San Francisco planning and urban research Association which is better note

120
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:25,375

124
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,983
Including a proposal

125
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,799
Taconafide some of these rules for the sofa

126
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,847
Privately owned

127
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,383
Open Spaces

128
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,687
I think it's key to keep in mind that

129
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,527
Hobo's will never fully supplant the need for a true comment

130
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:45,343
Free public spaces in a city

131
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,879
Public entities

132
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:47,903

Devon City

136
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,791
Even if you're allowed to play badminton

137
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,071
The fact that you have

138
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,095
The test for it

139
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,631
These these spaces

140
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,423
Aren't really ours

141
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:05,311

Before we go I want to tell you about the body genius a five-part series from fellow radiotopia show the truth

150
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:32,447
The body genius is a Dark comic mystery

151
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:35,775
That whines through a treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

152
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,311
We're looking the part

153
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,847
Might cost you your life

154
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:44,223
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

155
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,575
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

156
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:52,927
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like a dad

157
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:57,279
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

158
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:01,631
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main got to know how to do that kind of

159
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:08,031
I think a few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action

160
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,311
Movie called Immortal cop

161
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:15,711
Was found dead in my private gym crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

162
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:22,111
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it now I need to

163
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,391
To clear my name

164
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:29,791
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes to find them
