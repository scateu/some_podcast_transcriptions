If you have the word courthouse and do a Google image search

33
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:05,952
You get the hundreds of results that look really similar to the US Supreme Court Building

34
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:06,976

That's Brett Myers he's reporting this way

39
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:20,544
Michelle he went to the New York County family court in lower Manhattan

40
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:27,200
It's a building that looks nothing like the classic Roman and Greek inspired architecture that most of us associate with

41
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:27,968
Courthouses

42
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:31,552
There's little to quite family with the building be on disk

43
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:36,160
Function family court could have talked before its 2006 renovation

44
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:39,232
It would have said

45
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:41,024
Built in 1975

46
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,424
Polish black Cooper's Hawk is about as welcoming as the Death Star in Patron reading from an article he wrote about

47
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,264
What is time is a paralegal in the building sums up the most common argue

48
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,800
About the original design

49
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:55,616
The New York County family court at 60 Lafayette Street

50
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,664
Is information architecture circles

51
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,224
Is an example of form giving not a damn about funk

52
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,784
And that's an easy argument to make

53
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:09,184
Absolutely it filled me with rage the first time I saw this building back in the late nineties the design just seems so

54
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,976
So wrong for family courthouse

55
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,792
It was like hiring Dick Cheney to be the nanny for your kids

56
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,072
It was brutal

57
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,120
Think repetitive angles and stick

58
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,144
Heavy forms

59
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,192
Lots of lots of concrete

60
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:22,496
It's a pretty polarizing Style

61
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:23,776
Actually kind of

62
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:28,640
And before the 2006 remodel it was possible to appreciate this building

63
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,408
From afar

64
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,200
Up-close was a different story

65
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,504
The shiny black granite panels

66
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,832
The cover the whole thing we're falling off and threatening to kill

67
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:37,600
People on the ground

68
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:40,160
It was a looming and menacing building

69
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,440
Even the entrance

70
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:45,536
There were these huge pylons offset at 45 degree angle

71
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:49,632
So that when you enter the building you can actually see what it was you were walking into

72
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,680
It was like stepping into a black hole

73
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,496
Definitely very Bleak and very

74
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:58,592
Oh my God what is this a black Bill do you know is this a courthouse

75
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:01,664
Miriam Hernandez works there as an interpreter translator

76
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,944
It didn't really have

77
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,296
The feeling of humanity or Humane you know it didn't really have that

78
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,576
What kind of stuff happens

79
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:12,416
Inside the question should be what doesn't happen

80
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,232
What does it have

81
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,768
I mean it's like

82
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:17,536
You could ride

83
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,095
Maybe You Forever book about

84
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,375
Takes place inside

85
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:25,471
And that Forever book wouldn't be a light read

86
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:29,311
Would have chapters about custody battles and divorces and abuse

87
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:34,175
Children going in the family court in their faith is being decided behind those doors

88
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,199
If anything

89
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:37,247
You would hope that the architecture wouldn't

90
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,271
Inspire Trust

91
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,295
Not

92
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,063
Fear

93
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,879
And maybe even can be a little bit of warmth

94
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:43,903
But instead

95
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:47,231
Goldenvoice refer to it as the Darth Vader building

96
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,047
Luke

97
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:54,655
Your mother and I are getting a divorce the question is

98
00:04:55,423 --> 00:05:00,287
Was the form of the New York County family courthouse completely antithetical to its function

99
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:03,103
I met a guy who's got a really interesting theories

100
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:10,015
This guy goes by the name Loft room want my Clark Kent is a basic I do freelance research

101
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,575
By day he's a writer researcher

102
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,343
For a realist

103
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,927
But his secret identity is laughter one

104
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:23,327
It's the handle he uses when contributing to wired New York's this hugely popular website about

105
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,607
All Things New York City

106
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:28,703
The community section is basically a forum for Urban Design

107
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,775
After 1 is one of the biggest gigs on the side

108
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:36,127
How many posts have you posed is insecure

109
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,407
Furstenberg

110
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,199
About

111
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:44,575
Old couple thousand I'm not sure how I'd feel like 28,000 something like

112
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,647
28131 Plus

113
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,183
Excessive sweating

114
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,511
Texas morning video

115
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,351
You better if you today

116
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,399
I go out there almost everyday

117
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:01,983
In fact he averages almost 13 post per day

118
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,799
And most are related to architecture and urban planning

119
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:08,383
One of his first post was about the remodel of the building were talking about

120
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,407
The family courthouse

121
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,199
The building were standing in front of

122
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,479
Little place

123
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,503
I felt like I was

124
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,783
Kneeling down

125
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,551
And crawling

126
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,319
Through

127
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:17,599
Little

128
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,135
Bolin

129
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,159
Cave

130
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:22,975
And you know I didn't know what the hell there's a bear that

131
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:26,559
That's on the other side acting inside was not going to be good

132
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,351
They should have just put out you know

133
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,655
Abandon hope all ye who enter here

134
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,703
Because that's what the message

135
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,471
Who was sending

136
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,543
In laughter one argues that that message had a time set

137
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:41,407
That Old Black shiny death star of a building reflected the New York of the time

138
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:43,967
The New York back in the seventies when it was built

139
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,735
Watergate

140
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,039
Financial distress

141
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:48,831
Social

142
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:49,599
Divide

143
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,647
It all makes total sense

144
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,975
Total sense at this building looked the way it did

145
00:06:55,231 --> 00:07:01,375
And this argument games even more weight when you consider a 1977 Story by Fame New York Times

146
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,399
Porter Lori Johnston

147
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,447
The article profiles users

148
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:07,263
The court in what is essentially a critique of the system

149
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:11,359
She interviews people who spend a Shuffling from one waiting room to another

150
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:15,967
And their critiques of the bureaucracy go hand-in-hand with critiques of the Arctic

151
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,783
Here's a quote from the 1977 article

152
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,575
It seems like a maze.

153
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,855
This place or worse

154
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,903
It seems like it's run like a prison

155
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,439
With uniforms all over

156
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,231
Maybe it's meant to discourage you

157
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:27,999
I'm going to head

158
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,023
Psycho you want

159
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,071
Form to meet function

160
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,095
This is how this

161
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,375
Cork function

162
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:36,191
This is what this court does

163
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:40,031
Sucks people in and spit some out

164
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,079
And there is no feeling

165
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,383
It doesn't solve the problem

166
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,943
Now of course the courthouse has been remodeled

167
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,015
And it's warmer and friendlier and it reflects a city that

168
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,295
It's friendlier and more function

169
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,599
The black facade is all gone it's

170
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,623
Edible light

171
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,391
Gradle

172
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,415
The entrance

173
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,439
Is all opened up

174
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,231
It even has come in on it

175
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,255
That doesn't look

176
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:04,607
Imposing or unfriendly tall and there's no more threat that those black granite panels

177
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,655
They're going to fall off the side of the building and kill

178
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,935
Oh yeah

179
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,471
It's also kind of

180
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,495
Boring

181
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:15,359
The remodel is definitely a little boring and it's not a building I want to talk to my friends about

182
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,151
But that original building

183
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:19,967
Angered me and it was something I talk to my friends about

184
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,247
It was dark and interest

185
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,807
And now Brett kind of misses the old boy

186
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:27,135
But I also know that I'm privileged because I don't have to interact

187
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:31,231
Because I don't have to work there and I'm not a kid who has to walk into family

188
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:35,327
For them this Milky Bland remodel is a definite improve

189
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:36,863
And probably

190
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,143
A sacrifice worth making

191
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:41,727
Kids math

192
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,127

00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:29,343
Before we go I want to tell you about the body genius

200
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:32,927
Series from Bellow radio TV show the truth

201
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:39,071
The body genius is a Dark comic mystery that whines through a treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

202
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,607
We're looking the part

203
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,143
Might cost you your life

204
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:48,543
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

205
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,615
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

206
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:55,967
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like a dad

207
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,575
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

208
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:04,927
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that kind of

209
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:12,351
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

210
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:15,679
Was found dead in my private gym

211
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:19,007
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

212
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:23,359
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

213
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:26,687
Now I need to clear my name

214
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:32,063
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes

215
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,087
To find them

216
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:41,279
