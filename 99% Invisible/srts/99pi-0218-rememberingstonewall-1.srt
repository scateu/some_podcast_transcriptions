I'm Roman Mars

21
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:34,976
It started with a place called The Stonewall Inn

22
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:39,072
Gay bars have been raided by police for decades

23
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:42,912
Gay lesbian bisexual and transgender people

24
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:49,312
Had been routinely arrested and subjected to harassment and beatings by the people who are meant to protect

25
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:53,664
But one night in this place called The Stonewall Inn

26
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:56,736
The police stormed into continue their abuse

27
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,272
The clientele

28
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,552
Fought back

29
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:03,136

Turn into a protest over the next few days

31
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:10,048
An evolved into a movement that is still making the world better for everyone

32
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:10,816
Today

33
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:13,376
And it started with a place

34
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,008
On June 28th 1969 the patrons at the Stonewall Inn made history

35
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,872
Which is why gay pride celebrations all over the country take place in June

36
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:30,528
End on June 27th 2016 President Obama in the National Park Service designated The Stonewall Inn

37
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:33,088
Christopher Park in the surrounding streets

38
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,392
The First National Monument

39
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:38,208
The lgbtq rights

40
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:43,584
In 1989 twenty years after the Stonewall Uprising and now nearly 30 years ago

41
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:48,704
Radio producer Dave Isaiah created the first documentary of Stonewall ever

42
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:50,240
In any medium

43
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:57,152
Is also days first radio story if you can believe it he later went on to found the much-beloved and hugely

44
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,688
Popular storycorps broadcast

45
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:05,344
With the anniversary and National commemoration of the Stonewall Inn and the tragic massacre in Orlando

46
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:08,672
I thought it would be good to revisit this place

47
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:15,072
Which like so many other gay bars around the world is much more than just a place

48
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:21,472
This is remembering Stonewall by Dave I say with Michael Schenker

49
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:24,544
Originally broadcast in 1989

50
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,736
I Am Legend Hardwood

51
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,784
And my age is 80

52
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,088
I'm

Bruce Merrill

54
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,904
I I don't I don't

55
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:46,304
I don't know if it's really true but now people do refer to us as the two oldest gay men in America

56
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,840
We do hair I think

57
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:50,912
Have maybe a record relationship

58
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:54,240
Of almost 60 years together

59
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:58,592
Being gay before Stonewall was was

60
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:01,152
A very difficult proposition because

61
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,736
We felt that in order to survive

62
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,528
We had to

63
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:07,808
Try to

64
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,088
Look and act

65
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:15,744
And as rugged and manly as possible to get by in the in the in the society that was

66
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,047
I really very much against us

67
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:24,447
My name is Randy wicker I was the first openly gay person to appear on radio in 1962 and

68
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:28,031
On television in 1964 is a self-identified homosexual

69
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:31,615
And they are before Stonewall people thought of

70
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,895
Need to hide

71
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,431
Because of the

72
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:38,527
Precarious legal position they were in they would lose their jobs

73
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:44,927
There was a great hostility socially speaking in the sense of people found out you were gay they assumed you were a communist or a child

74
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:45,695
Leicester

75
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:52,095
Any of another dozen stereotyped to a ramp in the public media at the time I'm very fair and I'm 80 years old

76
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:55,935
I started a gay lifestyle in 1948

77
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,983
When I was around 39

78
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:58,751
40

79
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,543
At that time

80
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,383
If there was even a suspicion

81
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,431
But you were a lesbian

82
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,015
You were fired from your job

83
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:13,343
And you weren't such a position of disgrace

84
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:15,647
Baidu

85
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:20,767
Slunk out without saying goodbye even to the people that like doing your life

86
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,327
Never even bother to clean your desk

87
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,863
You just disappeared

88
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,911
You just disappeared your window

89
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:27,679
Quietly

90
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,727
Because you were afraid that

91
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:36,639
The recommendations at the tongue if you even still there protested would be worse than just

92
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:37,919
Leaving

93
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,967
My name is Sylvia Rivera

94
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:46,367
My name before that was spray Rivera until I started dressing and dragon 1961

Azahara

97
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,815
It was always the gay bashing

98
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:55,839
On the drag

99
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:56,607
Science

105
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:05,823
Flip with it

106
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:09,919
Because it was part of the lifestyle at that time I guess

107
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,247
But none of us were very happy about it

108
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,295
My name is Seymour Pine

109
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:20,927
In 1968 I was assigned as Deputy inspector in charge of public morals

110
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,463
In the first division

111
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,999

The Greenwich Village area

114
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,375
It was a duty of public morals

115
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:33,471
To enforce all laws concerning Vice and gambling

116
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:36,031
Including prostitution

117
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,567
Narcotics

118
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,359
And laws

119
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:42,175
And regulations concerning homosexuality

120
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:47,807
The part of the penal code which applied to drag queens

121
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,647
Was section 2 for 0.35

122
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,439
Section 4

In a public place

128
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:10,079
That time we lived at the Arista Hotel

129
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,895
Is Scott around

130
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,967
Try to figure out when

131
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:16,735
When does

132
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,807
Harassment the come to an end

133
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,343
And

134
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:24,671
We would always dream that one day

135
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,719
It would come to an end

136
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,535
And we pray and we look

137
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,303
Ford

138
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,143

Ivan

141
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,799
Hanging out

142
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:43,615
Drinking partying and working

143
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:46,175
And the gay boys for the last 30 years

144
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,991
In the era before Stonewall

145
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,295
All of the bars

146
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,831
90% the boys

147
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,879
Word mafia control

148
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,439
There wasn't that many

149
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,719
Gay bars

150
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:02,047
It had me B12 uptown

151
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,095
And the Upper East Side

152
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:08,191
They would get close down and if you wanted to in the Westside they get closed down in

153
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:10,495
Midtown tb12

154
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,287
Read maybe open

155
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,847
As they would get close down they'd move around

156
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,639
And they would dumps

157
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,919
I'm Joan Nestle

158
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:23,039
Co-founder of what is now the largest collection of lesbian culture

159
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:23,807
China world

160
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,879
The police raided lesbian bars regularly

161
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,159
They did it

162
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:34,559
They both did it in the most obvious way which was holding women away and paddy wagons but they did there was regular

163
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,583
Weekend harassment

164
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:36,863
What consists

165
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:43,007
Are the police coming in regularly to get their payoffs and then the Sea Colony we had a back room with a red light and when that red light went on

166
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,799
It meant the police would be arriving

167
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,079
In the round

168
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:46,847
10 minutes

169
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,663
And so we all had to sit down at our table

170
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:52,479
And we would be sitting there almost like school children

171
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:57,343
And the cops would come in now depending on who is on which cop was on

172
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:01,183
If it was something that really resented the butch women

173
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:03,487
A little bit many times very beautiful women

174
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:06,559
We knew we were in for it because what would happen is

175
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:12,959
They would start harassing one of these women and saying how you think your man come outside will show you in

176
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:15,007
The woman would be dragged away

177
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,311
They throw up against the wall

178
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:21,663
And they say so you think you're a man let's see what you got in your pants and they would

179
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,199
But their hands

180
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:24,991
Docker pants

181
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,551
Stonewall

182
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:28,575
That was

183
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,623
Just to get into the Stonewall

184
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,415
Get woke up and you knock on the front

185
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,487
Kid knocking the door opening

186
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,767
2001

187
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:39,839
Ameristep Megatron and girls

188
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,119
The Stonewall

189
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,423
Like all gay bars at that time

190
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,703
Painted black

191
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,031
Charcoal black

192
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,079
And what was the funny part

193
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,871
The place would be so dimly lit

194
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,431
But as soon as the cops are going to come in

195
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:58,271
The collected percentage of whatever they were coming in for

196
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,063
Tried being a nice

197
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,087
Dimly

198
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,111
Lip dump

199
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,183
The place was lit up like Luna Park

200
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:10,303
You felt like two guys and that's very often or we sent in would be two men

201
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,351
Could handle 200 people

202
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,887
When you tell him to leave

203
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,423
And they leave

204
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:20,031
And you say show me your identification and they all take out their identification

205
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:23,359
And file out and and that's it and you say okay

206
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,919
You're not a man or woman

207
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,967
OU or vice versa

208
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,759
You wait over there

209
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,295
I mean this is a

210
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,319
Kind of

211
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,367
How is it you have

212
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,439
And you never gave it a second thought

213
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:40,511
The drag queen took a lot of Oppression and we had to

214
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,095
We were at a point

215
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,375
Where

216
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:46,655
I guess

217
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,727
Nothing would have stopped us

218
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,007
I guess

219
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:53,311
As I stay or should I go

220
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,335
Esl

221
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,639
Do the ladies-in-waiting

222
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,943
Just waiting for the thing to happen

223
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:01,247
And when it did happen

224
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,527
We were there

225
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:11,231
On Friday evening June 27th 1969 at about 11:45

226
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:17,887
8 officers from New York City's public morals Squad loaded into for unmarked police cars and headed to the store

227
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:20,447
Stonewall Inn here at 7th Avenue and Christopher Street

228
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,775
The local Precinct just received a new commanding officer

229
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:27,871
Who kicked off his tenure by initiating a series of raids on gay bars

230
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,919
The Stonewall was an inviting Target

231
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:33,503
Operated by the gambino crime family without a liquor license

232
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:37,087
Dance bar drew a crowd of drag queens Hustler's in minors

233
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:43,743
The number of the bar patrons had spent the early part of the day outside the Frank Campbell funeral home where Judy Garland funeral was how

234
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,791
She died the Sunday before

235
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,095
It was almost precisely at midnight

236
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:50,655
Immortal Squad pulled up to the Stonewall Inn

237
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:53,215
Led by Deputy inspector Seymour Pine

238
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:57,567
It was never any reason to feel that

239
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:58,847
Anyting

240
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:02,431
Of any unusual situation would occur that night

241
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,223
You could actually feel it in the air

242
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,271
You really cry

243
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,831
I guess Judy Garland's death just

244
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,623
Really helped us Bailey head

245
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,391
Fan

246
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:14,207
For some reason things with different this night

247
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:17,791
As we were bringing the prisoners out they were resisting

248
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:21,119
People started gathering in front of the

249
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:24,703
Saturn Square Park right across the street from

250
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,239
Stonewall

251
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,055
People were upset

252
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,591
Now we're not going to

253
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,407
People started

254
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,711
Screaming and hollering

255
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,503
1 drag queen

256
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,295
As we put her in the car

257
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,623
Open the door on the other side and jumped out

258
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:46,975
At which time we had to chase that person

259
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,511
And

260
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,863
He was caught but back into the car

261
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:56,703
Made another attempt to get out the same door the other door

262
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,543
And at that point we had to handcuff the

263
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,079
The person

264
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:07,455
From this point on things really began to get crazy

265
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,247
My name is Robert Rivera

266
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:13,087
My nickname is birdie and I've been crossdressing all of my life

267
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,927
I remember the night of the riots

268
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,207
The police were escorting

269
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,487
Queens

270
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,279
Out of the barn into the Patty wagon

271
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:27,935
And there was this one particularly outrageously beautiful queen with Stacks and stacks of Liberty style for the

272
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:28,959
Bella style hair

273
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:32,543
And up she was asking them not to push her

274
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:38,687
They pretended for sure and she turn around and she matched the top with a high heel

275
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:44,575
She knocked him down and then she proceeded to first come for her have the keys to the handcuffs I wanna

276
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:51,743
She got them understand it herself and pass them to another coin that was behind all hell broke loose

277
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:59,167
Then we were we have to get back into the song my name is Howard Smith

278
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:04,031
On the night of the Stonewall Riot I was reported for the Village Voice

279
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:06,847
Locked inside with the police covering up

280
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,127
For my call

281
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,175
It really did appear

282
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,711
But that crowd

283
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,271
Looks a little peepholes

284
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,319
In the plywood windows

285
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,599
Lookout

286
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,135
We could see that the crowd

287
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:25,791
Well my guess was within 5-10 minutes is probably several thousand people

288
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:30,399
Mm music family yelling chola

289
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:36,799
Police brutality let's get them we're not going to take this anymore let me out as a group of

290
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,663
Persons attempting to uproot

291
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,967
One of the

292
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:49,343
Parking meters a witch that in which they did succeed and they then

293
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:52,927
Use that parking meter to

294
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:59,839
As a battering ram to break down the door and they did in fact open the door

295
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:06,239
They crashed it in and at that point was when they began with throwing Molotov

296
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:12,639
Cocktails into the place it was a situation that we didn't know how we were going to get with me

297
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:19,039
Remember someone selling a Molotov cocktail out of every other person was but I mean I saw that and I just touch my

298
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:25,439
Myself in Spanish I sit on my card to record wash it is finally here and I'm since I started screaming three

299
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:28,767
We're free at last dude I would have

300
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:35,167
I felt really good there a couple of cop station amoeba side of the door with a pistol bucking combat stance

301
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,447
Midoriya

302
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:43,359
Couple others with stations in other places behind like a whole another one behind the bar all of them

303
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:47,967
Guns ready I don't think up to that point I other at ever seen

304
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:51,295
Cops that scared remedies were Pros

305
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:57,695
But everybody's frightened is no question about that I Know I Was Pregnant

306
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:04,095
And I've been in combat situations and there was no

307
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:07,679
Never any time that I felt more scared than I felt that night

308
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,359
When did you know there's no place to run

309
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:20,735
Once the Tactical police force

310
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,551
Salvador

311
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:29,951
I think that really excited us a little bit more

312
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:35,839
My name is Martin Boyd in 1969 I was a drag queen known as Miss Mart

313
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,887
I remember on that night

314
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:43,007
All the strikers begin John's like about cats

315
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,799
And sing the song

316
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:47,359
We Are The Village girls

317
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,407
Beware I have a girl

318
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,199
We wear our dungarees

319
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,991
Above all Nelly

320
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:56,063
And at least went crazy hearing that necklace and mediately rush though

321
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,111
Gave one kicking today

322
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,903
My name is Rudy

323
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:02,975
Andrea the night of the storm while I was 18

324
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,279
And to tell you the truth

325
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:08,607
That night I was doing more running than fighting

326
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,655
I remember looking

327
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:11,679
Back

328
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,959
From 10th Street

329
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:16,031
And they're on Waverly Street

330
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,823
It was a police I believe on it

331
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,591
A cop

332
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,895
And it's on his stomach in his tactical

333
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,175
Uniform and

334
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,455
Is helmet and everything else

335
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:25,503
With a drag queen straddling him

336
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:28,063
It was beating the hell out of him with her shoe

337
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:30,367
What it was a high heel not I don't know

338
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,159
She was beating the hell out of him

339
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,439
Christmas Carol

340
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,767
My name is Mama Jean's

341
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,559
I'm a lesbian

342
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:42,399
I remember on that night I was in the gay bar I will make bark or cookies

343
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,983
Lila coming at the gay bar going toward

344
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,007
8th Street

345
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:51,359
And that's when we saw everything happen blasting away people getting beat up

346
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,663
Please come from every direction

347
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,199
I hadn't

348
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:55,967
Women

349
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:58,271
As well as men with their nightsticks

350
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:02,623
Gay men running down the street with blood all over their face

351
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:06,975
We decided right then and there we scared or not we didn't think about it we just jumped in

352
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:12,863
Here is Queen is going completely bananas you know jumping on hitting the windshield

353
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:18,239
Alexa you know taxi cab lesbians hard dog roll the cars with the entire dopest things

00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:23,359
Windows with shattering all over the place fires burning around

355
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:28,223
It was a beaut it was beautiful it really was it was really beautiful

356
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:30,271
I remember when kept coming at me

357
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:32,575
Hitting me with the nightstick in the back of my legs

358
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,623
I broke loose and I went after him

359
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:37,951
I grabbed his nightstick my girlfriend went behind him

360
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,487
Choose a strong 7 again

361
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:42,047
I wanted to feel the same pain I felt

362
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,863
And I kept on saying to him I'd like the pain

363
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:47,679
Do you like it do you like it I kept on hitting him and hitting

364
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:48,959
I was angry

365
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,239
I want to kill him

366
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:53,311
At that particular minute I want to kill him I wanted

367
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:58,175
Every destructive thing that I could think of at that

368
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:58,943
Time

369
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:01,759
Check hurt anyone

370
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,039
That hurt us

371
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,063
The year

372
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:07,135
Is that just when you see a man protecting his own life

373
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:09,695
They weren't the queens that people call them

374
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,743
They were men fighting for their lives

375
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:15,583
Can I find a website in any day no matter how old I was

376
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,631
Ellada has Sebastian

377
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,727
But it didn't hurt

378
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:25,311
True feelings they all came back from the war

379
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,383
Nothing

380
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:32,223
That's when you can tell that nothing could stop us but that time

381
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,271
But any time in the future

382
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:47,327
Every time

383
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:06,527
The riots were well covered in the media

384
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:09,343
The New York daily news featured that on the front page

385
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,671
There were reports on all of the local television and radio stations

386
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:17,535
By the next day graffiti calling for gay power had started to show up all over the West Village

387
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:22,655
Next night thousands of men and women came back to the Stonewall to see what would happen next

388
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:26,495
Wella couple of trash cans were set on fire and some Stones were thrown

389
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:29,823
The 400 riot police Milling around outside the bar

390
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:33,151
Ensure that the previous evening's violence would not be repeated

391
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:36,991
But on this night gay couples could be spotted walking hand-in-hand

392
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,271
Kissing in the streets

393
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:43,135
Just by being at the Stonewall surrounded by reporters photographers and onlookers

394
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,671
Thousands of men and women were

395
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:46,207
Proclaiming that they were gay

396
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:50,559
The crowds grew and came back the next night and for one more night the following week

397
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:53,119
What happened at the Stonewall on those nights

398
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:59,519
Help to usher in a new era for gay men and lesbians in Stonewall happened Bruce and I were

399
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,543
Still in the closet

400
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:03,103
Where where we at Ben

401
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,151
For nearly 40 years

402
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,479
But we realize that this was this was a

403
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:11,039
A tremendous thing to have happened

404
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:13,087
At Stonewall and

405
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,879
It gave us a feeling that

406
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,416
We were not going to be

407
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:18,464
Remaining closeted

408
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,000
For very much longer

409
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,792
And soon thereafter

410
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,840
We did come out of the closet

411
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,120
My name is Junie puso

412
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:29,216
In 1969 I was in the convent

413
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:32,544
And when Stonewall

414
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,080
Hit the Press

415
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:35,360
It

416
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:40,224
Hit me with a bolt of lightning it was as if I had to

417
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:43,040
Incredible release

418
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:46,112
Of my own outrage at having to

419
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:48,160
Sequester so much of my life

420
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:51,232
I made weight my way down I seem to recall

421
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:53,024
In subsequent nights

422
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,048
Being

423
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:57,888
I'm down on the unit kind of just in the periphery looking Observer

424
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:59,168
Clearly in observer

425
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:01,216
Clearly longing to have that

426
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:02,240
Courage

427
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:04,544
To come out and

428
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,360
Was a matter of record was only a matter of weeks

429
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,152
Before I left

430
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,688
The convent end

431
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,712
Start a new life

432
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,248
I'm Henry beard

433
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,624
In 1969 I was in the US Army specialist 3 station to Long Binh post

434
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,416
Near Saigon in Vietnam

435
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:24,000
I remember I was having lunch in the Army mess

436
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:26,560
Reading the Armed Forces news summary of the day

437
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:30,656
And it was a short paragraph describing a riot

438
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:33,472
Led by homosexuals in Greenwich Village against the police

439
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,520
Am I heartless

440
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:36,800
Filled with joy

441
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,848
I thought about what I had read

442
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:40,896
Frequently but I had no one to discuss it with

443
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:43,712
And secretly Within Myself I decided

444
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:45,760
That's when I came back stateside

445
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:49,344
If I should survive to come back stateside I would come out of scape

446
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:50,368
And I did

447
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,928
For those of us in public morals

448
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,744
After the Stonewall incident

449
00:22:56,256 --> 00:23:00,608
Things were completely changed from what they had previously been

450
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,656
They they

451
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:07,264
Suddenly were not submissive anymore they now suddenly had gained a

452
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,800
A new type of

453
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:09,824
Courage

454
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:14,432
And it seemed as if they didn't care anymore about

455
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:19,296
Whether their identities were were made known we would now dealing with human beings

456
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:22,880
Today I live in the senior citizen apartment building

457
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:25,184
What's different now

458
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:28,000
Is that I can be free

459
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:31,584
I have a daughter who's a senior citizen in my son is 58

460
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:33,120
They know

461
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:33,888
About

462
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:36,192
My homosexuality

463
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:39,520
My three grandchildren in the thirties

464
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:41,568
Know about that grandmother

465
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:45,408
I have a great-granddaughter who at the age of 10

466
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,736
Learned that grandma Jerry was a lesbian

467
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:51,808
And she thought that was most interesting

468
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:55,648
Jack by still don't have the personal courage

469
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,000
Black hair

470
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:03,072
Beijing to Summit Building

471
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:05,376
Know that Jerry is a lesbian

472
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:10,240
Well I retired from the police department in 1976

473
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:15,104
20 is a Pastime I'm going to be 70 in a few months

474
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,688
I still don't know the answers I would still like to know the answer

475
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:22,528
I would like to know whether I was wrong with her I was right

476
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:26,112
In NFL thinking that there was a dick

477
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,672
And it was thinking that maybe

478
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,000
You shouldn't trust a homosexual because

479
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,560
Something is missing in his personality

480
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:37,632
The Archives of lesbian culture

481
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:41,728
Which surrounds us now and was created for years after Stonewall

482
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:46,848
Hose at least from my part it's creation to that night in the courage

483
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,128
That

484
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:50,944
Found his voice in the streets

485
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,016
That night

486
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,832
In some very deep way

487
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:59,648
We finally found our place in history

488
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:02,464
Not as a dirty joke

489
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:06,816
Not as a doctor's case study

490
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,888
Not as

491
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:11,680
Freak

492
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:13,472
But as a people

493
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:17,312
Today I'm a 38 year old drag queen

494
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:23,968
I can keep my long hair I can pluck my eyebrows and I can work wherever the hell I want

495
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:27,552
And I'm not going to change for anybody

496
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,880
If I change that I feel that I've

497
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:33,184
But I'm losing

498
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:36,768
What 1969 brought into my life

499
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:40,864
And that was to be totally free

500
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:45,216
How can I

501
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,264
Avocado

502
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,176

Remembering Stonewall was produced by Dave I say with Michael shirker

506
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,512
In 1989

507
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:46,144
This documentary was a production of sound portraits which went on to spawn Story 4

508
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,752
Which is dedicated to collecting sharing and preserving people stories from around the world

509
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:57,408
You might have heard storycorps on the radio but they're podcast which is hosted by their producers offers longer stories that go

510
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:59,712

Dim the living room lights to 50%

Okay

531
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:17,280
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

532
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:20,096
Makes for a much more natural experience

533
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:22,144
Turn the living room lights on

534
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:26,240
