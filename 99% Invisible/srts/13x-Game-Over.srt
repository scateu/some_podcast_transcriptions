Check it out

49
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,160
But this is a piece that I really love

50
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,184
That I did for them

51
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,464
For the Utopia epi

52
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,024
And if he has some design implications

53
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,560
So if you can bear with me

54
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,840
You know but otherwise it's a

55
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,376
Fun with Alyssa

56
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:46,912

Destroyer

60
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,056
It's about

61
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,592
An online world

62
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:57,920
That was designed and created by EA Games and Thrift

63
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,968
Turned into a perfect little Utah

64
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:00,736
Copia by the

65
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,272
By the users themselves

66
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,552
But the problem was

67
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,088
Dagames

68
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:05,856
Didn't

69
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:07,648
Any money off

70
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:09,696
Supported anymore

71
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,256
So it's what happens when I created world

72
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,048
I hope you enjoy

73
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:21,472
A few months before the end of the world Paul Monaco posted this message

74
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,240
On YouTube

75
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,544
Hello everyone

76
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,824
Call Monaco here

77
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,848

Do you know me as

79
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:33,504
Probably all heard the news

80
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,808
Online closing down

81
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:42,464
The world that was ending was called The Sims Online it was not online version the most popular computer game ever made

82
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,256
You've all been wonderful

83
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,144
Help me through a hard time in my life when I first got online but ironically

84
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,216
The online version of The Sims was not very popular

85
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:57,568
They ended up losing tons of subscribers and changing the name of the EA land

86
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,848
And then they finally

87
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:03,456
Thank you and please try to stay in touch

Whatever you choose to do and move on to

90
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:17,024
As you can probably hear real and was not a normal video

91
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,071
There are no monsters no killing

92
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,119
And although it had some competitive element

93
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,935
For many players competition wasn't the

94
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:24,703
The point at all

95
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,263
Unlike a lot of other games where you might be

96
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,031
Shooting people

97
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,871
Slaying dragons or something this is a game about socializing

98
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:38,271
That is Robert Ashley Ashley very popular internet radio show the creator of

101
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,511
Love

102
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,047
The crowded attracted I think

103
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:52,095
We're people who just wanted to get together

104
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,375
Answer chat

105
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:58,239
Meet strangers it was a nice place over time it became a kind of intimate

106
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:03,103
Almost bar like the cheers of video games where everyone knows your name

107
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:07,711
Let the moment that Paul Monaco AKA Buddha Paul found EA land

108
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,991
It was exactly

109
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,271
What do you needed most

110
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,063
My wife from

111
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:17,183
A long-term illness she had blood transfusion she had hepatitis C

112
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:20,767
3 years of silver life were pretty

113
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,583
Yeah pretty much a challenge for a while for both of us

114
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,887
And after she passed away

115
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,191
I had absolutely no

116
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:31,519
Function of the new wake up go to work and go to sleep again

117
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:36,639
With with her illness I didn't get out of socialize much we know we

118
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:41,503
Weren't able to you know go out to the bars and meet up with friends and have dinner

119
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,551
I totally be socialized myself

120
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:48,927
And this game was, wait for me to just can't get back into into living you

121
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,743
It was pretty amazing

122
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:58,143
And Paul begin to live for real and you would play it for hours and hours with the first thing he did when he got home from work

123
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:14,527
Image feel really good it wasn't the real world his friends were real friends and virtue

124
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,295
Four worlds

125
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:21,695
Do you have an upside your race your car legal in Virginia all that can be totally in your truly

126
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:25,535
Judged on who you really are and how you present yourself

127
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:29,119
There's no no prejudices no preconceived

128
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,911
Anythink

129
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,959
Really taken at face value

130
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:37,311
People could really like break loose and envy themselves and have some fun

131
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:42,175
It just feels really good

132
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:46,783
The Paul's Utopia didn't last because he alien started hemorrhaging money

133
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,879
The writing was on the wall the server was about to go dark and this event

134
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,671
This virtual apocalypse

135
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:55,999
My only exist in the memory of the players if it weren't

136
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,535
4 dr. Henry lowood

137
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:01,375
I just stumbled across and this project by

138
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:04,447
Henry lowood who is this

139
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:11,103
Archival researcher at Stanford. I had a project called how they got game

140
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:14,431
Summit history of digital games and simulations

141
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,967
Saving video games for future

142
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:22,111
Generation Beyond 50 a hundred two hundred years from now are we going to say that history and like we got to save the video game

143
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:28,767
So doctor lowood and his colleagues preserve what happens inside video games no for single player game like

144
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:35,167
Pac-Man for example take the Atari cartridge out and you put it on a shelf but saving multi

145
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,703
3 player online games

146
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,239
Is not so simple

147
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:44,639
Saving the software alone is kind of a bearing exercise he said the code for Yale and turn it on hundred years now

148
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:47,711
You enter a world and nothing would be there

149
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,527
All the things that Paul Monaco and his friends love

150
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:56,159
Would be impossible to find you need to document what people are doing in these spaces

151
00:07:56,927 --> 00:08:03,071
That situation is much more like what a historian on archivist would do when faced with the problem of document

152
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,095
The real world

153
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:09,471
Dr. Leatherwood caught wind of the alien shutting down here the opportunity to record something

154
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,519
Historian or archaeologist

155
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,799
Would die

156
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,335
To witness firsthand

157
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,359
In the real world

158
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:18,687
See what it would be like when an online world

159
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,711
Came to an end

160
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,015
What happens when a virtual world close

161
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:22,783
The end

162
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,879
I'm a culture what is it like to be there at the last minute and then when it shuts down

163
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:34,303
To the tape is rolling in the last few hours of Yale and are being recorded in the most dedicated DieHard users are there

164
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,863
Exchanging virtual hugs reminiscing

165
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:40,703
Players are typing messages which appear like comic book word bubbles in

166
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,495
You hear all these avatars

167
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,031
Crying and hearing all these

168
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:47,615
Cruise and moans in the gibberish language of the game

169
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:51,199
Simlish you know they said they sound like they're going to be bummed and

170
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:54,527
And everything but it's not like a big pity party but then

171
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,807
Toward the end of

172
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,831
Of the night

173
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:00,927
There's this radio station that you can listen to you in a game called Charmed radio

174
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,463
And they had

175
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,743
This TJ there

176
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:04,767
Names

177
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:09,631
Spike he is assertive The only voice that you and appearing at the end of the world

178
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,655
And as soon as

179
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,423
She starts talk

180
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,471
You understand what is

204
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:38,463
To get this field

205
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:43,839
In like being on the deck of the Titanic

206
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:50,751
Very much invested in the game on an emotional level when they pulled the plug on the server bits and pieces of the world

207
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:51,775
Started disappearing

208
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:54,079
Environment began to disintegrate

209
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,127
The Textron the trees flicker

210
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,407
And all the people

211
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,967
And blinked out of existence

212
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:06,623
The actual ending was was

213
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:13,023
You're not with a bang but with a whimper and the last thing that they saw was basically just an error message a server.

214
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:13,791
Disconnect message

215
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,287
And then

216
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,079
The world ended

217
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,831
That was a game over

218
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,367

00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,391

You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath
