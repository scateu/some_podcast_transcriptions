This is 99% invisible

28
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,864
I'm Roman Mars

29
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:11,680
My boy Maslow's favorite color

30
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:12,448
Is red

31
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:14,752
My boy Carver is favorite color

32
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:15,520
Is blue

33
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:17,056
Cover

34
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,848
Okay with the color red

35
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,128
But Maslow

36
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,664
Hates blue

37
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:22,688
They're twins

38
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:24,224
And for those who don't know them well

39
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,784
Color they wear is how people tell them apart

40
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:27,808
These colors

41
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:29,856
We're not chosen for them a test

42
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:30,880
Happened is

43
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:32,672
Fundamental to who they are

44
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:34,720
When you're a kid

45
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,256
Your favorite color is

46
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,024
One of

47
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,608
Maybe five of the most important aspects of your personality

48
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,144
Records of Our Lives

49
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,240
The fervor for a specific favorite color tends to die down

50
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:48,288
But over the course of human history

51
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,080
Search for the brightest

52
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,104
Splash of color

53
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,920
Has been a defining feature of our species

54
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:57,504
Concert Sinclair is fascinated by color

55
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,528
How It's Made

56
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,296
What it means

57
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,320
Now defined

58
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:05,952
She wrote a beautiful book called The Secret Lives of color that I love so much

59
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:09,024
But I invited her in to talk with me and she's riveting

60
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,048
So this episode

61
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:10,816
It's just that

62
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,096
My conversation

63
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,120
Kasia Sinclair

64
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,144
All about

65
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,168
Secret Life

66
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,192
Color

67
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,288
How did you begin

68
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:22,080
Becoming obsessed with colors in

69
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:24,128
What made you want to write a whole book

70
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:25,408
The lights

71
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,248
Yes I'm lucky that I came from for a creative

72
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,528
Amelie

73
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,320
My mother was a

74
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,088
Florist

75
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,624
And I have

76
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,904
Very Vivid memories

77
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,440
The kind of messing around in

78
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:41,024
Flower shop when I was little and I would be given kind of like the office

79
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,328
Cuts to make little bouquets from

80
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,632
That was the beginning of my love

81
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:48,192
Ocala but I became interested in it

82
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,216
Academically

83
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,520
I bet you the best because I was studying 80

84
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,056
Centre women's history

85
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:57,664
And more specifically what women wore to masquerade balls during a

86
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,432
Century

87
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,736
And one of the things I loved about

88
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,784
Starting this very Niche topic

89
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,832
Is the fact that I go to read

90
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:07,648
So many journals and letters

91
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,416
About

92
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,440
What people will

93
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:11,232
Planning to Arrowhead wound

94
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,768
Parties in University

95
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,048
Full movies with ghosts

96
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:17,376
Really struck me time again

97
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:20,192
Was the fact that friends will using

98
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,728
Caller-Times

99
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,008
In these letters

100
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,800
And Diaries and that account

101
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:28,896
That was completely unfamiliar to me and I

102
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:35,296
We have to go and do an awful lot of research to try and recreate what. Color might look like and then sometimes it was a dimple

103
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,320
Ultimate yunnan

104
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:39,392
I simply wouldn't ever be able to find out exactly what

105
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,160
Color look like

106
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,720
And the fact that the color of a cobra hitches

107
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:45,280
Shifted you know I was in London

108
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,584
In the same city where the people were

109
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,424
We're writing it out and it really wasn't that long ago historically

110
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,728
And yet the color terminology

111
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:54,752
Chad changed

112
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:57,824
3D was completely the colors that was possible then

113
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,616
What colors the eye

114
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,896
Even recognize

115
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,784
Delete my mind instead of continue to be of interest to Menard

116
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,576
Will be fascinated by it

117
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:12,928
And I mean in your book you talk a lot about the relationship between language and color and

118
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:16,256
One of the most interesting things to me was how different languages

119
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,559
Divide up the color spectrum differently

120
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:23,679
Yes absolutely so if you think about a color wheel or we know if you think about

121
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:24,959
A microwave

122
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:28,031
Representing the colors we could possibly see

123
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:30,079
It wouldn't be in

124
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:36,479
Straight line it would be kind of in a random Blood on the areas where your blue face into green

125
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,271
Phenol red face into

126
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,319
I'm too pink or purple

127
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:45,183
The dividing lines the bit with different cultures

128
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:45,951
Define

129
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:49,023
This is raden and this is blue in this is purple

130
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,559
That can really change

131
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:55,423
And making changes on an individual basis and also on a linguistic basis soap

132
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:59,007
Various languages have divided up the Spectrum

133
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:04,383
Differently in two more or fewer groups through 7 in different ways surf example

134
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,663
I'm Russian speakers

135
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:12,063
Wordful darker blue on the word philosophy for example and some languages only

136
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,599
Need to buy the color spectrum

137
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,367
Instacart

138
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,671
304 grade

139
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:17,695
Right

140
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,487
I was struck by this in your book that

141
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,279
When the section on pink

142
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,327
That there's a word for pink

143
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,631
And there's no word for light

144
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,423
Yellow or light green

145
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:30,239
It's just it's so strange that has its own nomenclature

146
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:34,079
Yeah it's a real set of cultural Oddity I'm particularly

147
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,895
Your pink now play suction outside

148
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,431
Role in our culture basic

149
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:42,015
Associated with women and girls by good on l

150
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,039
Peru ceviche

151
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:46,879
We just seem to really love it in western culture comes up a lot

152
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:51,743
And you're right you know far more than you would think of say up a pale green or or

153
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:52,767
Or pale blue

154
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:57,375
I mean there's a sense that these colors is this kind of his Concepts but

155
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,423
Your book The Secret Lives of color

156
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,727
Is really about color in the material world

157
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:02,751
Girls about the pigments

158
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,519
Themselves

159
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,103
Until I kind of want to go through a few of those pigments to sort of tease out

160
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:07,871
These types of

161
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,919
Stories that we get an isbn number

162
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:10,943
We could just start with red

163
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,247
Because it seems to be the most universally loved

164
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,271
Color through history

165
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:16,575
Why is that

166
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:20,927
Yeah it's pretty interesting one so one of these questions that I

167
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:25,023
Get off keto without fail every time I do a talk about color

168
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,559
Is weather

169
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:30,143
Colosseum make humans have a set of real physical response

170
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:33,727
And quite often decide are is Connor

171
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,495
Phoenix Lights

172
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:40,895
Junk science you know like pink makes you calm will we know whatever and it's very hard to really pin down

173
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:41,663
Valid

174
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,943
Pontificator

175
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:46,527
Red is the color where

176
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,807
The most test

177
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,087
Happened on

178
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:50,879
The most active

179
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:53,439
Come back with with fatty compelling result

180
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,207
Yes

181
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:57,791
Redis have some form of measurable

182
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:58,815
Impact

183
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,863
That's why

184
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,935
You get it so widely across

185
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,471
So many different cultures

186
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,519
Because it does seem to

187
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,799
Make us one

188
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:09,567
Spawned

189
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:13,151
In this really elements way so one of the

190
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,687
Examples of faith

191
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,455
Is that

192
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:17,759
If you look at movie games of

193
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,295
Establo Osaka

194
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,319
Dipping plate

195
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,623
Since the Second World War

196
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,903
In the UK

197
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:27,487
Teams that are wearing red have one

198
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:30,559
When I fridge more than they then they should have done statistic

199
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:38,495
And there was another similar study done on the Olympics as well as you know the Athens Olympic Games

200
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:42,847
On a non-combat for today and again he had similar results

201
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,383
What does deceive mean

202
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,199
Incredible but also makes you think that you have ass play

203
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:51,807
Thought you should definitely make sure you was a team wearing red

204
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:57,951
Talk about how people made red in the ancient world

205
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:02,047
Show so I'm one of the dates of oldest pigments

206
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:05,375
I'm always red pigments that we know about is is hematite

207
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:09,215
Which essentially you can kind of think of like rusticity

208
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,239
It's on outside

209
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:13,567
You find it in in Oak Hills right ashoka's and

210
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:18,175
The chemical compounds which is made of really common

211
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:22,527
In the Earth's crust you get kind of red red tinted

212
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,343
Either geographically really widespread areas

213
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,647
So it's not surprising in a way that it's

214
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,439
Crop top in a lot

215
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,975
If I'm difference

216
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,511
Archaeological context

217
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,047
All over the world and then

218
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,583
China North America

219
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,167
North Africa Europe. Again again again

220
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:45,311
It's so Universal that it was dumped by a 1980s anthropologist

221
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,871
Just wanted to see if the two consistent

222
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,431
Markers of Chi-Chi human evolution

223
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,711
Along with to make a

224
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,759
How's the weather

225
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:57,855
Hematite red into making are the things that make humans human

226
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:00,159
Yeah

227
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:04,255
But hematite Sarah falls out of fashion because

228
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,279
We find

229
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,559
Brighter version

230
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:10,143
The one of the reasons why I love

231
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,679
Color is a subject

232
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:15,263
Yeah I'm just so fascinated by it because humans have always

233
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,543
Going to the most

234
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,567
Extreme

235
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,615
An extraordinary lengths

236
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,407
To get that hums

237
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:28,063
On brighter and more interesting Shades and that's really evident when he talked about red so yeah yeah

238
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,367
If they have this really white available

239
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,135
Weather

240
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,159
That you bacon

241
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:35,999
If they got famous anywhere in the world but that is not enough it's not bright enough

242
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:39,071
And so somewhere along the line

243
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,143
Someone that discovers that if you crush up

244
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,679
A type of apple

245
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,703
Scale insect

246
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:49,311
That can be found in in Europe called that is neither could become is

247
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,335
Scale insect

248
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,127
That you can produce

249
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,687
I really am quite vibrant

250
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,455
Reds

251
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,223
Die

252
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,527
And this was a highly

253
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,575
Mokena on clothing it was

254
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:06,207
Used to clean a status symbol and it was also very expensive and because

255
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:08,511
The finest of a cloth

256
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:15,167
And the expensive. I went together there's no point in having a really beautifully manufactured wood and cloth

257
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:18,495
And then thawing it a color is associated with poverty

258
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,543
I'm a particular type of

259
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,823
Very fine cloth

260
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,103
Cool Scarlet

261
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,407
Wisp usually tied with

262
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:28,991
Descaling sex will you see if she died this very vibrant red

263
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,807
And So eventually the name of the cloth

264
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,599
Scarlet woollen cloth

265
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:38,719
Became kind of synonymous with the red that was so often died and that's kind of how

266
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:44,607
The name Scarlett and the color red came together that she should have borrowed from a very fine wooden clothes

267
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,399
That's amazing

268
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,983
It is another red that you can help me pronounce this is like

269
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:56,127
Coach Anil how do you say

270
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,151
TTM

271
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:00,735
Scarlet Azusa made with a scale insect

272
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:04,319
This one rather than being European

273
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:07,647
Is very common in South and Central America

274
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,183
And was used

275
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:11,487
Very widely biotics

276
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:14,815
Antenna man in Kazan In the Intercultural again it was

277
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,095
Associated with

278
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:18,399
With relays and and Power

279
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:20,959
Positive

280
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:21,983
Taxation

281
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:25,311
Histamine away so when there was a vassal state

282
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:28,127
And the bottle States would be expected to

283
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,919
Give the rulers

284
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,199
Certain numbers of

285
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,759
All femcare chenille

286
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:36,575
Die all the dried bugs

287
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:39,135
Through every month or two months

288
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:41,183
Depending on how well fetus

289
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,487
Allstate walls

290
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:46,559
Highly valued in an embedded in the culture

291
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,583
How did

292
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,607
Discolor

293
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:51,167
Interact with colonization in trade

294
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:51,935
Around the world

295
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:54,495
Food colors and colorants

296
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:59,103
You haven't been one of those things that people go and take over the countries and

297
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:01,151
Exploit of the areas of the world

298
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:03,711
For either that very often natural resources.

299
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,735
The people desperate

300
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,759
Set the hounds on

301
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:09,343
And they can make an awful lot of money from back home

302
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:12,415
I'm so nakusha Neil was one of the

303
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:17,791
The Spanish word with the desperate to get their hands on in order to get

304
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,559
This red

305
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,327
Colorance

306
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:23,167
Back to Europe where it was actually many times stronger

307
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:27,007
Then the commies died that had been originally used to

308
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,567
I'm color Scarlet cloth cushionless is much

309
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,335
Stronger

310
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:34,175
I'm so it's much more cost-effective and great sums of money

311
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,735
Could be made and mermaids

312
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:39,551
In the Expo and in use of this die

313
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,855
And it took like 70 thousand bugs

314
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,135
Pound of

315
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,159
Coutinho right

316
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,951
Yeah I mean

317
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:52,351
In with all these dyes that are made out of animals or Animal product in this reality

318
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:58,495
The pool at creature that's involved in the making of the color really does get completely homity a very often it takes

319
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:02,335
An awful lot of them to produce not very much time

320
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,383
And often you find he died

321
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,687
Temping driven to the brink of Extinction

322
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:09,759
Because people are so Keen to get their hands on on the

323
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:10,527
Color

324
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,063
And do we still use insects

325
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,111
Like they used to make pigments today

326
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:18,975
Yes so there is a spot East Side

327
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,279
Particular color in it

328
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,583
Queen of consent a natural Reds

329
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,863
Colorado booster because it's

330
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:27,423
Nesbit really highly pigmented

331
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,215
Is been used in car

332
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:32,031
Food and Uso cosmetic surgery

333
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:38,175
If you were to look at your stupid yogurt to or something like that you might see that it's been colored with

334
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,455
Carminic acid

335
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,503
We might see it down as the color

336
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,551
120 and not

337
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,831
Is it in fact

338
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,111
Cochineal

339
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:53,279
Okay

340
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:58,655
Yes but if you think about it all the covens that they used in food I mean

341
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,191
Maybe

342
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:03,007
We're all different but you know if you replace

343
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:08,639
Amy 21-20 with another color and that the likelihood is that that color it might well be

344
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,407
An extra

345
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:14,783
From like a cult of sludge just learned a lot about that coloring come from so I don't know

346
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:19,391
Kotaro Oldsmobile

347
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:24,511
Turn the color pigment can be pretty rare in nature intensive

348
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:29,119
Require the wholesale Slaughter of an entire species to make it happen

349
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,167
Which brings me to

350
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,447
Tyrian purple

351
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,471
Can you talk about

352
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:38,079
Yeah so this is one of my favorite stories

353
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,359
From the Spurs

354
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,639
Because many people

355
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:45,759
Office automatic association between royalty and purple

356
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:49,599
And it's one of those kind of cultural thinks that maybe you didn't think about too much

357
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,647
Actually

358
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:54,463
The link goes really far back

359
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:57,535
Audit is based on this amazing

360
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,559
Purple guy

361
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:01,887
I'm cool tyrian purple again it's an animal-based

362
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,423
I colored it comes from

363
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,215
Two varieties of

364
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:05,983
Shellfish

365
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:08,543
That all Native to Mediterranean

366
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:13,663
And if you were to go in a nun find some one of these selfish

367
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:16,735
I'm back white spiny so you have to be careful when you picked it up

368
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:17,503
If you attack

369
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,527
Crack it open

370
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,551
You would

371
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,599
Seated as kind of a apparel

372
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,623
Blinds

373
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,647
Runs across

374
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,671
Steve

375
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,463
The back of the of the shellfish

376
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,487
Auntie

377
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:30,815
Gland contains feet in a single drop of liquid

378
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:36,191
Smells a little bit like garlic apparently it's very unpleasant smelling like garlic breath

379
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,727
Ons this

380
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,751
Liquid

381
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,519
Is

382
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,055
Phenomenal when it's

383
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:45,407
Exposed to the light if you want to rub it on a piece of cloth Express a piece of toast to the light

384
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:49,759
It would have Me Gently change color with tiny yellow and then green

385
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,831
And then blue and then finally purple

386
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:59,487
Call of Duty produces is very distinctive and very vibrant and this was to die

387
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,511
Beloved

388
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,303
By the ancient world

389
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:05,119
And became again because it's very expensive

390
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,167
Really appreciated with

391
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,447
Chihuahua and

392
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,471
Royalty

393
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:12,031
So again you get off of legislation

394
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,823
Dictating who

395
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,895
Katadyn called where it is a kind of famous

396
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:22,271
Story about the emperor Nero who 10.2 a recital

397
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:24,063
I'm so a woman

398
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,599
I'm in the audience

399
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:30,719
Wearing a tyrian purple gown and she wasn't either of their of the rights and cloth

400
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,999
What state has to wear it

401
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,047
I'm so he had her

402
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,839
Taken from the room

403
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,399
Whipped and told her lands confiscated

404
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:40,191
It's because he's so this is a real

405
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,287
A wave he's up in his own power because she was

406
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,079
Taking

407
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,383
The power bestowed by this

408
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,175
Color was supposed to symbol

409
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,967
Which is kind of amazing

410
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:52,735
Yeah

411
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:53,759
Back again

412
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,295
Like the full scale

413
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:57,343
Bugsby for shellfish

414
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,903
United went through went through horror

415
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:00,927
Because of humans

416
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,463
Decipher this powerful

417
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,487
Hillside United

418
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:06,303
It takes about 250000

419
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,607
Of these shellfish to produce

420
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,143
Just an ounce of dye

421
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:14,239
Anso people hunting these selfish

422
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,519
Extinction

423
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:17,823
Chicken and using so many of these shellfish

424
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,871
Absolutely amazed

425
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:22,943
Geographical features if you go back to some of the

426
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,295
I'm the areas of the world were producing this die in the classical era

427
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:30,367
The discarded shells who makes become conniff

428
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,391
Hills

429
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,183
Outside the town

430
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:39,071
I'm very often downwind of the Town who the guy works with associated downwind

431
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:45,471
Say that the citizens who ended up wearing it's a real purple gowns when people that buy the smell of the money fight

432
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,031
Until when did

433
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,055
Purple

434
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,335
You kind of lose

435
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,103
It's

436
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:53,919
Association has always been associated with royalty

437
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,455
When did it become

438
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:57,759
Acceptable for a common Folk

439
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,295
To wear at without getting wet

440
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:03,135
Tyrian purple

441
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,927
Both because the shellfish

442
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,975
And it became incredibly rat

443
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,535
Suicide because of political

444
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,559
Tom Wales

445
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,607
I'm around the Mediterranean

446
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,655
Which kind of really disrupted

447
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,191
Steve Emmanuel

448
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,983
Jeff of the die

449
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:21,823
3M public self need a large disappeared from from View

450
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,871
Proper kind of goes into a little bit of it

451
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:24,639
Define

452
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,455
Until the mid-nineteenth century

453
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,735
When I didn't

454
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:32,831
Kylie new purple dye was discovered completely box

455
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,647
Understood letter Revival

456
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:36,927
And what's that

457
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:37,695
What's that

458
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:40,767
Somd the new purple guy that was

459
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:43,327
Covered in the mid-nineteenth century is Kool Moe

460
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:47,423
And it was discovered by an 18 year old scientist who is

461
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,495
At home on holiday

462
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:54,335
And, using his his vacation time to

463
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,615
Try and find

464
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,895
A synthetic

465
00:18:57,407 --> 00:19:00,735
Version of Queenie in which was a cure for malaria the time

466
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:05,343
A malarial a use for severely common in Europe newest tool to be able to

467
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,135
Juice is synthetic we need

468
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:10,207
Would be kind of a huge moneymaker if anyone you could

469
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,231
Discover it

470
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:14,047
But that's what he was doing you spending his days

471
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,071
You know what's on this

472
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,607
I'm in his father's office

473
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,935
On one of his failed experiment

474
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,215
He ended up with it is

475
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:22,239
It is test you

476
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,287
Was Ethel purple

477
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,311
Sludge

478
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:28,639
I think you know he definitely knew this wasn't cleaning

479
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:29,919
But I think

480
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:35,295
Possibly because he was interested in Alton painted in in his younger days

481
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,111
He decided to just throwing

482
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,903
This purple sludge away

483
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:43,999
Without a bit of water to it and then he would defend a piece of cloth

484
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:48,095
And what he discovered was that he had completely accidentally

485
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,119
Made

486
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:54,239
A really colorful stand very vibrant purple dye and this was

487
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,287
Incredibly moving parts of lead

488
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,567
To a whole

489
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:58,847
Revolution

490
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:01,151
In synthetic dyes

491
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:04,991
You know what the flip is the first synthetic are they could be manufactured

492
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,783
You're not using any

493
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:12,159
Natural component so no bugs no fetal snowquill shellfish

494
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:14,463
And I need just allowed

495
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:16,767
Purple to be worn by monk

496
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:17,535
Greatest sex

497
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,327
Society than ever before

498
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,375
Until the invention of Mo

499
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,911
Really just impacted being

500
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,959
Tire textile industry because

501
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:27,519
Cuz of this possibilities are opened up in order

502
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:28,543
Official dying inside

503
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,567
The right way to put it

504
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:35,711
Yeah so they already know you think it would be kind of immediate you think that either the whole world would very quickly

505
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:40,063
Call Nan if you'll excuse the pun to the value of this

506
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:43,391
Of this synthetic dye but in fact it took a while

507
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:46,975
Oh I'm the scientist who quotes and William parking

508
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:48,511
To persuade

509
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,303
M textile dyes

510
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,631
Did they switch the way forward because they were used to working with

511
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:54,911
Natural plant

512
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,263
I mean idea of a synthetic doll I was really alien teeth

513
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,311
And it was in fact in a his

514
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,335
Best

515
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,639
Only buddy Hawkins love you by accident

516
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,407
It's because

517
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,175
Keep

518
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,711
Just waited a couple of

519
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:12,319
Textile mills to use this died and one of them ended up

520
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:14,111
I'm selling a gown

521
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:18,208
Two members of royalties are princess Eugenie

522
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:21,536
I got on in this powerful and then

523
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,816
The real clincher

524
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:25,632
Was Queen Victoria wore a move down

525
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:28,704
2hat what if I do to his weddings

526
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,008
Andy Scottsdale greatly reported

527
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:32,032
In the Press

528
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,824
New color

529
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,360
And it became a complete

530
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,640
Fashion trends

531
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:40,480
So much so that year off. Queen Victoria had one this down

532
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:43,296
A substitute Rico English newspaper

533
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:47,648
Reported that London had become Afflicted with the move measles

534
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:49,952
So many people wearing this color

535
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,256
I think it was intrigued

536
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,792
Especially by

537
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,584
The color green in your book

538
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:56,864
Because

539
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,400
It seems like

540
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:01,216
It is this thing is so fundamental to Nature

541
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:01,984
It's everywhere

542
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,264
But

543
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,824
It was historically really challenging to make

544
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:06,848
Could you

545
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,128
Explain why that is

546
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,712
Yasso and Willow

547
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,736
Like you say we

548
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:16,576
We could look around the world and it seems like there's a lot of green

549
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,112
In Orwell

550
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:18,880
In fact

551
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:21,440
It's very difficult to make stable

552
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,464
Vibrant

553
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,744
Green colorants

554
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,536
Either is as pigments

555
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:27,072
Inpaint but also

556
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,608
In thighs as well

557
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,400
And there was some who

558
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:34,752
Blesiv adeptus and I'm very often the office to able to make

559
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:40,384
Vibrant greens with make them by layering various different colors on top of each other

560
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,248
Daya's would have to serve again what would serve several different eye colors which was

561
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:48,832
Either in the Medieval World The Mixing of dyes is really frowned on

562
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,880
Why is that

563
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:54,720
It's often because of Guild restrictions

564
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,000
Because they were

565
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:58,816
Very protective of that Guild skills

566
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:00,352
I'm so

567
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,120
Daya's

568
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,144
Guild doubt

569
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,424
With words

570
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,728
Indigo blue dyes

571
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,264
Was very reluctant

572
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,568
Tuesday work with yellow coloring

573
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,384
I'm so the mixing of blue and yellow.

574
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,968
Taqueria green what simple machine is is devilish already transgressed

575
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:16,736
Save in many ways

576
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:19,808
Amazing it is like something that you know any kid

577
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:20,576
With paint

578
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:21,600
Knows how to do

579
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:22,624
Almost

580
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:26,464
Yeah it is an old one and it's one of those things right

581
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,256
You suddenly realize how

582
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,584
A way you are for the people you're studying

583
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:37,984
When you're reading these these documents you're looking at these kind of debate surrounding it and then prosecution's you're the prosecution of

584
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,032
People making green cloth

585
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:45,408
Two artists were able to find good Reds and could yellows but greens were

586
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,200
Define how did they end up

587
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:47,968
Finding the right

588
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:48,736
Bright green turf

589
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:49,504
Painting

590
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:54,368
He hasn't said greens were Lucifer's some artists were able to create

591
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,160
Vibrant greens by

592
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,184
Using condom

593
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,464
Intermediary

594
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:03,328
Maison dinner with a real kind of trade skill it was a closely guarded

595
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,864
Secrets by some artist

596
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:07,680
Secret today I agree in their ability to create the

597
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,472
Peaceful colors

598
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:11,008
Put that on

599
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,032
Sweetie very many

600
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,056
Staples

601
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,336
Natural

602
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,872
Green pigments

603
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:17,664
Fitts Auto

604
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:18,688
Have access

605
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:23,040
Which meant that when they started being created in the

606
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,856
Unirush of of Mew

607
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,136
Chemicals in

608
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:28,416
Experimentation

609
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:30,208
In the 19th century

610
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,816
The creation of new greens that would take out really rapidly

611
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,096
How much

612
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,376
Stooped

613
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,144
Cast

614
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,936
Why she was contained

615
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:40,960
In these greens

616
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,008
In particular

617
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,032
A green called

618
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,056
She was Green

619
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:49,152
Could you tell us about the uptake of that and the horrible effects

620
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,760
Yeah so this was created by a

621
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:55,040
Swedish

622
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:55,808
Scientist

623
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,112
In 1775

624
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,136
And

625
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:00,672
Because there was

626
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,952
Death of

627
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,232
Bright green pigment

628
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:05,024
It's on the market in this was relatively

629
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:05,792
Cheap

630
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:08,352
It got taken up by artists

631
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:11,936
Wallpaper manufacturers and

632
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,216
Dressmakers

633
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,752
Incredibly quickly

634
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,080
Well within a decade it was kind of everywhere

635
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:20,128
One of my favorite stories is that

636
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:22,176
The writer Charles Dickens

637
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:26,272
Came back from a trip to Naples where he seen a lot of the screen

638
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:27,296
Being used

639
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:32,160
And decided that he's going to decorate his entire house

640
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:35,232
This is one particular shade of green

641
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:38,048
Peter from the basement to the Attic

642
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:40,608
I'm very lucky for him and fast

643
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,704
I have never ran into his work his wife

644
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,728
Dissuaded him

645
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:47,776
I said that she thought it was disgusting,

646
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:50,592
And he ended up not

647
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:52,896
Erasing his entire house

648
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,432
This particular

649
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:55,712
Drawfee

650
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:56,992
Emerald green

651
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:59,296
Luckily for us because it was

652
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:01,600
Discovered is pigment that was made

653
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:03,136
Live from off neck

654
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:05,952
Was really poisonous or could be really poisonous

655
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:07,488
It was found that

656
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:11,328
In samples of wallpaper that we know any few inches across

657
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,888
Contains enough off Nick to kill

658
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,704
Two adults one of the industry's

659
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:19,008
The screen was really

660
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,848
Popular in with the artificial flower industry because of Syracuse tips

661
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,128
Paint the

662
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:27,456
The stems and under the leaves of these artificial flowers

663
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:30,272
Goku's Matilda

664
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,344
He was quite young athletes 2018-19

665
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:38,720
Started working at a special flower factory and very quickly became very ill

666
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:44,096
A doctor in London that started looking into the causes of this because

667
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:46,912
You know she had a really disparate array of

668
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:47,680
Symptoms

669
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:48,960
And eventually

670
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:52,800
Discovered that it was the screen colorant but by that time it was faulty late it was

671
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:58,432
All over the country all over the world that was used in wallpaper and dress fabric

672
00:26:58,944 --> 00:26:59,968
You know you name it

673
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,016
It was it was it was painted this

674
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,552
United off Nick Laden

675
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:05,344
Green but one of the most

676
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,112
Famous

677
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:06,880
Supposed

678
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:07,648
Victims

679
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:08,672
The screen

680
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,464
Napoleon

681
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,488
It was found

682
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:13,024
Couch off to his death

683
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,816
That was

684
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:18,912
Quite a lot of green in the wallpaper that was used to decorate his room

685
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:24,032
I just thought for a long time that this arsenic green might have contributed to his death

686
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,080
Subsequent

687
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,104
Task

688
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,640
About to be shown

689
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:31,200
Remember to find some samples of his hair

690
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:33,248
Throughout his life goodness and he knows how

691
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,528
But they test movies

692
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:40,416
I found that we had really high off Nick levels throughout his life

693
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:42,208
And it didn't rise

694
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:42,976
Suspiciously

695
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,000
Just before his death

696
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,536
I'm old I'm sure

697
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:47,072
Peter being in a room

698
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:50,400
Covered with with Asatru paper contacts helped his gun

699
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,936
Is Health one little bit

700
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:53,984
Strange things I think

701
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:55,264
You learn

702
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,288
Reading your book

703
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,056
Is

704
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,616
The place of blue

705
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:00,384
In history

706
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,200
How popular was blue in

707
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:08,064
So now it's one of the most

708
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,600
Popular if not the most

709
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:10,880
Popular color

710
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:13,952
Globally among men and women

711
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:14,976
And it

712
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,768
Conniff and seen as being

713
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:19,840
Inspiring trust and confidence in

714
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,120
All good things

715
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,656
And you kind of

716
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:24,704
You're tempted to kind of push.

717
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,240
Into history but in fact

718
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:30,336
If you look at the ancient world and I'm kind of really up until

719
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,872
14th century

720
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,664
Leucine

721
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,200
Unlucky

722
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:36,224
Uncouth

723
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:40,064
Unfashionable Associated the code of barbarism

724
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:43,392
Sticky in the west disses in West Des Moines West

725
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:48,768
It was only with the kind of the rise of the cult of the Virgin Mary

726
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,048
In Christianity

727
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,840
Because she was partly

728
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:53,376
Depicted wearing

729
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:55,168
Bibliocommons

730
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:58,496
That blue becomes assertive have this car

731
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,520
Cultural

732
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:02,848
Resurgence in in Western thought and suddenly became

733
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,128
Pretty quickly

734
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:04,896
A real

735
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:09,504
Carla decided to the picture wearing blue

736
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,064
Who made that decision to change the world

737
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:19,488
Yes it's coming around about the same time that because of the Virgin Mary was crying

738
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,768
Vu

739
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:21,536
Of this Petit

740
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,560
Takeda pigments

741
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:23,840
I'm altering which

742
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:26,400
Made from lapis lazuli

743
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:28,192
Was growing and being caught

744
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:28,960
Affected

745
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:32,288
And again because it was this really

746
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,056
Vivid

747
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:33,824
Color

748
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,848
I was incredibly

749
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:35,616
Expensive

750
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:38,688
It became a way of autists and patrons

751
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:41,248
A showing that Devotion to the Virgin Mary

752
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,552
By depicting her in this Redux

753
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:44,320

To a pigment

783
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:52,672
Takes an awful lot of hard work

784
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:53,440
Des Moines

785
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:57,024
Afghanistani Minds with the lapis lazuli I came from wearing

Two donkeys and camels

789
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:02,400
Take it across

790
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:05,472
So creep to the coast of the Mediterranean put on ships

And they usually fat shop in in Venice

792
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:09,824
What you said of the

794
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:13,408
Luxury goods

795
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,688

797
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,784
An artist who bought his his pieces

798
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,320
Pavlakis La-Z-Boy

799
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:22,112
The work was still

800
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:25,952
Awesome Ava Stein had to be ground down to a powder

801
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:30,560
And then I have to be purified those bits of fools gold and the white

802
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:34,912
Traceries I mentioned in the original stud hats those elements

803
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:35,936
To be removed

804
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:36,960
Because they

805
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:39,264
Tons the blue color

806
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,032
Adult

807
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:42,080
And the way that was done

808
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:43,872
Is the blue

809
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:45,152
How did blue stone

810
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:46,432
Would be mixed

811
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:48,480
With mastic wax

812
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:53,088
And then it would be needed almost like yourself needing a dough to make bread

813
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:56,416
It is solution of of lie

814
00:31:56,928 --> 00:32:02,560
And as the door was was needed and the flakes of blue

815
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,608

816
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:07,424
To the bottom of the LIE solution

817
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:11,776
I need them be up to tip off the lie and you have blue bright blue sediment

818
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,056
The contender

819
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,080
Be used

820
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:16,896
App to create an amazing pigment

821
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:19,968
Ultramarine that was just beloved of artists

822
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,248

Medieval artist and Artisan the Renee

824
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:25,600

825
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:27,392
Pigments that was used

826
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:30,464
During this time and very often when you see

827
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,512
Painting of the Virgin Mary she'll be

828
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:34,048
Swayze

829
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,632
Kelly Clarkson and usually doctor who painted

830
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:38,912
Using ultramarine

831
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,728
The root of one of my favorite

832
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:43,008
Kind of color facts

833
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,568
Which is that Tina will there now we think of

834
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:46,592
Pink is being

835
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:47,360

837
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,664
Is being for boys

838
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,456
In fact if you were to go back to the

839
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:54,272
Adjustable air force entry a century-and-a-half

840
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:59,648
It was the other way around pink and and was so seeing his pale red and was much more associate

841
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:00,928
Did with boys

842
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,512
And blue because it's a station with the Virgin Mary

843
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:07,072
Racine is the most feminine and dainty color

844
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:10,912
The process

845
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:13,472
Extracting and purifying

846
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:14,496
Colors seem so

847
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:15,776
So arduous in

848
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,824
It speaks to the desire for the end product

849
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,592
But they would go through

850
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:19,360
You such a pervert

851
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:20,384

Of like

856
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:27,296
Basically

857
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:30,880
Food shelter in the brightest color imaginable

858
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,976

859
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:37,536
Yeah we we we love

860
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:38,816
Shiny

00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:42,144
Bright colors and we are prepared to do all sorts of

862
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,448

What came first

865
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,128
Set the color with app

866
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:54,944

Traveled across the Wild Roots its name and it's

869
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,488
Color with it

870
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:08,512
Which is rather nice butt

871
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,304
In the English language

872
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,096
Oranges called oranges

873
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,888
Eudoxie cool yellow red

874
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,448
Which kind of makes sense but isn't

875
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,472
Yeah

876
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:18,752
Is a bit long-winded

877
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,544
So what's up Broadway

878
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,824
About the color

879
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:25,408
I think people think a black is one thing but they're a lot stiffer

880
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,176
Shades of blue

881
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:27,456
Fox could you describe

882
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:29,248

You know clothing store

885
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:39,232
You can find

886
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,512
So many

887
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:42,560
Hundreds thousands of variance

888
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:43,328
Of white

889
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,864
And we can call them

890
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,144
Cream ivory

891
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,960
Lots of different names for them

892
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:51,264
And yet we just have collapse

893
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,056
So many

894
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:54,336
Duffel blog

Fairy

897
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:58,432
Big overarching

898
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,200
Label

899
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,224
I'm in fact

900
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,760
Rock has many different

901
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:02,784
Subtleties

902
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:05,600
Thailand United as as white does

903
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:07,648
And yet we just don't we all

904
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:09,696
A vocabulary

905
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:10,464
O Block

906
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,488
Israeli

907
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:12,256
Cool

908
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:18,656
And it was what was one of the colors I was most worried about when I was writing the book I was like

909
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:21,216
Am I going to get to this one chapter and just have nothing to say

910
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:23,520
I found completely the opposite I found

911
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:24,544
I became

912
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,336
Frustrated I wanted

913
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,872
People of the past

914
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:29,920
To have been as

915
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,200
Excited about

916
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:31,968

00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,040
Redsan

919
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:37,600
Please take it seemed to me that I was

920
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,392
Richness

921
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:41,440
But it seemed a shame

922
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:45,280
The we'd be nice to have the vocabulary takes it to do it just

923
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:49,120
Quotes when you talked to earlier about

924
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:51,680

Into the world

928
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:56,288
How the world

929
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:57,568
Bloated with a

Excitement

931
00:35:58,592 --> 00:35:59,360
And how

932
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:01,664
Amazing is I think of

933
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:03,712
Discovering Racine colorful

934
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:04,480

935
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,272
This the closest

936
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,552
Analog I can come to

937
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:08,832
Is when I saw Manta

938
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,672

Yeah so I guess

942
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:26,240
He's pretty start with the name vantablack it sounds to the ferry space-age but actually it's kind of it comes from a useful

943
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:27,520
I'm acronym

944
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:31,872
Devonte stands for vertically aligned nanotube

945
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:32,896
Array

946
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:34,432
And essentially

947
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,456
Vantablack

948
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:36,480
Is

949
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:39,040
It's not really a color it's more of a

950
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:39,808
Substance

951
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,344
Absorb

952
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,368
Moonlight

953
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,160
Anything else

954
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:44,928
On Earth

955
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,768
And that is because of its structure because of these but Caroline Chu

956
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:50,816
Tiny tiny tiny Cinema

957
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,608
Carbon fiber

958
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,888
Delight

959
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,424
Get Skyrim sword

960
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,472
Between and amongst

961
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:58,496
These fibers

962
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,032
And count get out

963
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,056
Get trapped

964
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:03,616
I'm so very little light is reflected

965
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:04,896
What did they make

966
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:07,968
What it was created for, released

967
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:08,736
Specific

968
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:10,272
Episode

969
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,832
I was created for satellite guidance

970
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,136
The idea being that you know

971
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:17,184
Different satellite TV

972
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,720
Know where it is in

973
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:19,488
Space

974
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:21,280
It takes it an image of what it can

975
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:23,072
See if we're sitting in front of it

976
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:27,936
Then that can be kind of much. With a map of the sky and then do you know the song

977
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:29,216
Play what kind of know where it is

978
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:32,800
And the blocker that you can get the internal working

979
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:34,080
Around the

980
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,872
Have the camera navigation

981
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,688
The bet that because it means says Surplus

982
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:40,224
Destruction in the image.

983
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,784
Will be clear enough for you.

984
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,088
Bez effect for the satellites navigate

985
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,624
I'm so that's been this

986
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,928
God of creation of super Pacs

987
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,464
Yeah by -7

988
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,304
I'm very sad that people who walk we would stop by SoMo make soft light

989
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:57,888
A British company

990
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,728
What about of nowhere discovered a much

991
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:02,752
Blocka blocka

992
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:04,288
And Eva been discovered

993
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:07,104
49er Neva Flats about no point notes

994
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:08,384
I've sent

995
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:09,920
The visible spectrum

996
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:12,736
3D is uncannily block

997
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:16,832
And it's fall to dockets fall to light

998
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:17,600
Disobeying

999
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:21,184
Fruit to give on eyes any information about

1000
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:24,512
The kind of environment within so what I mean by that is

1001
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:27,840
When I first saw a sample of antibiotic it was kind of

1002
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:30,144
Grown on two sample of

1003
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,680
I'm on sub to a piece

1004
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:34,240
Crumpled up aluminium foil

1005
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:36,288
How many looked at the reverse

1006
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:40,896
You could see all the different planes you could see the discomfort piece of aluminium foil

1007
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,456
From the different planes of of light

1008
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:46,272
I'm not give you information about where

1009
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:48,832
Uy relation to the tin foil and

1010
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:50,880
If I was composing an aggressive it

1011
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:54,976
When it was turned over to expose the vantablack coated side

1012
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:57,280
F****** what you sow

1013
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:59,840
Was like a kind of a mistake like an

1014
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:01,120
A black hole

1015
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:02,144
Because

1016
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,728
Your eyes aren't being given enough information

1017
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:06,752
So

1018
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:08,032
What you saw was

1019
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:10,336
Even though you knew that this

1020
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,664
Piece of aluminium foil was was 3D at your house

1021
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,432
The Contours

1022
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:15,712
You couldn't

1023
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:16,736
Define that

1024
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:19,808
Legacy West

1025
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:20,576
A box

1026
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:21,600
Hole

1027
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:22,880
And that was in

1028
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:25,440
Creatively on Sunny Place Mesa

1029
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:30,816
Gmod seeing it in a storm full in a lab

1030
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:35,168
Even though I knew exactly what I was going to see I went there expecting it and yes

1031
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:38,240
Daily I couldn't quite wrap my head around it but it really short

1032
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:39,008
Pipa Lite

1033
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,080
Start today the scientist who is involved in his creation

1034
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:46,688
And he said he was getting cools from people and soon after it been discovered

1035
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:51,040
Telling him that this creation must in some way be associated with

1036
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:51,808
The devil

1037
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:53,856
Anything

1038
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:57,952
That black gave back that little information to our eyes must

1039
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:00,256
People are intrinsically evil

1040
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:02,304
How much is an oz

1041
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:04,608
Yeah and Olney Jack reaction

1042
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:07,168
In fact you know it's incredible

1043
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,960
But it's also

1044
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:10,240
It totally

1045
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:13,056
Harkins back to all these stories that you've told us

1046
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:14,080
But these

1047
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:17,408
Association is Primal associations we have with these colors

1048
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,944
It sounds exactly like

1049
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,480
You know the

1050
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:21,248
Alchemist

1051
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:27,904
Told that they can't mix blue and yellow or they're doing the work of the devil

1052
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,232
Yeah maybe after all

1053
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:35,328
I had a question about the design of the book itself

1054
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,352
It's really beautiful

1055
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,400
And one of the coolest parts

1056
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,424
Is that you have a

1057
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,448
The colored stripe

1058
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:42,752
On the edge of the pages

1059
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:43,520
That go with it

1060
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:44,544
Story

1061
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:47,872
But I couldn't help but think about how stressful it must have been

1062
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:54,528
You know you have to be right on the money that you got the right pigment you know in the printing process

1063
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:55,296
You up at night

1064
00:40:56,064 --> 00:41:02,208
Yes it did not yet but I'm not going to tell you which color is that gives me this still gives me take this life I have I like my

1065
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:03,744
I had anxiety nightmares

1066
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,352
About either people coming at me and say your

1067
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:12,704
Sky blue is wrong or whatever it is I just don't know no

1068
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:19,104
Get myself into so much trouble at the end what was say stupid is that the apostles the argument of the book is that there is no

1069
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,152
True ultramarine

1070
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:22,176
Colors of

1071
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:25,504
Cultural creations and they kind of Shifting all the time

1072
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,552
Tectonic plates

1073
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:29,856
Color is not precise

1074
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:34,464
Spangs it's changing its living it's constantly being redefined and argued over

1075
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:39,840
And I'm not part of the magic over that part of why I loved it but it was a part of why

1076
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:43,168
I'm it is infuriating and particularly when you find yourself

1077
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,960
Definition of having to choose

1078
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:50,080
MAA the right color feeds and every page of your book you end up

1079
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:51,872
Finding the hole

1080
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:55,199
Completely ridiculous then and then casting the Fatiha

1081
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:57,247
Winston car in the fast life

1082
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:08,767
Final story from Kelsey St Clair

1083
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:10,047
About the color blue

1084
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,327
An art forgery

1085
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,095
And not

1086
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:13,631
When we come back

1087
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,287
Between the beats

1088
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:22,591
Bongs and Charter of our devices

1089
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:23,359
We're immersed

1090
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:25,919
The cluttered World a man-made sound

1091
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,199
If

1092
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:31,551
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexa

1093
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:37,439
Is talking to me and my wife is in another room in a kid is in another room and we're all hearing. Voice

1094
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:38,463
Technology

1095
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:39,231
You talk to us

1096
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:41,023
It is a creation of sun

1097
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:41,791
Trash

1098
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:44,607
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

1099
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:47,935
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

1100
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:49,983
To make them more human

1101
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:54,079
Turn the living room lights on

1102
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:55,871
Okay

1103
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:57,407
Dim the living room lights

1104

50%

1105
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:00,223
Okay

1106
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:06,623
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

1107
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:08,927
Makes for a much more natural

1108
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:09,695
Experience

1109
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:11,487
Turn the living room lights on

1110
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:14,815
Dim the living room lights.

Just after the second World War

1122
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:47,583
A lot of people in Europe were being

1123
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:52,191
Prosecuted for collaboration and collaborated with the Nazis

1124

Kalafina Hitler's R&R collection

1134
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:13,695
Itself

1135
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:16,511
The prosecution should have began of this

00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:17,791
Basaltina

1137
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:19,839
And he turned around and said actually

1138
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:21,887
You know you should be prosecuting me

1139
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:24,447
You should think of me as a hero because

1140
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:25,983
Far from selling out

1141
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:28,799
You're amazing. Shown dolls to the Nazi

1142
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:31,103
I was actually doing if I was

1143
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,639
You're creating these

1144
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:33,919
Masterpieces

1145
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:35,455
From scratch I'm a Fool J

1146
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:38,271
I was never selling for me is to the Nazis

1147
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,807
I was just ripping them off

1148
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:42,367
He made a fortune

1149
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:43,135

$1000000 the heat made

1153
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:52,607
By selling these

1154
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:53,887
Then I suppose it all wet

1155
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:56,703
I found himself and it's really odd position

1156
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:57,983
According to Kant

1157
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:00,543
Proved he was guilty of forgery

1158
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:03,103
In order to prove that he was innocent of

1159
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,383
Collaboration

1160
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:05,919
Honesty

1161
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:08,735
Pigments that eventually kind of

1162
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:11,295
Proof that he had forged these pictures

1163
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:13,087

Cobalt blue

1169
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:25,631
Because

1170
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:28,959
It had been discovered a long time off

1171
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:29,983
Ipomoea staff

1172
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:32,287

Ephemere

1175
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,943
Fake for me that he had created

1176
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:40,991
And so he managed

1177
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:42,015
Proof that he was

1178
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:44,319
Guilty of forgery because of the presence

1179
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:45,855
Cobalt blue

1180
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:46,623
