This is 99% invisible

27
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,400
I'm Roman Mars

28
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:50,848
The greatness of New York is perhaps most spectacularly seen and its buildings

29
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:55,968
New York has been forced to build upward

30
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,784
Like the best of these stories

31
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,344
The two bitter Rivals started out

32
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,624
As best friends

33
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:05,696
William Van alen alen was

34
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,000
It kind of the archetypes of

35
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,536
Architect is artist

36
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,328
He looked at buildings

37
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,096
As art

38
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,632
Anyone to do

39
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,424
And Craig Zimmer

40
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,496
Craig Severance is very much architectus businessman

41
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:22,080
He looked at buildings as way to make the land pay

42
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:24,640
They were business partners and as partners

43
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:25,408
They were

44
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,688
Incredible together

45
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,736
Because you had vanallen as the

46
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:29,504
Architect

47
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,272
Does artist

48
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,040
And you have

49
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,832
Severance as the business

50
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,136
Making everything run on time making

51
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:36,416
Work efficient

52
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:41,024
And together they were able to do quite a bit but they were not just business partners

53
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,816
They stood up at each other's wedding

54
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,352
Van Allen was The Godfather

55
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:45,888
Stillwater

56
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:51,776
But years of working together had taken its toll sadly we don't know exactly what this word

57
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:55,104
Potato Factor was other than the fact that

58
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,384
There were some

59
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,408
Records that I do

60
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,176
Discovered just

61
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,456
What about been on one

62
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,480
Change plans

63
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,504
Continuously

64
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,040
Running over budget

65
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,576
And to someone like severance

66
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:05,856
That wasn't going to stand and

67
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,392
Relate on plan

68
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:08,928
Delivering

69
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:09,952
And

70
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,744
I think the severance at a certain

71
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:12,768
Sad

72
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,304
I can do this better on my

73
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:17,376
Telling our story today is Neal Bascomb

74
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:20,448
My name is Neal Bascomb you wrote a great book about this called

75
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,216
Higher

76
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,008
Historic race to the sky

77
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:23,776
In the making

78
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:27,104
Of a city on the author of fire and a number of other

79
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:30,432
At the time of the Van Allen and severance break up

80
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:34,528
New York City was undergoing a boom like nothing ever seen before

81
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,600
Massive wealth concentrated on this tiny Island

82
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:41,184
Turn Manhattan into the most valuable property in human has

83
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:43,488
Women property gets valuable

84
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,024
We build up

85
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,048
The Roaring Twenties

86
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,328
Stock market

87
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,352
Is going crazy

88
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,912
Real estate prices are going through the roof

89
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:55,008
A skyscraper is a machine designed to turn land into money

90
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,288
At least

91
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,568
That's out severance

92
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,336
Skyscraper

93
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:00,640
There were talks of skyscrapers of 12

94
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:01,920
1500

95
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,456
I mean off the chart

96
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:05,504
It was a symbol both of the economics

97
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,272
And also

98
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,040
The times made

99
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,576
Culture-wise we want everything

100
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,344
Faster

101
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,368
Higher

102
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,392
Satyr

103
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,952
And so it sort of all came together

104
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,488
Into the sky sky

105
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:21,375
At this point in 1928 late 1928

106
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:23,423
Van Allen's career is best

107
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,471
Get out in the basement

108
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,775
I mean he's not getting many commissions

109
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,567
Meanwhile Severance is

110
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,335
Going crazy

111
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,895
He's getting commission after Commission on

112
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,175
Building after big building

113
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:36,735
1828 Walter Chrysler

114
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,527
Founder of the Chrysler car account

115
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:42,623
Came to New York City and bought a plot of land and wanted to build with

116
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,159
He referred to as

117
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,695
A monument

118
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,975
Tumi

119
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:51,071
Allen had already been working on plans for the previous owner of that

120
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,911
In Chrysler decide to hire him to develop that plan

121
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,447
It what would become

122
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,215
The Chrysler

123
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,007
Chrysler I thinking

124
00:04:59,263 --> 00:04:59,775
Was

125
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,567
In his own way revolutionary

126
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,615
Very committed to Art and

127
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,383
Design

128
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,919
And I think saw

129
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,967
A very real way I kindred spirit

130
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,783
Meanwhile downtown at 41

131
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,343
Ben Allen ex-partner Craig server

132
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,647
Was building the Manhattan company building

133
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,183
Ei and Severance

134
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,719
Building was very different

135
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:21,023
Kida exactly to his personality

136
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,815
The Manhattan company building

137
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,863
Was downtown the Chrysler Building was

138
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,631
Uptown

139
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,935
Severance was an investor in this

140
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:28,703
This building

141
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,007
It was being funded primarily by

142
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,311
Amanda George ohrstrom Who was

143
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,359
Is considered the Boy Wonder Wall Street

144
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,639
34

145
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,175
Incredibly rich

146
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,199
Incredibly quickly

147
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:41,503
And they're building was

148
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,295
In a very real way I was

149
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,063
How to make money

150
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,111
While the Chrysler Building was

151
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:49,695
Sort of make a monument to what Chrysler had achieved but also

152
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,255
New ground in Ark

153
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:59,423
At the time Cass Gilbert Woolworth Building

154
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,959
Towered over everything

155
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:03,263
792 ft tall

156
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:07,359
What's the tallest building in New York and in true Monument to me fashion

157
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,151
Chrysler set his sights

158
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,943
On his building being taller

159
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,479
And the Woolworth Building

160
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,503
The tallest

161
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,271
In the city

162
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,647
And even though the Manhattan company building didn't quite have the same motivation to be the tallest

163
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,671
To celebrate

164
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,207
One man's greatness

165
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,767
The team decided that they wanted to take

166
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:26,815
And be the tallest

167
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:31,167
I think the motivation initially for the Wall Street Building for the Manhattan company building

168
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,191
Is

169
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,775
One because of the cost of land downtown in Worcester

170
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,311
You have to build High

171
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:40,127
You know got their spreadsheets out and decided

172
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,919
Exactly how high that would be

173
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:47,551
And then they decided to go a little bit higher to have the in-form otter of the world's tallest building which

174
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:48,831
When your

175
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:51,903
Selling office space is something that is real estate agent

176
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,463
You consider hand out a car and says do you want to work

177
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,743
In the world's tallest building

178
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:58,047
So it was a

179
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:58,815
Sales tax

180
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,607
As well as an economic

181
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,167
And so the race was on

182
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,447
2x partners

183
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:06,239
Van Allen with the Chrysler Building

184
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,519
In severance

185
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,799
With Manhattan company building

186
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,335
We're going to battle it out

187
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,359
Supremacy

188
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,383
On the skyline

189
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,223
Initially the Chrysler Building was the first to announce that side

190
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,783
Chrysler and then I'll wait a little bit further along

191
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:23,647
And so they announcing early 1929 that they're going to

192
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,439
Roughly 822

193
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,487
Star than the

194
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:30,559
Woolworth 792 a couple months after that

195
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:33,119
Greg Severance comes out and says we're building

196
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,399
To 840

197
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,215
And then you have this over the course of

198
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,495
Of that year

199
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:41,823
Tickly that summer even as the buildings are going up

200
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:45,151
Setting the foundation even as their War during Steel

201
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:48,223
Then Island and Severance are both changing their plans

202
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,551
Both not knowing what the other person is doing but sure

203
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,319
That

204
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,111
Their respective bosses

205
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:54,879
Want to go higher

206
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:57,695
And I think at this point they very much want to beat each other

207
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,487
But it wasn't just a high price

208
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:01,279
It was also a speed race

209
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:06,655
At the point in the in the summer of 1929 when both of these buildings are going up very fast

210
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,959
It's it's very much who can

211
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:11,007
Did the Woolworth Building first hookah

212
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:13,311
Get out release that first statement saying

213
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,591
World's tallest building

214
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,639
In the public was into it

215
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,919
It was a race

216
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,199
Almost weekly

217
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:19,967
There were

218
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,503
Newspaper articles

219
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,271
About

220
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:28,415
This buildings going higher Christ was going to be 900 ft man Company Billings going to be 950 ft

221
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:35,327
Severn twins premature statements and it was very much covered in the press and in all

222
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,887
Call the New York newspapers of that time which were many

223
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,191
Front page photographs

224
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:40,959
It was pretty incredible

225
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:47,615
Pitbulls Chrysler and vanilla we're not content just being the fastest on the toilet

226
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,687
Remember that I'm going into Chrysler's office

227
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,223
Chrysler's on the floor

228
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,527
You know with plans spread out on the carpet

229
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,319
Looking at how the lobbies going

230
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,087
Shut up

231
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:59,647
Walter Chrysler was very interested in Arden arcade

232
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,207
And so he wanted a beautiful building

233
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,279
A building like none other in the world

234
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:10,911
Meanwhile at the Manhattan company building they see what's happening on the Manhattan company building is there just adding floors

235
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:16,287
Thirsty well the foundation will be able to do this if we had four floors if we had 10 floors

236
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:21,151
We are at the top we can go higher so it was almost incremental movements

237
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,175
Honda Manhattan

238
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:27,551
On the Chrysler Building they were achieving the last-minute height advantages in two ways

239
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,575
1

240
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:32,159
Originally the Dome of the Chrysler Building at Arch Dome was

241
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,183
What's much more

242
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:36,511
Compact as you see it now it's almost like it's stretched out

243
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,071
And that happened because of the height race

244
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,631
I wanted to find more floors it wanted to get

245
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,399
Tim Moore height

246
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:47,007
And so that elegant elongated Dome that we love on the Chrysler Building

247
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,055
Was the result of this silly I Rise

248
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:53,663
But the sneaky masterstroke that ultimately led the Chrysler Building to

249
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:56,479
It surpassed the Manhattan company building for good

250
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,527
Was the gleaming Spires

251
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,295
Called

252
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,063
The vertex

253
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:05,951
And that was 185 foot triangular Spire that was built

254
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:08,767
Inside the stairwell basically the fire

255
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:09,535
Stairwell

256
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,839
Inside the building at the top of the building

257
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,655
Manhattan company building had no idea what we

258
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,935
What's going on if brought up each

259
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,959
Peace separately up

260
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:18,495
The side of the building by Derek's

261
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:23,103
Instructed it inside the fire tower in one day at the Manhattan company building

262
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,383
Finished top.

263
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,431
No chance to add any more floors

264
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,455
Suddenly

265
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:29,503
Best concealed vertec

266
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,831
From inside the building

267
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:37,183
And it's better now I'm sad sort of like a butterfly emerging from its cocoon

268
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:39,231
They put this thing on top of the building

269
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,511
It was 185 ft

270
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,815
Tall and made the Chrysler Building

271
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,583
1000

272
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,607
46 ft

273
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,399
Hi in the tallest structure in the world

274
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,191
Now surpassing the Eiffel Tower

275
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,471
And if you're thinking

276
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:52,543
This is stunt of secretly riveting a giant metal

277
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:55,871
Expired 900 feet in the air sounds ridiculously dangerous

278
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:56,639
You are

279
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:02,527
Is extremely dangerous I I can't imagine today it not getting approval everyone basically

280
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,295
Thinking from

281
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,599
Chrysler the Van Allen is this thing

282
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:06,623
The fall

283
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,695
And if it does you going to impale half a street

284
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:10,975
Armoire

285
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,023
And you can imagine the damage that would have

286
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:17,887
Now you probably know and can clearly picture the now-classic

287
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,679
Art Deco style of the

288
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:22,495
The steel-clad arches

289
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,519
Sunburst

290
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,055
Triangular windows

291
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,591
Not to mention the hood ornament

292
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,871
Eagles

293
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,407
And the hubcap freezes

294
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,455
It was made for a car guy

295
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,247
But it's doubtful

296
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,015
That you

297
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,063
Even heard of them and Company

298
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,087
First

299
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,623
Because now it's called 40 walls

300
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,439
Building

301
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,487
But also

302
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:46,047
Cuz it just never took hold in the public hunting

303
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,071
You know

304
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:53,215
Curiously the Manhattan company building 40 Wall Street got all the accolades

305
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,495
It won awards

306
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:57,311
The design was mostly by this Japanese architect

307
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,847
Yasuo Matsui

308
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:01,151
So we did in a wonderful and in the trade

309
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:03,967
And it was just basically a fairly Bland look

310
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,319
And then you have the Chrysler Building with this

311
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,879
New Dominus nuvertex something

312
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:13,695
Really new yorker the world has never seen

313
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,743
It was pretty remarkable stuff

314
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,047
And it was almost Universal

315
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:21,631
Sleep and it was considered a stunt design

316
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:24,447
Some people called it a monstrosity know it was

317
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:30,847
Largely reviled by architectural critics and it was only overtime at the Chrysler Building

318
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:31,871
Became the sort of

319
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:32,895
Hazard landmark

320
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:38,783
That it is and if the story stop there you might think Van Allen the artistic Maverick won the day

321
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,319
The Chrysler Building

322
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:43,135
What's the tallest structure in the world and even though

323
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:45,695
Design with Pandora Jewelry we all know that

324
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,719
Eventually got it

325
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,487
Do

326
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,511
But the story

327
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,047
Does not in there

328
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:52,095
After all this hubbub

329
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:55,679
Partner against partner fighting for who would be the tallest

330
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,727
Amir 11 months later

331
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:00,543
The great Empire State Building was completed

332
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:03,103
And it became the tallest building in the world

333
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,639
For nearly 40 years

334
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,175
Brinkley

335
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,455
I don't care about that so much

336
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,735
What happened next

337
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,015
Was the real trash

338
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,319
The lack of business acumen

339
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:15,647
That probably contributed to the Van Allen and Severance parting ways

340
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,695
Really came back to buy

341
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,719
William Van alen

342
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,023
He never actually had a contract

343
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,583
With Walter Chrysler to design the Chrysler.

344
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:24,607
Chrysler

345
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:27,935
At the end of the the day so I'm not going to pay you your feet

346
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,215
Sweden have a signed contract

347
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,263
It was widely sort of

348
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:34,591
Considered normal at the time for the architect to be paid

349
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,127
Roughly 6% of

350
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,663
The cost of the building

351
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:40,735
That sum of money is is what van all expected

352
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,783
What Chrysler was willing to pay

353
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,831
Van Allen ended up soon Chrysler

354
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,623
The newspapers

355
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,391
And

356
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,671
At the end of the day

357
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,951
Cass Gilbert

358
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:50,975
Woolworths

359
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:51,999
Came inside you

360
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:52,767
Yes

361
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:53,791
Percentages

362
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,071
Typical rate

363
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,095
That's what man on ship

364
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,143
And I wanted that

365
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,959
But then Allen was never given a major Commission

366
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,727
Again

367
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,591
Both because the Great Depression in head

368
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:09,919
And also because he had now sued his Patron

369
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:10,943
And that was something

370
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,711
Things that I think

371
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:12,735
Others

372
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:13,759
Shied away from

373
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:17,855
Ben Allen spent most of the rest of his life teaching sculpture

374
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,903
The bozarts Institute of Design

375
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,207
But Severance on the other hand

376
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,999
Continue to succeed

377
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,791
The Manhattan company building

378
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:28,863
Did terribly like every other office building

379
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:32,447
In New York at the time but Severance you know when into

380
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:33,983
The depression and

381
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,799
Got a bunch of government work actually built a bunch

382
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:37,823
Hangers for

383
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,359
Her balloons and such

384
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,663
And so he did quite well and

385
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,199
Live nicely in

386
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,735
Died in luxury

387
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,271
So that's at least 1/2

388
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,831
But we do have a happy ending the fact that

389
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,111
The Chrysler Building is so sore

390
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,391
Howard Stark

391
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:54,975
And then Alan we did get the commision of a lifetime

392
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,023
There was no expense spared by

393
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:57,791
Chrysler

394
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,327
If you ever go into

395
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,095
The Chrysler Building

396
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,655
From the lobby all the way to the

397
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,423
The top I mean

398
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,447
Just

399
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:05,727
Expense

400
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,263
Inexpensive

401
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,287
Expanse images

402
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,591
Beautiful Art Deco interior work

403
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,127
Wood paneling

404
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,687
Art Deco murals

405
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,735
Just an incredible building

406
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:17,503
Top

407
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,551
The bottom inside and out

408
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,111
And very rarely do you have

409
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,671
Commission where money is no object

410
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:28,255
In Savannah on was given one shot and I think he can

411
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,863
Greg Severance was standing in front of me

412
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,143
Think I'd say

413
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,703
I wish you worked it out with Van Allen

414
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,727
You did well

415
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,495
You deserved

416
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:39,775
I think

417
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,055
You would have been greater

418
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:41,823
Together

419
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,895
And if I could talk to Van Allen

420
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:45,663
I'd say

421
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:48,479
I'm sorry you didn't get the Biltmore great structure

422
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:49,759
But no

423
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,551
That you created the building

424
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:57,695
I can stop the most architectural e blind and generally disinterested person dead in their tracks

425
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,487
And they will Marvel

426
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:00,511
At your accomplice

427
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,047
No

428
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,375
And to Walter Chrysler

429
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,143
I'd say

430
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,447
You

431
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,495
Pay your bills

432
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,775
Deadbeat

433
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:16,639
I could we could have had another Chrysler Building or something is good

434
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:18,687
You ruined Van Halen live

435
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:22,527
Probably not because the Great Depression and all but we'll never know will we

436
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:35,327
I'm going to need a minute

437
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:41,727
99% in

438
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:45,311
Exam Greenspan Avery truffelman and me Roman Mars

439
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:51,199
We are project 91.7 local public radio kalw in San Francisco

440
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:53,247
And produced are the offices of parks

441
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:57,599
Brilliant Architecture Firm in beautiful Downtown Oakland California

442
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:02,207
When we get a little out of hand they sometimes ask us to use our inside voices

443
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,743
What did I say

444
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,279
You should try working next

445
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,047
Snapdeal

446
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:17,567
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices were immersed in a cluttered world of man-made

447
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,335
Sound

448
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:25,503
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife is

449
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:31,391
Technology talk to us

450
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:33,695
It is a creation of Sonic trash

451
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:40,095
That's Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

452
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,399
To make them more human

453
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:46,239
Turn the living room lights on

454
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:47,775
Okay

455
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:50,335
Dim the living room lights to 50%

456
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,383
Okay

457
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:58,783
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

458
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,855
Makes for a much more natural experience

459
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,647
Turn the living room lights on

460
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:07,743
Dim the living room lights to 50%

461
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:16,447

00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:13,695
Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main guy to know how to do that

483
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:20,095
I kind of thing a few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for a nap

484
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:26,495
Action movie called Immortal cop was found dead in my private gym crushed inside a high-tech

Check weight machine even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it
