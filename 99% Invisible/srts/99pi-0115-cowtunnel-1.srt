This part of Manhattan the westernmost part between SE 34th and 39th streets

35
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:44,960
This

36
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:49,824
Was Cow Country late 19th early 20th centuries

37
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:54,432
Good cattle being herded across 12th Avenue which is now the West Side Highway

She writes a Blog called edible geography

40
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:08,768

Packing District police would like the Meatpacking District

43
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:24,896
It was nicknamed abattoir place

44
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:31,040
Bone boilers hide stretchers and lard renders

45
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:33,344
If you can picture it would have

46
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,696
Disassembly line for every single part

47
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:44,352
Ikaw the council be ferried across the Hudson River from New Jersey

48
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,120
Here

49
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:53,312
Marching a few cows across 12th Avenue to the slaughterhouse was fine you can hold up traffic for that but then came

50
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:57,408
More and more folks in their carriages

51
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:59,456
And then the train came through

52
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:05,856
And cars all the sudden cows are in the way I mean cows move at a different pace and so

53
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:09,696
There were reports this epic cow jams

54
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:14,048
On 12th Avenue

55
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,608
I think it was his people about like

56
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:24,800
Cows and cowboys and cowgirl thing on 12th Avenue is no longer Modern Life

57
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:31,200
So this is what we're here to talk about today and I cannot wait neither here we go

58
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:34,784
That's why people invented things like the cow tunnel

59
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:39,648
How to have the best

60
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:43,488
Cowtown

61
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,608
Countertops

62
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:54,496
Whatever you say it's funny

63
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,568
Avenue have to love

64
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,848
Cow tunnels

65
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,384
Cow titles

66
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:07,040
In Manhattan or is Nicola called them in a piece she wrote for Gizmodo the Lost Cow tunnels of New York City

67
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,904
When Nicola says the people invented things like the count tunnel

68
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:15,744
For the purposes of this story that really could mean one of two things

69
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,047
Either people invented the tunnels

70
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:22,143
To March the cows underneath 12th Avenue to the abattoir

71
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:28,543
Or people invented this crazy cock-and-bull story about the count tunnels from or Escape

72
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:32,127
Because everybody loves a good

73
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,151
And so

74
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,967
Nicola twilley has been on a years-long quest

75
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:39,295
To figure out whether the cow tunnels ever actually existed

76
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:45,695
Because after all the idea of cows loping along under your feet in New York City at least how we think of New York's

77
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,463
City now

78
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:50,303
Is insane

79
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,095
Generally about food

80
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,119
And place

81
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,935
And if anything exists at that same intersection

82
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,215
It is the cow

83
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:57,983
Tunnel

84
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:01,823
I just did dedicated infrastructure for animals like that

85
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,359
Write a new genre of Arc

86
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:09,759
Texture freak out when you think about all of the tubes and tunnels and

87
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,039
Weird things that are underneath the

88
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:14,367
Street we have tunnels for cars we have tunnels for subways

89
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:21,023
We have all these tubes filled with electrical cables in the internet

90
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,327
Subterranean infrastructure to

91
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:27,167
Nicolas first happened on the couch tunnel Story by chance

92
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,751
Called raising steaks

93
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:34,079
Bocephus

94
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:37,151
Steaks of course it's spelled steaks

95
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:40,223
Yes the kind that could be porterhouse

96
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:43,295
T-boned exactly

97
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,319
Sirloin

98
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:47,391
Stripling

99
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,463
Alexandra

100
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:52,255
Skirt she's reading along

101
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,303
Middle Passage

102
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,839
I'm paid 22

103
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:58,655
You could miss it quite easily if you are reading

104
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,191
Too fast it Cicero

105
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,215
2 line

106
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:06,591
Traffic was so heavy in the 1870s

107
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,127
Sedecal tunnel

108
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:08,895
In quotation

109
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,199
Is Aunt capitalized

110
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:16,319
Was built beneath 12th Avenue to serve as an underground Passage

111
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:20,927
And it's rumored to be there still awaiting designation as a landmark

112
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:26,559
When she just carries on you know as late as 1880 Horowitz rights

113
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:27,839
Blah blah blah

114
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,887
Want this literally one cent

115
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,167
Exactly

116
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,775
That's weird I wonder if they're still there

117
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,055
So I Googled it

118
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:39,615
Define

119
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:40,895
I found

120
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:43,199
Brian whipp Road

121
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:46,783
Think of how he pronounces his name

122
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:51,903
Brian Lippard is a utility specialist for weidlinger Associates in New York

123
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:58,303
Structural engineering firm what I do for weidlinger is figure out how to get from point A to point B underground in New York City

124
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,583
Con Edison is

125
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,375
Cutting a trench for electrical cables

126
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:07,519
They need a navigator as well as investigate all kinds of anomalies and strange things that they find at a ground when doing

127
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:13,151
Brian went searching for the truth about cow channels more than 10 years before Nicola

128
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:18,015
In 1997 he published an article in a local local newspaper called the Tribeca

129
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:18,783
Trib

130
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,343
Which is what Nicola found in her web search

131
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,647
The headline

132
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,439
I will summarize it here

133
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:34,399
Fred just Fred just read the last night and read says he was watching a work crew in

134
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:40,799
Install a new drainage basin downtown which is by the way nowhere near the side of those old slaughterhouses

135
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:44,383
They dig and dig and then finally they have this kind of wooden

136
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,407
Barrier

137
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,687
Wooden

138
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,967
They break through it

139
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,759
And it's Hollow on the other side

140
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:53,855
And then a quote-unquote old man from the neighborhood steps up

141
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:54,623
And says

142
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,951
Why I see you found the cow tunnel

143
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:03,071
Sobran walk the story around ask the whole mess of people

144
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:05,631
And everybody's heard of the tunnel

145
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:09,215
But when they talk about the facts are never the same

146
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:13,055
But it's somewhere different and is made of different items

147
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,103
Since it was built at a different time

148
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:18,687
Brian finally circles back to Fred

149
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,711
Princess

150
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:20,735
Well

151
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,575
Actually I never saw it it was a buddy of mine I saw it

152
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:27,903
So again that's how Brian told the story in his article

153
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,695
In 1997

154
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:32,767
Sitting in his office with me in 2014

155
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,303
He told it this way

156
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,583
We were digging some test pit

157
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,119
For a Verizon

158
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,167
So so

159
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,495
You were there and digging and

160
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,823
Right and so we dug down about five feet and then

161
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,591
Grits

162
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,895
Curved surface that looks like a balti

163
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:49,663
Did roof

164
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:52,991
So now the story has completely changed

165
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:55,039
In Brian's mind

166
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,855
He's the one watching not Fred

167
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:03,487
Not would you talk this way

168
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,815
For another 10 minutes before he finally stopped and said

169
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:07,839
Wait a second

170
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:12,959
Call me in the beginning of this cuz I was

171
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:13,727
I didn't

172
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:18,335
100 and even the same damn thing Fred did

173
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:21,151
Let me tell you how big it is and where it goes

174
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:24,223
Everyday man

175
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:28,575
I know I started doing the same damn thing this is what happened with the code tunnels

176
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:31,391
And why the truth of them is so hard to get ahold of

177
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:35,231
It's like as soon as you start to retell the story it gets loose

178
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,767
And begins to bend

179
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:39,071
It's like an instant fishtail

180
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,863
Except it's about cows

181
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,167
And somehow the folklore of it

182
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:48,287
Stretches further and further out until nobody can remember how the story started

183
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:55,455
And so when Nicola twilley wrote her first blog post in 2010 she went solely off of

184
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,479
Brian's article

185
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,015
Which uncovered nothing

186
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:00,319
And that one line in the Betty Fussell book

187
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,879
But around the same time she had published

188
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:06,207
A little shred of hard ish evidence popped up

189
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:09,023
Cowtown a version of the Shroud of Turin

190
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,559
It's a coffee table book

191
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:11,583
Called

192
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,351
New York

193
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,887
In the 19th century

194
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:21,055
Send there's a picture in here that shows this is an 1877 engraving from Harper's Weekly

195
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:25,919
Tunnel at 34th Street paddle being driven up through a tunnel

196
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,199
Looks like a wooden tunnel

197
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,503
And it says tunnel from the dock

198
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,271
Huh

199
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:35,135
Emerging from it's almost like they're

200
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,975
And then they're strung up by 1 foot

201
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,767
Samara Lee X

202
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,119
But

203
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,655
Wow so that seems to be

204
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,935
Evidentiary

205
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,727
Right there is a picture of a towel tunnel

206
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,543
I don't know about that though

207
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,591
This is Nicholas

208
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,383
You can actually see

209
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:00,735
Where the tunnel is emerging from a tunnel

210
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,527
Photograph

211
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,111
But there's a cow emerging from a

212
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:11,231
Well and the cowboy in the picture is about 2 foot tall so there's all kinds of problems

213
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,023
The cow is about 10 times

214
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,047
Decisive

215
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,607
I wasn't I wasn't buying it

216
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,143
I needed more

217
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:22,495
I needed more so she did what she says bloggers like her and never do

218
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:24,031
When they're researching a topic

219
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,823
She called people

220
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,359
I talked to

221
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:30,687
Cities director of archaeology and cheese

222
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,223
Without this

223
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,527
As if she'd be nice

224
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:37,087
Christian Bale

225
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:37,855
12

226
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:44,255
After I read about them the first time that sort of bubbled up on a few blogs and I suppose those people were actually

227
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:52,191
Probably what she said to me which was

228
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:58,847
No evidence never found anything

229
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:04,223
Historic preservation very nice

230
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:07,039
Very apologetic sorry

231
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,903
I am about

232
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:15,231
Really fully write these things off as a myth

233
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,279
When I decide

234
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,327
To call CC Saunders

235
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:23,935
Of historical perspectives Incorporated which basically consults with big projects

236
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:29,823
Construction projects in that sort of thing and they gauge whether there is historical archaeological

237
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,615
Important stuff

238
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,639
In the area

239
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:39,039
That's my she called me back

240
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:39,807
Fairy

241
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,575
On the way back

242
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,599
Vim Staten Island

243
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,415
Of course they exist

244
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:49,535
Yes no question don't be ridiculous I'll send you the blueprints

245
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,559
Soon as I get home

246
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:56,959
After all this there are blueprints yeah original at this point but I have

247
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:59,007
What's the copy that we put into our

248
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:05,407
Report that we did when we study the Reconstruction of Route 9A otherwise known as the West Side Highway

249
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,991
Is narcisi Saunders

250
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,039
I have never been CC Saunders

251
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,087
With her for about 20

252
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:16,671
CC Sertraline was basically the count

253
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,695
Alien

254
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,463
At their shop

255
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:24,607
Back in 1991 the state contracted historical perspectives to do and historical study

256
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:28,191
Of that former meat packing area at 12th Avenue in the upper 30s

257
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:34,591
And Faline wrote the report so she did a ton of research

258
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:39,199
Look at all these old maps and documents and built this picture

259
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:43,295
The kinds of structures that used to be a long 12th Avenue there

260
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,319
Tenements

261
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:46,367
Warehouses cattle tunnel

262
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,903
Stop right there

263
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:53,535
On the very very last page of the report about that meat packing area

264
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,631
Sure will and underground cattle pass

265
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:04,287
Was built and used by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company it extended about 200 feet beneath 12th Avenue in the shore

266
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:07,615
Flying to the block between West 38th and West 39th Street

267
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:10,687
Pardon my bad grammar back in 1991

268
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:16,063
It was not meant to say that it was 200 feet beneath 12th Avenue it was 200 ft long

269
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,599
And beneath the Avenue

270
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,903
Misplaced modifier

271
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,231
The tunnel was built in 1932 and may still be present

272
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:26,815
Wait a minute 1932

273
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,863
Yeah and

274
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:33,215
Yeah that was during when all of this construction is going on in the city

275
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,775
Are being planned at least new Bridges and tunnels

276
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:42,431
Again like 200

277
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:44,479
Feet from the dock to the slaughterhouse

278
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,015
So that New York could

279
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:48,319
At the end of a long day of building

280
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,855
Ham steak for dinner

281
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,391
So how big was it

282
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,975
9 feet wide by 7 feet high

283
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,791
And that was ascertained from a New York Department of Doc

284
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:00,607
Permit number Manhattan .67

285
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,631
3 - 8

286
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:03,679
Yes

287
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,447
So

288
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,727
Maxine

289
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,263
Pretty Ironclad

290
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:13,151
Well yeah I would say it was an ironclad concrete pad but yes

291
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:19,039
To actually see a blueprint

292
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,575
It was sort of it

293
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,367
You know a lottery winning

294
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,135
Moment

295
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,671
I felt pretty good

296
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,255
The design

297
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,535
For the lost city of Atlanta

298
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:30,815
Exactly

299
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:33,119
Exactly having a really I mean I was

300
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,423
I was pretty stoked

301
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,239
What did you say

302
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:42,591
Well really I thought I have to go out there and

303
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,407
So where

304
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,455
Roughly

305
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,503
Roughly here

306
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,831
After looking over the blueprints Nicola

307
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:56,159
Pause for a minute to write up a new blog post

308
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:58,463
To the area where the tunnel had been

309
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,487
See if

310
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:02,815
Any sign of it any hope

311
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,863
That it might still exist

312
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,167
Some people swear it's intact

313
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,983
That the tunnels in tax

314
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,335
Wait we might be able

315
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,615
How to find an entrance

316
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:21,247
They've been one of the buildings without having to excavate the roadway at

317
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,343
I don't know I mean bears

318
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,879
The West Side Highway

319
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:28,927
Music about the Javits

320
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:31,487
When you think about the Lincoln Tunnel that were standing

321
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,767
Right next to you

322
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,303
Most likely

323
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:37,119
If Cal tunnel there was once upon a time

324
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:39,935
It was pulverized and all of that construction

325
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,215
And any void

326
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,519
Westfield in

327
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:47,359
You have a blueprint of it so how do you know if I'd be built inside of it

328
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:50,943
Plan on other maps that were made though the area later

329
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:57,087
Oh I see in and it's in the 1953 Port series from the Army Corps of Engineers

330
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,647
Which I don't really know what that means but there is

331
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:06,303
And actually in a research that I Nicholas found evidence for that other tunnel at 34th Street

332
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,095
It was in the Harper's Weekly picture

333
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:11,935
There's this New York Times article from 1875 that talks about it

334
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:12,959
It says

335
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:18,079
There runs a tunnel under 12th Avenue where the animals are brought into the shambles

336
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,103
In fact

337
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:23,711
Cattle are never seen by the outside public from the time of their Landing

338
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:25,759
Until they are converted into beef

339
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:32,927
From

340
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,463
Where our food comes

341
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,071
Cities are becoming things

342
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:44,191
But somehow get fed mysteriously and invisibly at this precise moment

343
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:48,031
And apparently

344
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:53,151
Of historic importance in Boston that also exist

345
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,967
Oh contraire Nicola twilley

346
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,503
Oh contraire

347
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,807
So wait the train

348
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,087
Right now

349
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:07,999
Is going through what used to be a tunnel

350
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,815
We do know whether the couch handle in Boston accept

351
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,863
Medicus Acceptance in Cambridge Mass

352
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,191
I stood on a bridge above it with Charlie Sullivan

353
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:18,751
By the way the way this neighborhood developed

354
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,543
The cattle market

355
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:23,615
Was established over on Massachusetts Avenue

356
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:27,199
Quite early before the railroad came through

357
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,783
Farmers would drive the cows here

358
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,063
Over the road

359
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:35,391
Charlie's the head of the Cambridge historical Commission

360
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,463
He says it used to be Cowpens on either side of this bridge

361
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,743
Walden Street Bridge

362
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,535
Accountable

363
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,095
Polly Walden Street cattle pass was built

364
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:49,727
So farmers could drive the cows from one pen to another

365
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:50,751
So

366
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:51,519
Because they might

367
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,311
Because they would get loose

368
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,335
Like Lucy

369
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,783
Cows that have minds of Their Own

370
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:03,807
Anyway

371
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:06,623
Viscount tunnel is now on the national register

372
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,903
Of historic places

373
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,951
But other than a plaque that mentions it

374
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:13,279
You never know it was tucked underneath the railroad bridge

375
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:17,631
Off-limits to the public next to an active rail line which is fenced off

376
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,679
So that people don't get hit by trains

377
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:25,055
So in short the commission preserve the structure that no one can see who has any access to

378
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:25,823
Correct

379
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:28,383
The only way is to hop try to hop that fence

380
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,151
You want to do that

381
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:32,479
Define it would be fun interesting way to spend the morning

382
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:33,503
I'm not sure

383
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,295
I'm able to do it

384
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,111
So

385
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:42,719
Feel free please tell me that you have two hands without him please tell me that you have to fence without him

386
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,743
Sound too

387
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:49,119
So when Charlie was well out of sight and couldn't be accused of aiding and abetting

388
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,983
And I am in

389
