This is 99% invisible

20
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,120
I'm Roman Mars

21
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:14,752
Look at that it's like a

22
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,544
Three houses on

23
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,616
Set of stairs

24
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:25,760
I love those moments when you're walking in your neighborhood and suddenly nothing is familiar

25
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:30,112
Staircase for a giant I don't want to meet

26
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:33,952
Giant not that you don't know where you are but

27
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,000
Where you are where you've always been

28
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:38,304
Seems foreign somehow

29
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,680
Jim before beautiful little streetlow boxing houses

30
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,728
It happened to Sean call friend of the show

31
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:49,824
Back in the spring he lives in Brooklyn up in the northern part near Queens

32
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,640
Gallagher the comedian

33
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:57,248
Talks about when you have a kid and you start seeing the world with new eyes

34
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:00,064
What kind of seeing the World by neighborhood with new eyes

35
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:04,928
It was

36
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:07,744
Due to this artist that I was going to meet that's why I was

37
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:12,608
Walking through the neighborhood and what's his name his name is James Gulliver Hancock

38
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,240
Here we are you told me to meet him at this Cafe not far from where they called Cookie Road

39
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,776
Right on time videos

40
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:23,616
The old cookie road though not the new one on Manhattan Avenue

41
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,896
And I'm thinking

42
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:27,968
What do you know about the new one you live in Australia

43
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:28,736
James

44
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,320
A microphone in hand how are you

45
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:35,648
But the thing about James Gulliver Hancock is that

46
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,208
Just knows this city

47
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:41,536
So intimately he did used to live here

48
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,560
From about

49
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,608
2010 to 2012

50
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,216
And back when he lived here in this is why I was going to meet him back when he lived here

51
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,240
He started this

52
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,800
Pretty obsessive little project

53
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,336
That ultimately culminated

54
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,688
Yes so I have the book I'll gret and the name

55
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,712
Of the book

56
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:00,992
How to say I love

57
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:01,760
The title is

58
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:02,528
So earnest

59
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,552
Is

60
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,880
All the buildings in New York all the buildings in New York

61
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:09,696
That I've drawn so far

62
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,000
It's like what I said

63
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:16,096
6 year old what is that what it was

64
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,632
It implies that you're going to

65
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,168
Drumore

66
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:19,936
Sure

67
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:22,752
I like the first part of the title of mice

68
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:25,824
So

69
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,360
He's saying he wants to

70
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,896
Show all the buildings in New York

71
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,688
I think he would like to

72
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,736
How many buildings are there in New York

73
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:37,344
Hunter 2000 building

74
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,184
It would you would probably need to spend a lot more time here

75
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:47,584
Sure I actually look this up later in the New York City Property Tax annual report of 2011

76
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,936
It said there were 1030202

77
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:56,544
Parcels but I think Parcels also includes separate condominium and rental units

78
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:00,640
And then I found myself on the website of something called emporis

79
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:04,480
Which bills itself as a global provider of building information

80
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,016
And the number it said

81
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,040
Was closer to

82
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,856
720 8452

83
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:14,464
They're closer to that closed in the book there are only about a hundred

84
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,000
70

85
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,536
Most of them in Manhattan

86
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,839
But you'd also dry around here in Brooklyn and

87
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:20,863
Everyone

88
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,143
Bronson

89
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:22,911
Linda Burrows

90
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,727
Try to mix it up a bit

91
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:28,799
He's hit every Borough except Staten Island so he did

92
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:29,823
Draw the fairy

93
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:36,223
And despite the title these are not all the buildings in New York that he's drawn so far the book is just a sampling of his

94
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,783
Blog of the same name as blogs is called

95
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:45,183
All the buildings in New York

96
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:45,951
Lizards map

97
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:48,255
500 drawings on it something like that

98
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:53,375
Some of them are just black and white and Wiggly sketches others of these really loving

99
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:56,191
Color treatment with all kinds of intricate details

100
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:58,495
Just one per page mostly

101
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:01,311
A little kid draw superheroes

102
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,615
Empire State Plaza

103
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,431
All the classics but also all these anonymous

104
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,991
Down-at-the-heels ones robbing houses

105
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:11,807
Synagogue rigorously labeled with the address

106
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:16,927
53 Pitt Street to 22 West 23rd Street

107
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,463
Monolith

108
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:21,279
But even the intricate drawings are still kind of

109
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,559
Cartoony

110
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:25,631
Little squiggles and dots hovering above the rules

111
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,911
Is that the building you're saying

112
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:27,935
Lookout

113
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:30,495
Maybe

114
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:31,775
I mean

115
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,335
Exactly right yes okay so

116
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,127
What's on this project

117
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,943
In different fashions in different cities

118
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:41,247
I've done all the rain in London in

119
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,783
All the cars in Los Angeles

120
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,343
And all the bicycles in Berlin but

121
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:49,183
He was just passing through the city's so we didn't dig in like with the building

122
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,487
Looks like it would parachute into a place

123
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:55,583
And immediately trying to find its noun

124
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,631
The thing that the city was

125
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,911
About in

126
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:05,311
I'm in Berlin mine I'll be about box Forever on that when I was there ever run out of by Candlebox all over the place

127
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07,359
Just focusing on one thing

128
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:09,663
I'm getting to know that one thing about that place

129
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,711
Trying to record it as obsessively as opposed to

130
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,807
New York was definitely the building

131
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:16,831
And that's

132
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,135
When I'm going to go when I'm here

133
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,415
I just thought of doing it

134
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:28,095
James and his wife move home when she got pregnant so they could raise their kid in a place with more than one blade of grass sprouting

135
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:34,495
I can't even enjoy a blade of grass unless I know there's a Subway Andy book and the blog

136
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,263
Buzz

137
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:41,919
A big newspaper write-ups and a lot of mentions on the blogosphere including one that due to a glorious type

138
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:46,271
I said James is on a mission to draw the buildings in New York

139
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:50,111
A lot of coverage really frames James is a kind of Don Quixote

140
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:53,439
With a pen okay so how's it going so far

141
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:56,255
Whittier dream of painting all the buildings in New York

142
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:00,863
It's going pretty well this is from a segment on Good Day Sacramento

143
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,655
I talked to James by Skype

144
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:05,727
No it what it what is it this is New York

145
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,751
It's a tough City

146
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:10,335
There's some people yell at your like why you paid my building what's going on

147
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:14,943
I know it's

148
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:21,599
It is New York's that people let you do whatever you want really you know it's a guy drawing on the street is probably one of them

149
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:24,927
Normal things to say

150
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,999
Go back to my retirement

151
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,303
Does plenty more where things are not around

152
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:33,375
Is a building just on the corner that I've drawn a couple of times

153
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,703
And what I wanted to do with James

154
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:42,591
Was go to some of the buildings he drawn and hold up the drawing next to the building

155
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,407
How to see what he sees

156
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:51,039
I'm only realizing this now but you don't ever get to do that to sit with the artist in front of the thing

157
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:53,599
That they made into a picture

158
00:07:55,903 --> 00:08:01,791
There are a lot of Brooklyn buildings in the book but I have my smartphone with me so I figured we just call up his blog

159
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:08,191
The first drawing on his blog is in Greenpoint actually a little apartment complex at 587 Manhattan Avenue

160
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:11,007
One of a loose Chamblee charcoal sketches

161
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:13,055
Looks more like an idea for a building

162
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:19,967
James uploaded that picture on May 20th 2010 you still brand new to the city at that point and this was sort of

163
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:22,527
In his way of keeping a diary of his time here

164
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:26,111
It also has a very real pragmatic function

165
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:28,415
Helping him get around town

166
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,951
That was what I did for the

167
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,231
The project to Mathis

168
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,511
Spice that I did not very well

169
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,815
To myself drawing what's the differ

170
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,631
I mean was it in F

171
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:38,655
To sort of

172
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,471
Contain I mean like I

173
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,495
Netflix error

174
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,543
I've only lived here two years but

175
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:47,871
Ain't no I can't stop ya

176
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,407
You can take it all in

177
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:54,271
Yeah I said it what you trying to like bring the city down to 8 by 11 size so yeah

178
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,039
Turtle

179
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,063
You get a

180
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,367
Much deeper understanding of the plasma. Just

181
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:04,511
Sit in front of the Cross building in the end by side which I've done but you sit in front of

182
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,815
Roblox assassin

183
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,607
Pfister 811 is it on

184
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,631
And

185
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:12,703
Danny Way those buildings been become as

186
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:17,311
Kind of special as the Chrysler

187
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,079
Can I think

188
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:21,151
I got a drone that before that grocery store with the

189
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:21,919
The tree

190
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,967
Stories about nothing just that.

191
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:28,319
He's planning to 97 Franklin Street we walk

192
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,111
Passed it to Greenpoint Ave

193
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,391
Plop down on the bed

194
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:34,719
James take my phone and Scrolls back on the blog

195
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:37,791
To another Bodega across the street from where we're sitting

196
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,839
What is this one just

197
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:42,911
The deli down the bottom it's a similar one to the one we were talking about before

198
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:44,703
Oh

199
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:45,727
Oh

200
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:54,175
You really captured it I mean I have to say it's like it's like that's what I like about drawing

201
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,711
Like it's not exactly

202
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,503
Like I might have missed a few things and

203
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:01,855
This isn't actually that that's a bit further I ever the V down the middle

204
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:05,439
The windows down the middle

205
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,487
Organic

206
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,279
And it's almost like you've made it more

207
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,303
What it is

208
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,631
Yeah if you bring out its character of it

209
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,167
I can pull up

210
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,447
Oh yeah yeah yeah

211
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,751
Is 144 Franklin Street

212
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:21,055
An older 3 level apartment building

213
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,079
That's

214
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:25,663
Lavished with all kinds of intricate design frills

215
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,455
It's one of those places that makes you think

216
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,223
Tuesday

217
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,247
1

218
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:35,135
Who decided that this building out of all of the buildings on this block should be so crazily ornate

219
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,671
+ 2

220
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:39,231
You know they just don't build places like that anymore

221
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,767
Do you do you know ARCA

222
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,047
Architectural terms what do

223
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,327
Call like

224
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,095
That

225
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,375
Filigree

226
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:46,655
Another

227
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,423
Flowers that

228
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:48,703
Keep going across

229
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,239
Freeze up top

230
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:55,871
Cornice

231
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:58,431
But that's the funny thing because I'm doing this

232
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,991
Largely architectural projects icon

233
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:01,759
I get off

234
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:05,343
About architecture and I haven't trained in architecture and I done

235
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,135
Know the times

236
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,159
Outside of

237
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,463
The Standard-Times

238
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,255
So yeah it's hard to

239
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,327
I just appreciate that man

240
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,351
Chatham throttles

241
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,887
I mean I'd never

242
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:20,447
They have noticed them if he hadn't drawn them

243
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,239
Door if I wasn't sitting there with him

244
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:25,823
Sitting with James it's like the whole city is a museum

245
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,615
Usually

246
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,919
You know buildings are

247
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,943
Too big

248
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:33,247
Horseshoe cookie cutter to notice

249
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:36,063
But because he's drawing every window

250
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,343
Every

251
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:41,951
Fire escape railing he's eventually going to hit the funny little decisions

252
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,231
Or awkwardness is

253
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:46,047
That make that building that building

254
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,607
That nobody would notice otherwise

255
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:56,031
Dentists have a studio in the old Pencil Factory does half a block down

256
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:59,359
Funny actually the top of it all the way around

257
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,639
Is appointed with

258
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:01,663
These

259
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:05,503
Pencils that are vertical it's like an incomplete

260
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:11,903
Crown going across around the top story just in case you forgot what they were making in there

261
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:15,743
I mean it's like a 15 B * 15 foot long pencil

262
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,535
I like pencils for a giant

263
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,839
That's the second time you mentioned Giants

264
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,399
Thank you for keeping track

265
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:29,055
I've done a few on the roof of the building we can get up there

266
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:34,175
We duck around the corner into this Warehouse he looking Lobby and go right up to the top floor

267
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,711
I love these old elevators

268
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:39,551
Jog around to the stairwell

269
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:45,951
GameStop's at a window for a second point something out to me the weirdest thing just under the roofs on the Builder

270
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,231
Wings across the street

271
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,023
Are stenciled

272
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,583
The address numbers of those buildings

273
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,863
See the numbers up until

274
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,679
What's above Earth

275
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,727
Oh yeah

276
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,263
Oh how about that

277
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,847
You would never know it's what it's like who is that for a giant

278
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,383
Just walking down the street

279
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:07,711
What's up with you in Chinese

280
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,015
Oh man

281
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,087
Oh wow

282
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,135
Amazing app

283
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,719
Brooklyn and Queens

284
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,511
Just like a helipad

285
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,303
A huge roof

286
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,863
Ando and one of the iconic water towers

287
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:31,007
So yeah the Empire State the Croswell all the classics over there

288
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:39,967
You know it's crazy like now that I'm looking at the skyline from up here I mean if it feels like because I spent some

289
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:45,087
How much time looking at your drawings that feels like a drawing as opposed to reality vibrations

290
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:46,879
The wiggly line

291
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:49,695
I see someone's perspective that's what I say

292
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,743
I see someone else's perspective

293
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,303
I painted your eyes

294
00:13:54,559 --> 00:14:00,703
Damn you got to say everything is quiet

295
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,239
Explain everything is pastel

296
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,263
Exactly

297
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:08,639
That's the thing about writing someone's story which kind of what this is I guess it's

298
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:12,479
Have a different view of the world off the woods get inside someone's head

299
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,783
See that post office affected

300
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:17,599
Just doesn't happen the band was this time it's in pictures

301
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:22,463
Yeah I picked up the book again the other day

302
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:27,071
Just leaving through it for a minute and then walking outside to the

303
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:27,839
Street

304
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,887
And looking up at the buildings I look up

305
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,703
At all the time and kind of

306
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,471
Hate

307
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,007
Now

308
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:40,127
I don't know how to say this is like that they seem to fund all of a sudden

309
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,991
What kind of carefully like now they were these carefully made objects

310
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,271
I mean you know that

311
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,063
When you see the care that

312
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,855
Someone put into something and

313
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:52,415
The Genius of everyday decisions

314
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,951
I think it makes you

315
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:54,975
Almost packed

316
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:55,743
Logically

317
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,511
Optimistic

318
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,559
Somebody put care into this

319
00:14:59,071 --> 00:14:59,583
The world is

320
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,607
Better because of it

321
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,631
And I think that

322
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:08,031
That kind of optimism feeds James I mean it's funny that you say that because like I've been wondering like my see such a happy

323
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,311
Person but I think that's

324
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,615
Do I will say that

325
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,687
Pessimistic little moment they're on the roof

326
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:21,343
Cuz of course he's not just looking at the city he's looking at the impossible job he's carved out for himself

327
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,647
Makes me anxious that icon

328
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,671
Through it all

329
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,695
Now you look here at this

330
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,975
Amazing view and that's like

331
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,255
That one

332
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,791
I got us a planet

333
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,095
I'm by that one over there

334
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:36,959
Rosemary's Baby Ghostbusters

335
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:37,727
Install

336
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,519
Under under the brown with the

337
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:46,431
The creamy brickwork up with help decorative grain copper roofing

338
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:48,479
I don't know what that is

339
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:52,831
Makes me anxious that I'm on I'll get that I want to do it I want to know that one

340
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:55,903
Makes you anxious why

341
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,463
Cuz I want to

342
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:00,767
Spend time during all of the different buildings

343
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:07,679
When you're specially when I'm crossing the bridge it's you say that the law of the land

344
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:10,495
Do you remember the name of the project

345
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:15,103
You want to you want to do it then I hear the nine-year-old and they wants to just

346
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,127
Let's do this

347
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:22,271
But what would it mean if you don't get to all of them are dumb get to the ones that you want to do

348
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:25,343
Diane unhappy death

349
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,695
Force my son to start drawing

350
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,535
Generations

351
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:35,839
He's probably going to be

352
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,631
Why do you say that

353
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:38,655
He's one

354
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:45,823
Are you already doing Matt's performer in his dad's a drawer

355
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,615
Adele

356
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,431
I can do it every once

357
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:57,599
That's a good dad thought about it I've only

358
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,903
Yeah something too hot

359
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:28,063
99percentinvisible was produced this week by Shawn Cole

360
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:31,647
Sam Greenspan and me Roman Mars

361
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:34,719
And we have a new intern her name is Avery droppleman
