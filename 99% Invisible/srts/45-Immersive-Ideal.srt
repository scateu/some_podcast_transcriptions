36
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:09,024
My name is Chad Clark

37
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,424
And I'm in the Band Beauty pill is a band I really like from Washington DC their last album the Unseen

38
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,728
Saleable lifestyle was released in 2000

39
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:24,640
Since then she has serious illness that nearly killed him

40
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:27,456
So usually it swells and you die

41
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:32,064
And I didn't I don't think it's entirely accurate to boil this down to cause and effect here

42
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,600
But at the same time

43
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,392
Is practice as a musician

44
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,928
Change dramatically as well

45
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,720
I just kind of became

46
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:39,744
Dismayed

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,584
About putting stuff out I don't think I was even aware that that was happen

48
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:47,168
If you talk to me like 2 years ago I wouldn't know all the

49
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,192
I know now

50
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,984
But clearly I was resisting

51
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,264
Actively resisting

52
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:55,616
And because he was sick and making music but not putting out music

53
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,408
People began to wonder

54
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:02,016
About Chad Clark being perfectionistic reclusive

55
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:08,416
Two words that have been repeated to me a few times the Brian Wilson fantasy that I like

56
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:14,816
He's going crazy in a sandbox somewhere and the whole point of what I want to do

57
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:15,584
Communication

58
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:22,240
So I will admit that it was a misguided path

59
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:35,040
Women look like the way things were going to be but

60
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:37,344
Then Beauty pill got an intriguing invitation

61
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:42,208
From Artisphere a new multimedia art space in the DC area

62
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:42,976
Just ask me to

63
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:43,744
Come down

64
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,768
To see the space

65
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,560
And talked about doing something

66
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,328
Creative

67
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,352
With music

68
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:51,168
Very open-ended very creative

69
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,472
Kind of

70
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,520
Idea the best kind of invitation

71
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:58,592
I came down and we walked around the space

72
00:03:59,360 --> 00:03:59,872
Different things

73
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:02,944
We can do any obvious ideas spring up he could create

74
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,736
Ambient looping music developed

75
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,784
Space or some kind of audio installation

76
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,344
But as they're walking around they came to a room

77
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,136
Varied

78
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:11,904
Distinctive

79
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,672
Fenestration

80
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:16,256
And we looked into this black box theater and there's a window that looks down in

81
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,303
Did the theater this thing to detect

82
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,631
And the first will the black box theater look really cool to me

83
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:24,447
But mostly the window

84
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,471
Wasn't interesting

85
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,775
Because the window looks down and

86
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,567
Is the space and I'm a huge Beatles

87
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:33,151
And if you just Google Abbey Road Studios

88
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:33,919
2

89
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,199
And you will see this design

90
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,527
The famous Beatles Studio has a window that

91
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,319
Looks down a second-floor window it look

92
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,087
Looks down into the sea

93
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:44,415
It's angle almost exactly like the window at artist

94
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:45,951
And that

95
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:46,975
Excited me

96
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,767
Beauty pill record a new album

97
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,815
It's an album that no one that was going to happen

98
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,863
In the black box theater in front

99
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,655
If everyone letting people watch us

100
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,423
Work

101
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,215
All inspired by window

102
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,751
And there you have it

103
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:01,055
The closest one could ever hope to get

104
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,079
The dancing

105
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,103
Barakatak

106
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,455
They call the projects the immersive ideal

107
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,735
Immersive ideas

108
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,527
Will be accessible invisible

109
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:11,551
To everyone

110
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:12,575
And we would

111
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,111
Hopefully lose ourselves in

112
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,903
In the process which is where the title

113
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,183
The ideal weight

114
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:17,951
How to make music

115
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,487
Serve drop your

116
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,559
4.

117
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,607
They had two weeks there was a deadline

118
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,911
I think there's a way you could view the kids

119
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:27,679
Strain to the spa

120
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:28,703
This is a form of

121
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,471
Confinement

122
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,263
But to Chad Demers bidil was

123
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:34,335
Not about putting himself in a fishbowl and being forced

124
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,383
To perform a task with everyone watching

125
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,663
It was about

126
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,199
Opening up the wall

127
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,223
Inviting people

128
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,247
Into the process

129
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,527
In the studio

130
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,551
You can

131
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,575
Lose Yourself

132
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,623
Entirely and that can be a really narcotic

133
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,647
Can wonderful thing

134
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:50,463
But it can be easy to forget that the main purpose

135
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,487
This is what you're doing is

136
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,535
Make a piece of music that is

137
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,071
Heard by someone else

138
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,095
Excommunicate

139
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,911
And transmits an idea or a sensation

140
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,703
Ornamotion to someone else

141
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,495
It's easy to lose sight of that

142
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,519
When you're in the

143
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,799
Antiseptic

144
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,335
Closed wall

145
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,871
Environment of a studio

146
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,919
Working in the open air

147
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:12,479
You never lose sight of that as an object

148
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,015
Removing someone else

149
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,295
As an object

150
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:16,575
Case in point

151
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:21,951
The theater / recording studio was set up so people could only observe through the Abbey Road win

152
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,487
Now the reality

153
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:24,511
Is

154
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,279
We're nice p

155
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,583
And if we saw saw

156
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,631
Standing at the window for

157
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,655
Two or three hours

158
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:31,935
Watching a

159
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:32,703
That's work

160
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:37,055
I don't know it just seems right to invite them down so what I would do is I would wave them down

161
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:37,823
And I would wave

162
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:38,847
I'm at the window

163
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,127
And I would say

164
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:40,895
Come on down

165
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:41,919
And

166
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:42,943
We did this

167
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,711
Quite often

168
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,063
Sometimes the people invited into recording area would erupt into Applause

169
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:52,927
Can you gently one in the studio recording this was one of the manifestations where you could

170
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:53,951
Can tell people were

171
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,743
On our side or

172
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,791
Investigated wanting it to work

173
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:58,815
But the other factors.

174
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,863
The crowd begin to guide some of the creative

175
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:01,631
Process

176
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:05,215
On the song Steven Antoine gay Chad Clark came into the room without vision

177
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:05,983
For the song

178
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,007
My original

179
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,031
Demo was

180
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,567
Kind of slow

181
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,335
Disco

182
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,895
Kind of somewhat erotic

183
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,175
Somewhat dark

184
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,199
But

185
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,223
Kind of slow

186
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,503
Too slow to dance

187
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,551
And I thought this was provocative

188
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,599
But you can feel if there was a dance beat

189
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,879
But it was slow down to

190
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,159
The point where you really could

191
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:24,927
Dance to it

192
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,207
And the rest of the band

193
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,743
Was feeling that it should have

194
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,767
Agresco

195
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,535
Pace

196
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,071
And I was

197
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,351
Pretty ottoman on

198
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:35,167
Trying to pursue this vision of slow Disco

199
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:37,215
Who hasn't pursued slow Disco

200
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,007
But when they were recording this

201
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,055
Or something like 12 guests

202
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,847
Also in the room and

203
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,383
I could feel

204
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,687
And the band was trying to honor my vision

205
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,735
I could feel that it wasn't working

206
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,807
I could see the band wasn't on my side

207
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,855
And that I was outnumbered by the band

208
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,903
But I could also feel from

209
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:56,671
Behind me

210
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,207
I was like this is

211
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,487
I'm the only one in this

212
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,511
Sam's room

213
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,559
There's like 18 people in this room

214
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,375
And I'm the only one that thinks this song should be slow

215
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,679
I think I'm probably wrong

216
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,983
Like it was like this

217
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,287
I think I'm wrong

218
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,079
And

219
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:17,151
I probably let go of my

220
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:17,919
Concept

221
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,199
That it should be slow

222
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,735
Sooner I think

223
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,759
Then I would have

224
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,807
Had I not felt the

225
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,831
The presence of

226
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,367
Other people in the room

227
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,415
Cuda spell wasn't working on

228
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,183
And

229
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,743
If we've been working in a studio

230
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,279
I think I probably would have

231
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,839
Eventually acquiesced I do trust the band

232
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,399
But I certainly feel like the

233
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,191
The social presence of others

234
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:40,959
People

235
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,751
Helped me realize that

236
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,031
That my Approach wasn't

237
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:45,567
At all

238
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:49,919
But that's not to say that inviting the crowd in the room even the metaphorical

239
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,711
Cool crowd is the right way to create something

240
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,735
What's a paradox

241
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:53,759
Because

242
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,575
If Radiohead when they were making kid a

243
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:57,855
Had allowed

244
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:58,879
Crowding

245
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,159
While they were working

246
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,951
That crowd might have been

247
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,231
Fleetwood dismayed

248
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,791
But everything they were doing why are you doing this

249
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,839
Your guitar rock band

250
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:11,935
Why I liked your last record it was great why don't you just do another one of those

251
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:14,751
The crown doesn't always have the vision

252
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:17,311
So there are times when you have to knowingly

253
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:20,639
Push beyond what is socially desirable

254
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:23,711
That point to arrive at a fresh and worthwhile

255
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:24,735
Results

256
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,527
So it's complicated

257
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,295
It's not

258
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,087
Just one way or just the other

259
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:32,415
You can never design the perfect situation for creating radar

260
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,695
It doesn't work that way

261
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,999
But sometimes you have to make some rules

262
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,303
And sometimes you have to decide

263
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,607
The five notes are all it takes

264
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,447
But sometimes the circumstances dictate

265
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:45,727
That Disco

266
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,519
It's supposed to be fast

267
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,103
It's probably all the time

268
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,383
Actually now that I think about it

269
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,223
Sorry Jen

270
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:03,391
99% invisible woodspring Suites by me Roman Mars

271
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,159
The same dream

00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,463
It may possible with support from router

273
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,487

It's a project of kalw 91.7 local public radio in San Francisco the American Institute of Architects

What are websites 99% invisible

00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:42,015
Before we go I want to tell you about the body genius

283
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:45,855
A five-part series from Bello radiotopia show the truth

284
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,391
The body genius is a dark

285
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,415
Comic mystery

286
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:51,999
That whines through a treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

287
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,279
We're looking the part

288
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,815
Might cost you your life

289
00:13:55,327 --> 00:14:00,191
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

290
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:04,543
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

291
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:08,895
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like a dad

292
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,431
I'm having

293
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:13,247
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

294
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,551
Actually if I'm being honest

295
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,599
I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that

296
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:23,999
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an act

297
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,279
Watch a movie called Immortal cop

298
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:28,607
Was found dead in my private gym

299
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:31,935
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

300
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:36,287
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

301
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,311
Now

302
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,359
I need to clear my name

303
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:45,759
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes to find them

304
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:53,951
