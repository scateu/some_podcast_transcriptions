A number of cities across the US have actually banned the use of tube guys

63
00:02:55,616 --> 00:03:00,480

00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:05,856
Contributes to Urban visual clutter and blight and adversely affects the aesthetic environment

Trinidad which is where I'm talking to you

83
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:09,600
From now in Trinidad and Tobago a moss man is someone who works in the carnival Arts

84
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:12,672
Peter Mitchell made a name for himself in park

85
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:18,047
By making these larger-than-life puppets that dance to the street to the beat of a steel drum band

86
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:21,119
His work was featured in a book called Caribbean Festival Arts

87

We just how in 1995 Peter Mitchell found himself in a stadium in Los Angeles working with a bunch of different

90
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,943
Trying to figure out ideas for the opening ceremonies at the Atlanta game

91
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,223
The following year

92
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,503
As mental health

93
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:40,063
He was trying to do something using inflatable tube

94
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,855
But it wasn't working out

95
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,623
Episode

96
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,719

Somewhere

100
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,887
How to behave

101
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,167
I just got

102
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,191
Colombian flag

103
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,519
Join them at the waist

104
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:00,799
Don't want you

105
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:03,615
Porcelain divided

106
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,175
You might

107
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,015
Dancing

108
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,855
Boom the dancing to guy is born

109
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:19,231
Mental realized these figures made from a tube hooked on an air source

110
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:23,583
Good dance just like the people did back home in Trinidad and Tobago

111
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:27,679
I'm so it might to another person seem like a great leap

112
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:32,799
I'll be imagination to me it was like jumping into water like a little.

113
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,383
Peter Mitchell knew how to make giant figures

114
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:39,199
They always been powered by people not air

115
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:44,063
And so well Peter Mitchell was in that moment able to Glimpse upon the possibility of

116
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:48,671
Giant undulating inflatable dancing tube guys for sure

117
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:53,535
And so well Peter Mitchell was in that moment able to Glimpse upon the possibility of these tall boys

118
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,327
He knew he needed help

119
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:58,655
They got the call from the Olympic Games from a Peter mincha

120
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:01,727
And he asked me if I came to create the human shape

121
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,287
And then

122
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,823
So difficult that can be done

123
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,103
This is Tyrone Gazette

124
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:07,871
Another artist

125
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:11,199
Who like Peter Mitchell I got known in the Olympics planning

126
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:13,503
He done some work in the 84 games

127
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,527
News in Los Angeles

128
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:17,855
If there's one guy who knows about making things full of air

129
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:21,439
It's him the wrong because he first got interested in inflatables

130
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,743
When he was a college student visiting the US

131
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:24,511
Casitas

132
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,279
Israel

133
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:28,607
He saw someone making balloon figures on the street and got obsessed

134
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,631
Was doing that himself

135
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,167
Isolde balloon animals

136
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,447
Streets in Jerusalem

137
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:35,519
And this day he still carries balloons around with him in his pockets

138
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:40,127
And I like to say that we don't use the B word

139
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,431
All about inflatables

140
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:48,831
Petit founded a company called air dimensional design

141
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:49,855
Objects in sculpture

142
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,391
And so after he got the

143
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:54,463
Call azita his team headed over to meet Mitchell

144
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,743
And see if they could make the

145
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,023
Cowboys reality

146
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:00,095
Which actually turned out to be a pretty big engineering challenge

147
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:06,495
I had to find the right two strong powerful motor that will be able to give me enough safe am in the right

148
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:11,871
You get the idea engineering physics

149
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:12,639
And eventually

150
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,687
These tall boys came to life

151
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,479
And it looks very much like the two guys we

152
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,247
BC today

153
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,527
With two major exception

154
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:25,183
Once they were bipedal their legs divided at the base each with its own fan and to these things were a norm

155
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,719
They were 30 years

156
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,255
If you hyperventilate

157
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:34,911
And that was the first the world that ever seen these inflatable men the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta Cayman Way

158
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:39,007
And so at this point in the story The Two Guys the tall boys

159
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,287
Are out in the world

160
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,871
But how did it go from a thing we saw at the Olympics once

161
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,151
Basically as an art piece

162
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,759
How do they go from that to a thing you see it like every used car lot in America

163
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:54,367
Here is where the Mitchell camp and The Gazette can't begin to diverge

164
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,903
Apetamin pills account

165
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,207
A few months after he returned home from Atlanta

166
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:01,023
He got a call from one of his collaborators at the Olympics

167
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,559
He recalls him saying

168
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:04,863
Hello

169
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,423
In La who made those

170
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:13,567
Because I think

171
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,847
But he's making them

172
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:19,199
Later on mental caught wind that the wrong disease had gotten a patent on the

173
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:21,759
The tallboy the dancing vertical inflatable

174
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:27,647
Cuz it says that he wanted a patent because he put a lot of research and development into making the tube guys work

175
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:31,231
And it was already starting to see other people rip off his effort

176
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:35,327
The Chinese company just took my designs and toes

177
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:39,167
Pictures that they could they just imitate it in the copycat

178
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,447
Tyrone Gazette

179
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,239
Was awarded a patent for

180
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,543
Apparatus and method for providing in

181
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,079
Inflated undulating figures

182
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:46,847
10 mm

183
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,407
Azitra first of them as Fly Guy

184
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,455
Peter Mitchell & Dawn visit both

185
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,479
The breed of a dancing

186
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,247
Inflatable figures

187
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,015
Instrumentals

188
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:58,111
And they both agree that cuz he turned that idea into a reality

189
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,391
Where they disagree

190
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,671
Is whether or not it was

191
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,439
Cool forgas

192
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,463
Cheat to get a patent on

193
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,487
Without informing

194
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,023
Division

195
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,815
He was asking for you

196
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:10,143
It didn't exist before that and then

197
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:16,543
And I very very very very much respected put them in Chinese in an amazing how to write to an artist and

198
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:19,103
Doing good for the work at night was it

199
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,151
In order for me to work with you

200
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:25,247
Cuz he says his attorney told him that in the eyes of the law menchel would not begin

201
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,271
Ininventor

202
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,319
And took his seat was surprised to learn that

203
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,599
Dementia 11 angry with them

204
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:33,183
He says that since then he's reached out to mention the number of Thai

205
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,207
But never her

206
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:38,815
Peter Mitchell says it it never occurred to him to seek a patent on the two guys

207
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:39,583
I don't

208
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,607
Pace

209
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:44,191
I'm a naughty boy from Trinidad I don't know what the law is

210
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:48,799
My instinct tells me

211
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:52,127
The time before he could do any such thing

212
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,407
It is his duty

213
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,175
Teacher Consulting

214
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:57,759
Is heat meanwhile continues to make money off of the tall boys

215
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,039
Fly Guys

216
00:09:59,295 --> 00:09:59,807
Whatever

217
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,087
He licenses his

218
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,111
Patents other companies

219
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,391
Like look our way

220
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,439
Which sells Inflatables here in San Francisco

221
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,975
That's what you heard from earlier

222
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,023
This is like our ways Nick Sonic

223
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,607
Yes or the technology weed license from them has to do with

224
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,911
The way the air escapes the inflatable

225
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,935
Airscape

226
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,239
From threat top of the head

227
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,007
Is well

228
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,031
Which one of the farm

229
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:23,615
So that you know after testing that is what gives

230
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,919
It's Dynamic motion

231
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:28,223
Kind of the special sauce and why it's so effective

232
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:31,039
Look our way has their own name for these things

233
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,063
Air dancers

234
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:35,391
And even though they may be licensing pre-existing technology

235
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:38,207
They also invented a whole new use for them

236
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:42,559
It came to them by way of a farmer in Eastern Washington State named Gary long

237
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,839
Little setup

238
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:48,703
Scary keep apple orchards on his property and he started having a really severe bird problem

239
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:49,727
Starling

240
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,007
Eating tons of adapt

241
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,031
Like literally

242
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,311
10 tons a year

243
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:58,175
When season 2 of 20000 at a 40000 lb of honeycrisp apples

244
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:58,943
Affidavit

245
00:10:59,199 --> 00:10:59,967
Pecked out by birds

246
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,247
And rendered unsellable

247
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:03,807
And so Gary long was looking for ideas

248
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:09,951
I was talking to a person that was selling his products that he grew on this Ranch

249
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:12,255
And so he wanted to attract

250
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:15,071
People that come to each one of these

251
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,631
Are dancers out there

252
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:24,031
Wiggles and Giggles and they all they hoping that people would see that the dancer and come over to it

253
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:27,615
Well it didn't bring any people and other

254
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,687
But the thing that you know this was

255
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:36,319
Hubbardston bother him they weren't coming into a Fruit Stand and pecking on the fruit

256
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:40,415
Gary bought a few air dancers from look our way hoping to keep the birds out

257
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:44,255
The result is the dancer started dancing they took top

258
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,535
And went to the neighbor

259
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,095
Enchilada

260
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,399
This looks like it's got possibilities

261
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:56,031
With the air dancers in place Gary was able to get the bird damage down from 20,000 lb to

262
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:56,799
Ready for this

263
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:59,871
They got bird damage down to zero

264
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,151
Zero damage

265
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:07,551
Gary long called up Nick cassavetes from look our way and made some suggestions for how to turn the air dancer into a bona fide

266
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,319
Hide scarecrow

267
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:11,135
They added bits of reflective material to the Head

268
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,415
Give me some Angry Eyes

269
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,439
Scary teeth

270
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,743
And transform the thing from an air dancer

271
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,023
To an air ranger

272
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:20,863
The air ranger section of the look our way website reads

273
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,935
Dynamic unrepeatable dancing motion

274
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:26,239
Keeps birds away Time After Time

275
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,543
I meant to the are Rangers that Peter Mitchell

276
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,823
It was the first time he'd ever heard

277
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,687
Next time I open up a packet of corn flakes

278
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:36,991
I'll smile

279
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,295
Yes or no bitterness on Mitchell's Park

280
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,831
Even though he's not making any money off of

281
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,391
Actually he loves

282
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,159
Two guys around

283
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,439
Can you imagine

284
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:49,279
How I feel when I'm driving down I don't drive actually when

285
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,839
My friend is driving me down from a house

286
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,631
Who are we

287
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:56,703
A factory building place in chaguaramas

288
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,495
And I see a sort of

289
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:04,127
Diminutive version of a tall boy dancing up a storm by a gas station

290
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,919
Look at where we reach

291
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:11,039
And I'm certainly aware that the dancing couple gas stations all over the

292
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,623
Apartment meet can't help but feel

293
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:15,647
Delight

294
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,463
Nutella

295
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,279
Look at what you and your Island have given to the world

296
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,863
I don't know how much money do around is eat is making off of

297
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:25,887
What is too bad

298
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,959
But whatever it is you can't really say he didn't earn it

299
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:29,983
Sure

300
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:33,311
Maybe it was Peter Mitchell's idea but because he'd actually made this thing

301
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:36,127
And as you really wanted me to point out

302
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:39,199
He's done a lot of other work with inflatable since then

303
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:41,503
But I also love knowing about Peter Mitchell

304
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:44,319
Cannabis things are kind of like shopping plaza ambassador

305
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,111
From the streets of his Caribbean island

306
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,903
Because that is how we dance

307
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,183
Limpid

308
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,207
Andaluz

309
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:50,975
Stop the music

310
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:51,999
Ramzan

311
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:52,767
Street

312
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,559
Solace

313
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,351
And with that in mind

314
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,887
Inflatable figures

315
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:01,983
The two guys that tallboys the Fly Guys the air dancers the air Rangers

316
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,287
I discovered a whole new join them

317
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:07,103
They probably won't convince me to buy a new car

318
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,407
I will Delight in seeing them try

319
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,199
And when I look upon them

320
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:13,759
I will know to listen to the distant whisper

321
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,039
Of a Calypso band

322
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:27,583
99% invisible

323
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,959
Was Prince this week by Sam Greenspan with reporting from Sam Dean who wrote about the two guys previously

And architecture and Interiors firm in beautiful Downtown Oakland California

332
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:03,935
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices were immersed in a cluttered world of man-made

333
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:10,079
If I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexis

334
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:15,967
Is talking to me and my wife is in another room and another hearing.

335
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:17,759
Technology talk to us

336
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:20,063
It is a creation of Sonic trash

Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

To make them more human

340
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,607
Turn the living room lights on

Okay

345
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:45,151
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

346
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:47,967
Makes for a much more natural experience

347
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,015
Turn the living room lights on

348
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,599
