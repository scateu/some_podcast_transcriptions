The world each episode of Family ghosts takes a look at the story behind a different person's family lore

9
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:39,936
Digging into unanswered questions about their history

10
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:42,496

00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:48,896
Between episode where they take you inside the love Israel family called an episode about uncovering the secrets scrolled an annuity

Episode that brings you along to the hunt for a container of missing Chinese food that's haunted a family

14

For 25 years and more

15
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:03,232
The proud family goes to wherever you get your podcast and find out why they say

16
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:04,768
Every house is haunted

17
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,328
This is 99% invisible

18
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,608
I'm Roman Mars

19
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:17,056
Is a show about language and words

20
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:21,408
That's kind of like saying that this show is about architecture and design the description

21
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,200
Doesn't quite capture the way

22
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:26,272
We use those lenses to view the World At Large

23
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:27,552
My favorite

24
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:28,320
Words

25
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:29,600
Are eponyms

26
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:32,928
If you don't know what an eponym is you are about to find out

27
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,536
Because I love eponyms so much each year Helen produces an episode of The Illusionist

28
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:38,816
About evidence

29
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,864
Which feature me talking little bit

30
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,936
We put two of those episodes together for you to enjoy

31
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:44,960
One quick note

32
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:46,240
Helen is from the UK

33
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,544
For the often referred to ballpoint pens

34
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,568
As by Rose

35
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:55,200
You would have picked that up to contacts but I just wanted to eliminate that half-second of confusion that you might have if you're not from there

36
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:58,272
Alright without further Ado here is Helen zaltzman

37
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,552
The Illusionist

38
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,648
Molokai Raymond tweeted the following

39
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:09,024
I would totally listen to an ongoing Ray J series comprised solely of the stories behind eponyms

40
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,560
Firstly I thought

41
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:11,840
What's an eponym

42
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,680
F&M noun

43
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:18,496
A word or name derived from the name of a person

44
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:22,592
Or a pass enough to human Discovery invention Place Etc is named

45
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:26,944
Second day I wondered what it was about eponyms look up Romans so excited

46
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,248
An eponym does almost by definition

47
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:33,344
Has some gun store even if it isn't the origin story it has something

48
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,880
Where it

49
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,952
Got the F&M attached to it

50
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:38,976
Which is

51
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,024
A good enough story to be retold

52
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:45,376
And so for that reason I just I kind of love them and it's worth starts

53
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,912
A good conversation I think

54
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:47,936
That's what that's what I like

55
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:52,288
Silhouette because I think it's a little bit of a slur

56
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,568
If I have this right

57
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,128
The idea that like really elaborate

58
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,664
Painting portraiture was in

59
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,688
Was in fashion

60
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,736
Silhouette was the head of the

61
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,272
French Treasury

62
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:06,112
Was cutting back into Israel their version of austerity

63
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,136
And

64
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:09,440
And that's right at the time when

65
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:14,304
Outline drawings for becoming a fashion which are clearly not as elaborate didn't require

66
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:17,888
An artist inquire months of of time

67
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:18,912
And so

68
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:21,728
That type of a portrait was all a silhouette

69
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:22,496
Like a really like

70
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,288
Stripped-down simple

71
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,312
Didn't require

72
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,080
Real Steel

73
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,104
And

74
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,152
I love that cuz it

75
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,176
It's a bit of

76
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:32,480
A slight at the same time as being descriptive

77
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,808
Enzo I love those ones like

78
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:42,464
Like that but if you like silhouette Truman you probably going to love bowdlerization after the English editor Thomas Powell

79
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:47,072
Ua1919 released a version of Shakespeare's plays that Henry was

80
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,632
Make some more suitable for women and children

81
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:53,472
Hasn't he taken up Wilson naughty bits and foul language

82
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:59,104
The Lady Macbeth doesn't even say her famous line out out damn spot anymore but I don't Crimson sport

83
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:05,504
As if she's in the laundry detergent at Birth actually a huge success and brought Shake special much wider

84
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:11,648
But his name does now stand for cat handed expectation when it comes to word origins and eponym

85
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:14,464
Is the shortest that they are going to get a good story on

86
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,000
That's what I love

87
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:20,095
Taking me this long to realize what is the problem

88
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:24,447
I told you from the very beginning that she does being epidemic show

89
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:30,591
So you should start to do you want to do a regular one

90
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,871
Every 6 weeks

91
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,663
Olc

92
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,199
We'll see how this one goes

93
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:39,807
I'm going to start small with some eponymous items you probably old familiar with

94
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:43,135
You might be holding one right now.

95
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,159
On the Bayou

96
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:50,815
Attorneys fees for the first time in his attempt because I thought they were in the spirit of both Roman Chevy 99percentinvisible which

97
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:53,887
Under this one

98
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:57,983
Because this is a show about what and what is stationary without words

99
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00,031
And words without station rate

100
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,055
Stationary

101
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,079
Basd

102
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,359
Physical infrastructure

103
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,127
Of what

104
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,919
Is James Ward

105
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:09,759
Author of Adventures in stationery a journey through your pencil case

106
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,575
So James knows a lot about ballpoint pens

107
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:15,903
Which we might casually refer to as by Rose obit

108
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,695
I guess what kind of interesting is

109
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,463
Stop

110
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,487
Jealous people

111
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,511
It just one thing

112
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,559
A people say a big fire

113
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,351
Controversial

114
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,631
I'm it's

115
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,399
Kind of

116
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,983
In the same way as you when you wouldn't say

117
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,287
I'm going to have a can of Pepsi Coke

118
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,407
I'm a space you might say I just bought a new Dyson Hoover

119
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,967
Yes this is what I guess it's when

120
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:43,039
When one brand name becomes too

121
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:45,599
Generic and the other one Remains the specific

122
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,135
How to take borrow

123
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:48,671
Generic

Alaska pipeline Road

125
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:52,255
He when he didn't invent the ballpoint

126
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,279
But he kind of

127
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,047
Text

128
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:59,935
Invention of the ballpoint going by patient filed in 1888 is credited to Johnjay loud

129
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,983
Had a great name for a product

130
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,519
But not a good pain

131
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:08,127
Which left room for Laszlo Biro to swoop in and claim both Point Victory

00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,343
An insurance salesman a racecar driver

134
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:23,743
And eventually he became a journalist which was what she was working as in the early 1930s when he invented the pen

135
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:24,767
It would make his name

136
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,815
And indeed to take his name

137
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:29,119
One day he was in the front room

138
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,679
And the heat machinery

139
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,215
Kosice fountain pens leak

140
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,263
And so he wanted to develop

141
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,055
Little tentative wave

142
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,591

144
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,175
He saw the way that the

And

150
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:50,879
So he threw our funny could have like a miniature version of virus

157
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,751
Is he was sitting in

00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,287
In a caffe

00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,055
Window

160
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,335
Trying to make sense of

00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,383
How you make a cylinder rolling cooler

Going to Sun Road Demopolis prep Hudl

167
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,599
And then he saw the

168

Salina full set at the marble made of

169
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,975
And then he suddenly realize how well

00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,679
Based on that Prince

174
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,215
It took him

175
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,519
These children playing with marbles

176
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,311
Make the connection

177
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,591
And

178
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:46,943
But it's weird experience checking into a hotel

179
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,479
And

180
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,527
He signed in

181
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,807

183
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:55,391
And the guy next to him

184
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,671
I saw the pain

185
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,487

You want a pendants knucklehead Harley

243
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,591
Because of the air pressure

244
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,127

00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:00,063
It was a lot of competition over my sleep

249
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:05,439
In the United States a Michael Milton Reynolds wanted to be the first to launch a bull point in that country

00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:15,167
He didn't actually put in effort to make the soup of pain a super pain

256
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:18,751
He just wants to be the first to Market so everyone bought his pain

257
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,031
He was a kind of

258
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,055
Opportunist

259
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:26,431

Crowds like thousands of people lining the streets is it

265
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,535
It was he was like that but

266
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,839
So it depends it was crappy

267
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:46,911

274
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,895
Who said that

275
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,175
Nearly killed it off

276
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,711
Because people have this

277
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,735

288
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,639
They licensed the technology from Biro

289
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:31,711
Everything is very complicated legal battle

290
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:36,831
Books where each party are suing the other one cuz I claim the infringement and

291
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,367

Gru in Grand Prairie

307
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,647

Yeah it's actually something like

317
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,847
Think ha

318
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,127
Opal point

00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,583
The big Crystal just wax and

331
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,399
It's one in the collection of Museum

332
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:55,935

Yeah but it's a different experience

337
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:12,063
Let's take a little etymology break

338
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:17,951
Pen and pencil meisha a syllable but don't let that jeep you into thinking they have a common linguistic origin

339
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:21,279
Pain derives from the Latin Penna which meant feather

340
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,095
I think we'll plan is a tautology good tonight

341
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:28,703
Pencil meanwhile came from the Latin for a painter's brush penicillus

342
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,031
A diminutive appendicular switchman littletale

343
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:35,615
Intelligent Patel is also where we get to work penis

344
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:40,735
Anyway back to pens and how their development influence the development of rocking itself

345
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,807
The ability to make marks more precisely

346
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,623
Means that you are able to make more complex Ma

347
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:47,903
So

348
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:50,207
Fo you have is

349
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,231

351
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,535
You can Arnie

352
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,327

353
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,863
Script

354
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,655
Form is quite angular

355
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,959
But then if you stop using

356
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,007
Micah Reed Rush

357
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:05,567

358
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,127
Office you more flexibility

359
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,151
And then if you start

360
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:09,919
Using

361
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,711
Pirates

362
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:12,735
Quite rough

363
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,759

375
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,375
With those

376
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,143

Distinguish that you're able

381
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,103
He's writing

382
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:43,199
My school with only lettuce use fountain

383
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:45,759
We would not allowed to write with both points

384
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:49,599
I'm missing shipping quote Tacoma not street with bullet points for a long time

385
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:55,999
Fountain pen companies thick lines thin lines flourishes and thoughts invest your handwriting with a lot of character

386
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:59,839
Fly for the pool in the pool point produces a line of uniform thickness

387
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:03,167
So a lot of people believe that the pens are detrimental to handwriting

388
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:03,935
Las Vegas

389
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,703
Daughter

390
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:05,727
She said

391
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,543
Her father would have to respond to these complaints

392
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:12,383
And he used to hit people say that the whole point was ruining writing skills

393
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:15,455
And he'd smile and say what writing comes from the heart

394
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,479
We can help

395
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,759
Hands before massage

396
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,599
It's nothing wrong with

397
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,671
I think it's interesting

398
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,279
Extreme excessive

399
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,839
Disposable

400
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:33,887
Yeah

401
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,167
San Jose

402
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,191
They

403
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,239
Disposable

404
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,799
In that you can owe a big

405
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,591
Is Noah pyro is

406
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:43,615
Peter Noone

407
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,639
I need to know who

408
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,663
Marcel

409
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,943
Is all here

410
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:47,711
Flashlight

411
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,479
Is

412
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,551
Say they could have made this disposable

413
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:54,623
Contributions a strain and in the same way they might themselves

414
00:15:55,391 --> 00:16:01,535
So if you're eponymous product a successful your involvement in it and even your own identity is subsumed

415
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,863
Which one don't fit that well with the kind of people who put the names on things

416
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:08,959
Because calling something off yourself seems like quite an egomaniacal choice to me

417
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:13,311
I mean I may be wrong but my impression is a lot of eponyms are not

418
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,615
The person named in the map

419
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,383
Songs

420
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,663
It's more than a sign

421
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,431
By another person

422
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,735
Mark of respect

423
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:21,759
Yeah

424
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,295
Do you think boots

425
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,575
I believe

426
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:27,135
Disease a horrible medical condition named after

427
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:33,535
Quite a sad way to be remembered isn't it I don't know

428
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,583
You probably gotten past

429
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:39,935
The feeling of gross mess around disease and you probably just enjoy the fact that

430
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:43,263
You were instrumental in its Discovery or successful treatment

431
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,847
I have a feeling that I could I could even live with that horrible

432
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:47,871
Disease being in.

433
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:51,711
Yeah but I need help people who are you remembered you because you'll what killed their grandma

434
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,783
And you feel good about that

435
00:16:56,831 --> 00:17:00,671
Just be remembered any of the most important thing

436
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,719
Couple serial killers banking on

437
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,543
Anel part two of The Illusionist eponyms Saga where we learn some bad news

438
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,311
About apus

439
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,407
There's a shift a gradual shift

440
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,455
Away from using up and down

441
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,223
Gyms in Madison

442
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:26,271
Who's this enemy of eponyms

443
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:31,903
My name is Isaac Siemens and I'm a resident physician in the department of family and Community medicine

444
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,439
I'm at the University of Toronto

445
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:36,255
There's two camps in medicine currently

446
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,279
People who

447
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:41,375
Want to use afternoons and people who want to move away from eponyms and there's

448
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:47,519
There's a few different reasons for that people that are more in touch with history perhaps and then people that are more

449
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,799
Moving towards kind of

450
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,591
Accuracy in language

451
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,895
In Broad Strokes that's the controversy

452
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:55,455
You can see the Practical case for this shift

453
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:59,551
Medical workers have to stay abreast of an awful lot of terminology

454
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:03,903
You try memorizing a load of surnames and which element each one represents

455
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,183
A list of

456
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,207
Diseases with

457
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,743
Somebody's last name as

458
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10,047
The title gives you no information and

459
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,607
How to get bundled up where is

460
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:16,703
You can kind of fake your way through if you will if the name of the disease

461
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:18,239
It says something about the desert

462
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:22,591
To use an example that was all over the news when I was growing up

463
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,615
Cjd

464
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,407
Creutzfeldt-jakob disease

465
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:32,063
The name alone doesn't tell you much about what it is unless you were familiar with the early 20th century work of the Germany

466
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,111
Neurologist hands get hot

467
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,647
And alfons Maria

468
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,719
Do you have a name is also not easy to spell

469
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:42,303
At the far end of the scale tabloids called the condition

470
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,607
The human form of mad cow disease

471
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:47,935
Hey Brother cartoonish time for brutal and incurable illness

472
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:50,495
So the other option is the scientific term

473
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:54,591
Cjd is a form of transmissible spongiform encephalitis

474
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:57,919
Encephalitis from the medical Latin encephalon

475
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,711
From the ancient Greek and kephalos

476
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,735
Meaning brain

477
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:01,759
The itis

478
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,295
Suffix denotes inflammation

479
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:05,087
Spongiform encephalitis

480
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,367
To me that way

481
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,183
Be easier cuz that tells you something about

482
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,463
I mean although it's Latin

483
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,487
It gives you a bit of a

484
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:12,255
Information

485
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,023
So you could kind of peace

486
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:13,791
Is it together

487
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:14,815
If you had to

488
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,887
Spongy

489
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:20,191
Essentially it's all there

490
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,471
If anything

491
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:24,543
That's more literal than a lot of disease names would be

492
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:30,943
Think so perhaps when you're receiving a diagnosis this some psychological protection from the Grim reality of what's half

493
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:31,967
Play Nobody

494
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:36,319
Somewhat disguised by science be called the opaqueness of an eponym

495
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:42,719
On the other hand an overly academic or incomprehensible description of the condition can amplify a patient

496
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,999
Stress and fear

497
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:44,767
1

498
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:48,863
Thing that hopefully is changing in medicine that maybe tizen

499
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,143
OSU is

500
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:50,911
The sort of

501
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,983
Black boxing of knowledge and

502
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,519
Disorder protective

503
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:56,543
Nature

504
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,871
Different professions and I think it's similar to law or

505
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:02,431
Engineering maybe we're

506
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:05,503
You know in order to protect our jobs and

507
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:08,319
Seem like we have some sort of power over

508
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,623
The people we work with we kind of make

509
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:11,903
Things possibly

510
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:16,255
More difficult to understand than they need to be and we use a jargon and a lang

511
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,279
That needs to

512
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,047
To be taught

513
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,327
To be understood so

514
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,375
I don't know if there's some sort of like

515
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,423
Unconscious

516
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:24,703
Protectionism

517
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,471
Ivar

518
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,239
Practice

519
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:27,519
Involved with naming

520
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,847
Cuz even the non F&M

521
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,895
Names are very like complicated

522
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,175
Don't mean a lot

523
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:40,575
It's it's quite a common thing in language like the Bible using quite lovely sounding language so that

524
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:43,135
You maintain. Division of status

525
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:47,743
I just wonder whether that's a decent middle ground in medicine between

526
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:52,095
Wibbly wobbly heart disease a long complicated name

527
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,655
You don't want it so simple that you sound kind of

528
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:56,447
Stupider like you don't know what's going on

529
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,007
I guess but

530
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,287
It's also

531
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,615
In medicine as in everything communication

532
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,383
So important

533
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,407
And so

534
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,967
You want to strike that middle ground where you're making

535
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,247
To that person

536
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:16,159
So in some circumstances it's better to use the acronym because it might be more familiar

537
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:20,000
We learn about trisomy 21 which is a genetic disorder that

538
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,304
We're encouraged to speak about

539
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:23,584
Referring

540
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,400
The actual genetic issue

541
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,168
Where is

542
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:29,216
Down syndrome is the common

543
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:30,752
Eponym

544
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:33,824
I think the lay public as well are more familiar with

545
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,848
That language

546
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:38,432
Some concepts of really hard to describe without the eponym

547
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,712
And with an eponym

548
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:42,528
Much more memorable with a heimlich maneuver

549
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,112
Be something that people knew it wasn't attached to a name

550
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:47,392
Like Lime Lush

551
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:53,792
You know no I don't think so would it have made the news in May of this yet when 96 year olds

552
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,328
Henry heimlich himself

553
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:58,144
Save the woman from choking on a piece of hamburger meat

554
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:04,288
Are using the maneuver the best his name

555
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,824
Tell an interesting story

556
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,640
I totally get why then I'm not so tied to

557
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:09,408
My

558
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:13,504
Worldview or Nostalgia that I cannot accept

559
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,552
That it would be better another way

560
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:21,952
Well good because there was Stephanie some aspects to eponyms that I didn't think you'd like Raymond argument against

561
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:25,024
Eponyms is that it's sort of a simplification of complex

562
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,560
Stories where

563
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:30,144
Generally a white dead male will get

564
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:30,912
The

565
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:31,936
F&M

566
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:34,240
But if you look at

567
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,544
The process of discovering and categorizing

568
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,824
Diseases it's often

569
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,152
Over the course of more than a lifetime and it involves many many

570
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,432
Keep off

571
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:44,992
And it's sort of a false history to just

572
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,016
Use this

573
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:46,784
Its name

574
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,064
And then there are like

575
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:51,136
Ridiculous extremes where there's like

576
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:53,184
For it for 5 people

577
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:54,976
That all have

578
00:22:55,232 --> 00:23:01,376
Similar form of the disease named after them and then later on they discovered that it was the same disease the whole time and then it gets off

579
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,400
All messed up like

580
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:09,056
I have one of them written down cuz I can never remember it but I think it's the longest it's the longest eponym that I've come across

581
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,080
And it's

582
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,360
At 4

583
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,128
Barros

584
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,176
Name if you will and it's

585
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:16,736
Mayer-rokitansky-kuster-hauser

586
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:23,136
Mayer rokitansky kuster Hauser syndrome is congenital abnormalities in or absence of the uterus.

587
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:25,696
Vagina it sounds like four people

588
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:32,096
All had some sort of a claim to the discovery of the disease in reality that were far more than four

589
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:37,216
People have been writing about the condition all the way back as far as the Greek physician Hippocrates

590
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:39,008
In the 5th Century BC

591
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:45,152
Rokitansky kuster and towels are all made significant contributions to the understanding of the disease

592
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:47,456
But they weren't even working together

593
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:51,296
Mad describe the syndrome in a paper in 1829

594
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:53,856
About 50 years before Custer was born

595
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:59,744
92 years before the birth of Hauser who went on to name the disease Mario cutkosky Costa syndrome

596
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,144
Someone else I did how's it to the end you don't hear that disease name a lot but I feel like every time I hear it the order is a little

597
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,680
Little different so I don't even know if there's

598
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:11,008
Like a standardized name order to it maybe they Shuffle it

599
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,032
5 everyone gets

600
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,312
Turn on the front

601
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,336
They take turns

602
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:18,176
The problem with quite a lot of acronyms is the person named therein

603
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,456
Reiter's syndrome

604
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,480
Is a

605
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:23,552
Condition where you get joint pain related to

606
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,576
And I kind of see

607
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:25,856
Systemic inflammation

608
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,904
And it's named after

609
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,440
Hans writer who was

610
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,976
A famous Nazi

611
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,256
War criminal

612
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,792
Gruden terrible experience

613
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,352
Buchenwald

614
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:42,752
Hans reuter discovered the eponymous syndrome in 1916 when he treated his soldiers during the first World War

615
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:44,800
Prior to his Nazi affiliation

616
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:51,456
The witch the American rheumatologist dr. Efraim Engelman was unaware when he coined the acronym in 1942

617
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:55,552
But he like to join The Campaign which began in 1977

618
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,832
To replace the Apple

619
00:24:57,344 --> 00:25:01,696
With the name Anna somebody associated with war crimes and mass murder

620
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:06,816
If you don't want to avoid sounds right you can call this condition reactive arthritis

621
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:10,400
But while usage of the eponymous time has decreased

622
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:13,984
It is still being used in medical schools and in journals

623
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,080
The debate rages on do you pick and choose which parts of history of mock

624
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:24,224
Do you allow a person scientific achievements to be honored despite whatever horrible things they did

625
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,528
Controversial things eponyms

626
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:29,088
There's even more controversy about

627
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:35,488
F&M is where there's like a sub conflict if you will going on about whether to use the possessive or not in

628
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,512
I'm so

629
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:41,120
There's an even within people that use eponyms are down the people that use eponyms

630
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:47,776
Having debates about whether it should be Downs apostrophe s for possessive or down syndrome Enders research

631
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:48,544
Search about like

632
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,824
Which should be used

633
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:51,616
In medical journals

634
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:55,200
I'm to simplify searches so that you don't have to search

635
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:55,968
Turn

636
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:59,296
I think that's the one thing I would simplify I would get rid of

637
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:00,832
Apostrophe

638
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:03,392
Wow that seems like the right solution

639
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:06,208
Caesar salad Caesar salad

640
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,000
Seasoned ice

641
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:10,816
But yeah they possibly it messes up a little too much

642
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:11,840
And you shouldn't have nothing

643
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:18,240
You about it is already know something about about that horrible disease you got

644
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:20,288
And the great Rich story behind the name

645
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:22,080
It was enough

646
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:25,152

So much

650
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,808
Story embedded in Fayetteville last night

651
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,368
I was eating dinner with my kids

652
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,648
And the wife

653
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:36,928
And

654
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,976
We were talking about childbirth

655
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:40,000
And mentioned

656
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,792
The cesarean section

657
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:42,816
The way

658
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:45,120
But these two babies

659
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:47,680
Pain in my butt when boys came into this world

660
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:48,960
And

661
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:51,520
It caused us to talk about

662
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:53,312
Caesar and

663
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:55,872
Was Caesar really the first person to have

664
00:26:56,128 --> 00:27:01,760
Give me the results of a cesarean section in which case I have no actual knowledge

665
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:08,160
Probably not it's hard to imagine that the first person to be born through this procedure also became one of the most famous people

666
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:11,232
What all history of the most famous salad

667
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:16,352
Cfnm circus-like

668
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:20,192
They're endlessly fascinating so but it causes great conversation

669
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:23,008
At a dinner table with two 9 year olds and

670
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,616
And my wife and we had fun no talking about it and even the parts of it that are the

671
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:29,408
You're the caveats in

672
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,432
Dinnerly

673
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:34,528
The etymology with the tidiest story is the least true

674
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:39,648
You know it seems like that's the nature of it unfortunately there Shaggy are and messier than they

675
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:42,208
And in general the true ones are Shaggy or Messi

676
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:48,864
Give some gory dinner table conversation

677
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:51,424
