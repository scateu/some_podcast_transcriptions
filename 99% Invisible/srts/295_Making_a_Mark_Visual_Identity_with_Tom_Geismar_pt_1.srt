To see today

37
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,632
Whether they design them or not

38
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,424
In 1961

39
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,960
Logo for Chase Bank

40
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:45,728
Poppy design

41
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:49,056
The blue octagon with the square in the middle was introduced

42
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,848
It's still used everywhere

43
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:53,408
Consider when the first of its kind in the US

44
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:55,200
An abstract Dynamic shape

45
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,992
Representing a giant company

46
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:59,296
The logo was a real CJ

47
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,320
For Chase

48
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:06,208
Belle Chasse at that time it was really Chase Manhattan bank because it was the merger

49
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,744
Two giant bags

50
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:11,328
Chase National Bank in the back of the Manhattan company

51
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,120
And

52
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:16,960
They had a logo which featured a map of the United States

53
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,008
Globe of the world

54
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:22,848
The wording Chase Manhattan Bank in a few other things

55
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,128
It was quite a

56
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,152
Credit mix

57
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,968
I meant they were

58
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:34,112
In the process of building the first modern skyscraper in the Wall Street area because of Avi

59
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:38,464
Financial firms for moving up to Midtown at that point

60
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:43,328
David Rockefeller was in charge of that process though he was only 13 command at the time

61
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,608
At the bank

62
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,888
And

63
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:46,656
He fell

64
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:49,984
That would be appropriate to have them also and modern

65
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,032
Contemporary looking mark

66
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,568
For this new Leaf

67
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,592
Form Dutch

68
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,640
Basically you're merger

69
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,688
Least of these two Banks

70
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,832
And we discussed with him the idea of maybe we could just do something abstract because no one had any idea of

71
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:09,184
A symbol of banking dollar sign

72
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,304
Chase was so big they were going to be either the number one or number two I don't remember

73
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,328
Largest

74
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:18,912
Bank in the country they had advertising in the newspapers every day

75
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,448
Turn around

76
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:23,008
New York metropolitan area that you couldn't miss

77
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:26,080
Their branches they were everywhere so

78
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:28,896
The idea that you could establish something

79
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:31,712
Don't you be abstract as their mark

80
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:35,040
What channel is the Red Cross or Mercedes

81
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,648
Chevrolet that mean there are some around there were some of the time

82
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,464
But not many at all

83
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,744
And that was the idea

84
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,280
We can do that

85
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,560
Stop for something

86
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:50,400
That was bold and that would be recognized as representing the bank

87
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,800
And so how did you come up with the shape like what were the drawings like what were you thinking when that shape was

88
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,080
Applying to Chase

89
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,456
But we weren't something bold something to stand out something that could be reproduced

90
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:06,016
In various materials

91
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:08,320
Something that could work at a small size

92
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:13,184
Turn up the time is very important also that's something that could work in black and white in the newspaper

93
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,256
There was no color printing in newspapers at that time

94
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:21,887
Something that could work on television but also in a letterhead or a formal announcement

95
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:22,655
So we

96
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,447
Try to keep all those things

97
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:29,055
In mind we looked at a number of different designs this particular one

98
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,871
It's also quite similar to

99
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,175
Old Chinese coins

100
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:38,015
They were rectangular they had a hole in the middle

101
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,551
And someone in that was

102
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:42,111
Helpful in terms of rationalizing

103
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,159
Why that particular design

104
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:45,695
And so

105
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,743
In Rockefeller was

106
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,303
Turn on your side in this but

107
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,607
Did they expect something quite so

108
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:57,727
Dynamic and radical in Revolutionary or they expecting something more akin to the

109
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:01,823
Map of United States and the globe and the world banking

110
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,383
Word on top of them what were they expecting

111
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:11,039
Well you say they David Rockefeller certainly went along with this idea but the two

112
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,319
Do people above him

113
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:16,415
John McCloy the chairman and George Champion the president

114
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,951
We're pretty shocked

115
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,511
Women that when we showed it to them

116
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:24,351
Championship why can't we just have a picture of the building

117
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:27,679
Or the sculptures were going to have out front

118
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,727
Panda

119
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:32,543
We tried to persuade him that was a bad idea

120
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:35,359
Helen McCrory eventually said

121
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:38,431
David we've given you this project

122
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,711
If you want this

123
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,247
For the

124
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:47,135
Retail Bank you can do it but I don't want to see it on my letterhead I don't want to see at my office

125
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:50,719
I don't want to see it I really don't understand it and don't like it

126
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:54,559
Soon thereafter they adopted it and

127
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:57,119
The bank went ahead and did it and it was only

128
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,423
6 months later

129
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:03,519
That we were down there and ran into McCoy in the hallway

130
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,055
And

131
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:10,175
Barry was with a tie with a symbol on it with cufflinks with the symbol on it

132
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,735
With a pin in his lapel with a symbol on it

133
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:15,551
So it was a great lesson to us because

134
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:18,623
Suddenly someone who couldn't understand it

135
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,671
As an abstract design

136
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:23,487
Now really accepted it

137
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,791
As a representation of

138
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,839
His his company

139
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:31,167
So you mentioned the lessons of McCoy

140
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,447
Employee

141
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,471
On board

142
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,751
With the mark

143
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:37,055
As soon as it became the mark of his bank

144
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,639
Expand on what some of those lessons are and how you

145
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,431
Use them to think about your work

146
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,223
Today in and how you deal with client

147
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,783
Well I think that's a big lesson

148
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,831
And we learn then was that

149
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:55,231
What people react to is not the more but they react to is the institution that it represents

150
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,791
So if you ask people

151
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,095
Yo what do they think are good marks

152
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,119
They will

153
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,655
Almost inevitably

154
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,191
Mention

155
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:07,775
Companies or institutions or whatever that they think highly of

156
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:13,407
So they'll often say apple and others that they think highly of

157
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:16,479
Dilemmas never say Imran for example

158
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,295
Even though Enron had a very

159
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,063
Good

160
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:20,831
Mark

161
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:23,903
Designed by a famous designer Paul Rand

162
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:28,511
Nothing to do with the quality pretty much it has to do with what it represents

163
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:32,351
So the chase logo with something that's from the ground up

164
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:34,143
A brand new invention

165
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,959
It's also done an umbrella I got a patient's and

166
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,239
An update since

167
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:41,055
Was one of you talk about the PBS logo which is something that

168
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:41,823
I think a lot of

169
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,847
People are familiar with

170
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:45,663
What that process was like and then what you were trying to do there

171
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:51,807
You're very often we will try and build on something that's there if it has real real value

172
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,367
And in the case of PBS

173
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,903
There was a

174
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:57,951
The problem

175
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,719
That

176
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:01,023
They and the station

177
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,327
Where is public broadcasting stations

178
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:08,191
At the time people presumed it was the public broadcasting system

179
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,799
The way CBS is the Columbia broadcasting system it's on

180
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:17,407
At CBS you know they have a number of owned stations and whatever

181
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,991
End of the issue was that actually

182
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,783
The stations

183
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,367
Had complete responsibility for raising their own funds

184
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,647
To keep in business

185
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,183
And PBS is not a

186
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:32,767
Conglomerate that supplies funding and someone

187
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,303
Verizon programming

188
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:37,887
But not finding any people misperceived

189
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:41,215
What PBS was in there and their logo

190
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,751
Was a very clever

191
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:46,079
PBS where the P was a person

192
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,639
Service silhouetto of a man

193
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,175
And

194
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:53,247
The idea was could we do something

195
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,575
That makes it clear that does public television

196
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,367
Not some kind of

197
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,135
Network

198
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:05,023
So or I thought was actually at the time to take that P

199
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,071
That they had out of the PBS

200
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:10,911
Turn around 30 gave me lobotomy

201
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,191
And

202
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:16,031
Pick some up a bit and then repeat it so that was the idea of multiple

203
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,055
People is in

204
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,591
That was public TV

205
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:22,175
But that was the whole reason to do it but again it got filled

206
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,223
On something that existed

207
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:27,039
A part of the letter so it was no great

208
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,343
Radical change

209
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:32,159
At the time but it was something more appropriate

210
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,207
And something to solve a problem

211
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,231
To how do you

212
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,023
Steer a client to select

213
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,327
Name of the shape in the idea that in your heart

214
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:45,727
You really know is the right one like how many options do you give them but I'll need variations do you present is there a psychology

215
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,007
In presenting a logo

216
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:47,775
2 group

217
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,079
Will today

218
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,383
We do want to prevent

219
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,919
Options we almost

220
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,455
Almost always do

221
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:59,039
Because there is not necessarily one right answer

222
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,599
For these issues

223
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:04,671
It's just you're having to make a decision and go ahead with it

224
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:11,071
But we you know explain what the pluses and minuses are of the various options

225
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,935
And you often have a favored which we try to push if we had

226
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:17,983
Butters

227
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,543
There's not necessarily a computer

228
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,335
The obvious

229
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,103
Right

230
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:23,871
Answer

231
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,175
And when you have a favorite.

232
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:31,551
Give me state that it's your favorite or do you just presented first or presented last is there a

233
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,855
Engagement ship in this at all

234
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,927
There may be a little bit but not

235
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:39,231
Not that much and we don't usually state

236
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:42,303
Which one we favor for showing options

237
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,863
But we encourage them to ask us

238
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:48,191
A later and we try to also get there

239
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,751
Take out in one of the first things we say

240
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:55,615
Actually when we're before we presented anything is it's never love at first sight

241
00:10:56,383 --> 00:11:01,759
So it's your thing is if you can imagine what it might be like it actually use

242
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:05,087
And that's what we try to show when where showing

243
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,367
Designs

244
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,647
Have to be marks

245
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:11,743
What it might look like in various appropriate to kind of use

246
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:18,655
So I see the chase logo on my iPhone it works really well as an app icon it is that a coincidence or something

247
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:24,031
Has made it indoor over 50 years in in in Brooks on a tiny screen as well as a

248
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,847
Trinidad and other tie tack and everything

249
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:32,735
Well it is a coincidence but it happens to work very much in our favor because we've always tried to do things

250
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:38,367
That are very clear very simple and that can be reduced to a small size

251
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:42,463
So suddenly today it's a it's a requirement

252
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:47,327
Really have almost every Mark that has any kind of social exposure

253
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,119
And it does work well

254
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:55,775
And it just happens I think maybe our approach was the right approach and we were lucky

255
00:11:56,031 --> 00:12:00,383
That it certainly applicable today and looked like a lot of work we get

256
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,175
Today is because people have

257
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,967
Mark's that can't work is it at

258
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,039
So has the approach

259
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,575
For creating marks

260
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,623
Changed over 60 years in

261
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:13,695
Because of this or there are there other things that

262
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:17,279
Are more fundamental in the in the change in the work that you guys do

263
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,839
You don't actually hasn't

264
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:23,679
Change that much at least our approach to it hasn't changed that much

265
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:26,495
Is that say mention we try to

266
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,287
Really

267
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,823
Get down to the basics

268
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,895
Sing a basic Mark that can identify

269
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:37,247
Whatever the institution is that we're identifying in a clear way

270
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:41,343
And we have three criteria really which are the basic criteria

271
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,879
That one is that at

272
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,671
Be appropriate

273
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,951
You would do something

274
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:50,559
Sports team that would be quite different for something you do for a bank for example

275
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,863
It'd be appropriate to

276
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,143
To the client

277
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,935
In to enter what they do

278
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:58,751
Second one would be that'll be distinctive

279
00:12:59,007 --> 00:12:59,519
That

280
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:03,871
You can see it you can remember it you can recognize it

281
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,407
Maybe you can doodle it

282
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:10,015
Quickly after having seen it a couple times

283
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:12,319
Set that it that it will stand out

284
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,599
And be recognized

285
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:18,207
And then the third thing is just that it works in all kinds of sizes

286
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:23,071
Different materials and so on if that's appropriate and it often is

287
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:26,143
So if you can meet those three

288
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,935
Criteria

289
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,471
Then we're doing pretty well

290
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,263
How do you balance

291
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,823
The concept of being appropriate

292
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,871
Towards a certain Institution

293
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,175
And it being abstract enough

294
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,199
2

295
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,503
You know be this empty vessel that

296
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,039
Rapport meaning into

297
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,599
Well it doesn't have to be

298
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:48,927
An empty vessel that all it doesn't have to be abstract

299
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,975
For banking that window

300
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:54,047
We couldn't think of anything that's good

301
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:58,399
Trappa lyrics persons banking but that's not always the case by any means

302
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,191
I mean if there is something

303
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,775
Real that's appropriate than you try to work

304
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,359
Understandable

305
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:12,991
That's a lot easier for people to understand the other thing is that once we did the Chase Bank

306
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,271
Mark

307
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:17,599
Thanks rollover infect people over started using

308
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:24,511
Making abstract sense because they didn't have anything like the exposure

309
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,815
Dr. Chase

310
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,911
That kind of thing only works really well if you

311
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:34,751
I'll have enough exposure that people come to recognize it

312
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:35,775
Brian

313
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:36,799
Rhino that makes

314
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,847
Example I know that

315
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,127
Your

316
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,663
Group is responsible for a lot of

317
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,455
Aquarium logos and those are

318
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:47,807
You know that they have nice shapes to them in their abstracted in certain ways but

319
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:53,695
Waves and fish and things that you recognized as the things that that it represents as an aquarium

320
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:56,511
Yes and I actually will those aquariums

321
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:02,911
They will have different emphasis in terms of the concept of the building and and the

322
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,191
He said that since I won

323
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:08,031
And so we're even trying to represent that obviously fish

324
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,079
And water are

325
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,871
Key part of all of them

326
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,943
But summer about the oceans and summer about

327
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,991
Freshwater and so on

328
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,527
You talk about

329
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:20,319
You know how you decide

330
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,087
Nearest

331
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,135
In the very beginning stages

332
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:23,903
Of working

333
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,671
The client

334
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,463
Whether or not you're going to

335
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,487
Do some kind

336
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,255
Wordmark

337
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,023
That uses

338
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,303
The company's name or

339
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,583
Something more abstract

340
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,119
Pictorial

341
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:33,887
How do you

342
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:34,911
Make that up

343
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:39,007
Well that's what was the key decisions

344
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,079
We don't surely make the decision

345
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:46,431
We we might show you both options for example

346
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,991
And what the pluses and minuses are

347
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:49,759
Proposed

348
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:53,343
Two things that depends of course and put the name is to begin with

349
00:15:54,623 --> 00:16:00,255
But generally if the name is is short and I shorted me maybe five letters or something

350
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,791
Annie's distinctive

351
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,559
Then

352
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,863
We would start with the idea

353
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,399
Making that word

354
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,423
Distinctive

355
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,287
I'm doing a lot of work for a lot of technology companies recently added

356
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,847
You know what they're

357
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:21,247
Doing is pretty hard to understand and serve you very hard to represent in any meaningful way

358
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,295
You know it's not as if they're

359
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:26,623
They're harvesting apples or something that you can do Annapolis

360
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,391
Whatever

361
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,695
It's extremely difficult

362
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,463
Go to work

363
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:32,255
Find something that's a

364
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,023
Appropriate

365
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,071
Meaningful but also

366
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:35,839
Distinctive

367
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,911
And if so is there a certain thing that you listen

368
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,703
For when somebody describes

369
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,751
Company describes what they do

370
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,543
That is a

371
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:47,871
Key into your process of beginning to design something

372
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,151
For them or is it too stiff

373
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,175
Every time

374
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:55,295
Well we go through a whole process of trying to interview a lot of people

375
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:57,855
Really trying to understand the culture

376
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:00,415
And what they do obviously

377
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:06,047
And to understand the competition and Racine with

378
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,583
Against and

379
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,119
Really together

380
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,143
Pretty in-depth

381
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,679
Understanding

382
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:14,495
Of what the situation is in

383
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,543
In the process of doing all that

384
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,823
And interviewing people

385
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,871
Muffin ideas funny

386
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,663
Some funny places come up

387
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:24,223
Might be just a wisecracking

388
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:28,575
Conversation or something but that's where a lot of the ideas come

389
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:34,719
Sue in 1961 you can introduce an octagon and have a pretty simple

390
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:36,511
Be bold and be assertive with Chase

391
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,535
Because Chase is so big

392
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:42,143
Now you know doggone it's closed off you can't put an octagon out there

393
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,679
As an abstract marched

394
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,215
You know for a company

395
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:46,495
Is it harder

396
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,823
Have a bold graphic

397
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:53,151
Simple today just because of the number of

398
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:53,919
Shape sorter

399
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,199
Just limited in the world

400
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:57,247
Well it is hard

401
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:00,063
Chester there are so many and now with

402
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:06,719
Little icons and emojis and whatever is just so much so much around so yeah

403
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:08,767
Yes it is it is difficult

404
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:11,839
What we do now is before we show anything

405
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,631
To our clients we

406
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,399
Have

407
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:17,215
Done a preliminary legal search

408
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,239
So

409
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:20,543
We try not to show anything

410
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,335
To a client

411
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,871
East Pass

412
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:24,895
The initial with

413
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:25,919
Knockouts

414
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:26,687
Search

415
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:29,503
Because we don't want them to fall in love with something and then find out

416
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,783
MLB can't use it

417
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:34,111
Have you ever fallen in love with something and found out you couldn't use it

418
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:38,719
Oh sure we just don't show it

419
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:43,327
I mean very much and one of the one of those

420
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:46,911
Complications is of course the things are registered

421
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:50,239
Has marks within a certain area of business

422
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,567
For example I want to wake up a week if it's

423
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,103
Red star

424
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:57,663
So what I mean obviously represents China

425
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,199
But it's also Macy's

426
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:02,271
Is San Pellegrino it's Heineken

427
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:06,879
It's it's many different things and they're all doing it legally

428
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,927
They will have the right to use it

429
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,463
Another so

430
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,767
It's not quite so simple

431
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:19,167
So you might have something you come up with it maybe similar to something in a very different field

432
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,495
And you have to register the mark in particular

433
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,799
Yeah whatever area business here in

434
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,847
And so then there's

435
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:28,895
That decision to hear do you

436
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:35,039
Go ahead presuming it's going to be okay because there's not going to be confusion because you're in a completely different

437
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,063
World

438
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:37,599
Or not

439
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:41,183
Has this method of

440
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:43,487
You know introducing things to the public

441
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,023
That's really change

442
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,047
Extend

443
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,327
The time. Would you been work

444
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,143
How do you approach that now in in what do you think of

445
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,703
The Serta Bloodsport of

446
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,007
Introducing logo is in

447
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,287
Reactions online

448
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,311
And that kind of thing

449
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:00,639
Well are you sure recommendation is don't say a word

450
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,919
Just do it

451
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:06,527
I think if you look at more broadly I think people are much more

452
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,319
Visually aware

453
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,879
Today

454
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,183
You're always looking at their phone they're looking at

455
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,487
Icons of looking at apps

456
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:19,327
They're looking at all these things in and so it's much more part of the

457
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,863
Culture so

458
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,935
I think the desire to do something good

459
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:27,519
Which sperm are going to be was certainly a positive thing is part of that

460
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,823
The idea being a Critic is

461
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,847
Is another part of

462
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:33,407
But I think overall

463
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,711
It is great that people are much more

464
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:38,015
Conscious and aware I critical

465
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,063
Of these things

466
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:46,463
Tom Geismar is the co-founder of Termite & Geismar & haviv

467
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:52,351
If I mentioned at the beginning the show Tom's longtime partner Ivan chermayeff died in December of 2017

468
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,887
They work together for 6

469
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:54,655
60 years

470
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:59,519
Expanded text version of this interview will be included in a new book about the firm

471
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:02,847
Don't be published by standards manual in May 2018

472
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,383
Bobolink

Coming up an extended preview of a brand-new radiotopia show in the producers of criminal

474
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:13,599
Criminal

475
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,647
What day you ask me

476
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,672
Is my personal

477
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,976
Favorite podcast I cannot praise it enough

478
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:22,304
Guava short story and preview of their brand new series

479
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:23,328
But after that

480
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,312
Between the beats

481
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:35,616
Bongs and Charter of our devices

482
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:39,200
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

483
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,224
If

484
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:46,624
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife isn't

485
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,720
Another

486
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,512
Technology talk to us

487
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,560
It is a creation of Sonic trap

488
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:57,632
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

489
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:01,216
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

490
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:03,264
To make them more human

491
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,104
Turn the living room lights on

492
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:08,896
Okay

493
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,944
Dim the living room lights to 50

494
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,712
80%

495
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:13,504
Okay

496
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:19,904
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

497
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,720
Makes for a much more natural experience

498
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,768
Turn the living room lights on

499
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:28,864
Dim the living room lights to 50%

500
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:36,288

Is impacting our health

503
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:41,664

Constipation abdominal pain and bloating

508
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:00,864
It's not that bad you take laxatives modify your diet and exercise routine but thinking about it all the time is frustrating.

509
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,728
Doesn't have to Define constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again

510
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:09,312

Black podcast

515
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:23,392
And now a preview of a new show in radiotopia

516
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:25,184
From the makers of criminal

517
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:27,744
Generally speaking a lie about

518
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:32,352
5100 eggs and these are laid in a in a

519
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,888
White silken sack

520
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,168
And

521
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,984
After the babies hatch

522
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,288
The mother

523
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:46,944
Just about immediately lays another set of eggs and and these are what are known as trophic eggs these are exit

524
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:52,064
They're never going to hatch and they will serve as food for the spiderlings

525
00:23:54,112 --> 00:24:00,256
This is doctor bill shut professor of biology at Long Island University

526
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,536
Associate in Residence

527
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:07,936
The American Museum of Natural History he's telling us about the black lace weaver spider

528
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:10,752
Spider is common in the United States

529
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:16,128
You've probably seen one before you probably have one somewhere in your yard right now

530
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,480
They're hard to describe because they look like a spider

531
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:27,392
Brownish black in color

532
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:30,720
Summon the spiderlings hatch

533
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:35,072
They are the immediately set about eating the the eggs

534
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:41,472
All the trophic eggs that their mother has late now spiders and a lot of other Arthur

535
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:47,872
Pods animals that have an outer covering that have their skeletons on the outside of their bodies like shrimp or Lobster

536
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:54,272
We're scorpions or insects it's the only way that they can grow in size

537
00:24:54,528 --> 00:25:00,672
Is to shed their outer that system is cuticle

538
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:04,512
So after their first molt that pretty much out of food

539
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:07,328
So they've gone through the

540
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:10,144
Trophic eggs that their mother has produced

541
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:12,704
And that's when they do something really

542
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,728
Kind of strange

543
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:20,128
The mother

544
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:26,528
Basically thrums on the web drawing a baby's to R

545
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:32,928
So it looks like she drums on the web it and and they are attracted to that vibration of the web

546
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:39,328
And they swarm all over her spiders are all about vibration

547
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:45,728
She basically does as she's plucking on her silk and attracting the youngster

548
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:52,128
First to come to her this is Doctor Linda Ray or

549
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:52,896

Cornell

551
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,200
Inter specialty

552
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:57,504
Is the social lives of spiders

553
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:00,576
They respond to the movements

554
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:02,624
And move in

555
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:08,000
Quarter as a group and start feeding and evidently they eat or within the hour

556
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:14,400
How does she get them to eat her do they just know this instincts really that

557
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:17,472
They noticed instinctually

558
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:23,872
What they do is it is basically inject this enzyme Laden

559
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:27,968
Got juice and.

560
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,272
And break down the inside of her body

561
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:34,880
It's almost like they slurp a rock through a straw

562
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,928
Like a protein milkshake

563
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:38,720
Eating her

564
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:40,256
Yeah eating her alive

565
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:42,560
And then they

566
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:44,864
They will hang out for

567
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:46,144
Another

568
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:51,264
Three four weeks together so there's a mass of these baby spiders and then they'll disperse from the web

569
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,056
Hot to become adults

570
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,128
It is

571
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:57,664
It is just natural

572
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,712
Yeah I would call it parental Behavior

573
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:02,528
That to a degree that we would consider to be extreme

574
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:05,856
They turn out to be just awesome Mother's

575
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:06,624
The ACT

576
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:12,000
Inducing the young to come to her and start

577
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:15,072
Feeding on her is absolutely intentional

578
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,864
She is inviting them

579
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,216
She's asking them to do this and this is her sacrifice for her youngsters

580
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:27,104
This happens every day These Quiet selfless Act

581
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,896
All around us

582
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,176
And we have no idea

583
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,480
We've been making Criminal

584
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,016
For more than three years

585
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,320
When we began

586
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:39,136
We set out to explore stories about crime

587
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,416
That went places

588
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:42,208
You might not have seen coming

589
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:45,536
We thought we try our hand

590
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:46,816
It's something new

591
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:48,096
A subject

592
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:50,144
Is enormous and varied

593
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,936
And arguably over

594
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,472
Posed as crying

595
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:56,544

600

Dealing with the inescapable nature of love

601
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:10,112
And how a simple Act of love

602
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:11,904
Isn't always pretty

603
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,928
Or Grande

604
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:14,976

605
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:17,536
