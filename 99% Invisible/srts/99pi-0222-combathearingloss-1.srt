I'm Roman Mars

33
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:33,696
The United States Marine Corps buys a lot of earplugs

34
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:36,256
Visit any military base and you'll find

35
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:38,304
Under the bleachers at the firing range

36
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,352
In the bottoms of washing machines

37
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:43,424
They are cheap and effective at making noise

38
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,704
Less noisy

39
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,032
Most ear plugs reduce Noise by about 30 decibels

40
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:54,688
That is Mary Roach author of a bunch of great books her latest one is called but it's about the science of humans at

41
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,992
30 decibels can be significant

42
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:00,064
Every three decibel increase in a loud noise

43
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,088
Cut in half

44
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,136
The amount of time you can be exposed

45
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:05,184
Without risking hearing damage

46
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:12,352
To put that another way in unprotected human ear can spend 8 hours a day exposed to 85 decibels

47
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,632
Without entering hearing loss

48
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,936
That's the level of freeway

49
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,312
85 decibels is also the level of a crowded restaurant

50
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:26,432
But if you go up to 115 decibels

51
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,712
Things like a chainsaw

52
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:34,368
Or a really loud concert

53
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:37,696
Your safe exposure time is only half a minute

54
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:39,232
Before your hearing can be affected

55
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,768
So without earplugs

56
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:44,608
You should only be exposed to the sound of a chainsaw for about 30 seconds

57
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,144
But with your plugs

58
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,192
You got closer to 8 hours

59
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:55,360
In a military situation or reduction of 30 decibels is especially helpful with a steady

60
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,896
Finding background in

61
00:02:57,408 --> 00:03:00,480
Like say a Bradley tank clattering over asphalt

62
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:03,040
Is it from of a Blackhawk helicopter

63
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:10,464
But there's a problem with ear plugs as the solution on a Battlefield

64
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,744
I will tell you that I

65
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,536
I've never seen a Marine

66
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,840
Where are closed in a combat

67
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,632
Operation

68
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,448
That's are in a 1/2

69
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:24,800
It's been 8 years as an infantry marine and served a tour of Duty in Fallujah Iraq

70
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,592
And this is Eric Fallon

71
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:27,616
Andover

72
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:30,688
24 years of military experience

73
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,808
I've never seen soldiers put a passive ear plug in and go on a dismounted

74
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:36,576
Control

75
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:41,952
Soldiers aren't using their ear plugs because when they do they can't hear what's happening around them

76
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:47,328
And with unprotected ears a lot of service members are coming home from Battle with tinnitus

77
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,376
Which is a ringing in your ears

78
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,400
Or hearing

79
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:54,240
It's not uncommon anyone especially in the Infantry

80
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,264
Will

81
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,568
Pretty much tell you that they have hearing loss

82
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:01,152
When Aaron and his buddies get together in social situations

83
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,200
Everyone speaks a little louder

84
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:06,784
You know when we get together everybody knows who has the worst

85
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,320
Amount of hearing loss

86
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,880
Are typically fits a good set of friends

87
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:12,672
We know what year are they

88
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:16,000
They tend to have hearing loss and I can tell you two or three

89
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:21,375
Trans right off top my head I know okay yeah he got hit by an IED on his right side

90
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,423
I need to speak to his left ear

91
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:27,519
Well Aaron's fellow Marines are naturally understanding about his hearing loss

92
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,823
His wife and kids find a challenging

93
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,895
They actually end up getting frustrated with me in it sell

94
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:34,687
China

95
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,711
Trying to play it off

96
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,783
Pretend like you heard what they had to say in

97
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,063
China

98
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,623
Picked it up later on in the conversation

99
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,159
Figure it out later

100
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,207
Or ask them as though you forgot

101
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,743
Jillian Ashley forget you

102
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,767
I just never heard them

103
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:53,887
When you really think about the Advent of black gunpowder which is really win

104
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:56,959
The military became an extremely noisy environment

105
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,263
Think about how long we've lived with that

106
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:03,615
I'm really without a solution the solution is to put something in your ears

107
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,151
The blocks the sound

108
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:08,991
And by the way it doesn't just bought the sound that we want to prevent it blogs

109
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:09,759
All the same

110
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:15,903
Since World War II the VA has been reporting on what kind of injuries they treat

111
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:21,791
And tinnitus and hearing loss have always been the number one and number two most prevalent injuries

112
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,559
Deserve as member

113
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:28,703
Eric Fallon has been studying how to protect the hearing of service members for a long time

114
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,727
He's an audiology

115
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,287
An audiologist is a medical

116
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:35,103
Professional that is concerned with the audit

117
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:35,871
Choice system

118
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:39,455
Eric used to be the chief audiologist at Walter Reed Medical Center

119
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:45,343
Some audiologist work with patients to give them hearing test and diagnose what kind of hearing disorder they have

120
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:48,415
But Eric's main focus is trying to find Solutions

121
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:52,255
The right protective solutions that not only protect their hearing but

122
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,047
Enhance their

123
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,327
Performance in some way

124
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,887
Eric now works for the company 3M

125
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:00,191
Designing hearing protection from military use

126
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:04,031
And he's fond of saying that the military has a noise problem but

127
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,311
We have a significant

128
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,335
Quiet problem

129
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:11,967
What do you mean to that service members in combat need ear protection that works for them in both environment

130
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,271
Because the transition from quiet

131
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,063
Napa Newberry

132
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:16,831
Very quickly

133
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:21,439
In a war zone you have to consider everything

134
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,999
Even just walking down the road has a strategy

135
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:24,767
Ctuit

136
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:29,887
The quote-unquote killing radius of a fragmentation grenade is 15 ft

137
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,935
If troops walked along in a clump like

138
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:32,703
Tourist

139
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,519
A single grenade kill a bunch of them at once

140
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:39,615
So they try to keep at least 15 feet between each other on Patrols

141
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:42,943
But the more spread out they are the harder it is to hear one another

142
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:47,039
Troops in combat might walk in the quiet for hours

143
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:49,087
The only two ways being is a little bit of

144
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:49,855
Chatting

145
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:52,415
The sound of gravel crunching under their boots

146
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,695
And then suddenly

147
00:06:54,207 --> 00:07:00,351
This is a video that Eric Fallon likes to show of troops on patrol in Iraq

148
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,911
These troops were just walking along

149
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,191
Avon

150
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,519
And then all of a sudden things got

151
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,543
Genetic very quickly

152
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,383
Are you okay

153
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,455
In the video when the truth comes Under Fire

154
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,479
All the soldiers

155
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,783
Boulder ground who can shoot it it's allowed

156
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:21,087
They probably aren't wearing hearing protection

157
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:25,439
But Eric says the pencil damage to their ears isn't the only boy

158
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,487
Their lives are in danger

159
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,023
And they're hearing

160
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,583
Turn on the main things helping them figure out what to do

161
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:35,935
Just because they're being shot at doesn't mean that they understand what's happening to

162
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,287
They may not know am I being shot at by 50 people or three

163
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:44,383
What's happening to the left of me what's happening to the right of me

164
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,991
One of the major tools to figure out what's happening in this situation is Radio

165
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:53,855
With a radio you can connect to someone who has more of a bird's-eye view of the place

166
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:56,159
This might be another Soldier somewhere on a roof

167
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,719
Or someone monitoring from a drone camera

168
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:05,631
Communication will help the person on the ground answer all the questions running through their head in that moment what do I do do I

169
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:06,911
Push through the assault

170
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,447
Do I hold in place

171
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,751
Do I wait for the quick reaction force

172
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,519
Succumb

173
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,799
And help us

174
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,103
How do I call in air support

175
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,407
But it's loud

176
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,991
They can probably barely hear what the other people around them are saying

177
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:25,087
I love butts on the radio and if I can't hear the signal

178
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:28,927
I may be missing the information that I need to make the right decision

179
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:34,559
And so you are seen that video there's a young Soldier laying on the ground communicating over the radio and

180
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,863
And just before the video stops

181
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,911
You'll hear him say

182
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,191
I can't hear you

183
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:51,967
A point that I try to make whenever I use that video is

184
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:55,039
That's probably one of the more important communication

185
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:59,135
That not only that person but his team members will ever have in their life

186
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:03,487
Because they're under direct enemy fire

187
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:07,583
Being able to hear the radio and each other is crucial to their survival

188
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:11,423
Eric believes that he has a solution to this problem

189
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:16,287
He thinks that service members on dismounted combat controls like the one in that video

190
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,847
Should be wearing a device called TCAP

191
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:22,943
Soe tactical communication and protective systems or TCAP

192
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:26,783
I'm all products that are designed to not only deliver hearing for

193
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,551
Protection

194
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:33,951
But to allow you a better ability to hear what's happening around you so you can maintain situational awareness

195
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,999
Tea cups come in a couple of styles

196
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:39,583
One style fits inside your ear kind of like a pair of earbuds

197
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,887
Any other style fits over here

198
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,727
And they look like that your love seem like we're while operating power tools

199
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:52,383
Both styles are equipped with environmental microphones that pick up the sounds around you and feed them into your

200
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,455
Careers at levels that your eardrums can tolerate

201
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:57,247
And in some cases these products

202
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:02,623
Integrated into a radio system so that you can have more seamless

203
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,391
Two way radio

204
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:10,047
With the radio feature you could be talking with a drone operator or communicating with a command center

205
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:12,351
And you can actually hear what they're saying to you

206
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:15,167
Because the device is blocking out other noise

207
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,191
And yes

208
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:19,263
3M the company Eric works for cells tcaps

209
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:25,151
But he's also an audiologist who's dedicated his career to protecting the hearing of people in the military

210
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:28,479
Eric sent as a few of the over-the-ear style tcaps

211
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,015
Headsets to dry out

212
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,295
Powerball

213
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:36,415
Each pair have a power button that allows you to

214
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,207
You toggle between a few settings

215
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:48,191
99 Pi producers

216
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:53,567
Katie mingle and Sam Greenspan tested out the tcaps in front of our office where there's been a bunch of loud

217
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,103
Destruction happening all week

218
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,407
Nkt recorded what the world sounds

219
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,687
Through her teeth

220
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:11,743
So in this clip Katie and Sam are standing on the sidewalk

221
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,767
Rock wearing tcaps

222
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,047
Looking like a

223
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,071
A couple of weirdos

224
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:16,863
People are walking path

225
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:19,167
How to spell construction worker is sweeping

226
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,495
And despite the fact that they're wearing big padded earmuffs

227
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:24,031
I can hear it all really well

228
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:30,687
Because the environment of microphones are picking up the noise around them

229
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,223
Feeding into their ears

230
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:42,207
That's am talking to Katy using the radio feature on the tcaps

231
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:49,375
Mail someone has started to saw through the concrete nearby but the tcaps are attenuating the sound

232
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,423
So that Sam and Katie

233
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,191
Still here at

234
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,239
It's a much lower volume

235
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,031
But if they take the keycaps off

236
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:09,855
I won't make it within that very long but basically the tcaps allowed Katie and Sam to communicate

237
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:12,415
Through some very loud construction noises

238
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,207
While also protecting their ears

239
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:17,535
And when it was quiet they were able to hear the environment around them

240
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,559
Soft sounds

241
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,327
Like sweeping

242
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,351
And people talking

243
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:24,959
Teacups are also being marketed for use in industrial and construction settings

244
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:28,031
Just like the one Katie and Sam were standing in the middle of

245
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,311
In the military

246
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:34,687
They've been used since the early 2000 mostly by Special Operations groups like Navy Seals

247
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,479
But they're not standard issue

248
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:41,087
Even for troops in combat who would be exposed to the kind of noise that can damage your hearing

249
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,879
The conventional forces

250
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:48,511
Do what I think that conventional forces of done for many many years they just did

251
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,071
Except that communicating is going to be a challenge

252
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,143
Communication challenges and hearing loss

253
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,703
So much a part of the culture of combat

254
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,495
The Earth says when he was a soldier

255
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,287
He actually wanted hearing loss

256
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:02,591
So the people would know he had experience

257
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:07,199
So if you didn't have a degree of hearing loss it was obvious that you were one of the new guys

258
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:13,855
I meant that you had not really been around much noise and you really have not fired that many artillery

259
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,879
Rounds down range

260
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:21,279
Well soldiers are actively serving they do have to undergo fairly comprehensive hearing test

261
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,559
Send periodic check out

262
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:25,375
These tests are administered by an audiologist

263
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:31,263
But the results of those tests get passed onto the unit commander and he or she decides what to do with them

264
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:34,335
And a soldier who is found to have degraded hearing

265
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,895
Often won't be taken out of their position

266
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:40,223
We're just so accustomed to finding work around

267
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:40,991
With hearing loss

268
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,807
You will sometimes fine soldiers that have a c

269
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,599
Significant degree of hearing loss

270
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:49,695
But their unit leadership may be so dependent on that

271
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,463
A person

272
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:52,767
But they also want that person to

273
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,559
I remain where they are

274
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:59,167
I look forward to the day when we put as much info

275
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,727
Tips on maintaining good hearing

276
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,519
As we do good vision

277
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:08,127
Eric has found that in order to get the military interested in protecting people's hearing

278
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,943
He's had to sell it differently when I was a young golfer

279
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:17,343
When I would go out and do a unit briefing I would actually talk to them about how much money the VA spends on here

280
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,159
Because I thought that was pretty

281
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,207
But I didn't really work

282
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:26,815
It's not a unit commanders job to be concerned of what the VA spends on hearing loss

283
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:31,423
Eric talked to unit commanders he had to make the argument Tactical

284
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:36,031
He had to explain it when people can hear they can be more effective on the battlefield

285
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:40,127
This points to unlock a disconnect between the Department of Defense

286
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,175
Defending the nation

287
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,455
And the VA

288
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,479
Which provides Healthcare

289
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,247
The veterans

290
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,551
If the dod is given the choice

291
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,343
Between spending the money on bonds

292
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:50,879
Hearing protection

293
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,695
It's not hard to see why they might use

294
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,719
Kick the Can

295
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,487
The VA

296
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:57,791
But to defend the Department of Defense

297
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:01,375
They have made an effort in the last couple of decades to do better

298
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:03,423
There's more testing than there used to be

299
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,239
And in 2009 they established the hearing center of x

300
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,287
Which research has hearing loss

301
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,335
And advocates for more protection

302
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:14,431
This invisible Hendry of hearing loss is very significant

303
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,735
Big part of our job is to advocate

304
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:17,759
And build awareness

305
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,295
That's Colonel Mark packer

306
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,599
Is the director of the hearing center of excellence

307
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,903
He says yeah Teacups are great

308
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,183
But they're not perfect

309
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:27,487
All hearing protection has

310
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,023
Some foul ability

311
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:34,143
If you're out on a hot mission in the deserts and you have those earmuffs down over your ears

312
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,191
They are hot

313
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,983
Soldiers might remove them

314
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:40,031
And then be unprotected when they need it

315
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:46,175
Other arguments against tcaps they are this extra thing to carry and have to be charged and if they break their expensive

316
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:46,943
Sed to replace

317
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:51,039
Not everybody needs just $1,500 tactical radio device

318
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,087
There are some solutions

319
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,903
In between tcaps and the cheapest foam ear plugs

320
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:58,207
There's what's called level dependent ear plugs

321
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:01,791
Remain to protect against High impulse noises like weapons fire

322
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:04,351
While allowing other environmental noises to pass through

323
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:09,727
But Eric and others we spoke to said that these earplugs still make it difficult to hear the environment around you

324
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:13,055
For that reason a lot of people will often not to wear them

325
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:20,223
Liberty caps are the solution for all combat troops or not it's worth saying that Colonel Packer and Eric Fallon there

326
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:24,575
And they're both working sometimes together

327
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:29,183
Define dissolution to one of the oldest most prevalent and most invisible problem

328
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:45,311
99percentinvisible was reported this week by Mary Roach and produced by Katie mingle with Delaney Hall Sharif Youssef

329
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:50,175
Fitzgerald Kolstad same Greenspan Avery truffelman and me Roman Mars

330
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:55,039
This episode was based off of chapter of Mary Roach has excellent best-selling book

331
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:57,855
Grunt the Curious science of humans at War

332
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,647
I cannot recommend her book

333
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,415
Enough

334
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:04,255
They are the best time you can have learning weird things about science

335
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:08,351
We are project on 91.7 kalw San Francisco and produce

336
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,631
On radio row

337
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,399
And beautiful

338
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,423
Downtown

339
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,703
Oakland California

340
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,031
Between the beats

341
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,335
Bongs and chatter of our devices

342
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,103
We're immersed

343
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,919
In a cluttered World a man-made sound

344
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:22,943
If

345
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:29,343
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife isn't

346
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,207
Technology

347
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:34,975
Talk to us

348
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,279
It is a creation of Sonic trash

349
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,351
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

350
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:43,935
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

351
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,727
To make them more human

352
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,823
Turn the living room lights on

353
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:51,615
Okay

354
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,151
Dim the living room lights

355
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,175
50%

356
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:55,967
Okay

357
00:17:56,735 --> 00:18:02,367
