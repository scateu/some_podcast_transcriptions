20
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:26,528
The picture of

21
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:32,160
Pneumatic

22
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,768
Pneumatic pneumatic

23
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,048
Of course

24
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,584
Are gases

25
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,424
Donnie

26
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:48,800
In the wall where the tubes go

27
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:51,360
Away

28
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,664
They never come back

29
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,968
Does it work

30
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,040
Will never know

31
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:05,440
Vacuum

32
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:18,496
In the world before telephone and email the task of transmitting information

33
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:21,312
And moving material objects was essentially

34
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,592
The same challenge

35
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:28,992
The way you send someone a message with pretty much the same process as sending someone a package you had to send a piece of physical media

36
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,784
Lea to the post or on the ship

37
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,856
It was the telegraph that divided telling someone something

38
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,952
Remember every day people didn't speak Morse

39
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,280
So the message had to be deciphered written on a slip of paper

40
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,328
And that it was delivered to the recipient

41
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:55,872
Even though you can probably guess already that electronic communication eventually killed most of the need for pneumatic tubes

42
00:02:56,128 --> 00:03:01,248
You may not know that it was the telegraph itself that also put pneumatic tubes into widespread use

43
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:02,784
As Telegram

44
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,552
Blew up

00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,832
Amanda cost drop

46
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:09,440
Did the volume Rose it became very difficult to quickly deliver them to their destinations

47
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,720
And so

48
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:15,584
But they needed to do was come up with another way to get messages across the city quickly

49
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:20,960
So if you can't send something with that newfangled electricity stuff you have to figure out a way to do it all

50
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,264
Sending a message as a physical object

51
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,800
The Last Mile problem

52
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,336
Getting to an end

53
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,640
Customer or an end recipient

54
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,432
Can be the more difficult

55
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,200
Call problem

56
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:34,784
And it came up with the post pneumatique or the pneumatic post

57
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,320
Doing that

58
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,624
That is Molly Wright steenson

59
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,744
Researcher PC student and aficionado of all things pneumatic tube

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,584
Pneumatic tubes are systems of subterranean

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,352
Bourbon

62
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:51,936
Postal services that delivered messages underneath

63
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:52,704
Cities

64
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,520
All across the world in major Financial Centers

65
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:58,080
Those were the large-scale implementation

66
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,640
Splitter on the right number of smaller pneumatic tubes

67
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:05,504
More familiar to people today are producer Sam Greenspan spoke with Molly through a difference

68
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:11,904
I had similar experiences with pneumatic tubes growing up

69
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,696
When I was a kid

70
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:15,488
Used to go to the bank

71
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,256
Down the street

72
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:22,143
And to the bank with my Dad we go to the drive-thru and he put his deposit slip or whatever inside the

73
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,423
Plastic canister

74
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:27,519
My mom would enroll her window and she gets a canister

75
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:30,591
From this big are making device

76
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:35,711
And she put in whatever checks she wanted to deposit and then I would see it shoot up

77
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:36,735
Clear tube

78
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:40,319
Through this clear tube and it would shoot across to the bank

79
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,623
And then the ladies in the bank

80
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,391
Candy Girl

81
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:49,535
Lollipops for me and my brothers and dog biscuits for the dog

82
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:54,911
And it just seemed

83
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:59,007
And they also hearken back to another era

84
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:02,591
You may only know about pneumatic tubes in the context of a Bank drive-thru

85
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:08,223
When they were invented they really set the stage for what communication would look like over the next century

86
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:11,039
Pneumatic post first started in London

87
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:11,807
In 18th

88
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,111
3 but the technology transfer

89
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,903
Very quickly to other cities

90
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:16,927
Tiananmen

91
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:21,535
Say Munich Milan Lynn Lewis

92
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,815
Australia

93
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,095
Pneumatic post

94
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,631
In every major

95
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,423
On every

96
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:29,727
Antarctica

97
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,519
Antarctica is always slacking

98
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,055
But know where we're pneumatic

99
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,335
Choose more expensive in

100
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,407
19th century

101
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,967
Totally redone paris's Urban layout

102
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:40,991
Putting in those big

103
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,015
Boulevard

104
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,295
Circular Plaza

105
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,087
He also put in sewers

106
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:48,415
So not only did the sewer carry potable water

107
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,439
And eventually

108
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,231
Electrical cables butt

109
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:51,999
It carried

110
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:52,767
Pneumatic tube

111
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,327
Annies tubes inside of tubes

112
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,095
Square head

113
00:05:56,351 --> 00:06:00,703
My 1919 Paris was processing 12 million pieces of pneumatic post a year

114
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:02,495
Mai 1945

115
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:07,103
They were 450 km of pneumatic tubing lining Paris is underground

116
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:11,967
Making it possible to get a handwritten note across Paris in less than 2 hours

117
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,759
Without even breaking a sweat

118
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:14,783
Here's how it works

119
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,575
You write something on some special

120
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:19,135
Stationery closet

121
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:19,903
Postage

122
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,439
And you get at your local two piece

123
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,463
That's what you

124
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:25,791
Call one of the people who sends pneumatic post

125
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:26,815
The envelope in a can

126
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,607
And let me tell you about the

127
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,399
Happy birthday gif

128
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:34,239
But over time they became more aerodynamic

129
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,031
Begin to resemble Little Rock

130
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:37,567
Anyway

131
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:41,407
The to beat Rings an electric Bell to alert the two beasts on the receiving end

132
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:44,223
There's an incoming canister and then

133
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,551
It's hurtling through paris's underbelly so fast

134
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:50,111
The descending to Beast that actually hear that

135
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,391
The canister arriving

136
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,439
Destination the description

137
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,743
From the 19th century

138
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,279
Talk about the shop

139
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,303
The noise of the shocker

140
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,839
Pneumatic post arriving

141
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,863
The only

142
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,399
Provide enough for switch

143
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,167
Beastie

144
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,959
And so they were checking antics

145
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,983
Steam engines

146
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:09,567
Underneath the hotel de post which was the central post office

147
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,335
Westin Paris

148
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,127
And they would produce the

149
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:14,175
Compressed and rarefied Air

150
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:17,247
That would serve to push or pull

151
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,111
Pneumatic tubes through all of the kilometers in miles and miles of two

152
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,135
That we're underneath

153
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:23,903
The streets

154
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,695
They're also even buildings

155
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,999
Simply existed 2

156
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,791
Produce are for the tube

157
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:30,815
Services

158
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:36,447
The biggest pneumatic tube systems had problems that required some creative troubleshooting

159
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,471
Paris Hutton

160
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:38,751
Twisting mechanism

161
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,287
In case there was a blockage

162
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,311
Did someone win

163
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,335
Fire a gun

164
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,871
Into the tube

165
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,151
And then measured

166
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:45,919
Soundwave

167
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:48,479
And be able to figure out to Within

168
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:52,063
I guess two metres or so where the blockage was

169
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,087
And then

170
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,623
They would be able to go under

171
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,391
Ground and

172
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,183
Undo the flan

173
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:57,951
French and

174
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,231
Bring out the offender

175
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,255
Canister

176
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,303
I guess it's better than what happened in

177
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:05,375
In Berlin where they just poured copious amounts of wine

178
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,935
Into the tubes in order to unfreeze

179
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,471
Stop canisters

180
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:12,799
As exciting as all this sound electric communication evolve

181
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:17,151
You're up other Technologies like telephone and tell facts and proved that way cheaper

182
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:19,199
And so off The Last Mile problem

183
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:23,039
It was another form of physical transport that put the nail in the coffin

184
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:26,623
The thing that put them out of business in the United States was

185
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,903
The invention of the truck

186
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:28,927
The truck was in bed

187
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:31,743
Dentist in 1912 and and that's kind of what

188
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:32,511
What did it

189
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:36,607
Trucks are fine and all but they just don't capture the imagination like a massive

190
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,143
Pneumatic tube Network

191
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,703
As silly as such a thing might seem today

192
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:46,335
Moline I spent a good deal of time trying to figure out what exactly it is about the tubes that leads

193
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,103
Be fascinated

194
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,151
Mysterious about

195
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:49,919
Why you mad

196
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,943
Tubes are magic

197
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:53,247
I think the Inspire Wonder

198
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,015
Because

199
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,551
They're alive

200
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:58,111
Or it feels like there alive there

201
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:01,695
Reaching out through the city they have tendrils and 10th

202
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,999
And they breathe

203
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,071
And they feel

204
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:07,839
Much much

205
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,375
Bigger than we are

206
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,471
Inspire Wonder because

207
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,495
They manifest

208
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:15,775
Medication

209
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,311
4S

210
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:23,199
Today when we think of communication all the ones and zeros and digital things that we move

211
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:25,247
Don't feel real tangible

212
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,527
To us anymore

213
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,295
But I also

214
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,599
They felt pretty magical 2

215
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,367
Two people

216
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,927
Back then to that they were

217
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:35,231
Kind of electrical and breathing connections

218
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,255
Communication

219
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,303
You could send to handkerchief

220
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,351
And send it to your lover by a Pneumatic

221
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,655
And it would still smell like you

222
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,959
So I mean

223
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:47,519
We're romantic as well and I think

224
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,567
Weather today to

225
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:54,687
So in a sense they're both alive and mechanical both high and low Tech

226
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:58,783
And there's also something to be said about the Journey of a tube canister

227
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:02,623
That you can imagine it's making its way through these Underground

228
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,391
Passageways

229
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,671
Carrying your message

230
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:10,559
And so this idea of being able to go somewhere where you wouldn't otherwise be able to go is

231
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,327
It's amazing

232
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,655
Message this made that entire underworld Journey

233
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,215
In order to surface in the hand sub

234
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,239
Recipient

235
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,031
More than their widespread use

236
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:24,383
What might be the most surprising thing about pneumatic tube systems is how long they

237
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,151
Stayed in you

238
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:28,223
The post pneumatic operated in Paris

239
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,503
Until as late as 9

240
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:30,783
Before

241
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,367
Even ran over the Brooklyn Bridge until 1953

242
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:36,927
And took a force of nature knock them out of Prague

243
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:39,743
The city was using them until a flood in 2002

244
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,303
Lots of places

245
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,071
Still use

246
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,119
Hospitals

247
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,655
Used pneumatic tube system

248
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:47,935
And that's what

249
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:48,959
Cuz you really can't

250
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,775
Digitize tissue or medication

251
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:57,407
And so the next time you find yourself in a hospital take a look because you'll find them by the nurses station

252
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,175
Munson in the emerging

253
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:58,943
Chelsea room

254
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:05,343
They're also used it places at grocery stores or big electronics stores usually that kind of delivery

255
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,159
Pneumatic tube so that

256
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,183
It's not any

257
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,975
Where where the store could get robbed

258
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:14,303
When Molly was doing research on tubes at the New York City Public Library

259
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,863
She found her requests were being dispatched

260
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,143
Buying a Matic 2

261
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:22,239
But there's one other tube system in New York that moves a lot Mormon

262
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:25,311
In Roosevelt Island pneumatic tubes are used

263
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,103
Four for garbage

264
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:31,711
Roosevelt Island if you don't know is a small island in East River between

265
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,247
In Queens New York

266
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:36,831
And as it happens my good friend Hannah Jamal grew up there

267
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:43,487
Hey how's it going nice to hear from you so I asked her about the pneumatic tubes

268
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:46,559
I get flustered when people ask me about the garbage

269
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,351
Because to me

270
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:51,167
How you take out your trash

271
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,471
The most fascinating thing about it

272
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:59,871
Yes I am sure that there are thousands of fascinating facts about Roosevelt Island but let's hear about those garbage tubes

273
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:03,455
Aaron is only about three miles long and about 800 ft

274
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:09,855
Wide and when the other was being developed for residential living in the 1960s planners determine that the quality of life would be

275
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,647
Better without big garbage

276
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,927
Trucks on the road

277
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,999
So instead

278
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,535
The dispatch with their trash

279
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,559
With a pneumatic tube Network

280
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,351
And I have one friend and put

281
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,655
Particularities my friend David and

282
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,703
He can tell you more about how it works

283
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,775
Brooklyn-based producer moods ad

284
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,823
Hey to go meet Hannah's friend

285
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,103
I haven't got a mood

286
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,943
Guy named David Finkelstein

287
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:37,247
Stanley and I live in Roseville.

288
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:40,063
Tell me when you want start time out the trash.

289
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,111
There's not much to say about it

290
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:48,767
The beginning of the processes I guess the same as what most people deal with

291
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,631
Just like they have the trash to take your trash bags and then take out

292
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:55,679
Tie it up

293
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,215
Man we got fat here coming

294
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,079
Florida

295
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:02,847
Urumqi

296
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,127
Rack Room

297
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,919
And my whole life

298
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,455
If it's the same thing and at least all the

299
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,223
The original buildings

300
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,271
The newer buildings

301
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,343
Floor has a

302
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,135
Ours is Right neck

303
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:15,903
The stairwell

304
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,207
You open it up

305
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:19,999
And it's not a lot in it

306
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,559
Tiny little

307
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,607
I'll get like space and there's

308
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:27,935
A place for recycle

309
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,471
Recyclables

310
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,287
Cute

311
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,847
Handle that you pull and you

312
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:38,687
Open the door and throw your garbage down the champion and

313
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,223
And that's it

314
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:46,111
To be honest like it wasn't until after I left Roosevelt Island that I realized

315
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,159
Other people don't have a vacuum

316
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,183
That's not

317
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:51,743
I remember

318
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,023
Precisely when I learned about it

319
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,559
I think it might have been awake

320
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:57,887
Pediatric I like double check that I knew it pneumatic man

321
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,215
Amazing

322
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,055
Well my dad

323
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:10,431
In fairness the tubes might have made a bigger impression if Hannah and David had the

324
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,455
But there

325
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,991
Trash bag in a rocket ship

326
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,295
Canister and fired across the island

327
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:18,111
But there's still something about a visit to Roosevelt Island

328
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,647
Makes you feel like

329
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:23,487
You're on the cusp of the future even though you're clearly not

330
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,815
A payment when can I try Siri

331
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:30,655
Okay if you think about all the technology we were promised the Future Would

332
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,703
Hold from something like Star Trek

333
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:38,335
A lot of his come true right like we have little touchscreen computers we have hand communicator

334
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:42,943
What are things that we don't have and will probably never have is

335
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:43,967
The Transporter

336
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:46,527
You know the thing that can disassemble something somewhere

337
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,575
And reassemble it somewhere else

338
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:53,183
And I wonder if that has to do with why the tubes feel both so ancient

339
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:55,231
And so futuristic at the same time

340
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:58,303
Like it's the closest we ever got to transmitting a

341
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,351
Physical object instantaneously

342
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:06,751
I think that's definitely possible that you could get something instantly

343
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,591
It's again that you could communicate

344
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:13,151
But you said that you could not only get it

345
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:13,919
But but

346
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,199
You could have that feeling

347
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:20,831
Sensation or that information right away it's the Nexus of those two things

348
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,671
What is more than just information

349
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,719
The scented handkerchief that are rhymes

350
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:30,559
After traveling through miles of Paris underground or even

351
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:33,375
The dog biscuit from the bank teller these

352
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:36,703
Are romantic because they have physical intimacy

353
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:41,055
I mean maybe that's why we keep coming back to it and maybe that's why

354
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:41,823
Steampunk

355
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,847
Seems important

356
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:45,151
In a digital age

357
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:48,991
Actually we do need physical things and

358
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:51,551
You know we've we never did get our check

359
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:58,719
But we we do care all the more about things that are real and tangible that come to us and I think with

360
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:00,767
The pneumatic post represents

361
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,071
What pneumatic tubes represent

362
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,399
Is the possibility that that could happen

363
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:21,759
99percentinvisible was produced this week by Sam Greenspan and me Roman Mars with help from moods a day

364
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:28,415
It's a project of kalw 91.7 local public radio in San Francisco in the American is sumac

365
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:38,143
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices

366
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,727
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man made sound

367
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:42,751
If

368
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:49,151
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife isn't

369
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:53,247
Call hearing.

370
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,039
Technology talk to us

371
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:57,087
