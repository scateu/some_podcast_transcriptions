00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:34,208
Scottish scientist

34
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:35,744
Started a club 2 address

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,072
What they considered to be humankind's greatest problem

36
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,608
Things like pollution

37
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:41,888
Resource scarcity

38
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,680
Andover population

39
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:50,080
And because this group met in Rome Italy it came to be known as the club of Rome

40
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:54,688
Over the next couple of years the club of Rome would grow to include politicians

41
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,712
Scientist

42
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:58,784
Economist and Business Leaders from around the world

43
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:04,416
It was a pretty Elite group I've always pictured a lot of leather furniture and cigar smoking

44
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:07,232
I don't know how much cigar-smoking there was

45
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:09,280
I mean it was certainly Clubby

46
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:14,912
That's Patrick McRae he's a professor of history at the University of California Santa Barbara

47
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,704
I think there's a tendency to

48
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,544
Imagine them as sort of this cigar-smoking cabal

49
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:26,176
Yessir pulling the strings behind the scenes but I think there is a genuine interest on their part

50
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:26,944
2

51
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,480
I'm address these

52
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,760
Problems of the world

53
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:32,320
The people who were a part of the club of Rome

54
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:37,440
Basically wanted to figure out if and when the world was going to hit maximum capacity

55
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,464
And one out of resource

56
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,512
And toward this end

57
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:41,536
They had a tool

58
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,072
A relatively new tool

59
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:43,840
What's the time

60
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:44,864
The computer

61
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:51,008
And so they plugged a bunch of data into their huge 1970s computers

62
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:55,104
And then looked at the results and switched up the variables

63
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,896
Ran the test again

64
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,200
No matter how they played with

65
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,736
The variables

66
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,272
Switch for a resource use

67
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,552
Pollution

68
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,344
Industrialization

69
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,112
Population

70
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,392
Gross things like that

71
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,184
All of the models

72
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,208
What they came up with

73
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:13,792
All of them should have led to the same conclusion

74
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:16,864
Sometime in the 21st century there would be

75
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,888
This massive collapse

76
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:18,656
Maps of globe

77
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:19,424
Will Society

78
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:25,056
In 1972 the club of Rome published a book outlining their findings

79
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:25,824
Called

80
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,104
The limits to growth

81
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,920
And it got a lot of media attention

82
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:36,576
They found the way things are going now the planet can support us for less than 100 years

83
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,112
It maybe never 50

84
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:42,208
The book became a surprise bestseller and was translated into more than

85
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,744
Two dozen languages

86
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:47,584
And yeah there were critics who disagreed with the findings

87
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,936
But overall the limits to growth was incredibly influential

88
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:52,704
You know there was a

89
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:55,264
Famous cover of Newsweek around 9

90
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,032
70

91
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:56,800
3

92
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:02,688
That your shows Uncle Sam on the cover looking into a cornucopia and there's nothing in it and the headline

93
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:05,248
On the cover of Newsweek says running out of everything

94
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:08,320
You can see the idea of limits

95
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:10,112
All over popular culture

96
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:11,904
New York City

97
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,208
In the year 2022

98
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,024
Nothing runs anymore

99
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,815
Nothing works

100
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,119
The famous or inFAMOUS movie with

101
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,143
Charlton Heston

102
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,423
Soylent Green

103
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,215
Give me the whole premise of the movie is

104
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,495
It's based on

105
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:27,775
A scenario where they

106
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,311
Overpopulation

107
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,103
And the Earth is

108
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,895
Xeos exceeded its carrying capacity

109
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,175
Pasadena

110
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:37,247
Hard to say and the people will do anything

111
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:43,647
To get what they need what they need most is Soylent Green

112
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:46,463
Exhaust

113
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,351
But I think there was a

114
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,887
Really Fierce debate

115
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:56,447
That the limits to growth report stimulated

116
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,031
About whether there was this need to curtail economic

117
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:00,799
Growth

118
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,591
Regulate populations

119
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:05,663
And perhaps even curtail individual freedoms

120
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:11,039
And out of this chorus of debate an alarm

121
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:15,391
Emerges a physicist and engineer named Gerard O'Neill

122
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,951
He was mostly known as Jerry

123
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:22,815
Andrea Neal says yeah we may live on a limited planet

124
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:25,119
But we live in a limitless

125
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:25,887
Universe

126
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:31,775
And the answer to a lot of our problems here on Earth may actually be out in space

127
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:35,103
In what O'Neal called The High Frontier

128
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:39,199
Here's Jerry O'Neil in an archival recording from the 70s

129
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,503
Opening the High Frontier

130
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,271
Means

131
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:44,575
Making possible and ensuring

132
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,623
The survival of the human race

133
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,439
Jerry O'Neill wanted to build settlements

134
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,207
In space

135
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:52,767
If you truly love this planet

136
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,607
The best thing you can do for it is to move as much industry and as many p

137
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,631
People as possible

138
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,423
From its surface out in the

139
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:05,055
The space O'Neal was motivated and really saw his ideas as a form of environmentalism

140
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:10,431
Jerry O'Neil wasn't the first person to imagine human habitats in

141
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:15,039
But unlike others who had come before him O'Neill was the first

142
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:19,391
Punjab and numbers and come up with technologically feasible design

143
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,719
Over the course of his work he would turn Skeptics into

144
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,743
The true believers

145
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,279
Fun support from NASA

146
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:29,375
And start a social movement toward the goal of building human colonies

147
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,143
In space

148
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:34,751
Before he started thinking about

149
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:35,519
Space colony

150
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:38,591
Jerry O'Neill was a professor in Princeton physics

151
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:41,407
But he wasn't content analyzing data

152
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,943
He like building things

153
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:45,247
O'Neill's contribution to physics

154
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,015
Was

155
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:49,343
Re-engineering the way in which particle accelerators work

156
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,367
Designed and built

157
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,415
And he was really really successful at this

158
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:55,743
He was very famous already as a physicist

159
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,815
Long before he got interested in space colonies

160
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:02,911
So he was very much respected among his equals

161
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:03,935
And a

162
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:06,495
So if a person of Great Character

163
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,799
I always got along very well with him

164
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:11,359
That's Freeman Dyson

165
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:16,991
Freeman Dyson I'm a retired professor at The Institute for advanced study in Princeton

166
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,271
My subject

167
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,063
What is mathematics and physics

168
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,647
I was just a pencil Pusher Distributing equations

169
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,439
Dyson is being modest

170
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,975
She was an is a

171
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,279
Polymath in a veritable genius

172
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,863
He's made huge contributions in quantum mechanics

173
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,935
But also in nuclear energy biology

174
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,959
Astrophysics

175
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:41,311
And he's got pop-culture cred to there's a video game character

176
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,591
You're named after him

177
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:45,919
There's even a Star Trek episode about one of his Concepts

178
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:49,503
Titan was also a friend and colleague to Jerry O'Neill

179
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,551
O'Neal died in 1992

180
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:54,367
How many students were always

181
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,159
Following him around

182
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,695
He actually

183
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,975
Russian students

184
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,511
Doing real projects

185
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,303
It wasn't just talk

186
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:06,911
In 1969 the same year the first astronauts walked on the moon

187
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:11,775
O'Neill posed a question to his introductory physics students at Princeton

188
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,823
What makes more sense

189
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:17,151
Building human settlements on the surface of another planet

190
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,711
Rebuilding free-floating settlement

191
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,991
In outer space

192
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:27,391
3 months of research and calculations O'Neal and his students came to the conclusion that building free floating habitat

193
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,671
Was the way to go

194
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:35,071
First of all you don't have to overcome gravity every time you go on and off of free-floating space settlement

195
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:41,727
But even more importantly in space you have access to the sun's energy 100% of the time

196
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,031
So no other sources

197
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,823
The fuel would be needed

198
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:50,687
But when the semester ended O'Neill didn't stop thinking about space colonization

199
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:51,711
In fact

200
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,759
He'd only just begun

201
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,295
Goodwill Sumter

202
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,855
Dreams of samurai the remote future

203
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,671
It was something O'Neal really salty should do

204
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:09,887
O'Neill decided he would build his settlements at a place in our solar system 250,000 miles from

205
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,167
Called

206
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:13,727
LaGrange LaGrange point

207
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,799
LaGrange points places in

208
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:17,567
Space

209
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,591
Will object

210
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,359
Stay put

211
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,663
They don't move around on August

212
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,199
And so these are the most

213
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:26,271
Convenient places if you want to have a fixed habitat

214
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:30,111
Object stay put because at LaGrange point five or L5

215
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:34,207
The gravity of the Sun and Earth are a special equilibrium

216
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,743
L5

217
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,279
What's his favorite

218
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,071
Electronics point

219
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,095
Play switches

220
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,911
Same distance from the Moon and the Earth

221
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:48,543
Oliver nails designs for habitats were variations on cylinders spheres or rings

222
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,335
And it designs have been copied

223
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,103
All

224
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,383
Uber science fiction

225
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:55,711
You can see O'Neal ask designs in the movie Elysium

226
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,735
Interstellar

227
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:59,295
The design that I find the easiest

228
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:01,087
Picture basically looks like

229
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:03,903
Giant bicycle wheel floating in space

230
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:07,231
The people would live inside the tire

231
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:08,255
Part of the wheel

232
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:10,559
Which itself would be enormous

233
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,351
There would be a huge windows

234
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,887
What's that let in sunlight

235
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:16,959
And allowed amazing views of outer space

236
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:22,079
The artist renderings of O'Neill settlements make them look really earth like

237
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,103
Unappealing

238
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,127
Water

239
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,151
Treason

240
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,431
Terraced housing

241
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,759
He imagined that thing would would be like

242
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:34,623
An Italian Hilltown we we knew that the first ones wouldn't look like

243
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,415
Anything like that

244
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,463
That's Tasha O'Neal

245
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:43,839
In 1969 Tasha had just moved to the US from Germany to work as an au pair

246
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:47,423
When she decided to attend a mixer the YMCA

247
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:51,007
In what Jerry O'Neill with his mop top haircut

248
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:55,103
Looking more like a member of the 60s rock band than a physicist

249
00:10:55,359 --> 00:11:00,735
I looked at him and I thought that's the first interesting guy that I see around here

250
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:04,063
I wouldn't say it was love at first sight but it was definitely

251
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:04,831
Interest

252
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,367
At first sight words

253
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,159
Gulou into love very quickly

254
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:14,047
When he and Tasha met O'Neal have just started seriously thinking about space colonies

255
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:16,607
And he was eager to share his ideas

256
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:19,167
I thought it was really ironic

257
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,447
That I would

258
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:22,495
Meet and marry a physicist

259
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:25,055
My physics was non-existent

260
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:25,823
I fight

261
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,847
Flunked it

262
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,127
But he was

263
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:31,711
So good at explaining things to lay people

264
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,527
And Tasha also got good attic

265
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,807
Explaining his ideas

266
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:41,183
Explain to me for example that the wheel in which people with live with rotate

267
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:43,487
Very slowly on an access

268
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:46,303
And the centrifugal force of that rotation

269
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,143
Who created gravity like sensation for the people inside

270
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,167
To keep them from

271
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,447
Floating around

272
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:55,519
The rotating would have been very slow

273
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,311
And you would not have noticed it

274
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,175
But the closer you were to the Axis or the center of the wheel

275
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,735
The less gravity you experience

276
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,295
When when you went uphill

277
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,831
You got lighter

278
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:09,855
And lighter

279
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:12,671
And you started skipping like a mountain goat

280
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,695
It always say that

281
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:17,279
Jerry O'Neil imagine the first structure can house

282
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:20,351
10000 people and subsequent structures could house

283
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,375
3 million

284
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,679
I hope that eventually these settlements

285
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,983
Could unburden the Earth of a significant

286
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:26,751
Population

287
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,311
Anne O'Neill also thought his settlements

288
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:34,175
Could provide Earth with a source of energy by collecting the sun's energy in space

289
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:40,063
Where it's in abundance all the time and sending it back to Earth via radio waves

290
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:43,135
This was a technology that another scientist

291
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,671
I've been working on already

292
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,487
By doing this O'Neal believe

293
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:50,559
What has a solution to the energy problems of the world

294
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:58,495
At this point you may be wondering how O'Neill plan to get all of the materials needed to build these massive star

295
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,263
Structures

296
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,287
Into space

297
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:04,639
Imagine the first loads would be taken by the space shuttle

298
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:07,455
A new tool for which NASA havoc

299
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,503
Extremely optimistic plans

300
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:12,575
Historian Patrick McRae

301
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:16,671
In the 1970s people were predicting shuttle flights happening every week

302
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:17,951
And

303
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:22,559
Build at the time is basically a space truck

304
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:25,887
But even with the space shuttle taking trips once a week

305
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:28,191
O'Neill knew that it wouldn't be enough

306
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:30,239
He needs to get his building materials

307
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:31,519
From the Moon

308
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,567
The Moon is a source of

309
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,895
Minerals which we know about thanks to the Apollo project

310
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:39,199
All of the things in fact

311
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:43,551
That we need for many of the products of an industrial civilization

312
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:46,623
So his idea was to

313
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:51,743
Move that material from the lunar surface using a type of electromagnetic catapult

314
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:58,399
This catapult was called a mass driver and it would swing raw materials from the Moon through

315
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,703
Through space to LaGrange point five

316
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:05,311
O'Neil and some colleagues actually designed a working model of 1

317
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:09,407
The PBS program Nova recorded a demonstration of it

318
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:10,943
Free

319
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:11,967
2

320
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:12,991
1

321
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:22,719
All of the people who lived in the first Bay settlement would be working in space as well

322
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:25,791
The process the raw materials to build the next settlement

323
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,607
Also be jobs in other industry

324
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:32,191
I decided that I was going to be

325
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,471
Running the first

326
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,751
Restaurant up there

327
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:39,871
I thought about you know which spices I had to take along

328
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,687
That we couldn't grow up there right away

329
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,247
Capture the imagination

330
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:50,367
Not everyone was as enthusiastic about Jerry O'Neill's ideas as

331
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,135
Tasha

332
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,695
Aa1972 O'Neill hat

333
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:58,559
Turn his ideas into a paper and was looking to be published in a scientific journal

334
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,095
He got a lot

335
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,375
Rejection letters

336
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:07,775
But then in May of 1974 the New York Times ran a front-page article about O'Neill's ideas

337
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,567
Which changed our lives

338
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,591
Dramatically

339
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:13,663
We had to delist our telephone number

340
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:18,783
Shortly thereafter O'Neal's ideas also found Traction in the academic world

341
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:21,087
When his paper was published in the journal

342
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,367
Physics today

343
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:27,231
And the requests for interviews and lectures

344
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,511
Came rolling in

345
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:33,119
O'Neill was interviewed by the Smithsonian in the science-fiction magazine Omni

346
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,143
Even penthouse

347
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,447
But it was a very very good article

348
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,983
I mean I only read it

349
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:38,751
The articles

350
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,567
In addition to Penthouse or maybe

351
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:42,591
Because of Ben house

352
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,895
O'Neill even gained the address of NASA

353
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:47,711
Which funded the series of studies at the Ames Research

354
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:48,991
2

355
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:51,295
Explore all the different Avenues

356
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:54,367
To try to find weaknesses and what he was suggesting

357
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,135
+ 2

358
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,415
Really workout

359
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,183
Detailed

360
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:57,951
Design

361
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,255
The bills on his original ideas

362
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:04,095
In all of his interviews and lectures

363
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,119
Jerry O'Neill

364
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,655
What about space in this

365
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,935
Onew way

366
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,263
Space wasn't just a government program

367
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,055
For elite astronauts to take

368
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:13,823
Pardon

369
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,359
Bass was a place

370
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,151
Just another place

371
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:19,199
For you and I to get to Ana

372
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:19,967
Explorer

373
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:25,343
When we open up the High Frontier by building colonies in space there is going to be

374
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:28,159
Room for people who want to leave

375
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:31,487
We are to go out and to develop their own colonies

376
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,279
And to do their own thing

377
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:40,447
Did the play

378
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,359
This idea of

379
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,639
Space as a place

380
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:51,199
Appeal to a lot of different kinds of people

381
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:55,551
And soon enough a social movement started coalescing around O'Neal's ideas

382
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:59,391
By 1975 a group called the L5 Society

383
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,671
LaGrange point five

384
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,207
Headphone to spread the gospel

385
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,743
Of space colonization

386
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:04,511
They were

387
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:07,583
Very vocal they were politically active so they would

388
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:10,911
Oftentimes be lobbying Congress or NASA for

389
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:11,679
Expanded

390
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,959
Space exploration Pro

391
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:16,543
And get it published a monthly newsletter

392
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:19,359
El fibers were serious face Act

393
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:24,223
But it was the seventies and there was a strange convergence happening

394
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,503
Of scientist

395
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,527
Hippies

396
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,831
Beautiful nerds of every stripe

397
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,367
Beautiful nerds

398
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:31,647
Within

399
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,743
All right let's do

400
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:36,767
Who were the green

401
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,047
4

402
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,863
That's Bill Higgins

403
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:46,751
She's a physicist and former L fiber who went to a lot of Science Fiction conventions in the 70s

404
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:51,871
Where he says there was often a room full of people singing and playing instruments

405
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:56,479
Bilco wrote the lyrics to a song that became somewhat of an Anthem

406
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,503
Bl-5c

407
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,271
Society

408
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,087
Give me your

409
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,623
Where the graviton

410
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:06,975
Where the three body problem is songs

411
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,279
Where the microwave

412
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,847
Space debris

413
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:23,871
Scolex

414
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:28,223
We possess

415
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,271
Solar power

416
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,391
I'm just going to give you a second

417
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,439
Stop picturing zero-g sex

418
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:44,351
For awhile O'Neill seem to welcome and encourage the

419
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,631
Attention from group play

420
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,399
Like L5

421
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:49,215
With the L5 Society started to attract

422
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,007
More controversial character

423
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,567
How many of you

424
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:56,895
Would like to live in space and live forever

425
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:57,663
How about it

426
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,479
That's incredible

427
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:03,807
That's Timothy Leary promoting the idea of

428
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:06,623
Space colonization in the late 1970s

429
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:12,511
Leary became famous in the 60s for advocating the therapeutic use of LSD

430
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:15,071
And Leary had his own ideas about what

431
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:20,959
Space colonies could do for Humanity brother trippy ideas about how building space colonies

432
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:24,543
Help Usher in this new phase of conscious human evolution

433
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,847
Having Leary as a spokes

434
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:31,199
May not have been ideal as O'Neill tried to get the government

435
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:33,247
Take his ideas seriously

436
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:37,599
Yo Larry someone who President Nixon once called the most dangerous man in America

437
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:41,183
If you're successful in promoting and popularizing

438
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:44,767
Nuclear technology or particular technological future

439
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,303
You also risk

440
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,607
Losing control over the idea

441
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,399
He wanted to

442
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,447
I'm happy ideas out there

443
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:54,751
You know people talking about it is

444
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:56,543
Better than not talking

445
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:00,127
People were certainly talking about it and not all of it was

446
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:00,895
What's positive

447
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:07,807
According to Patrick McRae many environmentalists of the time vehement Lee rejected the idea that space colonization

448
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:10,367
Mission could be a possible cure for our planet

449
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,391
Problems

450
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,927
Play Sade nothing Environmental

451
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:14,975
How about if they saw this as a

452
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:17,791
Extension of the military-industrial complex

453
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:18,815
Into space

454
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,399
And there were none environmental critiques made as well

455
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,959
People said well okay who's actually going to go into space

456
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:25,727
It's not going to be

457
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,287
You know the urban poor it's going to be

458
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,055
You know basic

459
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,079
Creditease

460
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,103
White suburbs

461
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,383
It in space

462
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,431
Kritikos

463
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,455
Sullivan Eagles

464
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:36,735
Uniform

465
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,783
Going to literally whiteflies

466
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,879
A rat done bit my sister nell

467
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,415
With Whitey on the moon

468
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,719
Buffets in Alma Kansas

469
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:48,511
And Whitey's on the moon

470
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,327
I can't pay no doctor bills

471
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,863
Whitey's on the moon

472
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:56,959
10 years from now I'll be paying still while Whitey's on the moon

473
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:58,751
You know the man

474
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:06,431
Gil Scott-Heron was just one of the people that voice this criticism about any quality in the space race

475
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,223
But of all the

476
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,527
Take sour made of O'Neill's ideas

477
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,807
No one really said

478
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,367
This is technologically in pause

479
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:18,976
And in fact in the 1970s we had just put astronaut

480
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:19,744
On the moon

481
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,536
Anything seems pause

482
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:25,888
Patrick says to put this in perspective he likes to imagine

483
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:27,680
Hypothetical scenario

484
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:32,032
It's 1975 and you ask a random person on the street

485
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,848
Which is the more likely scenario

486
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,384
Scenario a

487
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,432
We are going to build a

488
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,968
Base on the moon

489
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:42,272
And then we're going to build colonies and outers

490
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,040
Space

491
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,320
Or scenario B

492
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:47,392
We're not going to go back to the moon for another half

493
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,160
Century

494
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:48,928
At least

495
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:52,000
No I'd argue that in 1975

496
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,560
Most people would have felt that scenario a

497
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,584
Was the much more likely

498
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:03,264
In 1977 all of O'Neill's research was published in a very readable book

499
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,544
Call The High Frontier

500
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,616
And he appeared on 60 Minutes with Dan Rather to talk.

501
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,896
About space colonization

502
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,688
Do you expect

503
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,992
Just had put on one of these space habitats

504
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:17,344
I sure hope so Dan or I wouldn't be working on it that's your hoe

505
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:20,160
But the question is what is your expectation

506
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:23,232
Putting my own professional time and end my effort

507
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:28,864
Into the scenario that says that these things will be realized within my working lifetime

508
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:32,704
But despite O'Neal's optimism

509
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,264
The 60 Minutes segment marked the peak

510
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,824
Mainstream interest in his ideas

511
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:43,968
And the goal of building settlements in space began to seem less and less attainable

512
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:47,552
NASA space shuttles did not become Reliant

513
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:48,576
Space trucks

514
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:51,648
The shuttles ended up making far fewer flights into

515
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,184
Space Center originally predicted

516
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:56,000
In general NASA became more cautious

517
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,280
Unless adventurous

518
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,048
It's not a lot of pee

519
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:58,816
People at Hope

520
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:05,216
Which is why in 1977 O'Neill founded the nonprofit space Studies Institute

521
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:08,800
Which raises its own money and does its own research

522
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,592
On Space colonization

523
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:15,712
Gerard O'Neill died in 1992 after a long battle with leukemia

524
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,528
And now 25 years after his death

525
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,856
Some people think that were on the brink of another is facing

526
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:24,416
When they could lead to the realization of

527
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:26,720
Some of O'Neill's dreams

528
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,024
There are a lot of

529
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:29,792
People

530
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:30,816
Working on it

531
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:35,168
He has so many young people working with him they're now calling themselves

532
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:36,192
Jerry's Kids

533
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,240
And they're in there

534
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,264
50s

535
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,800
But they did learn

536
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,336
Sitting

537
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,872
A Disney

538
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,408
Eric Tomlinson

539
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,944
Peter diamandis

540
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:48,480
My mission in life

541
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,760
Since I was a kid

542
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:50,528
Was

543
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:52,576
And is to take the rest of yuan

544
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,368
Space during our lifetime

545
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,440
They were going to take the people of Earth in transition off

546
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,208
Permanently

547
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:01,024
That is Peter diamandis giving a TED Talk

548
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,560
In 2005

549
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:06,656
We thought about the government always has the person taking us there

550
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:10,496
But the government is not going to get us there

551
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:15,616
The government is unable to take the risks required open up this precious Frontier

552
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:23,296
Like Jerry O'Neill diamandis believes that technology can solve Humanity's biggest problems

553
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:25,344
And that we don't have to live

554
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,624
In a world of limits

555
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,160
But unlike O'Neal
