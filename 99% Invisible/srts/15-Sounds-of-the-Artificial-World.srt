Without other beeps without Sonic feedback all of your modern conveniences would be very

35
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,136
Hard to get

36
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:05,696
I mean try using your telephone without the

37
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:06,720
The beeps and it's

38
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:07,744
Really confusing

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,512
You're lost

40
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:09,280
Immediately

41
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:11,840
Play did I get it no I didn't get it the numbers there but if you hear it

42
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:14,144
Used to get it physically with the Rotary

43
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:22,336
Found this whole world is artificial

44
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:28,224
When I started I was working with this guy at the advanced product group at Apple

45
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:33,088
He had a case for a

46
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:37,696
Walkman I think and he opened it up and he closed it

47
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,720
Can you heard it

48
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:39,744
Click

49
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:44,864
And he said somebody work really hard to make that

50
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,632
Click

51
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,656
Sound that way

52
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,264
That was an an acoustical element on a

53
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:57,664
Mechanical device in a lot of moving Parts in mechanical bits and today's devices but gimmicky still has to

54
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,224
To make him sound right my name is Jim McKee

55
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,624
And I have a company called earwax Productions we do sound for film radio

56
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,160
Internet and

57
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:08,928
Products Amazon

58
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,512
Quite simply a product sound designer looks at a product and thinks

59
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:16,864
What kind of sound should this thing make when it does a particular thing

60
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:21,984
So typically what I do is I create a bunch of button sounds he's our would-be buttons for a Yahoo widget

61
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:26,336
Say okay you guys tell me which ones are the closest and then you end up with

62
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,664
What 38 Sounds here

63
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,576
I love that

64
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,112
Like it wasn't about all day

65
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,392
Let's hear it again

66
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:48,096
Oh yeah

67
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:55,776
The best sounds are not completely synthesized they come from the everyday world my top drawer my dresser drawer

68
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:58,848
Over the years I've been collecting all these little things

69
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,176
Just I would like I would leave

70
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,200
Leave it there all out

71
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,736
How cool is his little tiny

72
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:08,320
Chinese ceramic bowl or no

73
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,112
Some kind of funky clip

74
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:16,000
And I realize that all these things are very kind of intimate to me very close to me but they make sounds

75
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:19,071
And the one cool and was dropping a

76
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,375
Small marble into this

77
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,399
China Bowl

78
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,703
And it has a dynamic to it which

79
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,775
Everybody's familiar with it bounces but then it

80
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,871
Let the marble sped up

81
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:35,455
Eq2 knows what all sorts of things

82
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,831
Actually the funniest one the one that everybody loved and it's seems to have stuck

83
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,879
More less across-the-board his

84
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,671
The sound of a

85
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,463
Vise grip

86
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,743
Opening up

87
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,303
Cuz it's got the click in the spring

88
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,607
And for some reason it just

89
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:55,167
It really works and

90
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,447
People

91
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,983
Like the way it sounds

92
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,519
I think you can hear

93
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:02,591
Almost the same sound when you plug in your iPhone

94
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,895
Ticket powered

95
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,199
You know that

96
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,503
Ono when you turn it on

97
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,343
Hear it

98
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:22,815
Is a device that sounds or design correctly it creates a special theater of the mind that you completely buy into

99
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,095
Electronic things

100
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:28,447
Fuel mechanical it's the feeling of movement texture in articulation

101
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,727
Where none exist

102
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:35,103
Jimmy Keys most recent phone project the sounds that work best with the ones you felt

103
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:37,919
Resonating quality of the sound in relationship

104
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:38,687
To the

105
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:40,735
Chassis itself is what sold it

106
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,015
I feel

107
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,319
That really feels like Sparta

108
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:48,159
And once you find those frequencies that resonate in a device you keep it

109
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,439
Flooring that space

110
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:53,279
Almost got to the point where I didn't even have to ask them which one they were going to select

111
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,303
Cuz I would give them

112
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,071
Typically it would give the

113
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,095
Doesn't

114
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:56,863
Wants to pick

115
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,935
Varying volume varying slightly and patch

116
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,983
And I go okay it's going to be 46

117
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,031
And they come back

118
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,823
I don't know why but that seems

119
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:06,591
How to work a lot better

120
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,919
You take any actor and put them in the room

121
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:12,735
And they're immediately going to find the size of the room with their voice

122
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,271
It's

123
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,551
Human Nature

124
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,879
And so why can't we expect the same thing out of our devices

125
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,671
It needs to feel like

126
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,951
What's indigenous to this

134
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:50,879
Series from Bello radiotopia show the truth

135
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,695
The body genius is a Dark comic mystery

136
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,975
That whines through a

137
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:57,023
Treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

138
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,559
We're looking the part

139
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,095
Might cost you your life

140
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:05,471
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

141
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:09,823
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

142
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:14,175
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like a dad

143
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:18,527
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

144
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:22,879
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main got to know how to do that kind of

145
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:30,303
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

146
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:33,631
Was found dead in my private gym

147
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:36,959
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

148
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:41,311
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

149
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:44,639
Now I need to clear my name

150
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:50,015
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes

151
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,039
