I'm Roman Mars

25
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:47,264
The thing about being wrong is that before you know you're wrong

26
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,800
It feels exactly

27
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:51,360
Like being right finger that we were wrong

28
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:54,944
We wouldn't be wrong nobody's committing intentionally to a false belief

About the world

30
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:58,272
If they are they're not wrong they're deliberately lying

31
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:04,928
Even during the construction of the original Tacoma Narrows Bridge which was to become the third longest suspension bridge in the world

32
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,976
It seemed like something was wrong

33
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:10,816
Willy's in hindsight it seems like it should have felt that way

34
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:11,840
But that's not

35
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,120
Albion wrong work

36
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:15,680
If you grow up like I did watching the Warner Brothers

38
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,336
Moment

39
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:28,736
Where the roadrunners dashing off the cliff and the coyote is following him in the Roadrunner can fly

40
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:34,112
There's this great moment where he's run off the cliff but he does not yet realize that

41
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:37,184
You know he'd there's no Solid Ground Underneath Him and

42
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,744
The moment when we were wrong about something

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,792
But before we realized it is like that

44
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:42,816
We think

45
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:43,584
That

46
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,352
I believe

47
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:49,216
Is Rock Solid we think we have you know all of the facts in the world will stirring up

48
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,496
We feel like our God suspension

49
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,800
Bridge is not going to collapse

50
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:53,824
Down and realized

51
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,784
I know it sounds crazy but even during its construction the deck of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge

52
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,088
We go up and down by several feet

53
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,624
With the slightest Breeze

54
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,440
Construction workers on the Spanish food on Lemon wedges

55
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,464
The stop-motion

56
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,024
Book instruction continued

57
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,400
Because the bridge have been designed specifically to withstand winds up to 120 miles per hour

58
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:19,680
To everyone

59
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:20,704
Thought everything

60
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,240
Would be fine

61
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,080
Well almost everyone

62
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:31,456
The original Tacoma Narrows Bridge designed by Clark Eldridge was pretty conventional for suspension bridge

63
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:34,272
It was later Modified by Leon moiseff

64
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:35,808
To be Slimmer more elegant

65
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:39,904
The most notable change was the 25-foot

66
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,488
Lattice of stiffening trusses underneath the bridge on the original drawings

67
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,768
Replace

68
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,840
With an 8-foot solid steel plate girder

69
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:51,680
The new solid gutter along the side and wasn't design

70
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,216
Made for a much lighter

71
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:55,520
Slimmer and more flexible Bridge

72
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:58,080
It also got the wind like a sail

73
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,616
But they didn't know that

74
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:04,992
Moises design was also 2/3 the price of the original Eldridge design

75
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,016
And that fact

76
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,552
Ultimately won the day

77
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,392
Eldridge and other state Engineers were said to a protest in

78
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,672
But it didn't matter

79
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:19,583
The original Tacoma Narrows Bridge open to the public on July 1st 1940

80
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,935
They opened it was prone to having these oscillation

81
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,031
That's our Master of Disaster John Moore can I write on

82
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:31,103
Various murders and disasters mother rum Sunday topics

83
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:35,199
You supposed to Zine called Mercury can be fun about these sundry topics

84
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:41,599
He wrote about the Tacoma Narrows Bridge years ago workers on a bridge and nicknamed The Galloping Gertie in that game quickly

85
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:47,999
China became the bridges unofficial name even light winds caused the roadway to Ripple with longitudinal wave some 5 feet

86
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:53,631
The state of Washington was unconcerned about this but not like intensely so they're like looking at

87
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:58,239
Various things to reduce the motion to try some tie-down cables and installing a damper in

88
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,031
Very sad things

89
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:06,431
Again the roadbed seem like you can handle the waves just fine they're very confident in their structural integrity

90
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:11,551
The bridge was a solid as they are underneath Wylie Coyote

91
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:19,487
When you watch film of the waves traveling down the bridge

92
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,255
It is

93
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:24,095
Donnie the fact the bridge stayed open at all

94
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:28,703
Really illustrates how local governments have changed since 1940

95
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,007
That thing would never stay open today

96
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:36,895
If you were sitting in a car on the bridge when the waves were going the cars in front of you with Bob up

97
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:43,039
And then Disappear Completely from the you all look like it's Thrill Ride people actually dry specifically for the

98
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:46,879
The feeling of riding on this bouncing Bridge

99
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,719
The ride ended Just 4 months later

100
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:57,631
And the wind begins to speak with a roller

101
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:06,847
It was clear early on the morning of November 7th at the gale force winds were having a greater effect on the bridge

102
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:11,711
Previously these two source of waves on the bridge have been like a fairly transitory

103
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:15,039
Bounce out for a couple minutes but this was just going on and on so they

104
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:18,111
Got this could be problematical although they had seen actually

105
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,391
Deeper waves on the bridge

106
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:22,719
But then the movement changed things can't just got worse

107
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:29,119
The bridge begins twist violently along the Centerline and that became like extremely violent one end of the bridge.

108
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,167
45Â° angle

109
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:37,567
Little 40 mile-an-hour deals with feathers families like living in Queens with but you wouldn't believe

110
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,847
Palpable

111
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:42,175
Ohio River

112
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,199
Turning

113
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:43,967
Curly

114
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,527
By this time everyone had gotten off

115
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:51,391
The blunt solid edge of the bridge disrupted the flow of the strong wind

116
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,695
Causing one part to twist.

117
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,487
Well the other section twisted

118
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,255
Down

119
00:06:56,511 --> 00:07:00,863
They continue this torsional back and forth for over an hour or so there was plenty of time

120
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,399
For spectators to come watch

121
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,215
Including the bridge is original designer Clark Eldridge

122
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:09,311
A local camera store owner named Barney Elliott arrived on the scene

123
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:15,967
And took the now-famous color film of the bridges Relentless Generations

124
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:18,527
Airplane

125
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:21,855
Giant table snap like you only friend

126
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,815
The disaster

127
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,095
Gunplay net worth

128
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,887
Others Dipper

129
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,167
But whatever the reason

130
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,703
Tacoma wheel rebuild

131
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,799
This timer bracelet will not provide a super thrill in the news

132
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:46,943
For the collapsed Bridge aerodynamics and structural failure due to torsion

133
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,991
It's scarcely been considered

134
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:54,623
Or maybe those lessons I've been lost in the rapid evolution of more and more slender and longer Bridges

135
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,975
But the failure caused the study of bridge aerodynamics to take off

136
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:02,047
In any bridges that were on the drawing board in 1940

137
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:04,607
Or redesigned with more conservative

138
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,911
Deep open truss deck structures

139
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,519
Believe designer Leanne Marshall

140
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:15,615
And his solid steel i-beams received most of the blame for the disaster

141
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,431
He never designed another Bridge again

142
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:22,271
Doing no small parts affected he died three years later

143
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,367
No one was killed on the bridge

144
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,415
A few people were very lucky to get away with

145
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,439
The lies because

146
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:32,767
I just imagine you're on this bridge and is twisting it at 45

147
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:35,583
3 angling trying to walk off in a fairly stiff wind

148
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,887
The only casualty was a dog

149
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:44,031
A local newspaper man named Leonard coatsworth drove his car just passed the East Tower when the twisting started

150
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:46,335
That bouncing so hard he couldn't control it

151
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:50,175
Car anymore until teen Bridge through his car into the side curve

152
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,967
And he had his daughters dog

153
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,247
Cocker spaniel named tubby

154
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:57,855
Coatsworth gets out of his wrecked vehicle and gets thrown face down on the curb

155
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:58,879
The dogs completely

156
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,159
Trick Daddy come get the dog out

157
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,463
Here's the concrete cracking beneath

158
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,743
Can he barely makes it

159
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,511
Safety

160
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:07,327
An engineering Professor studying the bridge named for cars

161
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,399
Ventured out to get to be right when the bridge was about to

162
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,679
Fall into the sound

163
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,727
But when he reached into the car

164
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,751
Cubby bedroom

165
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,567
The dog was just too freaked out to leave

166
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,335
Vehicle

167
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,383
There's amazing film on cars

168
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,175
Stumbling back as best you could

169
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,735
Sticking to that middle yellow line

170
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,015
As the bridge Rock

171
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,807
Wildly

172
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,855
So tell me what's the only casualty

173
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:30,879
Forecast

174
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:36,767
Coach with was quoted immediately after the collapse saying

175
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,863
With a real tragedy disaster in Black the dreams all around me

176
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,679
I believe that right at this minute

177
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,959
What appalls me most

178
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:48,287

184
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:48,703
Several years ago I went to the Portland Zine Symposium to do a seminar

185
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,983
On research base scenes

186
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:53,823
Research-based seems like research-based blogs or podcasts

187
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,871
I have always been a bit in the minority

188
00:10:56,127 --> 00:11:00,479
Anyway and was held in this building called the Michael Smith Memorial Student Union building

189
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,527
On the Portland State University campus

00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:09,183
Very first thing I did like I can run the class and said okay this panel is being held in the Michael Smith amor

The championship

198
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:33,759
Which is an incredible accomplishments are beating out schools like Harvard and Yale and uses Portland State is a state school

199
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:37,855
This is not the type of school the expected wind something like this I'm sure
