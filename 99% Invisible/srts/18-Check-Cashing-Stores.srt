00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:12,608
You walk through the door you see the red carpeting you see someone in a suit there may be greeting you

Behind the counter

44
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:23,872
You don't really see what it is they offer you look around you're not going to see a lot of service

45
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:28,480
Know what you want going in there or you have to talk with someone

46
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:29,760
Help you figure it out

47
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,576
You think about it

48
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,856
There's no menu on the door

49
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:36,416
And you walk inside and

50
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:39,232
Like instead of giving you a menu they ask go to what do you want and you

51
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:41,536
Italian

52
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:45,376
And and then you have a conversation about what they could provide and

53
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,424
17 different sauces they could offer

54
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,216
Pasta

55
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,520

Second grade is a journal

My name is Douglas McGregor I'm a fellow at the new America foundation and I'm the editor-in-chief of Papa

58
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:02,528
What magazine

59
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:06,880
In a couple of years ago he wrote a story about Check Cashers in payday lenders

60
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:09,952
Switch Lecrae is quick to point out these are different services

61
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:10,976
Does check cashing

62
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,280
Is when you have a check that's made out to you

63
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,304
You going to the check

64
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,328
If you leave

65
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,888
Midas at 3% fee or so

66
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:20,448
And PayDay lending is when you don't have any money

67
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,496
So you write the payday lender a check

68
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,264
Act 4

69
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,312
$350

70
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,080
And you get

71
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,360
$300

72
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:28,896
And they cash it

73
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:32,992
Weeks those are the much more problematic transactions if you

74
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:36,832
I happen to think charging 400% interest is bad for the Working Poor

75
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:39,136
But McCray found that For Better or Worse

76
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,416
You know I think it's mostly for

77
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:42,464
Or Worse these places are here to stay

78
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:49,120
What may surprise you though if you have the same visceral reaction that I used to have to them it is a person

79
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:49,888
They're going to think they're

80
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:53,216
It's at least check cashing stores even with their problems

81
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:59,360
The fees are too high I can't say that enough of the Seas read most of them are too high May teach Banks something about using design

82
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:02,176
To better serve a wider range of customers

83
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:05,248
The absence of the bank like trapping

84
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,784
Plush carpeting for

85
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,808
Desk suits

86
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,600
They're missing for a reason

87
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:16,256
When Doug macray went on a tour of a branch with Tom next to at the time was the owner of the largest chain of check cashing

88
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,791
Stores in Southern California

89
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,607
Dick's pointed out the design choices he made

90
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:23,167
He pointed out the linoleum floor

91
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,983
He said you know if you go into a bank you're going to see a carpet of

92
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:30,335
And say a guy is coming off of his construction shift he's in his work boots

93
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,871
He walks across the car

94
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:32,895
Floor

95
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:33,663
He's going to feel

96
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,431
Like a jerk

97
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:36,479
I don't know if he's right or wrong but it was an interesting

98
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:40,063
And it was a conscious choice you know they would they would not put down

99
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:40,831
Carpeting

100
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:44,415
Nick's also work really hard to make his places seem just like retail

101
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:47,743
It reminds me a lot of a corner store only instead of selling

102
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,815
Chips and soda and stuff like that it's financials

103
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,655
And everyone patronizes and is welcome at a corner store

104
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,679
Rich and poor

105
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,471
And you know what everything costs

106
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:00,031
One of the most important things may be the most important

107
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:03,103
If this chain of Check Cashes Neal see this a lot of them

108
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,127
There was a

109
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,407
Big list of prices

110
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,199
And

111
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,735
It was all really straightforward

112
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:11,039
In the prices for the most part the prices were too

113
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,855
But you weren't going to wonder what something was going

114
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,903
You weren't going to wonder what they could do

115
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:19,487
Am I talk to people who chose to go to check

116
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,047
A lot of them it had a bank at one point

117
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:25,375
They signed up for some free checking account but then all of a sudden they had

118
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,471
Would like read these statements that were pages long and they could

119
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,519
Couldn't figure out why they were getting charged but they were getting

120
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:34,335
Charged plus you are paralyzed by the vast

121
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,383
Number of options available to you

122
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,431
If you go to your bank at chances are

123
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,711
It'll have like five.

124
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:46,111
Still have five different checking accounts will have all these investment accounts will have college savings accounts University to research

125
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,927
I'm it's hard to figure out which one is right for

126
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,975
And I for one always seem to leave with

127
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,511
The feeling that I picked the wrong one

128
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,559
The check cashers and payday lenders

129
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,351
Don't have a bunch of different service

130
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,631
But there will only be one of

131
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:58,911
So

132
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,447
You can cash your checks

133
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:04,543
You can wire money to your family another country and

134
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,359
It's all designed to be really simple

135
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:12,223
Let's pretend that you've never been to a bank before

136
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,015
I think some banks are realizing

137
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:18,879
They're cookie-cutter Suburban Branch you know they can't drop it down and

138
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:26,303
You know it's one thing if you opened a bank account with your parents when you were eight years old and you've been going there forever and all the weirdness the bank

139
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:29,887
Prices in the pamphlets and the ferns and all the stuff

140
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:30,911
It's kind of strange about it

141
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:31,679
Think about it

142
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,471
It's just normal cuz that's what a bank is

143
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,751
Suppose if you don't know what I

144
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,031
If it's not normal

145
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:37,567

Before we go I want to tell you about the body genius

155
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:05,727
A five-part series from fellow radiotopia show the truth

156
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,263
The body genius is a dark

157
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,287
Comic mystery

158
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:11,615
That whines through a treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

159
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,151
We're looking the part

160
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,687
Might cost you your life

161
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:20,063
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

162
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:24,415
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

163
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:28,767
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like a dad

164
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:33,119
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

165
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,423
Actually if I'm being honest

166
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:37,471
I'm one of the main guys who know how to do that

167
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:45,151
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

168
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:48,479
Was found dead in my private gym

169
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,807
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

170
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:56,159
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

171
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,183
Now

172
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,231
I need to clear my name

173
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:05,631
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes to find them
