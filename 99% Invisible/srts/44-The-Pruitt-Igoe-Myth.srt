It was 3311 storey buildings

37
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,168
And it was part of a larger urban renewal campaign that the city was undergoing in the 19

38
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:17,472
It was touted as a solute

39
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:21,568
A cure for the disease it was viewed kind of as a replacement for

What happened

59
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:20,192
Well one day we woke up and was all gone in the Middle St Louis

00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,752
But instead a monster was

62
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:28,640
Create in the film The pruitt-igoe Myth it's made it very clear that the project wasn't just a monster

63
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:35,040
In the beginning especially it represented hope to thousands of people who never thought they live in a clean

New home

65
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,880

12033 building

67
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,536
Only 2500 people still linger in the remaining shell

68
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,072

Vandalism and crime rates Rose

73
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,752
The one thing you always ask yourself

74
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:55,520
Cuz why

75
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:57,568
Why is it like this

76
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,384
Why do I live here

77
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,200
What did I do wrong

78
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,808
I think it created a mindset for

79
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:08,576
The inhabited

80
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:09,600
Dead

81
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,880
They weren't. About

82
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,184
That manifested itself

83
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:15,744
Way to cause more harm to

84
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,631

Caring

91
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,503
It's easy to look at pruitt-igoe and think that almost every decision that was made was a

92
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:42,623
The vandalism that the housing authority to install a bunch of Unbreakable

93
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,159
Designs in the towers

94
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,695
Instead of trident has

95
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,463
Existing

96
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:47,999
We'll just

97
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,791
I think so they can't beat

98
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:50,559
Destroy

99
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,863
Everything had to be protected

100
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:53,887
Light fixtures

101
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,679

Scheels around with mesh metal protecting the bulb

103
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,823
The city made a big deal about

104
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:05,919
Estandar PR department actually came out and they had the installation of these

105
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,991
New unbreakable lights that were going out

106
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:11,295
You know they brought in all these people in the Press

107
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:15,903
The only human reaction to being presented with an Unbreakable

108
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:16,927
Object is

109
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,463
I am break

110
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:20,767
The fact that it was in destruct

111
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,303
Made you wanted

112
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,327
Try to destroy it

113
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,351
There was a

114
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,119
Screen

115
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,399
Around the light bulb

116
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,423
They kept you from breaking

117
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,471
But you know kids be kids

118
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,007
Broadway brake

119
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,055
You just put water in it

120
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:33,823
Throw it up

121
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,359
And the light would get high

122
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:41,759
Two decades after opening pruitt-igoe

123
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:42,783
The government gave up

124
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,831
Because they are so desperate

125
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,623
They are willing to try

126
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,743
The Housing Authority blew it up

127
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,023
The Press was invited

128
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,583
It started with three buildings in 1970

129
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:56,863
The rest follow

130
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,911
The image of the implosion with

131
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,959
St Louis Gateway Arch in the background

132
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:01,983
Became infamous

133
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,519
The pruitt-igoe myth

134
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,287
Begins here

135
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,823
It was viewed as symbolic

136
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,871
It was kind of viewed as an end of an era

137
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:11,711
So then several years later Charles jencks writes his book on

138
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:14,527
Postmodern architecture and he opens his book with

139
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,599
Implosion is the death of modern architecture

140
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,879
Which leads to this Quest

141
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:21,183
How will know when pruitt-igoe be

142
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,975
If you didn't have that floating in the

143
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:28,095
You know if it's not blown up and you don't have that image with the arch in the background and it's so point it

144
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:30,655
I will be discussing. I don't I don't think so

145
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:33,471
You know I mean if something becomes an icon because it's

146
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:37,823
Been visually recorded there's something about that building in free fall

147
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:41,151
That acts is better evidence than anything else for failure

148
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,711
That image was so powerful

149
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,735
So full of emotion

150
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,015
Connecticut usually bu

151
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,039
Step support Mini

152
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,063
Previously held belief

153
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:48,831
Register

154
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,111
It's about Federal housing

155
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,903
Or modernist architecture

156
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:52,927
Are you in the

157
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:53,695
The pores of cell

158
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:58,815
And tell people who use a constantly as such that's what people think when they think of public housing and

159
00:06:59,071 --> 00:06:59,583
Anything Goes

160
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,375
Large-scale Federal probe Bandits

161
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:05,215
An architectural failure and here's a building that's being imploded because of his bad architecture

162
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:09,311
Bad architecture is one of the major cited reasons

163
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,847
4y pruitt-igoe failed

164
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,127
But that actually isn't

165
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:15,199
A factor that chat Frederick's puts a lot of stock in

166
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,735
Architecture was

167
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:20,063
La marginal influence if any on food I customize

168
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:26,463
Perhaps this is an overreaction that I tend to look as far away as I can from the design of the building simply because I see

169
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,255
So many other compelling factors

170
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,047
Infra Digos decline

171
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,583
I don't like to try to take

172
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:35,679
Should I go out of the city in which it resides and I think mud many of the discussions

173
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,983
Is that people have about pruitt-igoe

174
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:41,311
I tend to do that they tend to look at what I go as

175
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:45,919
Something that somehow divorce from the city of St Louis and what I went through in those years

176
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:48,735
What St Louis went through was it completely unpredictable

177
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,271
Did population decline

178
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,319
You have to remember food Iowa comes out of

179
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:55,903
The 1949 Housing Act in in 1949

180
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,207
The population of most major cities

181
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,999
Interurban Chlor was Rising

182
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:03,839
It was Rising relatively rapidly people coming into the cities for jobs from

183
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,375
Rural areas

184
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:11,263
And so St Louis was undergoing the same process where they just had the crowds and crowds of people coming into the city

185
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:15,615
And so the idea was well we need to find a place to put all of these new people

186
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:19,199
In a way that doesn't lead to the kinds of slums that you had

187
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,991
In earlier years going all the way back

188
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,783
The nineteenth-century factory City

189
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:28,671
The understanding among city planners and City officials was that the population would continue to rise

190
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,719
Show population of about a million

191
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:36,095
From 800000 from 1950 to 1970 and so over the course of those

192
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:39,167
20 years there was an expectation that the city would rise

193
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,447
How many 20%

194
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,215
Internship

195
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,263
Population what happened with the exact top

196
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,799
The bottom dropped out of

197
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,591
Population Naz

198
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,127
Population started to move

199
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,663
To Suburban areas

200
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,687
Out of the city

201
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:53,247
And this process was aided by the exact

202
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:59,135
Same 1949 Federal Housing Act that offered federally underwritten loans to buy houses

203
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,159
In Suburbia

204
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,207
I really started to see

205
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:06,303
A population's dip pruitt-igoe was undercut by the very law that created

206
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:11,423
The point where verify 1980 St Louis had half the population that it did in 1950

207
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,471
And that Trend continues to this day

208
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:18,335
What happens if you build this massive project to house all these people were coming into the city

209
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:22,943
And when those people don't come and the people who you attended to

210
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,479
Be letting their move out

211
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,015
All the sudden you have a vacancy

212
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,551
Crisis and that's really what

213
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,599
St Louis during these years

214
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:33,951
So given that the major architectural or design flaw that chat attributes

215
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,743
Am I the pruitt-igoe was

216
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,791
Sheer scale of the project

217
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,583
It was built so big

218
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,679
And they're just simply weren't enough people to populate it by the 1970

219
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:48,287
But it's something that is very difficult to predict as well

220
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,079
The scale Dune pruitt-igoe from

221
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:55,199
Start the high vacancy rate meant that the Housing Authority couldn't collect enough money to pay the main

222
00:09:55,711 --> 00:10:01,087
The money for operating and maintaining the building supposed to come from the incomes of the rents from the

223
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,623
Things began to break

224
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,903
Conditions deteriorate

225
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:06,463
More people laugh last rent can be collected

226
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,255
Everything just got worse and worse

227
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,607
I mean often like to say that

228
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,887
Pruitt-igoe is

229
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:14,911
An easy scapegoat

230
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,703
It's high rise

231
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,727
Sending that something in

232
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,031
In are mostly low-rise Society

233
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,079
Is viewed negatively in some circles

234
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,359
It's public housing

235
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,639
Supposed to private Market

236
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,407
Can housing

237
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,967
And it's demographics are

238
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,247
Extraordinary

239
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,551
And almost 100% black

240
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,575
And so

241
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,623
What I like to do when discussing

242
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:38,719
Pruitt-igoe is to try to like think about a different scenario

243
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:41,791
And conveniently that scenario happened across the street

244
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,327
Euro to enter pruitt-igoe

245
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,607
In the late 1960

246
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,399
And you were too

247
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,679
Travel Due West

248
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,447
Outer prude

249
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,519
And so you would what you would do as you would cross Jefferson Ave

250
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,567
You cross the street into

251
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:54,847
The low-rise

252
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:55,615
Private Market

253
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,383
Housing

254
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,407
That exists across

255
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,967
What you would see would be

256
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,759
Similar levels of poverty

257
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,295
You would see the same

258
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:06,623
I kind of maintenance issues in those low rise

259
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,415
How did Market Building C with c

260
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,463
The same kinds of vandalism

261
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:16,351
And oftentimes you'd actually see higher crime rates in the surrounding neighborhoods and you saw pruitt-igoe

262
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:22,751
And no one really ever talks about those low-rise private Market houses that existed around crude I get with all

263
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,287
How is pruitt-igoe people focus on

264
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:28,639
The focus on pruitt-igoe is understandable when you see an aerial photograph

265
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,663
St Louis at

266
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,431
The time

267
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,223
The impact of pruitt-igoe

268
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,503
633 building

269
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,295
Footprint that they make in the city

270
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,575
Is Jaws

271
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:37,599
Enormous

272
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:43,743
Give me it had very little to do with the fact that pruitt-igoe was public housing very little to do with the fact that it was high-rise

273
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,047
It had almost everything to do with

274
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,095
The decline of the city in which it reside

275
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:03,967

Before we go I want to tell you about the body genius a five-part series from fellow radiotopia show the truth

285
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:12,063
The body genius is a Dark comic mystery that whines through a

286
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,111
Treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

287
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,391
We're looking the part

288
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:17,183
Might cost you your life

289
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:22,303
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

290
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:26,655
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

291
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:31,007
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like a dad

292
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:37,663
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff actually if I'm being honest

293
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,991
I'm one of the main guy to know how to do that kind of thing

294
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:47,391
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

295
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:50,719
Was found dead in my private gym

296
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:54,047
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

297
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:58,399
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

298
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,423
Now

299
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,727
I need to clear my name

300
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:07,103
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes

301
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,127
