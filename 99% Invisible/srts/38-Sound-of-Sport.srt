I'm Roman Mars

Buchanan's Baxter and Bill Winston are doing their job right you probably don't notice that the

27
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,008
They're doing their job

28
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:52,640
But they are so good at doing their job you probably don't even know that her job exist at all

29
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:55,968
Are sound designers televised sporting events

30
00:01:56,224 --> 00:02:02,368
Their job is to draw the audience into the action and make Sports sound as exciting as possible

31
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:05,440
And that doesn't mean that they throw a bunch of microphones on the field

32
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:06,976
This is Dennis Baxter

33
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,512
Sound designer of the Olympics

34
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:14,144
There's some sports that she just

35
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,168
Cannot

36
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,448
Capture the nag

37
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:21,056
Cross country skiing biathlon is another one

38
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:23,104
Because of the size of the core

39
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,944
And this has been further complicated because it's the camera lenses have gone up

40
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,528
110 Hunter 2000 3842 1

41
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,832
These cameras are able to see

42
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:35,136
A half a kilometer maybe McClung

43
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,440
And how do you reply

44
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,464
Placate that sound

45
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,536
Essentially if you got cameras that are

46
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:45,120
That far apart from each other you're putting 20 or 30 microphones

47
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,400
To feel

48
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,192
Why is the athletes are coming to you

49
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,216
Which is not

50
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,032
I am not a

51
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:54,592
Purest whatsoever in sound production

52
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:55,872
I truly believe

53
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,688
Then whatever the tool takes

54
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,480
To deliver a

55
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,528
High quality entertaining

56
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,552
Soundscape

57
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:04,832
It's all fair game

58
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:05,600
And

59
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:08,160
That has caused some issues because I use sampler

60
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,208
What a sampler is

61
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,000
It's a keyboard is attached

62
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:14,816
To essentially a digital recorder

63
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:17,632
When you hit the key on the keyboard

64
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:18,656
Triggers

65
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:19,680
The sound

66
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,216
At the playback

67
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:25,312
And with keyboard also triggers with sensitivity

68
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,848
Means it if I hit the

69
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:28,640
The key real hard

70
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,688
Don't have a little bit more of a heart attack

71
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,224
And you can vary the pitch

72
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:35,040
If I hit a C note that has a stamp

73
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:37,856
And then I hit a d note of the same sample

74
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,136
It will be apus

75
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,672
So for the sea and it gets

76
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:59,104
Rick Craven pension still hold the lead the French in third we could do without saying never a mother

77
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,920
In Atlanta one of my biggest problems

78
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:02,944
With Relic

79
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,504
Rowing is a 2 km

80
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,272
Course

81
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,040
They have

82
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,320
For Chase boats

83
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,112
Following the rowers

84
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,136
And I have a helicopter

85
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:15,488
That's what they need to deliver the visual

86
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,559
Okay but the helicopter in the chase boat

87
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,095
Just completely wash out

88
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:22,143
No matter how busy

89
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:25,727
You cannot capture you cannot reach

90
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,007
And isolate

91
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,055
Sound like you do visual

92
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,335
But people have EX

93
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,103
Expectations

94
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,151
If you see the rollers

95
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:33,919
They

96
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,711
Have a sound that they respect

97
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:36,991
So what do we do

98
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:45,439
That afternoon we went out on a canoe with a couple of rowers and recorded stereo samples of the different

99
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:49,791
Type of effects that would be somewhat typical of an event

100
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:57,727
And then we loaded those recordings into a sampler and play them back to cover the shots of the boats

101
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:08,223
Great Britain gold medals Steven Matthew Benson

102
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:10,783
Standby

103
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:13,855
Good evening

104
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:18,463
Let me do a horse racing you're looking to get somebody running around the pool softer

105
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:22,559
Snow White and occasionally you will come across pretty close up pic

106
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,863
Of the horses of the Pharcyde

107
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,911
Which is the most fun of all roofing companies

108
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:27,935
What you have

109
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,215
Engine oil

110
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,519
So that's why you wouldn't want to watch phone on that

111
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,799
Cuz when he retired

112
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:35,103
The car revving up when they come around cussing

113
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,895
Basically

114
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,431
The way you cover roll Lots

115
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:40,991
Stuff is to run a tape

116
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,015
Which has

117
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:44,063
Sound of horses galloping

118
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,111
Which is actually if I remember rightly

119
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,159
A slowed-down buffalo charge

120
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:55,071
That's pretty much a standard thing

121
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,375
Same recorded Live use for you

Before we go I want to tell you about the body genius a five-part series from fellow radiotopia show the truth

132
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,383
The body genius is a Dark comic mystery

133
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,919
That whines through a

134
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,967
Treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

135
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:17,247
We're looking the part

136

137
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:24,159
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

138
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:28,511
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

139
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:32,863
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like a dad

140
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:37,215
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

141
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,519
Actually if I'm being honest

142
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,567
I'm one of the main guy to know how to do that

143
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:47,967
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for a nap

144
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,247
Watch a movie called Immortal cop

145

Was found dead in my private gym

146

Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

147
00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:00,255
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

148
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,279
Now

149
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:03,583
I need to clear my name

150
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:09,727
