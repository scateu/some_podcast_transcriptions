38
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:39,072
A very unusual building in New York

39
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,864
Citicorp Tower

40
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:48,288
What it was built in 1977 was the 7th tallest building in the world

41
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:52,384
You know I can still remember the first time I saw the citicorp center

42
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:58,016
If you exit the Local 6 subway station at Lexington and 53rd in Midtown Manhattan

43
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:02,368

Matthew 59 story skyscraper levitates meet hovering

51
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:35,648
115 space above the street corner

52
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:42,304
At first glance the building seems to violate the basic laws of physics

53
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,704
The underside of the building corner

54
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:55,104
Even the ground Instead This nothing

55
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,504
Of course the building isn't really levitating it's propped up on stilts which join the building at the midpoint of each side

56
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,040
It does not exert a

57
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:06,112
It's got to be starting Scott to be safe they wouldn't have built it this way

Secret about this building

60
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:13,792
It was literally a secret for nearly two decades after it was built

61
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,584
The citicorp center

62
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,400
Could very well have blown over in the Wind

63
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:20,192
What I want to know

64
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,008
Which one was this building waterfalls

65
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:27,616
The architect of the Citigroup Center was Hugh stubbins

66
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:32,992
The most of the credit for this building is given to the chief structural engineer William lemessurier

67
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:36,320
Who laugh at me but I did conceive it on a napkin

Greek restaurant in Cambridge

69
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,440
La mision passed away in 2007

70
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:45,024
This is him giving a talk at MIT in 1995

71
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,328
The whole problem was to build a building

72
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,864
On a site that has

73
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:52,448
A church in one quarter St Peter's Lutheran Church

74
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,984
Crummy old building

75
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:57,056
It was the lowest point in Victorian architecture

76
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,848
It was that bad

77
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:05,248
Set at the corner of the lots and when the church sold Atlantic City called it was on the condition that they built

78
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,272
Build a new church

79
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,040
Inexact

80
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,064
Same location

81
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:12,672
Beyond that the company was free to build a skyscraper around the church

82
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,464
And in the airspace above it

83
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,256
So a plan was hatched

84
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,303
Flute the building over the church

85
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,583
Hence the stilts

86
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:22,143
And because the church was in the corner of the lot

87
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,935
The measure put the stilts in

88
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,471
Kind of weird place

89
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:28,799
You couldn't have columns in the corners where they ought to be

90
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:31,871
Unconventional building so they were moved to the middle

91
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:37,247
Placing the Cullens at the midpoint of each side rather than in the corners made the building lifts table

92
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,295
Additional support

93
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,855
Lamesha designed a Chevron bracing struct

94
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,671
Essentially rows and rows of these

95
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:48,767
8/8 stories high pointing down the middle of h building face

96
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,815
Twitter supporting columns if they move

97
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,655
Actually I can take one and to keep the building simple it is

98
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:59,263
Skin because there was so much drama going on at the bottom and at the top anyway

99
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:03,615
Should know if you're going to have any diagonals I don't ever want to say them

100
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:07,199
Set the Chevron bracing structure was slipped under the skin of the building

101
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,991
I found the city court sentence

102
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:09,759
The skeleton

103
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:13,343
One of the amazing things about the Chevron bracelet

104
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,135
Is it so light White

105
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,415
The wind the wind blows

106
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:21,279
It is more dynamically excitable than the building that weighed twice as much

107
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,815
In other words

108
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:23,583
It movie

109
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,607
With the Wind

110
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:27,679
Which most people find really unsettling

111
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,215
Understandably right

112
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:33,311
Lamesha added something cold a tuned Mass damper

113
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:37,919
The tuned Mass damper is a massive concrete which is 29 ft

114
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:38,687
Square

115
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:40,735
In about 8 feet second wave

116
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,527
400 tons

117
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,319
It is flooded on

118
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,111
Pressurized oil bearing

119
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,183
Sits at the very top of the building

120
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,231
An axe to steady the oscillation

121
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,023
It offsets the Wind Gap

122
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:58,655
So to recap we have a 59 Story Tower floating on 115 foot still

123
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:03,519
Still switching not in the corner where you'd expect them but Rob it in the middle of a side of a

124
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:09,151
Face with a skeleton of beans shaped like these which make it super light for a skyscraper

125
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:13,503
And to stop it from swaying in the wind there's a 400-ton block

126
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,039
The concrete on the roof

127
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,575
Totally ingenious

128
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,623
Really cutting edge design

129
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:25,535
Limitations of pro so in accordance with the New York City building code

130
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,303
Medical model

131
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,863
To make sure the building is going to hold up

132
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,679
And everything seemed just fine

133
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,471
Until as

134
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,751
He got a phone call

135
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:36,543
June

136
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:37,823
19

137
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,591
78

138
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,383
I'm in my office

139
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,663
I got a call from a

140
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,687
Student

141
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:45,759
I do not know the school I wish you would call me

142
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,575
For the past you never had one and it was a real student

143
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,599
From New Jersey

144
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,879
I think it was an architect

145
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,159
Student English teacher

146
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:54,207
Giving him this buildings

147
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:54,975
Study

148
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:55,999
And report on

149
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,279
Because it's unusual

150
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,815
ASLA midget elf

151
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,863
Closest college senior

152
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:05,471
Hold him up to ask how he's building structure is going to cope with quartering winds

153
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:12,127
An undergraduate student calling out the head of a world-renowned engineering firm on one of the most Innovative skyscraper

154
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,919
Designs of a today

155
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,455
Quartering winds the winds

156
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,991
Caught the students attention

157
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:19,039
Adults that hit the building on the corner

158
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:21,599
Exerting pressure on two faces at once

159
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:27,487
Emissions calculations on the perpendicular Twins win to hit the face of the building Square on

160
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,767
Seem to be fine

161
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,559
But as The Story Goes

162
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:34,911
The student raise the alarm about citicorp Center being particularly vulnerable

163
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:35,679
Cornice

164
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:41,823
It turns out the measure had never run the numbers on what cornering winds would do to the building because normally

165
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,383
Buildings are strongest at their corners

166
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,199
But this is no normal building

167
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,735
Remember what's going on team

168
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,271
Supporting column shift

169
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,319
Did the midpoint of each building phase

170
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,367
The Chevron bracing skeleton

171
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,927
And the unusually light mass of the build

172
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:02,047
Taking a loan no one of these design quotes should have presented a problem

173
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,327
But as a

174
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,631
Student told lamesha taken together

175
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,167
Payless citicorp Center

176
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:11,263
Tequila vulnerable to wind striking the structure corners

177
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,335
And when the measure started to investigate the students claims

178
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:18,943
You realize that the root of the problem had to do with a change that have been made to the original plans

179
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:23,295
It has to do with how the Chevron bracing structure was fastened together

180
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:29,951
What measures plan originally called to the joints to be welded with full penetration weld with the contractor had

181
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,743
Just said using bolts instead

182
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,023

184
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,351
For the forces

185
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,887
Did my people gave them

186
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,679
It was a cost-saving measure

187
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:42,751
The measure says that this change would have happened without his knowledge

188
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:45,823
Given the wind load calculations lamesha tame Hadsell

189
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,591
Applied

190
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:49,151
Welding these days together with Overkill

191
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:53,247
Run the math and it looks like both would do just fine

192
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:59,903
And bolts would have done just fine I'm pretty much any other building except citicorp Center had an Achilles heel

193
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:04,511
Each of its Four Corners with no one else had

194
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,815
No one except for that pesky student

195
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:07,839
From New Jersey

196
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:10,399
And Islam Asia started looking into the students

197
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:12,447
Claims about these quartering winds

198
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,727
You realize this

199
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,519
Situation wasn't just bad

200
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,055
It was a disaster

201
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,335
Waiting to happen

202
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:21,407
The return. To failure

203
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,223
What's 16 years

204
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,015
It's about that

205
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,807
Cancel that meme

206
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,879
Limited calculated the quartering wind velocity

207
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:31,903
Required

208
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,439
Coppell citicorp Center

209
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:36,255
He didn't match these velocities to weathertap

210
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,791
To see how freaky

211
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,071
On average

212
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,631
Winds strong enough to blow the building

213
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,399
Occurred

214
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:47,519
La mejor found that storm strong enough to knock over the building is New York City on average

215
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,311
Once every 55 years

216
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:52,639
But that's only if the tuned Mass damper is working

217
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,175
The tuned Mass damper needs

218
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,199
How it's run

219
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:57,759
If you getting shoot Stone The Measure be alive

220
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:01,343
It's not unlikely that the city could suffer a blackout

221
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:05,951
La mejor random numbers again this time Imagining the damper without power

222
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:10,047
Without the damper a storm is strong enough

223
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:14,911
Topple citicorp Center hits New York on average once every 16 years

224
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,447
To put this another way

225
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:22,335
The entry of the building was standing there was about a 1 in 16 chance of a stone potent enough

226
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,127
To take out the citicorp center

227
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:29,503
This building is 915 feet high if it's fail they would topple sideways in the Wind

228
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,063
Crashing into other Manhattan skyscrapers

229
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:35,647
A whole slew of buildings from Midtown to Central Park

230
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,183
Would fall like dominoes

231
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,255
Thing is in real

232
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:46,911
This brand new skyscraper was on the verge of catastrophic failure

233
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,471
But the imminent disaster wasn't the result of

234
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,263
One glaring oversight

235
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:54,079
Robert it was a sequence of minor issue

236
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,383
Let's remember how we got here

237
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,431
This building was on stilts

238
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,991
Because they had to build over the church

239
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:06,879
Instills place at the corners would have been just fine except the church was at the corner of the lot

240
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:09,951
So the stilts had to be in the middle of each face

241
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:12,255
And that could have been a okay

242
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:17,631
Except the offset stilts led lamesha to use an ultra-light Chevron bracing

243
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,703
Which would have been perfectly adequate except in the end

244
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,287
Those Chevron V's were bolted not welded together

245
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,335
And even that could have been fine

246
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,359
Except

247
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:31,199
No one thought about how vulnerable this crazy design was

248
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,991
Wind blowing at its corners

249
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,527
No one except

250
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:36,319
An anonymous college student

251
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,087
La measurement

252
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,647
Citicorp chairman Walter wriston and told him

253
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,439
That would need to open up the building

254
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,975
And weld it back together

255
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,023
That is how much is going to cost

256
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,583
I don't think it's going to cost an awful lot

257
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,119
Billionaire 2

258
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,655
That's nothing

259
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:57,311
Rebuilding the cost 275 minute and if it falls down from he'll make sure when he's team worked with the city code

260
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:00,383
Bigwigs to coordinate emergency repairs on the bill

261
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,687
With the help of the NYPD

262
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:06,527
They worked out an evacuation plan spanning a 10-block radius

263
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,551
They had

264
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:10,879
2500 Red Cross volunteers on standby and

265
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,671
Three different Weather Services

266
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,463
Is implied 24/7

267
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,767
To keep an eye on potential windstorms

268
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:19,583
They welded through the night and quit they break

269
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,119
Just at the building occupants

270
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:21,887
Pretend to work

271
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:26,751
But all this happened in secret over three months without telling anyone who works there

272
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:30,335
Which is the part of the story I kind of have a problem with

273
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:35,711
I mean isn't the situation serious enough to Warrant informing the building's tenants

274
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:39,295
My wife works in a skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan

275
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,087
It's about informed consent

276
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,391
I want her to be able to make the judgment

277
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:46,207
Quote about whether or not to go work in a faulty building

278
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,999
But The Hobbit made for her

279
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,279
Their thinking was

280
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:55,679
A contingency plan was in place and ready to invoke as soon as a storm strong enough to blow the building down was in

281
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,471
Striking Distance of New York

282
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:58,751
Except

283
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,567
It was a giant storm Racing update

284
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,359
Hurricane Ella

285
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:08,735
The message says the palace at Baywood just hours away from calling in the evacuation

286
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,807
Spit the hurricane in the Atlantic

287
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:12,831
Of course

288
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:13,855
And in the end

289
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,647
The public was never notified

290
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,183
And I know what you're thinking

291
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:22,559
If only there was some kind of independent organization that serves the Public's right-to-know

292
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:27,167
That might wonder why citicorp Center was aglow with blowtorches all night every night

293
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,959
You know something like a newspaper

294
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:29,983
Except

295
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:32,287
The New York Times quiz on strike

296
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:37,919
Saturday did the New York Times go on strike but all the newspapers in the ward went on strike

297
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,455
Until October

298
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:40,479
So we had a

299
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,759
Chris blackout

300
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,551
And that was the greatest thing that ever happened

301
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,135
So weird never got out

302
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,671
And construction was finished

303
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:51,999
And citicorp Center has remained standing ever since

304
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:55,839
Long enough to be renamed Citigroup Center and lighter

305
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:56,863
601

306
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:59,423
Nothing remains a secret

307
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,191
Almost

308
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:00,959
20 years

309
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:10,943
In the early nineties

310
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:15,807
He interview limiter and broke the story in the New Yorker in 1995

311
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,599
La Mesa weather

312
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,879
To tell the story public

313
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,951
Like you did a mighty which is how we having talking

314
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:22,719
About this

315
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,279
End

316
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,559

00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,703
New York was spared a tremendous loss of life

323
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,847
Give time

324
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,895
The inquiry of an undergraduate

325
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:48,319
Thank goodness this uppity college senior and his thesis and kudos to build a measure who threw his humility

326
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,343
And heroism

That's sweet of you

Except

331
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,375
Nobody but the couple more things

332
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,959
Let's take a step back

333
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,519
And remember how this story start

334
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:12,127
I got a call from a spoon they was a real student from New Jersey

335
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:18,527
Giving him this building to study I do not know the school I wish you would call me

336
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,695
College students

337
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:27,487
Yum story

338
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,255
With love

339
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,279
History

340
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,351
Play wait for it wait for this moment it's a good one

341
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:33,631
Here it comes

342
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,751
It would have been sometime in the early 90s

343
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:41,055
Being upstairs in my bedroom

344
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:44,127
And had one of my sons

345
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:46,687
I was sort of hanging off me as I was trying to

346
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:47,967
Put him down to go to bed

347
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,759
And

348
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,575
Suddenly my husband who have been downstairs

349
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,599
Started

350
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,879
Yelling a little bit

351
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:57,439
Diane Diane quick quick

352
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,719
Turn on the TV

353
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:01,023
Your thesis building is on TV

354
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,047
This

355
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,327
Is Diane Hart

356
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,887
As far as we can tell she

357
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:06,911
Was the student

358
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,191
In the mattress store

359
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:13,823
And so I holding the baby with one arm I fumbled for the remote and got to the channel

360
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:16,383
Just in time to hear

361
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,407
This building

362
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,431
Could have killed

363
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:19,967
Tens of thousands

364
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:26,111
The extraordinary chain of events began with a phone call out of the Blues from a student in New Jersey

365
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:28,415
Professor who told him to write a paper on the city

366
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,207
William lamarche

00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:33,279
Explain to the student that a telephone call

368
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,095
Professor

369
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,375
I was

370
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,143
A gas

371
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:40,191
I nearly dropped my baby

372
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:45,567
This was the first time Diana never heard of the emergency retrofit

373
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,847
Weather monitoring

374
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,127
Evacuation plans

375
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,663
In the involvement of a student

376
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,967
So when she heard lamesha reference

377
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:52,735
Students

378
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,271
A male student

379
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,063
I of course assumed you know

380
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:56,831
Gosh

381
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,367
There was some guy

382
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:00,415
Studying the building as well

383
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:03,231
And wow you know how could I miss this

384
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:03,999
Wow

385
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:09,119
So it was pretty remarkable but I have course assumed at the time that

386
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,655
There was another fellow who

387
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,447
Been a better researcher than I had

388
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:16,031
In fact I never even considered that she might be

389
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,311
Student in the story

390
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,335
That is

391
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:20,383
Until she went to Princeton event

392
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,175
Honoring her thesis advisor

393
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,199
David Billington

394
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,223
When I

395
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,247
Showed up at event

396
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,527
David said

397
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,319
Well have you ever heard

398
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:30,879
Of the problems with the citicorp center

399
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,671
And I said yes

400
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,743
Isn't that pretty remarkable I wonder who it was

401
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,047
That discovered this problem

402
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:43,423
And you said you know there are very few engineering schools in New Jersey

403
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,703
And

404
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:45,983
Quite frankly

405
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,263
I know all of them

406
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,311
And I know the heads of the program

407
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:51,615
Of all of them and I've talked to all of them

408
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:54,431
There was no other student from New Jersey

409
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,223
That was studying the building

410
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,503
Except for you

411
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:02,623
So it must have been You by I don't know about any other student

412
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:04,415
This is David Billington

413
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,695
The thesis advisor

414
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:09,535
That's my name is David Billington that's correct and I'm an engineer

415
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,303
Respect

416
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,863
53 years at Princeton

417
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:13,887
Faculty member

418
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:17,983
I was dying Hartley ceases advisor she wrote the most

419
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:22,591
Outstanding pieces

420
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,127
Two big volume

421
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,151
NetSpend

422
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:28,735
To hear Diane Hartley and David Billington

423
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:31,551
Diane wasn't some in-your-face nodal

424
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,343
Here's her version of the events

425
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,647
So I was 21 years old

426
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,695
And there was a senior

427
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:40,511
At Princeton University where I was studying

428
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:43,327
Architecture and urban planning

429
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,119
My thesis

430
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,143
I had

431
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,935
Selected the topic of the

432
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:48,959
Citicorp Center

433
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,983
In New York

434
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:53,055
Which had only recently been completed and knocked

435
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:56,383
She reached out to limit his son to get the calculation

436
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,407
Diagram

437
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,967
And then she tried to replicate the math

438
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:00,735
Hisself

439
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:04,319
To do the work again from the start and see if she got the same answer

440
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,855
Tesla motors engineers

441
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:11,743
David Billington her adviser asked her to ask him about the quartering

442
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:15,327
The quartering wind I thought that was a problem

443
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:18,655
And that it should be looked at so I

444
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:21,727
Obtain calculations from the design engineer

445
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,775
I'm from the measurers off

446
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:26,079
And I concluded the governing

447
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,359
Loading condition

448
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,151
Was the wind hitting

449
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,943
The corner of the building

450
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:34,015
The math just wasn't coming out right

451
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:36,063
I was struggling with the calculations

452
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,111
I assumed

453
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:38,879
Of course

454
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:41,439
That the engineer had done the right thing

455
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,719
And any

456
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:44,511
Inconsistency that I might find

457
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:45,791
Would be mayor

458
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,327
Back in the building was standing

459
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:48,607
After all

460
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,399
She was just a college senior

461
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,703
Elementary established

462
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:54,495
Internationally-renowned

463
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,263
Professional

464
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,799
Structural engineer

465
00:19:57,055 --> 00:20:03,199
Diane got back in touch with the measures firm although she never talked with the measure herself I never called

466
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:06,527
I never said these things that

467
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:11,647
That were documented in the in the various reports that have been published today

468
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:17,279
Diane Tito to Junior engineer the measured New York office named Joel Weinstein

469
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:23,679
Calculations but at the end of the day no I didn't I didn't feel that I

470
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:25,983
I had put my finger on a major problem

471
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,775
I assumed I was wrong

472
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:34,175
And wasn't understanding things

473
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:38,271
Play it didn't think there was any imminent threat I mean I don't think either of us

474
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,831
Really were in a position to say it

475
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:41,599
The time

476
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,415
You got to do something bill right away

477
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,439
We didn't have that

478
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,975
Feeling I have the feeling that

479
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:49,535
She should talk to the designers

480
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,583
And find out

481
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:55,167
Weather this quartering wind has been considered and

482
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,191
So what is it

483
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,215
What was the outcome

484
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:03,871
But somehow dianthus cover ain't got silently passed out the totem pole within the measures firm

485
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:05,919
I said well I better check with Bill

486
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,991
That would have been the logical thing to do and he probably did that

487
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,295
I never heard that you never heard it I guess

488
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:16,416
Yes we are still one staying the engineer about meeting Diane and what happened afterwards

489
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:20,000
He says he has no memory of this either way

490
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:22,304
Diane remember

491
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,072
Speaking to him

492
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:23,840
Send it

493
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:24,864
Probably happened

494
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:26,400
And in such a sick

495
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,192
He would have talked him message

496
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,216
On television

497
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:35,616
So it could be that's why the measure remember speaking to a male student he was complaining Diane Hartley the student with Joline

498
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:36,896
Weinstein his own staffer

499
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:41,248
Now of course it is possible that there was a male

500
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,808
The third man is somehow

501
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:44,832
The same data

502
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:47,136
Is Diane and actually did

503
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,928
Hoksila measure on the phone

504
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:54,816
But I find it really hard to believe that such a person didn't come forward and claim the spotlight after the story broke

505
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:57,632
Gendercide Diane definitely doesn't fit

506
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,424
Poches student

507
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:03,008
Chatted about a problem without even recognizing

508
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:03,776
Significance

509
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,056
What she done

510
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,336
Decades

511
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,896
It's not that I did some

512
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,712
It's that perhaps

513
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,992
What's my questions help

514
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:13,760
Someone

515
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:14,528
Figure something

516
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:17,600
Perhaps my questions were meant to be

517
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,904
I think if I had

518
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,440
Really realized

519
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,464
If there was a problem

520
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,512
Put my finger on it

521
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,560
And raise it up the flagpole

522
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:28,608
I could Pat myself on the back

523
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:29,632
Having done

524
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,168
Pretty remarkable

525
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,728
But at the end of the day

526
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,776
I feel like I was a bit

527
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:36,544
Player

528
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:37,568
Play

529
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,360
That had a happy ending

530
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,944
So yes she deserves

531
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,224
More credits

532
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,808
You can tell her that

533
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,624
True that I think that that's right

534
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,440
Code up for this

Bongs and Charter of our devices

546
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,968
We're immersed in a cluttered world

547
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:49,248
A man-made sound

548
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,272
If

549
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:54,880
I'm in room listening to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexis

550

552
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,304
She talked to us

553
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:04,608
It is a creation of Sonic trap

Play starset

603
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:29,248
I say this is not architecture

604
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,040
Destructor

605
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:32,320
Engineering structure

606
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:34,368
I'm very sensitive about the

607
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,160
I don't want to mix up

608
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:36,928
These things

609
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:38,464
So I think that in this case

610
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,000
The measures design

611
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:45,376
Was a brilliant structural design but it was all covered over typical of Arkansas

612
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:47,680
The cupboard I wish I could never see it

613
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,216
Most people make that

614
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:49,984
Decision about

615
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,752
Call Bill

616
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,288
They wanted to be architect

617
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,848
And that's why most of them

618
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,384
So bad but anyway

619
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:57,664
Prejudice

620
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:03,552
But what we're talking about is structure.

Radiotopia

00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:16,352
Before we go I want to tell you about the body Genie

623
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,192
Series from Bello radiotopia show the truth

624
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,984
The body genius is a dark

625
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,008
Comic mystery

626
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:24,288

What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

632
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:42,464
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like

636
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:53,216
Nothing

Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

640
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,552
Even worse

641
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:10,624
The cops think that I had something to do with it

642
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,904
Now

643
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,952
I need to clear my name

644
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:15,488
