I'm Roman Mars

26
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:34,208
In the Bay area where I live for a couple of decades now

27
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:37,792
I watch the front line of gentrification move further and further east

28
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:41,376
This show is based in Oakland As you probably know

29
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:45,728
In Oakland quite big and heterogeneous so you can definitely talk about it as one thing

30
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,544
The last couple years rents have been going up

31
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:54,432
In the fear is that rents will continue to go up to a point where only wealthy Tech workers can afford it

32
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:57,504
This phenomenon is not unique to the Bay

33
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:02,368
East New York a residential neighborhood on the Eastern edge of Brooklyn is going through this now too

34
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:08,256
In the 1960s East New York rapidly transform from Mostly white working-class neighborhood

35
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:14,656
Do an underserved community of mostly black and brown New Yorkers neglected by both society and policy

36
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,728
But now as New York City rent Skyrocket

37
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:23,872
East New York is staring down a wave of identification that will forever change the character of this neighborhood

38
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:26,944
At 120 thousand people call home

39
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:33,344
WNYC in New York and the nation magazine have teamed up for an in-depth look at the gentrification of

40
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,392
Brooklyn they called her series

41
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,928
There goes the neighborhood

42
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,048
Today we're showcasing an episode from this ongoing series that we leave fantastic

43
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:44,864
It turns back the clock and looks at how this new

44
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,936
Rather unlikely hotspot for justification

45
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,472
Got to where it is today

46
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:52,800
This is episode 3 of there goes the neighborhood

47
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:53,568

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,224
How to make a latte

50
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:10,720
Other day I was walking in my neighborhood and I saw a black elderly gentleman

51
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:16,608
That I haven't seen in a couple months and he literally his eyes who opens that you're still here

52
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,912
And I wait yeah

53
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,448
And you're still here

54
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,752
Things have changed happened today

55
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,288
And we were like yeah

56
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:27,360
Black folks are disappearing

57
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:39,136
System fenomenon everybody sees everybody feels

58
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:42,464
But somehow isn't in the center of the discussion where it needs to be

59
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:45,024
I'm of course talking about gentrification

60
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:51,680
When everybody gave up on the neighborhood we didn't we stood in the neighborhood

61
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,216
We worked it out

62
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:59,616
And we made it the better place that everybody wants to invest into now we live on Bobby

63
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:02,944
We all there for you.

64
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:09,600
They have also the political power to modify think they can go and sit with Commissioners in with Highway

65
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:16,000
People and say I need an extra block

66
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:28,799
All I see is overpopulation the city with others the only ones that can afford this rent is people that's not from

67
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:35,199
New York gay and my income doesn't even give enough for a room in East New York was going to give me for apartment

68
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:41,599
Craigslist

69
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:44,927
The neighborhood

70
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:53,375
I'm Thai right and I'm an editor at the nation magazine and my WNYC colleagues and I have been looking at this major dim

71
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,679
Demographic change that happening all over Brooklyn

72
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:58,495
Gentrification is one term that supplied

73
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:03,359
A lot of people who are sick of hearing that term feel like hay

74
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,407
This is just the law Supply Adam

75
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:09,759
Is relatively cheap property available and all things being equal

76
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,551
The people who can afford it grab it

77
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:14,623
And the people who had it earlier they reap the rewards

78
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:18,207
But all things are not equal they never have been

79
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,231
Four-decade

80
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:22,815
Public policy stack the deck of Economic Opportunity against black

81
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,911
Writer Tallahassee Coates has spoken a lot about this fact late

82
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:29,471
And making his case for economic reparation

83
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:33,311
Give me the link to gentrification succinctly during a recent talk in Brooklyn

84
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,871
Change all the time

85
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:38,431
Indian makeup in the ethnic makeup

86
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,711
The problem is

87
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:45,855
Black people don't really have the same level of self-determination to decide whether they want to stay and whether they want to leave

88
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,927
When we built the middle class in this country

89
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,255
We made decisions about who was going to

90
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,559
We decided black people were a part of that

91
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:57,375
When we get to the point talking about gentrification

92
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,935
You got to dig deep you got to go further back

93
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:04,031
So today we take a long look back at

94
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:04,799
East New York

95
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:08,639
The Brooklyn neighborhood that Ed we started exploring last time

96
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:11,711
Is now standing right in the path of gentrification

97
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:20,671
The first developer to set his sights on East New York

98
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,695
Colonel John

99
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:24,255
Way back in 1835

100
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:29,631
Family got rich on cotton and slaves but went broke in the cotton crash of 1837

101
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:33,983
It was like 2008 but back then the bubble was cotton nuts of my mortgages

102
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,287
Anyway Picton losses shirt

103
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,567
Crash butt

104
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:40,383
Not before launching this neighborhood into existence

105
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,431
Bought a bunch of farmland

106
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,991
Milton shoe factory and called it East New York

107
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,807
Brooklyn's famous Pitkin Avenue still Bears his name

108
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:53,439
The Long Island Railroad came about a year later and with it factories to process food from Long Island

109
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,207
Fart

110
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:58,047
The low-rise Housing Authority find the area Skyline came next

111
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,583
Denver rail line

112
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:03,423
Connecting the area to Manhattan and the rest of Brooklyn and it just kept growing

113
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,727
All the way through the middle of the 20th century

114
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,519
East New York became

115
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:11,359
A thriving suburb for the European immigrants who worked at all those factories

116
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,383
German

117
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,711
Dalian eventually Jewish families came here to feel well

118
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:16,991
Successful

119
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,015
An American

120
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:19,295
It was

121
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,087
Go to the suburbs in the city

122
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,111
The place where

123
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,903
People strive to go

124
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,183
That's Ron Shipman

125
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:30,047
A community organizer an urban planner has been fighting the development Warriors and Brooklyn since the

126
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:35,679
Grew up in Westchester but spent a lot of time in East New York is a high school kid in v

127
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:39,519
My First Girlfriend actually was in East New York

128
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,287
Travel from

129
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,359
Lower Westchester County to meet her at the

130
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:47,455
The long commute commute.

131
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,247
Daughter of a judge lived in

132
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,271
East New York

133
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,831
He paints and almost Norman Rockwell portrait of the

134
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,927
It was attached housing but everybody had their own porch and it was a

135
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,463
Is a middle-income

136
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:00,767
Upper-middle-income community in many ways

137
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,303
Aspiring community

138
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,327
It was not

139
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:04,607
What we

140
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,631
Think of today

141
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,167
It was a white Cami

142
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,447
And then

143
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,983
All of a sudden it wasn't

144
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:13,823
Over the course of just four or five years the neighborhood changed

145
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,591
Dramatic

146
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,127
From middle-class

147
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:16,895
Sapore

148
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:19,455
From largely white to nearly all black

149
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:23,039
In 1960 East New York with 85% light

150
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,831
By 1966

151
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,879
It was 80% black in Puerto Rico

152
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,415
Why

153
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,719
What created such a star-change

154
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,767
A lot happened really fast

155
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,559
But there was a key moment

156
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:37,119
It happened on a hot summer night

157
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,399
On July 21st

158
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,423
Nineteen

159
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,191
66

160
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:43,007
That's the day 11 year old black boy

161
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:43,775
What shot

162
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,055
Jim O'Grady has

163
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,455
Here's a little hint that East New York was

164
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:55,295
Crimes for racial tension in the summer of 1966

165
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:59,647
Some of its citizens got together and started a little self-help group called

166
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,415
Sponge

167
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02,975
Sponge

168
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:07,071
The society for the prevention of negroes getting everything

169
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,935
Oh 1966

170
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,751
Of course the group was whites only

171
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:19,871
Its members part of the 20% of the neighborhood that hadn't become black or Puerto Rican

172
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,919
A neighborhood that is Kai said

173
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,711
Ethnic White indominus

174
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:26,527
Demographically economically culturally

175
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,831
Until as recently as five years

176
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:29,599
Before

177
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,951
Anthony mamina was a teenager when the changes came down

178
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,487
He was born in Tunisia

179
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:36,767
But he's Italian

180
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,839
A lot of the whites in East New York or Italian

181
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,143
I remember where I live

182
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,447
Santa was mostly all white

183
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,495
Anybody cross

184
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,031
Euclid Avenue

185
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,823
Black kid with cross that

186
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,359
They will chase him back there

187
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:54,175
In the beginning it was sort of like playing chicken

188
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,991
The thing was with them was the game

189
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:02,367
Subway in the black kids used to come I think for the same reason you at all

190
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,391
Let's get away

191
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,927
Kids to chases

192
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:10,047
Think about how disorienting it was to be nice New York in the early 1960s

193
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:13,887
If you're white you seen your tight ethnic Enclave

194
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,167
Flooded with newcomers

195
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,703
Your friends are gone

196
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,751
If you're black or Puerto Rican

197
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,543
You're moving in for the affordable rent

198
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,847
Or the American dream of homeownership

199
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:26,175
You might have also migrated from the south to find a job

200
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,711
And Escape segregation

201
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,527
But now these cranky Old-Timers are telling you

202
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:32,063
This ain't your place

203
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,855
And you're probably thinking

204
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,159
Dude if this neighborhood is so wonderful

205
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,719
Why did all the white folks all at once

206
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:40,255
Like a herd of antelope

207
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,535
Move to Long Island

208
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:42,559
I used to

209
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,607
Deliver the year Brooklyn eagle

210
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,655
And when are used to get to Broadway

211
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:50,495
I see one side of the street was black in the other side of street wear

212
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,775
Was right and I couldn't

213
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,543
Understand that

214
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:58,687
Then when I was in junior high we got two black girls and then that was a big thing going on you know

215
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:02,015
I still don't understand it

216
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,831
Then I had a friend of mine live across the

217
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,623
Austrian went down Alabama

218
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,671
And he got beat up

219
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:12,767
For the simple reason you got up and gave a black woman a seat

220
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:16,351
When he came back to Brooklyn

221
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,375
Two black guys

222
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,727
So yeah race relations in the South were obviously not good

223
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,519
But in 1965

224
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:26,079
America was reminded in a big way

225
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,615
They're not going anywhere

226
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,687
This is a network news report from the time

227
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:33,247
August 11th 1965

228
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:37,599
The bloodiest riot in 40 Years of America's troubled begin

229
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:40,927
Los Angeles California the district called what

230
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:45,023
34 persons died 40 million dollars worth of property

231
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:45,791
Destroyed

232
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,839
Almost 4000 are arrested

233
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:53,471
The American Negro The Invisible Man breaks out in a screen look at me look at me

234
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,263
Know me for what I am

235
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,567
Look up a if you can

236
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:04,223
So now it's a year after images of La burning have lit up American TV screen

237
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,527
Is the start of the summer of nineteen

238
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,295
66

239
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,343
And every major city is wondering

240
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,391
Could the Watts Riot happen

241
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,159
Here

242
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,951
New York's new mayor

243
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,231
John Lindsay

244
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:15,999
Fixated

245
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:16,767
Unprevailing

246
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:22,911
Lindsey has been Gathering a national reputation for walking the streets of New York at night without a security detail

247
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,703
Mostly in poor neighborhoods

248
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,239
As a gesture of concern

249
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,567
Here's how he describes the tension in places like

250
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,335
East New York

251
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,151
City governments have been largely absent

252
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,431
From the ghetto

253
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:38,527
Their Chief presence usually has taken the form

254
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,551
Other policemen

255
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,879
And it has been hit on happy life

256
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,695
To be the lone representative

257
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,231
The man

258
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,255
White

259
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,583
And by extension

260
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:54,911
The entire public and private establishments

261
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:58,239
Lindsey's chief of staff was Jake Regal

262
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,519
Who is 26

263
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,287
What's the time

264
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,615
Today he's white haired executive with the real estate Giant

265
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,639
Related company

266
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,919
His office has a

267
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:08,991
Power Brokers view of Columbus Circle where he and I talked

268
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,783
When I emailed kriegel to

269
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,807
The set up the interview

270
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,599
I asked if he remembered

271
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:16,159
Particular incident from that summer of 19 6

272
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:16,927
56

273
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,743
The shooting of an 11 year old black boy

274
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,767
Named Eric

275
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:21,791
Dean

276
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,327
He wrote back

277
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,607
Like it was yes

278
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:29,215
So this instant begins with a conflict overturf

279
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:34,079
The classic Turf Battle of a something called a triangle right below these New York subway station

280
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,383
It's a battle between Italian kids

281
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,151
I've always lived there

282
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,431
This is their turf

283
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,223
And blackheads for newly moving in

284
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:41,503
Shouting match

285
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,343
Is fist fights by all accounts the neighborhood was on the verge of exploding

286
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:49,951
Lindsay decides to go out to East New York which as you know is a long way away

287
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,231
From City Hall

288
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:55,071
Because there's an eruption of violence between the two communities

289
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,095
And

290
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,375
Lindsay and

291
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,911
Three of us race out there

292
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:04,031
And go to a little pizza parlor which is right under the subway station where Lindsay meets with

293
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,055
These kids

294
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,335
Kriegel says

295
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,359
The sit down at

296
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:10,687
Frank's Restaurant on New Lots Avenue goes well enough

297
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:15,295
Except for the group of whites who march by shouting 2 4 6 8

298
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,087
We don't want to integrate

299
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,391
Lindsay leaves around 10 p.m.

300
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,695
And then the explosion happened

301
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:26,303
Accountant the New York Times says about 30 whites from

302
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,095
Sponge remember sponge

303
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:31,167
The society for the prevention of negroes getting everything

304
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:35,263
They start picketing at a traffic Island behind police barricades

305
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,871
A group of black counter-demonstrators form and the groups exchanged words

306
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:43,711
Sponge members burst through the barricades and give Chase

307
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:45,759
The group's don't physically Clash

308
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,295
Put a block away

309
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,575
Near group of blacks

310
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:49,855
A gun goes off

311
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:55,743
A witness later tells a jury that nothing happens for a minute before quote

312
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,279
A little boy stands up

313
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:59,071
And lays down in the gutter

314
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,119
Is Eric Dean

315
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,935
He's taken away by ambulance

316
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,471
Soon.

317
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:11,103
The time says groups of black residents than roam the neighborhood

318
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,639
Some throw garbage cans

319
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,663
Restore Windows

320
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,455
And Bricks at police car

321
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:18,015
The disturbance lasts about 4 hours

322
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:24,671
It's City Hall the next day Maryland Zoo causes AIDS in and ask them who knows East New York

323
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,951
What's going on

324
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,231
Who were the players

325
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:30,559
Jake Riegel says everyone sort of looks at each other

326
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:33,119
Previous Mayors could have gotten these answers

327
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:33,887
Quickly

328
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,423
Because previous mayors

329
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,447
We're Democrats

330
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,727
Lindsey

331
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,751
Is a Republican

332
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:42,847
The city had been run by Democratic Mayors using the Democratic machine

333
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:46,175
So the city wanted to know what was going on in East New York

334
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,199
Call the local disk

335
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:47,967
Calculator

336
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,991
He'll call the lope

337
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:53,343
The clubhouse and that was really the city's branch office in these communities across City

338
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:57,951
Kriegel says this is why today we have Community boards with professional staff

339
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:00,255
The boards existed in 1960

340
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:03,583
But they were voluntary and they were pretty

341
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,351
Sleepy

342
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,423
Lindsay beef up their powers and gave them money

343
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:12,031
So he'd have locals on the ground to talk to when stuff hit the fan

344
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:15,615
Lindsey also oversaw a change in police tactics

345
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:18,431
Bringing the cops into a community early

346
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:20,991
For the afternoon rather than

347
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:27,391
Then 9 tonight to the doctor 7 cops run down the streets in the dark with are scared cuz I don't know where they are the people are scared

348
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,183
To see an army Marching In

349
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,719
Cops come in the daylight

350
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,999
They stand around they talked

351
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:34,815
Two people they get acclimated they see what's around in the people

352
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,375
Crystal says

353
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:39,423
Cops were instructed to leave their nightsticks

354
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,191
At the priest

355
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,471
To not use

356
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:44,031
Forced into not stand on rooftops

357
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:44,799
Smith rifles

358
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,335
Those tax

359
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,103
Helped

360
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,383
Tommy's New York

361
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,175
Besides Eric Dean

362
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:52,991
No one died that summer during public unrest

363
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:56,575
A local black teenager was later charged with the dean shooting

364
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,111
And put on trial

365
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,647
But a jury acquitted him

366
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:00,927
In the end

367
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:03,487
Lindsey managed to keep New York relatively

368
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:06,815
Free from the major fires in fatal racial violence

369
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,607
That ignited around the country

370
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,911
In places like Newark and Detroit

371
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:11,935
And other cities

372
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:16,031
But within a year almost every single white family moves away

373
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,055
From East New York

374
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,591
White flight then

375
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,895
Spread through neighborhoods around the city

376
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:23,199
Especially the outer boroughs

377
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:29,599
But the turf wars between teenagers were just one symptom of Allah

378
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:35,999
Larger process that was unfolding whites and blacks were in Conflict but they were being pitted against each other by much

379
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,535
Much larger forces

380
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:44,959
Brooklyn was in the process of absorbing two great migrations Southern blacks coming north

381
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:50,591
In search of industrial jobs and Puerto Ricans fleeing the decimated economy of the island

382
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:53,919
What segregation limited these migrants housing

383
00:17:54,175 --> 00:18:00,319
So black and Puerto Rican neighborhoods like Bed-Stuy in Harlem quickly became overcrowded people begin

384
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:06,719
Desperately searching for places to live and landlords and Real Estate Investors saw opportunity

385
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:12,863
Desperation tactics that have shaped neighborhoods all over the country ever since

386
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,655
Fear induced white flight

387
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,423
Predatory

388
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:19,007
Sell your home as is all cash

389
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,799
At no cost to you

390
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,591
And your home can be sold fast

391
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:23,871
Even if your face

392
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:27,199
30 in the years after World War II

393
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:29,759
In a stretch of tenements on the neighborhoods Western

394
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:33,599
The white families who live there were already frustrated with the landlords

395
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,367
Neglect

396
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,903
Owners want to do the least

397
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,183
Get the most out of the

398
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:40,255
What's something larger was about to

399
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,559
Play out we were very much afraid

400
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,583
A v atomic

401
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:45,887
This is Ron schiffman

402
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:48,447
Urban planner has been working in central Brooklyn

403
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:52,287
And that's right he said that atom bomb

404
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,335
The fear during the Cold War

405
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,359
Herniated America

406
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,663
Coming out of World War II

407
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:00,735
The policy of the federal government was to disperse

408
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,271
Essential population

409
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:06,367
To allow people to move out of the cities to allow Manufacturing

410
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:09,183
An essential Industries to move out of the city

411
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,231
So why tenants were giving it out

412
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:18,143
The FED begins subsidizing mortgages and highways and what became a wildly successful effort to create a new class

413
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,167
Suburban homeowner

414
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,215
But only for those

415
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:22,239
Essential pop

416
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,287
Essential populations

417
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:26,335
Were considered to be white and educate

418
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,615
And wealthy

419
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:34,271
And all of the major real estate Lobby groups advocated for restricting black buyers from the loans and neighborhoods that our

420
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,295
How much dollars final

421
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,343
Annies New York

422
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,903
White ranger seized upon the chance to buy home

423
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,975
And the landlords were happy to see them go

424
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:44,511
They got a pain in the butt

425
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:47,327
And now they're all of these black and Puerto Rican renters

426
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,887
Face the housing shortage and could be priced

427
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,191
But it didn't stop there

428
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:56,287
The real opportunity that segregation offer for Real Estate speculators

429
00:19:56,543 --> 00:20:01,663
Wasn't flipping the houses the East New York's Italian and German and Jewish immigrants had owned for years

430
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,967
But to make a profit off of that

431
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:06,271
They had to get those white homeowners to

432
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,551
Sell for cheap

433
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:11,135
People would come in literally and hire somebody

434
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:14,207
To go out on the street and get into a fight in front of your house

435
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:21,119
All right to scare you from leaving what you feel like there's violence in the neighborhood even pamphlets put out

436
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,399
That work

437
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,447
Attributed to black people

438
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,471
When you read this

439
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:32,127
It was obviously written by a white pretending to be so

440
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,151
Because of this

441
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,687
Or something or other

442
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,711
It was scared

443
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,479
Dick's going on

444
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:43,391
There were people coming in and basically saying that if you don't sell you're going to lose the value of your home

445
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:45,951
It would just show up and knock on the door and say hey

446
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:50,047
They went and solicited door-to-door knocked on their door

447
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,071
In a way saying

448
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:55,679
We're willing to buy your house for all cash today you may not get this tomorrow

449
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,471
What we now think of as

450
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,239
White flight

451
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,007
Guarantees

452
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:01,823
I remember one

453
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:04,383
One person she had a house up

454
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,663
Forbell Street

455
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,199
Again Tony momina

456
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:10,271
They came one day has started want to sell

457
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,295
She says no

458
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:14,111
Making the next day you want to sell

459
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,135
That's no

460
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,208
After about a week

461
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,000
Pick it up in the morning

462
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:22,048
And the front doors on a floor

463
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,120
A little something to focus the woman's mind on the offer

464
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,912
The next day the buyers were

465
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,008
Since you want to tell him now it said they took the Money and Run

466
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,544
This is blocked

467
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:33,568
And it work

468
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,616
Well Teenspot in the streets

469
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,408
The parents fought over proper

470
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:39,200
And the blockbusting

471
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,992
Set up a next stage in the process

472
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:41,760
Test for Real Estate

473
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,552
Predatory lending

474
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:46,624
They set up these fast foreclosure scheme

475
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:50,208
Where they would buy cheap from the white families

476
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,256
Resell it at a higher price

477
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:55,072
Two African American and Latino families

478
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:59,168
The aspiring black or Latino homeowner would sign a contract with the investor

479
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:03,520
The arrangement would look a lot like those rent-to-own deals on appliances

480
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,568
To be on the hook for

481
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,592
Way too much money

482
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,128
More than they can afford

483
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,664
And more than the house were

484
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:13,504
After two to three months they couldn't make that payment

485
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:15,808
So they finally move to evict them

486
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:20,160
I'm within a year or two they be evicted them and they had the housing back

487
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,464
In their own hands and sold them again

488
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,000
So they turned these buildings

489
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:30,400
Where are you talking about the sixties are the early 2000s that are foreclosure crisis that sounds very similar to the

490
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:32,448
It was very similar

491
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,984
Throughout all of this

492
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,520
Racial tensions of course emerge

493
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:39,104
They always blamed each other for what happened

494
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:43,200
Primarily the white families blame the blacks moved into the neighborhood

495
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:48,832
For the abandonment and the decay of the neighborhood when it was really the real estate manipulation going on behind

496
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:49,600
Mercedes

497
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:51,648
This played out in fight between Tina

498
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,696
Does fights blossom in the Gang

499
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:58,048
The Summers of 1966 and 67 were marred by console

500
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,584
And then

501
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,352
Teen got shot in

502
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:03,168
By the end of 1967

503
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,472
Broad swath of East New York where is much

504
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,752
If 97%

505
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:07,520
Black and Puerto

506
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:10,080
Today Tony is in the same house

507
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:12,384
But he says he can count the other whites in the

508
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,408
Surrounding area on

509
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,176
One hand

510
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,456
Do you watch them

511
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:16,736
One after another

512
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:20,576
Eat at the Howard Beach show out to Long Island

513
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,904
I don't know if people have a picture better

514
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,928
Then where I am

515
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,000
The whole thing is

516
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:28,768
They have the name

517
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:29,536
I would be

518
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,840
A lot of people are afraid

519
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:33,120
Chase New York

520
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:34,144
When somebody ask

521
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,680
Atomix New York

522
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,448
Proud of it

523
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:40,032
That pride is not a small matter when it comes to neighbor

524
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:40,800
Development

525
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:43,360
The decades after Eric Dean was killed when

526
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,640
Public and private investor

527
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:45,664
Drained out of the play

528
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:51,040
The real difference between the dark stereotypes of East New York and the reality of community

529
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,064
I've been residence

530
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:52,832
Shear wall

531
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:56,160
Tony retired from driving delivery trucks

532
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,184
33 years ago

533
00:23:57,696 --> 00:24:01,024
He spent most of that time volunteering at Cypress Hills Local development

534
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,096
He's been part of dozens of an issue

535
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:06,144
From Watchdog in the local police

536
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:06,912
Precinct

537
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:07,936
Working with banks

538
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:08,704
Define building

539
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:10,240
And he's not alone

540
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:12,288
Harold green and his wife moved here in 90

541
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,080
When they bought a house

542
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,360
Up on the hill by Highland

543
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,408
What is still one of the tone of your part

544
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,200
It was

545
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,224
Nice

546
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:22,784
It was very nice it was very quiet

547
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:23,808
It was

548
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:27,136
Transportation accessible

549

And the price

550
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:35,584
The price was on very affordable at the time and we have a nice two family house

551
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,424

He's the board chair

563

You have to do for your community because no one else would do for you

569
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,408
And now like most other property owners here

570
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,224
He's got mixed feelings about the city's plan to

571
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,248
Spur more development

572
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:28,064
He's more than happy to see the new resource

573
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:30,112
And even eager to see new people

574
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,648

00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:42,912
Position ourselves

582
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,192
How to get the best results

583
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,216
What's the best response

584
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:46,752
Ministration

585
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:47,776

596

But what am I going to do that

600
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:19,008

It comes up with the demographic shifts

Bongs and chatter of our devices
