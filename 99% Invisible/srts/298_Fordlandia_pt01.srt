This is 99% invisible

23
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,864
I'm Roman Mars

24
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,776
In the late 1920s the Ford motor company bought up millions of acres of land in Brazil

25
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:21,408
They loaded boats with machinery and supplies and ship them deep into the Amazon rainforest

26
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,064
Workers cut down trees and clear the land and then they built a rubber Plantation in the middle of one of the Wild

27
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,344
Places on Earth

28
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:34,464
Orange rubber development on the river is an Enterprise of historic proportions

29
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:40,352
Acres of jungle are being converted into a highly modernized Plantation

30
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:43,424
Capable of producing rubber on a large scale

31
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:47,264
The plan was to harvest the Rubber and ship it back to Detroit

32
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,824
It would be turned into tires and other parts

33
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,848
Scoreboard cars

34
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,128
The Henry Ford

35
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:54,176
One of this community what she called

36
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,200
Fordlandia

37
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:57,760
To be more than just a huge Plantation

38
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:00,832
He wanted it to be a kind of industrial Utopia

39
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:03,392
He paid his Brazilian workers good wages

40
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,416
At least for the region

41
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:06,464
We tried to build them the kind of place

42
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,000
He would have loved to laugh

43
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,280
Which is to say

44
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:11,072
A small Midwestern town

45
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,376
But in the middle of the jungle

46
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:17,728
Deep in the wilderness this model community of self-sufficient

47
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,800
Has its own Powerhouse electric lighting

48
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,080
Telephone system

49
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:25,664
Phone machine shop completely equipped with modern tools

50
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:30,272
Laboratory for processing Rubber and ice plant in the fire depart

51
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:34,112
Go to church you had Hospital leave at a power plant

52
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:36,928
You have a big Sawmill that's Rodger Webber

53
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:39,744
Who's the host of a podcast called mismatch

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,840
And the story is meditation of one that recently aired on his show

55
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:44,864
And so he wanted to

56
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,632
Who creates

57
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,400
This

58
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,168
Village

59
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:49,472
For the workers down in fordlandia

60
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:54,080
And well it's easy to look at him as some greedy imperialist

61
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,872
Capitalist very easy

62
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,408
He actually felt that he could help

63
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:02,272
These people

64
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:05,088
Provides free medical aid for the employees

65
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,648
Later than outdoor luncheon is served

66
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,696
Followed by tempting Delicacies

67
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:11,744
Then comes the afternoon round of golf

68
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,840
Play it on the plantation links against a beautiful jungle backdrop

69
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:20,448
Today the Ford plantation is a successful Enterprise

70
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,752
A tribute to skill in science

71
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:25,824
The new weapons of the 20th century pioneer

72
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:30,944
But the reality is that fordlandia was not a successful Enterprise

73
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,272
Nor was it really a tribute to skill and science

74
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,808
It was a colossal

75
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:38,112
Expensive and tragic mistake

76
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:41,184
It took Henry Ford nearly two decades

77
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:41,952
To give up on

78
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,864
It's a parable of arrogance but the arrogance isn't that Ford thought he couldn't aim and conquer the Amazon

79
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,632
Greg Grandin

80
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:54,752
He had his sights on something actually much bigger he thought he could tame and Conquer capitalist

81
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:56,288
Industrial capitalism

82
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:01,408
Ford wanted to export his brand of industrial paternalism to the Amazon

83
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,688
Hey workers well

84
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,224
And provide services

85
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,808
So that they stayed healthy productive and most importantly

86
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,344
Loyal to the company

87
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,136
And and that didn't have

88
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,744
In the early 1900s

89
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,071
It's a couple of decades before Ford set out to build fordlandia

90
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,887
A massive shift was underway in the rubber industry

91
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:25,471
4 years Brazil have been the world's main supplier

92
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:29,311
Rubber pretty much all of the Rebel with the one at some bicycles at 1

93
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,335
The condoms that

94
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,383
Gaskets

95
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,151
The valves

96
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,687
Winter tires

97
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,479
All came from Brazil

98
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,807
And the way rubber was cultivated was very labour-intensive

99
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,879
Rubber tappers would go out into the dense jungle

100
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,159
And find rubber trees

101
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:47,743
They would slash the trees and then they would extract the latex

102
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,279
The floor on the side of the trees

103
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,071
They would boil

104
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,119
Innocence this Milky

105
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,167
Fluid and turn it into

106
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,215
A large balls of rubber

107
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,239
Which they would then

108
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,775
You try to sell

109
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:06,175
Passing it on this kind of very decentralised chained up until it wound up in warehouses

110
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,455
Manchester

111
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,991
Warren Detroit

112
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:13,599
Rubber stoppers would work part of the Year tapping Rubber and they were part of the year

113
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,367
Growing

114
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,927
Other sustenance crops in order to survive

115
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,463
This is the economy

116
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:21,279
Lasted four years in in Brazil

117
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:26,399
But this economy could be brutal for workers at the bottom of the production chain

118
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:29,983
As rubber plantations grew they struggled to find enough workers

119
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:35,615
Some robber barons started enslaving indigenous people in forcing them to tap trees

120
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:39,199
Even the workers that were being paid didn't make very much

121
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,991
The so-called latex Laura.

122
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:43,295
Set the top ruin normally wealthy

123
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:47,391
Living in palatial homes in gilded cities in the jungle

124
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:53,791
This system all started to change because of a British Explorer named Henry Wickham

125
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:56,863
He come to Brazil to seek his fortune in the Amazon

126
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,423
And then in 1876

127
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,447
Henry Wickham

128
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:02,495
Managed to steal

129
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,287
Thousands of rubber plant

130
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:09,663
And he sent them back to England and eventually they want to the English colonies

131
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:12,735
It was technically no law at the time preventing the X

132
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:13,759
Sport of the seeds

133
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:16,831
Wickham had applied for an export license under false

134
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:17,599
Pretenses

135
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,903
He smuggled be tens of thousands of

136
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,975
The seeds back to England in the hold of a steamship

137
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:26,047
Each seed was about three quarters of an inch long

138
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,583
Is entire seed cash

139
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,631
Weight over 1000 lbs

140
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,935
He may not have known it at the time

141
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:34,239
But his act of Bio piracy

142
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,799
Would totally transform the rubber tray

143
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:45,247
From England Wickham's rubber seeds travel to various European colonies like Malaysia Sri Lanka and Indonesia

144
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,039
The trees thrive

145
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:53,439
Tropical environments where no blight or bugs had evolved to eat them Growers set up plan

146
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:59,839
Plantations with rubber trees planted in dense rows and these new Colonial plantations ended up

147
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:02,911
Possibly outperforming the traditional Brazilian rubber Tapper

148
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:10,335
Say run 1910 Brazil head by that we're pretty much lost its control over the

149
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,103
Rubber industry

150
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:16,223
Meanwhile the new European robber barons were talking about setting up a kind of cartel

151
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,783
Danelle dominated the global rubber trade

152
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,599
And they realize that meant they could set it prices

153
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:25,439
Which made a certain American industrialists control freak

154
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,975
Extremely nervous

155
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,023
Henry Ford was used to controlling

156
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:29,791
Everything

157
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:33,375
Will the Ford Motor Company in the in the 1920s pretty much

158
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,399
Controlled

159
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,935
Nearly every

160
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,215
Raw material

161
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,775
That went into the making of a motor car

162
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:43,615
Glass supply in the wood Lumber

163
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,407
Everything separate

164
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:50,527
This looming European control rubber cartel represented a big threat

165
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,063
A rubber prices went up

166
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,647
It could make the tires and gaskets and Tube is more expensive

167
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,719
2 Ford wanted to create his own rubber Supply

168
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:02,303
What is problem is that rubber doesn't grow in the US

169
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:06,399
So Not only was Henry Ford vulnerable bit but Brazil was vulnerable

170
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:11,263
That's why the nation of Brazil basically gave him this huge

171
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:15,359
Tract of land about the size of Connecticut to try to start his

172
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,407
Rubber plant

173
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,967
Brazil was placing a big bet

174
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,295
The betting on Henry Ford wasn't the worst idea

175
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:26,111
You look at a guy like Henry Ford and all he had achieved

176
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,415
With the Model T

177
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,207
The $5 day wage

178
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,255
They're looking at a real opportunity

179
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:35,071
And who better than Henry Ford to come down there and then

180
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,863
Restore the former glory

181
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,631
Of

182
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,423
How controlling the rubber Market

183
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,007
It was a boondoggle from from the very beginning

184
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:47,103
Ford Company shipped in supplies on the top of ghost River

185
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:51,199
They brought in American managers and hired a Brazilian Workforce

186
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:54,015
Then they started clearing the land to build

187
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,039
Portlandia

188
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:58,879
The jungle courses is just a very challenging

189
00:08:59,135 --> 00:08:59,647
Place

190
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,927
And right away

191
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:04,255
Things started to go wrong you have four

192
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,815
Example the workers were trying to clear the land

193
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,375
Baby working out their bare chested

194
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:12,191
And would be suddenly covered with biting ants

195
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:19,103
Hornets and scorpions in even worse they would reach in and suddenly a pit viper

196
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:19,871
Pepperwood bites

197
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:20,895
The Man Killer's

198
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:26,527
So they were they were dealing with a life-and-death struggle year

199
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:32,159
Eventually the workers managed to clear the land and build a town in the middle of the rainforest

200
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:35,487
Bored at a very particular vision for this town

201
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:40,607
He wanted it to feel like these small Midwestern Town T associated with his childhood

202
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,143
He grew up on a farm

203
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:44,447
He believed that there was a

204
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,007
A kind of healthy connection between

205
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:50,335
Between Agriculture and Industry

206
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:54,175
Is this crazy as that seems he he saw them kind of intermingling

207
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:55,711
And

208
00:09:56,223 --> 00:10:00,575
He really brought these Boyhood memories of the farm into his adult life

209
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,367
Justice nostalgic

210
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:03,647
Yearning

211
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,439
For a bygone era

212
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:09,279
This Nostalgia was for a very narrow slice of America

213
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:11,583
Small town mostly white in there

214
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,399
That was Ford's model for fordlandia

215
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:18,751
Even though he was importing it into a very different cultural environment

216
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:21,311
When you go to fordlandia there's an uncanniness to

217
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,335
Familiarity

218
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,615
It doesn't seem exotic

219
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,151
Isabel

220
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:28,223
Company event setup plantation-style rubber feel

221
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,783
Lots of trees densely planted

222
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,623
The style of the colonial rubber tree plantations in Southeast Asia

223
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:38,975
They started recruiting even more Brazilian workers from the surrounding areas

224
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:41,535
A lot of them were excited to work for 4

225
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:44,607
Ford was promising something they'd never really had

226
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,631
Free healthcare

227
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:46,911
Free education

228
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:51,519
He wasn't a guy just running roughshod over that area he felt he could improve

229
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,055
The wives of these

230
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:53,823
Workers

231
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,127
And this wasn't just for being benevolent

232
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,663
This was bored being straight

233
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,431
T check

234
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:03,039
Back in the US he discovered a few paid his workers well and let them work reasonable hours

235
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:03,807
If you didn't

236
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,599
Totally exploit them in other words

237
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:08,159
He could dramatically reduce turnover

238
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,207
And that's what he wanted to do in Brazil

239
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:13,279
In a sense they're trying to apply lessons from the factory

240
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,815
To a plantation

241
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,887
That's exactly what they're trying to do that's Matt Anderson

242
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:20,703
The Henry Ford museum being interviewed by Rodger

243
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,007
Try to run a plantation in South

244
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:23,775
America

245
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,311
As though it were

246
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,103
Industrial facility here in the Midwest

247
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:30,175
I'm bringing the time clock had to workers work 8-hour shifts

248
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,223
Clock on clock off Fiserv

249
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,759
Cafeteria style

250
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,551
Set for the world so forbidding

251
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:36,831
What he was trying to

252
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,903
Part of the problem for cultural

253
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:44,511
Neil people down there were used to living a different way they were not used to the 8 hours a day

254
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,815
The factory clock ship that were used

255
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,583
Usher and Yuna

256
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,351
United States

257
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,399
And part of that we would very good reason

258
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:53,983
The climate there is very different there just 250 miles or so from the equator

259
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,543
Temperatures routinely get well over a hundred degrees

260
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,615
He's during the heat of the day they were used to going into work

261
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,895
In the early morning hours

262
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:04,479
Before the Qibla kicked up taking a break for several hours in the middle of the day

263
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,271
Me coming back at the end of the day today

264
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:19,839
Started to become clear back in the state for that created an industrial system will workers connect before

265
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:26,239
Where to buy the products they made but in the Amazon there wasn't really that much to buy

266
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:29,823
Society within the Amazon so they didn't actually need

267
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:36,223
The high wages that Ford was promising they would work a few weeks or a few months and then they would disappear and they would go

268
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:41,343
Go back into into into into the jungle to to to work that plots to 2

269
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:44,671
Produce their own food and maybe they come back the following year

270
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:49,279
And this would this would drive the Ford managers mad

271
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,863
Solve the problem of turnover in Detroit

272
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:58,495
And the problem of turnover in the in the middle of the Amazon at the top of his River just

273
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,775
Proved insurmountable

274
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:04,639
The cultural disconnect also went beyond just work.

275
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:10,271
Henry Ford and very particular ideas about how Society should be arranged

276
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:12,319
And what people should enjoy

277
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,343
For example

278
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,623
He loved square dancing

279
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,927
He met his wife Clara at a square dance

280
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,719
And so he figured well

281
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:23,583
We got this big hole down there and in fordland and so let's play some square dancing

282
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:24,607
Music

283
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:25,887
A dress pattern

284
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:31,007
Surprised you know it wasn't all that popular down there who would have thought

285
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,799
Ford was also a teetotaler

286
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,359
So even though drinking was legal in Brazil

287
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,663
Gibbeted alcohol in Portlandia

288
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:40,479
Again you have Henry Ford trying to

289
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:43,551
Impose his will thinking will it works for us in America

290
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:46,879
Although a lot of Americans of the time didn't think the prohibition work

291
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,671
But he was

292
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:51,231
By golly he was going to make it work in Brazil

293
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,791
Ed couples balance board

294
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:56,863
It turns out he wasn't going to make it work in Brazil

295
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:01,983
Some Savvy entrepreneurs set up a bar and brothel on a little island near fordland

296
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,263
They called it

297
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,799
The island of Innocence

298
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,615
Fred Couples ladies Jane

299
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:11,199
And they were technically outside a Ford sovereignty of Fords

300
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:15,807
Control when they couldn't do anything to stop it

301
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,159
And then there was the food

302
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,951
Henry Ford was a vegetarian

303
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:24,255
Can an early advocate of healthy eating

304
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,303
And so he wanted them to eat

305
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:30,143
Whole wheat products and he just felt that this was going to be better for their health

306
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,191
This actually LED

307
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:32,959
To a riot

308
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,519
What happened in 1930

309
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:40,127
Workers resented having to eat the exact kind of food that Henry Ford told them to

310
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,919
But the other problem was that

311
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:44,735
It initially serve lunch the workers restaurant-style

312
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:45,503
With Waiters

313
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,295
Open somebody got the idea

314
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,087
What should we have the assembly line

315
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,367
In the

316
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,159
The United States so

317
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,207
What's helped them eat cafeteria style

318
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,487
What's more efficient weekend

319
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:57,023
Keep track of things well

320
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,303
The workers

321
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,351
Absolutely hated that approach

322
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,399
They felt like they were

323
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,935
Being treated like cogs in a

324
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,263
In a wheel and suddenly went on a rampage

325
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,311
And the town was was

326
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:12,895
Practically destroy that one of the first targets where the time

327
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,687
Which they smashed to pieces

328
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:18,783
Yes the managers actively write the manager said to flee on boats and

329
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,319
And intelligent

330
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,111
Because of because of the fury of

331
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:22,879
What is uprising

332
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:26,463
End and it was the time was eventually retaken with the help of

333
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,487
Brazilian security

334
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:31,327
And and then rather than give up Ford recommitted

335
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:34,911
Port even more money into enter trying to realize

336
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,447
This Midwestern ideal

337
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:42,335
At this point forward was only a few years into this Portlandia experiment

338
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,871
And it wasn't paying off

339
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,407
The company dust cap

340
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,455
Money it's the Rubber Plantation

341
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:51,295
Brandon said there always seemed to be a way to justify the project

342
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:56,415
In the 1920s it was going to be a symbol of what industrial capitalism

343
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,439
Bring

344
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,743
Took of the Backwater of the Amazon

345
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:00,511
In the 90

346
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,047
Dirty's during the Depression to be

347
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:04,863
Becomes a symbol of how to survive the downturn

348
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,143
Amazon

349
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,679
Who was going to say no

350
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,703
Henry Ford

351
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:13,055
No one really had the gumption the determination that this

352
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:15,871
Bravery perhaps the challenge for dummies big decision

353
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:16,639
Because

354
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:22,527
Yeah he was a tough fellow more and more as the years went by he got set in his ways and that was it his word was

355
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,807
What is going to happen

356
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,927
But fordlandia was up against insurmountable challenges

357
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,463
More than the time

358
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,999
More than the square dance

359
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,303
More than the way meals were served

360
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,839
The real problem

361
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:36,863
Was Boggs

362
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:37,887
The insect

363
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:38,911
Fungi

364
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:41,983
That were the rubber trees natural predators in the Amazon

365
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:48,639
Ford hadn't really bother to learn anything about botany or Agronomy before embarking on his fordlandia

366
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,407
The experiment

367
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,455
He didn't trust the expert

368
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:52,735
I could have warned them

369
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:53,759
What he was getting into

370
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,807
In fact he didn't trust

371
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:56,831
Experts at all

372
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:59,135
Kingdom and the idea of

373
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:01,183
Exports of slowing

374
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:03,487
The progress of of an idea

375
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:06,815
And his experience they could go to the factory floor

376
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:11,679
And maybe they had a problem with a widget or a wagon and they would have trial and error

377
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,471
And they would just figure it out

378
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,775
Need some

379
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,055
Buddy with the title

380
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,615
Or an education and some specialty

381
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,895
Need to tell them what to do

382
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,943
That was part of the problem with this that I thing

383
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,015
Ford bought into his own kind of invincibility is own price

384
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,039
If you will think Unity

385
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,575
You could just go down there and take

386
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,599
This kind of rock

387
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,623
Jungle in

388
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:33,695
Turn it into an industrial Enterprise Al working industrial Enterprise

389
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,999
And I think his

390
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,303
His eyes were bigger than his stomach soda

391
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,839
Because Ambitions got ahead of his

392
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:40,607
Disabilities

393
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,911
Because he wasn't willing to listen to

394
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:45,215
The experts wasn't willing to bring them on board

395
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:46,495
He was in

396
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,543
Far far to DP over his head

397
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:54,687
The problem was that rubber trees have never grown in the Amazon in the way that the Ford company with trying to grow them

398
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:58,271
Intense plantations with trees planted in Tyro

399
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:02,879
This growing style might have worked in the Southeast Asian plantations run by European

400
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:05,951
That's because the bugs there hadn't evolved to eat rubber trees

401
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:09,535
In Brazil this density ended up creating an environment

402
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,095
Were Native bugs that fed on rubber trees

403
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:12,863
Thrive

404
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,191
What Ford was basically doing with building a giant incubator

405
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,727
In which

406
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:20,543
Which year did the bugs and the

407
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,615
Blade and the fungi that feed off of rubber

408
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:27,967
Was able to grow exponentially because the trees will close together

409
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,271
For example there were these caterpillar

410
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,319
We're very fond of rubber tree

411
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,367
One of the predators of a caterpillar

412
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:37,695
Spray tan

413
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,743
Chipotle near me

414
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,791
The managers would send out

415
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:43,583
Battalions of workers to

416
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,863
Pek the caterpillar

417
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:51,775
Play even gathered all the caterpillars together and end in in buckets and then pulled them together and then had a huge bonfire

418
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:54,079
But within a few years guess what happen

419
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,639
It wouldn't the caterpillars Warren actually

420
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:01,759
Eating the leaves from the bottom they will leave from the top

421
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,575
You couldn't actually see them and so therefore you couldn't pick them

422
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:07,647
Again and again they replanted the trees

423
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,439
I need to have them killed off bypass

424
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:16,095
This went on for years and then decades

425
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:21,471
It wasn't until 1945 the Ford finally decided to shut down fordlandia

426
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:25,311
That point Henry Ford had turn the company over to his grandson

427
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,847
In fordlandia with a

428
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,639
And within a few months

429
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:31,455
He sold it back to the Brazilian government

430
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:35,807
For like $250,000 and then it was over

431
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,671
Henry Ford died a couple years later

432
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:43,231
And after all the money and time invested

433
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,255
Weirdly

434
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:46,303
He never even visited for Atlanta

435
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,351
He orchestrated all of it

436
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,887
Right down to the square dances

437
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:52,447
I miss home thousands of miles away

438
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,215
In Michigan

439
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:56,031
You're part of it maybe he was just afraid of going and

440
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:56,799
Qingdao

441
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,335
Tell you there in person so dusty

442
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,639
I was reading the reports the memos

443
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:04,735
Knew what was happening or what wasn't having the fordlandia surprised you didn't want to

444
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,015
Reckon with it personally

445
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:17,279
Fordlandia is still a town today

446
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:20,095
And although a lot of the old buildings are now falling down

447
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:22,143
People continue to live there

448
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,959
Is Dwayne Greg Grandin has visited twice

449
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:27,263
That's two times more than Henry Ford ever did

450
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,543
For those of you keeping count

451
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:32,895
Brandon made the day and a half long trip up the top of those River by boat

452
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:37,759
You just turn you just come around the bank and then all of a sudden you see this enormous

453
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,319
Enormous saltwater tank

454
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,879
Back in the day

455
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,159
The word Ford was

456
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,183
Written on the wall

457
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,719
The tank and end

458
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:52,095
And you could see the outlines of what was fordlandia is still there it's now

459
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,887
Brazilians are moved in

460
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,423
And taking over all of the houses

461
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:57,471
But you still get a sense of what

462
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,239
Look like

463
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,031
In the 1920s in 90

464
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:00,799
In thirties

465
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,615
Salinas casa

466
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,895
Emma Frost

467
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:07,199
My house is very close

468
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:10,015
From my house we can see the water tower

469
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:14,879
It's Antojitos Sosa and she's lived in fordlandia since 2009

470
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,159
Jim Kimball missing

471
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,208
Blessings kilometer

472
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:19,232
We can see it

473
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,768
Water Tower

474
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:21,536
Beautiful

475
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,840
It's historic it's a wonderful

476
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:33,056
There aren't many jobs left in the area for the 2002 habitants of fordlandia

477
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:38,432
Most of the economy in the region now revolves around industrial soybean production and cattle ranch

478
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,992
There's a little bit of Tourism to

479
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:43,296
Which people like Sosa counselor

480
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,344
She works at a hotel in town

481
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,464
We receive people from all countries

482
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:55,328
They search for the history they are curious to see in person

483
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,608
History

484
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:57,888
What is left

485
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:00,192
There are few things yet

486
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:01,728
He comes to the Village

487
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,008
The big houses

488
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:05,056
Cool the symmetry

489
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,080
The hospital

490
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,384
Hospital

491
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,712
People come to see what's left of Fords

492
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,736
Crazy vision

493
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:16,320
American style town in the middle of the Brazilian jungle

494
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:19,904
Be culturally insensitive and paternalistic boondoggle

495
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,440
For all its faults

496
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:23,744
Still created good paying jobs

497
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,512
Sports workers

498
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,816
424 flight

499
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:32,448
Henry Ford was very audacious at the time

500
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,752
2 best of Fortune in Brazil

501
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:36,032
In a foreign land

502
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,336
I think he's very interesting

503
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,872
Sebaceous

504
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:41,920
Americans are bear like this

505
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,712
It was school he did that

506
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:47,808
As a time he created a lot of jobs for Brazilians

507
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:50,112
People from all over Brazil

508
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:53,696
Migrated to here looking for a job

509
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,328
So is it wasn't there to see all the ways fordlandia went wrong

510
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,680
Bird the history represents a time when this sleepy town was the focus

511
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:05,216
Of a massive experiment

512
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:07,520
Buy world famous industrialist

513
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:10,080
Now with its crumbling old buildings

514
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:15,968
Portlandia is a different kind of Lost Civilization than you'd expect to find in the middle of the Amazon

515
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,248
The Midwest

516
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,016
Fantasyland

517
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:22,368
Returning to the Jungle

518
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,072
Do you know I host introduce another show

519
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:35,424
About the Constitution Twitter and Trump and it's actually really fun it's called

520
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,472
What Trump can teach us about con law

521
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:41,056
And this week is the last episode of the second series of that show

522
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,336
And I'm going to talk about it

523
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:44,128
With my co-presenter Elizabeth Joe

524
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:45,152
But after this

525
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:53,088
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices were immersed

526
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:55,648
The cluttered World a man-made sound

527
00:23:56,416 --> 00:24:01,280
If I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexa

528
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:06,656
Is talking to me and my wife is in another room and another room in Brawl hearing.

529
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,960
Voice technology talk to us

530
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:11,264
It is a creation of Sonic trash

531
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:14,080
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

532
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:17,664
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

533
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,712
To make them more human

534
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,808
Turn the living room lights on

535
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:25,344
Okay

536
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,136
Dim the living room lights

537
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:27,904
50%

538
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:29,952
Okay

539
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:36,352
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

540
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:39,168
Makes for a much more natural experience

541
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,216
Turn the living room lights on

542
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,800
Dim the living room lights to 50

543
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:45,568
2%

544
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:52,736
We're presenting to special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

545
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,272
About how are sounds gay

546
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,808
Is impacting our health

547
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:58,112
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

548
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:01,184
Look for them Friday is May 17th and May 24th

549
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:01,952
Right here

550
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,232
NPR

551
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:07,584
We need to talk about something

552
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,144
Constipation abdominal pain and bloating

553
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:16,544
You tell yourself it's not that bad you take laxatives you modify your diet and exercise routine but thinking about it all the time is free

554
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:22,176
Frustrating but doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again

555
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:23,456
And you don't know why

556
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:25,760
Then it may be time to seek help

557
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:28,832
Go to oh my God. Info podcast

558
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:33,952
We can learn more about your symptoms that's oh my God. Info / podcast

559
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:34,976
Oh my God

560
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:35,744
Dot and Bo

561
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,512
Back pocket

562
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:40,352
So I host another radiotopia podcast called

563
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:42,400
What Trump can teach us about con law

564
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:48,544
An idiot I invite over my friend and neighbor Elizabeth Joe to teach me a little about constitutional law

565
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,336
Using tweets from Trump

566
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,360
As a jumping-off point

567
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:52,640
Holbrook sample

568
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,176
The episode coming out this week

569
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:58,272
Starts with Trump's tweet about giving guns to teachers in school

570
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:00,064
And then we use that premise

571
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:02,112
To look at the Fourth Amendment and

572
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:04,416
What it says about the use of deadly force

573
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:05,440
By the government

574
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:07,232
Usually the government employee that would

575
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,768
Potentially use deadly force

576
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:09,536
Is a cop

577
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:10,560
Teacher

578
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,352
But the world has gone crazy

579
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:16,704
Presidents have always pushed against the constitution in different ways to forward their agenda

580
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,264
The reason why Trump is such a good foil for these

581
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,288
Types of hypothetical

582
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,056
Discussions about the

583
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,080
Institution

584
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:22,848
Is because

585
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:24,384
We have this unique

586
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,152
Window

587
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:26,176
What he's thinking

588
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,200
Because

589
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,480
Of Twitter

590
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:32,064
We've never had would have direct access to a president

591
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:35,136
Thoughts his ID his moment

592
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,672
My Moment thoughts on

593
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:41,024
Every piece of news or policy which may only hold for the next

594
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,096
5 minutes but nevertheless we get a snapshot into what he's thinking

595
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:48,704
And that's been important because this is been a norm breaking presidency

596
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,800
It's almost a tired phrase now to say this is abnormal I mean

597
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:56,640
The abnormal has become normal and in some ways that's been the Genesis

598
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,480
And Trump has definitely changed the way that Elizabeth teaches cost

599
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,272
At UC Davis

600
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:05,856
When I Survey my class and asked like what would you like to talk about

601
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,904
The semester will try to address some of those things

602
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,720
Donald Trump related they all are no basically

603
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,256
Whatever the topic is

604
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,280
Can he do that

605
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:17,120
Is he allowed to do that and I think that's been what's really remarkable

606
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:19,680
So yeah it's very different to me

607
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:20,704
Student ID

608
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:21,728
The teacher of

609
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:27,104
It's very different just to be an American today to think about what what's normal in terms of

610
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,664
Expecting certain kind of behavior out of an American Prayer

611
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:30,944
That's totally true

612
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,480
We're using in Cypress

613
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:34,528
About the concert

614
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:35,808
Anyways

615
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:38,880
And that seems to be going on Beyond

616
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,976
Is that a silver lining that you

617
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:43,744
You see in all this

618
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,024
List of people are actually talking about the

619
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,352
Take pleasure in the

620
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:53,984
Yes but has to be the one silver lining the people actually want to learn about how the government works

621
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:54,752
And

622
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:59,872
The people are slowly discovering that despite the fact that we have a constitution and we have

623
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:02,688
So many Supreme Court decisions on a variety of topics

624
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:08,832
The real thing that was always binding us the cookies and the glue for society was norms

625
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,696
That the Norms actually make

626
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:16,512
Our shared experience of what government should be possible

627
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,816
And when those start to unravel

628
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,352
People are understandably nervous

629
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:21,888
So that's been a

630
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:23,424
Big learning experience for all of us

631
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,216
Do you have a greater sense

632
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:27,008
That we are dependent on Norms

633
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:28,032
Then you did

634
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:29,568
18 months

635
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:32,896
You're absolutely mean it's it's showing us that

636
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:36,736
You know what we need is as kind of collective faith that are institutions

637
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:40,576
Our Collective faith in what the President should and should not be doing

638
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:46,464
And when that starts to come apart I think that that raises new kinds of questions for how we got to think about all of these

639
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:47,744
Offices

640
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,816
Westland institutions Congress the president how log works

641
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:54,656
But we should think about chords and we've never really had this kind of

642
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:57,216
Ultimate question that you want what is this song mean

643
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:59,008
In the very very beginning

644
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,032
When we started

645
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:01,568
We talk.

646
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:04,128
Only 5000 words

647
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,408
What's the scaffolding that

648
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,432
Be interpreted in

649
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:07,456
The ways

650
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,736
You kind of wish now.

651
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:09,504
But they were

652
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,832
More words of the Constitution that it was a little more exact

653
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:19,744
No I don't think so because I think there's a mean one of the reasons why so far anyway our system

654
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,304
Has been remarkably resilient in my last day

655
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,864
Is because of the flexibility and the doctor

656
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:25,888
You know if

657
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:27,680
They we had spend specific

658
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:30,752
You can't use muskets

659
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:32,800
And every person should pay

660
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:33,568
You know

661
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:39,968
$1 in taxes would be a very different document and probably we would have abandoned it a long time ago

662
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,064
But it's the open-endedness of it which kind of shows the genius of

663
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,344
Original framers

664
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:46,624
The show that

665
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,672
They were writing a document that was supposed to last

666
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:49,696
Astro long time

667
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:53,280
The problem with that is that we end up arguing a lot about what that means

668
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,072
And so that's

669
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:58,656
Thrilling parts of constitutional law or had been

670
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:00,448
And now sometimes it's becoming a scary

671
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,784
So if you want to take the chaos of

672
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,576
Unhinged tweets and

673
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:18,112
Endless political news

00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,672

What does it mean when Trump questions the legitimacy of judges

680
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:35,520
Can he even sees the necessary land to

00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,544
To construct a border

Might cost you your life

724
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:27,552
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

725
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:31,904
Or lose a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

726
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,232
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like

727
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,256
A dad

728
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:40,608
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

729
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:44,960
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that kind

A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

731
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:55,712
Was found dead in my private gym

732
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:59,040
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

733
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:00,320
Even worse

734
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:03,392
The cops think that I had something to do with it

735
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,672
Now

736
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:06,720
I need to clear my name

737
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:13,120
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes to find them
