No manipulation of funds

28
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:36,000
Okay and it's been a big rip-off with those funds do announcements of neighborhood parties

00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,264

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,616
Move the item Madam president move by Vice married

This will adopt the ends in the

35
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:59,040
Actually say it directly

36
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:02,368
But by adopting the items of the consent calendar

37
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,928
What happened there is the city of Oakland

38
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,208
Finally legalized

39
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:10,304
For the first time since the 1930s

40
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:11,328
Pinball machine

41
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:16,704
I Michael Sison the founder and executive director of the Pacific Pinball Museum

42
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:22,336
The Pacific Pinball Museum which is a collection of really cool mostly older machines that you can still play

43
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:24,896
Isn't Oakland's neighboring City Alameda

44
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:25,920
Until recently

45
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:30,528
Coin operated pinball machines were also illegal in Alameda and it's the reason

46
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:33,088
That we started out as a

47
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,112
Admission based

48
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,136
Establishment

49
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:35,904
And everything is

50
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,280
Free play most of the Museum's pinball machines look a lot like the ones you've seen before in your local bar

51
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:45,120
But there are few really old ones that look completely different

52
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,192
In Pinball's design history can help explain why

53
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:50,496
It was illegal for so long

54
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,800
And why after nearly 80 years

55
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:56,896
Abena slightly sketchy leather jacket wearing there dwell

56
00:02:57,152 --> 00:03:00,736
Pinball can now go legit and claim its place with Pac-Man

57
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,784
Has good clean family fun

58
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,648
Was it more like Billiards

59
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,952
YouTube the ball onto the field with a pool stick

60
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:16,608
In the 1860s the pool cue turned into a spring-loaded plunger that you pull and release to Launch

61
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:22,752
The ball they were simple wooden boards with last tops no electricity no flashy art or colors

62
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:27,360
And the game was made small to fit on top of a counter at a bar or drugstore

63
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,408
Mechanically gamer similar to

64
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,944
Basically did one action

65
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,712
Pull the plunger

66
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:35,296
The ball would shoot up the right side of the board and onto the Playfield

67
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:37,088
Where there were little pocket

68
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,112
That we catch

69
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,416
And then they were usually

70
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,184
Stamp

71
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,464
Point value

72
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:47,328
Indoor pens which look like tiny nails of obstructed your way into the pocket

73
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,608
That's where pinball

74
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,240
In the first games warrant

75
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,008
Coin-operated

76
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:56,288
Bars would buy one

77
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,568
And they would rent it out to

78
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,360
We wanted to play it and gamma

79
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,152
Was kind of like running

80
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,176
Out the car.

81
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,784
By the 1930s pinball games work when operating

82
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,344
He find his little countertop cans all over the place

83
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:16,000
Bars in drugstores you know you buy an egg cream to drink and some horrible tasting Elixir at the local drugstore

84
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,815
Can you use your change to play some pinball

85
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:22,655
And maybe you'd want a pack of gum or cigar and you have fun doing it

86
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,191
Then they move to

87
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,471
Just straight up gambling

88
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,775
Where instead of being awarded a prize

89
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,055
You were given cash

90
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,615
And it's around this point the pinball became Electric

91
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,663
Lights and buzzers started showing up

92
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,687
Along with other stuff

93
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,455
Netflix bumper

94
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,735
Bounce off of

95
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,015
Get more points

96
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:44,415
Points that needed to be tallied up on a scoreboard which led to what is now referred to as the back glass that's the part of the pinball

97
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,463
A machine that faces you as you play

98
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:51,327
And the art on the back glass became one of the most iconic things about the pinball machine

99
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,887
On the newer games a lot of the artist license

100
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:57,727
Spy movies like the 1991 hit Blockbuster The Addams Family

101
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:00,543
But if you go into the Pinball Museum in Alameda

102
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:03,103
Almost all the old games from thirties and forties

103
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,895
We're done by one of two artists

104
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:07,199
Sid George Blanton and Roy Parker

105
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,759
Dar was meant to appeal to men and boys

106
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:13,087
Teachers pictures of pretty lady

107
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:18,719
The back glass of a game called marble Queen depicts a group of women in swimsuits and high heels

108
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:20,767
Gathered around in a circle

109
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,047
Playing marbles

110
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,607
They're surrounded by a big tall fence

111
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,143
Almost like they're in the clubhouse

112
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,191
How do you see that the guys that are

113
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,751
Let you know picking through the fence and

114
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,031
It's pretty funny

115
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:35,103
The Ultimate Fantasy of a boy from the 1930s

116
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:37,151
Women in their bathing suits

117
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,175
Playing marbles

118
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:44,319
The lights and buzzers in women in bathing suits

119
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:47,135
Sometimes people were just playing to win a free game

120
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,927
Other times there was a bigger payout

121
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,463
But it all added up

122
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:53,279
These things made a ton of money

123
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,583
I can't emphasize enough of that because

124
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:00,959
The mafia got involved it was all cash with so much money disappearing in the pinball machines

125
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:03,519
The authorities started cracking down

126
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,287
It really got it

127
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,567
Heated in the 40s

128
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,615
More and more laws were being an act

129
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:08,639
To make

130
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:09,919
Pinball Gamble

131
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:14,015
Pulling harder manufacturers would try to get around this by labeling the machines

132
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:17,599
It says right here for amusement only no prizes no wager

133
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:20,159
Maybe they put that right on the machine

134
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,695
And everybody we knew that

135
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,463
Well that's

136
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,743
Exactly what it was

137
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:29,887
For it by the end of the 1940s pinball was banned in most major cities including Chicago and Los Angeles

138
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:34,495
But perhaps nowhere was the pinball Crackdown so Extreme as a New York City

139
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,031
Where 1942

140
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:40,127
Mayor LaGuardia ordered the NYPD to round up all of the machine

141
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,151
Then

142
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,431
In a press event

143
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:45,759
Damier personally shattered some of the machines with a sledgehammer

144
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:48,063
It had to be dumped into the Hudson River

145
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:55,487
LaGuardia later reported that mm new police billy clubs would be made from the wooden legs of old pinball machine

146
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:59,583
Perfect for knocking the heads of pinball plain Hooligans

147
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:04,191
LaGuardia did not succeed in ridding the world of pinball entirely though

148
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,495
It was still legal in some cities

149
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,775
And even in New York

150
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:08,799
It didn't totally does

151
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:09,567
Disappear

152
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,591
It just moved

153
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,639
In the City Underground established

154
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:16,223
Meanwhile the game designers were still developing new features

155
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,759
The most important of which

156
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,087
Were the flippers that first appeared in 1947

157
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:26,975
It allowed you to swap the ball around the play field by pressing two buttons on either side of the machine

158
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,023
In other words

159
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,863
The flippers gave you some control over the outcome of the game

160
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,679
Remember when pinball machines were first band

161
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,727
The games are considered a game of chance

162
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,775
He basically put your quarter in

163
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,823
Pull back the plunger and hope for the best

164
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,871
When The Flipper was added to the pinball machine

165
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:46,175
It should have changed the games legal status

166
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:50,015
It wasn't a game of chance anymore you can finally control the ball

167
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:53,087
If only they could find some way to

168
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:53,855
Prove it

169
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,695
Ladies and gentlemen I give you Rodger Sharp

170
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:00,511
I guess it one point I was considered to be

171
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,839
It's not the best player in the world one of the best players in the world

172
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:06,911
Nearly 40 years after the introduction of The Flipper

173
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:09,215
In April of 1976

174
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:13,567
Roger Sharpe was called upon to prove that pinball with a game of skill

175
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,871
Before a meeting of the New York City Council

176
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:18,431
On the day of the hearing tensions were high

177
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,455
It was packed

178
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,991
Lot of camera Crews

179
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:24,575
The New York State coin-operated Amusement game Association

180
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,111
How to arrange for the hearing

181
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:28,927
Need hauled to pinball machines into the meeting room

182
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,975
When that shark was to play

183
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,767
And another that would serve as a backup

184
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,815
In case the first one suddenly died

185
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:38,143
Start going over to

186
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,679
The game would have been designated

187
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:42,495
The council have been pretty antagonistic to Sharp

188
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,775
They thought he would cheat

189
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:46,079
And right before he was supposed to play

190
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,871
A council member stopped

191
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:48,639
You should know

192
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,919
Not that game

193
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,455
That came over there

194
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:56,831
I think that the head of the city council thought the vacuum was somehow rigged

195
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:01,183
Let's go with the game that's been turned off and nobody paid any attention to this over there in the

196
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:01,951
Corner

197
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,255
The council session took a 20-minute recess

198
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:07,839
So that the camera crews could change the lighting from the original machine

199
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,607
Into the new machine

200
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,911
And then Rodger sharp steps up

201
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:11,935
Then starts playing

202
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:14,239
Back that I was able to really show off

203
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:18,335
So it was very nice to be able to call my shots and just do whatever I want to do

204
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,919
Breaking Bad cams and shots for right to left or left to right

205
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,711
And then for the grand finale

206
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:26,015
Wanted to prove that even the first shot

207
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:32,159
The one that involves just pulling back the plunger and Let It Go but even that shot can be perfected

208
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,183
With skill

209
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,975
Return to the council members

210
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:38,815
Says if I do this right it's going to land right down the center

211
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,863
Hold back the plunger

212
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,703
Straight down the center

213
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:49,823
And the guy was Hershey concert at represent

214
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:53,663
And I was right which way to keep on playing. It was having fun

215
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:56,223
City council voted 6-0 to pass

216
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,503
The legislation

217
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,575
Sharpen said in the past that he got lucky with this Sean

218
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,879
But now he says that he was being modest

219
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,159
That his Plunge

220
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,183
Was not luck

221
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,463
To do what I did

222
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,999
That was skill

223
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,303
To have done it the way that I did it

224
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,071
Was

225
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,143
Pure naivete

226
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,423
Pinball was legal again

227
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,703
In most place

228
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,471
This is across the country

229
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,775
But not in Oakland and Alameda

230
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:24,895
Whereas we heard in the meeting the show pinball just became legal in 2014

231
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:31,295
Even with the rise of video games the pinball industry continue to experience waves of success until the 1990s

232
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,599
But over time people lost in

233
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:40,255
The last big Corporation to manufacture pinball machines lost millions of dollars on its pinball Division and decided to

234
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:43,583
The shutdown in favor of a more profitable operation

235
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:46,399
Making slot machines for casinos

236
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,679
After decades

237
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:51,007
Fighting to prove that pinball could be a game of skill

238
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:55,359
It turned out that the most lucrative bet for game Acres was on games of

239
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,127
Chance

240
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,151
Gambling

241
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,943
You know Bally's Casino

242
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,991
They used to be in the pinball business

243
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:06,623
Any took their name from their first hit pinball machine manufactured in 1932

244
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,903
Call Ballyhoo

245
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,439
Welcome to

246
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,207
Xxi

247
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:16,863
In 1999 pinball try to make a comeback with a game that integrated a video screen on the back glass

248
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,655
With a mechanical Playfield

249
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,191
Welcome to

250
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:20,959
Pinball

251
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:21,727
Mm

252
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:23,775
Welcome

253
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,311
The new image

254
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,847
In Denver

255
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:34,527
That was a promo video for pinball 2000

256
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:37,599
Despite the Reverb and the medicine taking clock

257
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:41,183
And the mountains of hyperbole heat on the promotion of the game

258
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,463
It never really caught on

259
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:46,047
Which is probably because if pinball still has any appeal

260
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,839
It's actually the Vintage

261
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,631
Analog Nostalgia feelings

262
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,703
We like it because it's not the few

263
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,239
The past

264
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:59,103
Back in the Pacific Pinball Museum Mike she's thinks pinball it making a bit of a comeback

265
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:04,991
It is because people are longing to get away from screens and from games that they play at home alone

266
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,783
So was Tim all you can kind of

267
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:09,599
Gather around and watch your friends suck

268
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:14,463
That's the other thing that's really cool is that anybody

269
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,743
Can suck at pinball

270
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:19,071
I mean it's a great equalizer you don't have to be smart

271
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,095
You don't have to be

272
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,375
Physically

273
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,399
DiNapoli

274
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:24,703
I think what you means is that anybody can suck

275
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,495
And anybody can be great

276
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,519
It's a nerd

277
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:28,799
A rebel

278
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,335
Underdogs

279
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:33,663
What are the best pinball players in the US right now

280
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,455
Is young guy with autism

281
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,503
Cooking memorize the geometric pattern

282
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,039
Thanks for the ball makes on the place

283
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:43,135
And then of course there's that deaf dumb and blind kid I heard about once

284
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,927
Never saw him play

285
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,975
I heard he was a really good

286
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:13,343
99% invisible was produced this week by Mickey Capper and Katie mingle with Sam Greenspan Avery trufelman

287

Tami Roman Mars

288
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:19,999
Make it another piece about pinball and fruits in Chicago for a program I love called curious City

289
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,023
Not really

290
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:26,911
Like that's a show if this newsgathering experiment basa WBEZ where people submit questions

291
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:32,031
About Chicago and curiousity investigates and reports if it's genius website

294
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,927
Between the beats

295
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:51,231
Bongs and chatter of our devices

296
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:54,815
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

297
00:13:55,583 --> 00:14:00,447
If I'm in room listening to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexa

298
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:06,335
Talking to me and my wife is in another room and another hearing. Voice

299
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,127
Technology talk to us

300
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,431
It is a creation of Sonic trash

301
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:13,247
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

302
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:16,831
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

303
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,879
To make them more human

304
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,975
Turn the living room lights on

305
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,511
Okay

306
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,559
Dim the living room lights to 50

Okay

309
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:35,519
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

310
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,567
Makes for a much more natural

311
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,335
Experience

312
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,383

I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

347
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,983
Actually if I'm being honest

348
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:44,031
I'm one of the main guy to know how to do that

349
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,311
I got a Thang
