This is 99% invisible

19
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:08,608
I'm Roman

20
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:18,336
When basketball was invented

21
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:21,920
As an indoor sport that can be played during long New England winter

22
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:23,200
The basket

23
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:24,992
Was literally a peach basket

24
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,296
And that basket was quickly replaced

25
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:28,576
Buy a metal hoop

26
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:29,856
The Rope net

27
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,672
But it was so close at the bottom

28
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:34,976
Every time a player scored a basket

29
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,512
The game had to stop

30
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,536
Pull data Lottery

31
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:38,816
Retrieve the ball

32
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:42,912
You can also sometimes you knock it out of the hammock with a long stick

33
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,472
But it took

34
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:46,752
Over a decade

35
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,568
For someone to come up with the brilliant idea

36
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,384
Of cutting a hole in the bottom of the net

37
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:57,760
And it finally put an end to the practice of manually retrieving basketballs every time ago

38
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:58,528
Discord

39
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,064
That took

40
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:00,832
8

41
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:01,600
Decade

42
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:09,024
Maybe it's a testament to have fun bad boy the play that the game going to work 10 years of such bad game design

43
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,304
Regardless

44
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,608
It someone not invented open-ended Nets

45
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,680
Basketball with Schwarz suck to watch on TV

46
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:17,216
What is a moor

47
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,496
Subtle development

48
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,032
Taking decades later

49
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,824
That made basketball

50
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,848
Sports juggernaut

51
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,128
But it is today

52
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,784
Okay I appreciate that not everyone listening as a sports fan

53
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:34,880
But what's your feelings about basketball aside for just a few minutes

54
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,416
And listen to The Raw

55
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:37,952
Human emotion

56
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:38,976
In this

57
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:50,752
This in basketball is called

58
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:51,776
A butterbeer

59
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:03,808
The game-winning shot made just as time expires it's exhilarating it's

60
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:04,576
Heartbreaking

61
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:07,904
It's a moment of pure anxiety that millions of people can share

62
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,928
As one

63
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:13,024
And the fact that a 48-minute game of basketball can still be won at

64
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:13,792
That's final macro

65
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:17,888
Thereby keeping you on the edge of your seat chewing your fingernails

66
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,680
The best until the final buzzer

67
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,216
That my friends

68
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,752
Is what we call good.

69
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,544
It is good design

70
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,616
But it's not the way basketball was originally designed

71
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:28,896
In fact

72
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,176
The drama the game clock

73
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:33,248
Really became relevant after the Advent of another clock

74
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,296
The 24-second shot-clock

75
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:41,184
This is the story of how the smaller less visible clock

76
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:46,816
24-second violation created the reaction

77
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,984
Outside for pain lets it go

78
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:05,248
For the uninitiated a shot clock is the smaller clock that you sometimes see counting down in the bottom corner of the TV screen

79
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,528
In the NBA

80
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:09,856
When a team gets the ball they have 24 seconds to make a shot

81
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:10,880
With the violation

82
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:11,904
They lose the ball

83
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:12,928
But this

84
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,208
Hasn't always been the case

85
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:17,024
In the early 1950s during pro basketball infancy

86
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,303
There was no shot

87
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,631
Nothing force a player to actually shoot the ball

88
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,167
NFL team was winning

89
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,703
They wanted to keep their lead

90
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,495
They could literally hold onto the ball for

91
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,263
10 minutes

92
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:32,639
That means you could turn off the game and listen to this entire pod gas and go back to the game in

93
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,663
Not miss it

94
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,223
I mean the game stock it was

95
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,503
Boring it was

96
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,271
Stupid

97
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,087
This is Dolph schayes

98
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:46,975
He's in the NBA Hall of Fame player and Coach whose career spanned two eras of basketball

99
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,767
Before the Inception of a shot clock

100
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:49,535
And after

101
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:54,399
He says this problem of players running time off the clock by just dribbling the ball around

102
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,959
Can really be summed up in a 1950 game

103
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,495
Between the Fort Wayne Pistons

104
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,031
In the Minneapolis Lakers

105
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,847
Good game near the end of it

106
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:03,615
Season

107
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:06,943
The Lakers they had like a dynasty at that time

108
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,503
And so the Pistons were ahead

109
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:10,527
Decided

110
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,295
2

111
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,087
Have a Slowdown

112
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,623
Meaning run time off the clock

113
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,415
So the game ended up

114
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,695
17

115
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,463
60

116
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,255
As the final score

117
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,791
The final score

118
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:24,351
What was something like that was in the teens

119
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,143
Actually was 19 to 18

120
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:26,911
Go Pista

121
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,191
And of course

122
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:32,031
The crowd was booing I mean that the became a real Forest

123
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:37,919
It was such a joke that in 1953 NBC decided to forgo coverage of the NBA Championship

124
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,711
Take out the game would be too boring

125
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,759
Finally it became a

126
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:42,527
A crisis

127
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,063
Sol basketball

128
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,855
Lizard a rule change

129
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,671
1954 enter Danny by Zone

130
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,207
Owner of the Syracuse Nationals

131
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,743
The team Dolph schayes play for

132
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:56,607
Crunch some numbers and he believed that some simple arithmetic could save

133
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,631
Basketball

134
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,167
And anybody song

135
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,191
It looks like I have this

136
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,215
Is formula

137
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,007
Why don't we try it out

138
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:15,807
Bizon figured that the best games of basketball the ideal games at Team scoring 80 or more points each

139
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:18,111
A store that buys on figured with high enough

140
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,647
To retain the audience's interest

141
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:23,487
Right so by Zone started tracking how many shots a team needed to make

142
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,791
Tuscora requisite 80-something points

143
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,095
Each team averages

144
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,887
60 shots

145
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:30,655
Hurricane

146
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:33,471
And there's two teams that means 120 shots

147
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:36,799
And the game was still 48 minutes long

148
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,079
48 minutes

149
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:39,615
Equates

150
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:42,175
To 2800

151
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,455
Is 82nd

152
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:45,759
So you divide the number of seconds in a game

153
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:49,343
2880 by the number of shots

154
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,391
220

155
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,671
24

156
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,951
24 sec

157
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:54,975
Spur shot

158
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:58,815
And hold a player to that standard you need a 24-second shot-clock

159
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:03,935
Myzone invited a bunch of League officials to Syracuse to watch a practice game using the shot clock

160
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:06,239
I mean dulces played in that game

161
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,543
Everybody felt

162
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:12,895
24 seconds remind me it was just very short. Of time

163
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:15,967
So when we got the bus

164
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,295
Everybody say oh my God

165
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:22,367
The entire team sense of time had become compressed

166
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,671
The old him didn't seem slow to the players

167
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,231
But with this new clock everything felt rushed

168
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,511
And the owners

169
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:29,791
Loved

170
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,351
I thought wow this is going to be great

171
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:35,167
Even if he's practice games there was a new sense of suspense

172
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,447
The owner sells it

173
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,983
And the players learn to love at 2

174
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:42,079
The clock became official in the 1954-55 season

175
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:48,735
Other changes in the Pro game is limiting the offense of possession what's the basketball

176
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,759
If that offense

177
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:52,063
Space of time

178
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:53,855
Another ball

179
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,903
Immediately

180
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,695
The scoring went up

181
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:04,863
Hayes passed away

182
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:12,031
This is audio from the 1955 NBA finals

183
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:14,335
Snowman as basketballs World Series

184
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,639
It's the first year the Clock Was instituted

185
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:23,295
Change the team the Syracuse Nationals made it to the finals last season

186
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:28,415
Play an important part in Our Winning

187
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:31,487
Because with the old rules the

188
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,255
Christian

189
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,047
Probably would have held the ball

190
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,351
Most of the second half

191
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:42,239
Because of the shot clock will be able to call way back and finally went in the last couple seconds

192
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:02,463
The next year the NBA finals are broadcast on television for the first time

193
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,279
Team scored almost 30 points more game

194
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,303
The next few seasons

195
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,863
And shortly after that attendance jump

196
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,399
By 40%

197
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,191
That's 24 seconds

198
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,983
Hawk the little idea

199
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:18,079
Started in 1955

200
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:21,663
Revolutionize and save the game of basketball

201
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,575
So let me just live for you

202
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:31,391
The reasons I actually like watching basketball

203
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:38,303
You can turn on a game of basketball in between commercial breaks of something else and still feel like satisfied that you saw something happen

204
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,327
It is the fastest

205
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,607
Toothpaste

206
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:44,959
Back in the baseball game you're not guaranteed to have that and I love baseball Talkin Baseball

207
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:51,359
But there's a lot of sitting around in baseball almost certain that something is going to be happening is so fast

208
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:57,759
That's wonderful right and I love how athletic basketball players have become I mean the things you see LeBron James do

209
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,527
Are Blake

210
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,575
Out of this world is mind-blowing

211
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:04,671
What he can do with a ball and even the worst guy on the court now is like

212
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:08,767
A crazy athlete in ways that I never thought like human beings could be

213
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:11,071
The players have to be stronger and faster

214
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:14,399
Because they have this set. Of time they have 24 seconds

215
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,935
To get the job done

216
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:19,263
I never would have thought that

217
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:24,127
That really made me love the game that made the game worth watching was some guy in Syracuse

218
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:30,527
60 years ago with a pen and paper and some long division he's the reason that this game is thrilling this one little

219
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,295
Innovation

220
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:36,159
Donnelly made this game so much better but make the players better themselves

221
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:41,023
Like a created better athletes it pushed human potential to a totally different limit

222
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,071
I never would have been possible before

223
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,119
He was all things to the shot clock

224
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:57,407
I got to tell your mom

225
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,479
But according to Eric

226
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:03,039
There is yet one more thing that basketball does

227
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,063
Is a pretty good job

228
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,367
I also really love halftime shows

229
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:19,423

Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices

238
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:47,327
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

239
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,351
If

240
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:54,751

Technology talk to us

243
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,943

244
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:05,759

It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

253
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,847
Makes for a much more natural experience
