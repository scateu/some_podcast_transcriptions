This is 99% invisible

24
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:15,264
Off the Southeastern coast of China is a small sweet potato shaped island of Taiwan

25
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:17,056
Yes I assure you

26
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:17,824
It is

27
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,592
Sweet Potato Shack

28
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:20,128
Not regular potatoes

29
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:26,016
Taiwan is not recognized by the UN as a Sovereign Nation so many people who live there would like it to be

30
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:28,064
Depending on who you dare ask

31
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,624
Taiwan can be considered a part of China

32
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:31,904
Orlando Park

33
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,208
Before I travel to Taiwan

34
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:38,560
I'm embarrassed to admit I wasn't entirely sure where it was

35
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:41,888
Producer Avery trufelman just back from Taipei

36
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,168
The capital of Taiwan

37
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:45,216
And a lot of people in Taiwan know this

38
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:46,752
Fat people like me

39
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:53,152
Aren't really sure where exactly they are or if they're a country and this is part of why in 19

40
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:53,920
97

41
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:57,504
City of Taipei set out to do something they hoped would

42
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,528
Put them on the map

43
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,344
They set out to build a very

44
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,368
Very

45
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,136
Tall building

46
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:08,256
Taiwan really need to let the world see it

47
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:10,560
You know Taiwan has seen such a beautiful Island

48
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:11,840
This is Michael Lu

49
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:14,656
He's a representative of taiwan's tallest building

50
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,936
Taipei 101

51
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:19,776
He says the City of Tempe started with a plan for a 66

52
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:20,544
Story office

53
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:23,360
With a high-class Mall food court

54
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:26,944
M-66 stories was enough to make it among the tallest in the country

55
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,272
The den the city government said all we know we should

56
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:32,576
Gladys the world's theater we should have a

57
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:37,952
Big guy Morgan says plan decided to change the plans

58
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:40,256
Eton building 288 stories

59
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:44,096
Which would make it the same height as the Petronas Towers in Malaysia

60
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46,912
Which were then the tallest buildings in the world

61
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,448
And it was not satisfied

62
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,472
So then

63
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,496
One of the Developers

64
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,800
We should go for her birthday

65
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:55,872
And so they decided to make it 101 stories

66
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:56,896
Anthony

67
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,176
Taipei 101

68
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,712
In Chinese philosophy

69
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:02,016
100 is a Zipcar facts

70
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,832
We're not satisfied with the perfection

71
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,136
Taipei 101

72
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,672
1600

73
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,952
67 feet

74
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,512
Up in the air which is about 508m

75
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,816
It is Bonkers High

76
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:15,584
It's stick

77
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,888
So far above the rest of Taipei

78
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:18,912
It looks

79
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:19,936
It's surreal

80
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:22,496
You can see it from almost anywhere in the city

81
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,288
Even from neighboring towns

82
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,848
Like a benevolent eye of Sauron

83
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:31,200
Building something of this size is never easy but I pay an extra optic

84
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:34,272
In a city prone to earthquakes and typhoons

85
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:37,344
They had to design a building that could withstand these conditions

86
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:42,720
And they had to convince the public that this freakishly tall new building was safe

87
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,256
And for a while at least

88
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,536
Taipei 101

89
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,072
But hold the coveted title

90
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,376
Of tallest building in the world

91
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:50,656
I think

92
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:54,496
It's fair to say that a large part of the story and history

93
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,520
Pole buildings

94
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,824
Is really wrapped up

95
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,592
With ego

96
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,616
Competition

97
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:02,432
Optimal so than any other building type

98
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,712
This is Anthony Wood

99
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,248
Executive director of the

100
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:07,552
The Council on tall buildings and urban habitat

101
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:11,904
They are the organization that gives out that official title of

102
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,696
Tallest building in the world

103
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,000
Yeah we have a very big ruler

104
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,791
And we send someone on socket

105
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:20,351
No it's it is all based on

106
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,631
On drawings on submit

107
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,399
Drawings

108
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:28,799
And it's important to have a fair an official measurement process because a tall tall building always represent

109
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,591
Something larger than itself

110
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:33,919
Historically a tall building was the embodiment of

111
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:37,503
Corporate power and you could see that in the titles of the pro jet

112
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,807
Pence Chrysler Building

113
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,879
Chicago Tribune Tower or Sears Tower

114
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:46,207
But in the last couple of decades the agenda has shifted

115
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:52,095
The motivation is the same in terms of getting attention I'm getting Brandon but it's now Moline clay

116
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,887
To befall a city

117
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,423
People and economy

118
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,191
Country

119
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:59,775
Which is why projects are now more likely to be named for places

120
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,567
Like Shanghai Tower

121
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,359
Doha Convention Center

122
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,383
Dubai One

123
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,175
Signature Tower Jakarta

124
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,711
Mecca Royal Clock Tower

125
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:09,759
And Taipei 101

126
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,831
How tall tower is a way to show the world

127
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,623
We have arrived

128
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,671
The question I typically get asked

129
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,439
Space

130
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,975
How high can we go

131
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:22,303
Most people think that the limits on high off technology

132
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,071
Nicole

133
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,607
And I can tell you that that no

134
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,655
Really the height of a tower is

135
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,935
The product of its base

136
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:31,519
And as long as you've got a big enough area at the base of the

137
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,287
The tower

138
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:36,383
It's just down to Structural Engineering that you can go as high as you

139
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:39,967
Necessary

140
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,527
Which means the only real limits

141
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,551
AR resources

142
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,575
And will

143
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,855
The main limit

144
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:46,879
Is financial

145
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:51,231
That's the only limit on tall buildings really is who the hell is going to pay for it

146
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,791
And then should it be done in the first place

147
00:05:56,863 --> 00:06:00,447
In Taipei securing funding for their new building with a huge endeavor

148
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:03,263
Is Taipei 101 representative Michael lucak

149
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,567
This was a public-private partnership

150
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:10,175
R a handful of local financial institutions signed on as shareholders

151
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:12,991
Including Taiwan stock exchange

152
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:19,391
And a lot of local bangs and some telephone company but local and getting the rest of the city on board with this

153
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:22,719
Plan meant taking a lot of different considerations into account

154
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,767
Light commercial flight pattern

155
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:28,607
When we proposed it is a big big challenge renovation Department

156
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:31,423
Type is airport is right in the middle of a city

157
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:35,775
So we went to a very very difficult time you need to talk to them

158
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:36,799
And

159
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:40,895
You know knowledge of the city but also the the country

160
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,687
Recognize that we need this

161
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:45,247
To really go for

162
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:48,319
The tallest in the world and then saw the end

163
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,367
The fly detour

164
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,719
Because if

165
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,511
The land was sad

166
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,303
The air was cleared

167
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:03,167
The city of Taipei was ready to create a building that would be the tallest in the world

168
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,215
Now they had to make it look good

169
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:10,335
The important thing is that you have to design building to be really iconic

170
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,639
Otherwise you cannot become a landmark

171
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,919
That is C Wiley

172
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,711
He's a bona fide Stark attack

173
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:22,111
Kid already designed big buildings and other cities in Taiwan and all-around China when he started planning this project

174
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,647
Back in the late 90s

175
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,951
He wanted this new building to be

176
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:29,023
Look different from skyscrapers in the West

177
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:32,863
Imitate like mod a Chinese Pagoda

178
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:35,423
So some more like a high-rise Pagoda

179
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,727
Super elongated

180
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,263
Multi-tiered Pagoda

181
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,031
Covered in

182
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,311
Sea Green Glass

183
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:48,223
Olympic a little bit light green mucus looks of record in this Pagoda is divided into 8 segments because

184
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,295
Eight in Chinese sounds like the word for wealth

185
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:57,695
Because that building is a financial building and for even more luck and wealth are a giant gold coins on all fours

186
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,975
Four sides of the base of the building

187
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:04,607
And for extra extra good luck the corners of the tower are accented with representations of

188
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,375
Clouds

189
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,143
And Dragons

190
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:12,543
The Cornell I have so many kind of a small thing that's expressed a dragon

191
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,079
Protectors of the building

192
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:16,127
In Taipei 101 needs

193
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:18,431
All the protection it can get

194
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:22,783
It is in what I like to call a tough neighborhood

195
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,063
That's Leonard Joseph

196
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,855
Thornton Tomasetti

197
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:28,415
They provided the Structural Engineering Services

198
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,695
Does on Taipei 101

199
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,719
You have both

200
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,255
Typhoons that are

201
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,559
Significantly more severe than

202
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:37,119
The Hurricanes we see you in the eastern US

203
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,911
And it is an active seismic

204
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:45,311
Until thing about having both harsh winds and seismically-active ground is that in an earthquake you want a flexible belt

205
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,591
So you would

206
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:49,151
Really would like a nice cool Timber structure

207
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,455
An earthquake zone kind of roll with the flow

208
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:55,807
When the wind blows that limber structure

209
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,367
Sways too much and people get seasick

210
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:01,183
One of the ways to lessen that sway

211
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,975
Is with a tuned Mass damper

212
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:08,095
A wind damper or a tuned Mass damper is basically a counterweight to wins

213
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:10,655
Tuned Mass dampers appear in many forms

214
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,703
These can be weights on rollers

215
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,031
Blocks of concrete suspended in pools of water or oil

216
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:16,799
Or

217
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,591
In the case of Taipei 101

218
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,383
A gigantic pendulum

219
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:24,223
By having a 2 Mass damper having this big pendulum

220
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,527
Has the building sways

221
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:30,367
And this business pendulum is designed to sway at about the same rate

222
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:35,999
The pendulum will handle a behind the building moves a pendulum follow

223
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,071
Slows the sway of a building

224
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,863
Tower would still stand without a

225
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:47,263
But the people inside might feel seasick or they might just be unnerved by the fact that they're building is Wayne

226
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,799
The damper

227
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,847
Is typically intended

228
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:53,151
Just to improve occupy

229
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:58,015
Comfort having a temper is not unique there are lots of buildings that have one

230
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:00,319
What's unique about Taipei 101

231
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:02,879
Is the way they've turned it into an ass

232
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:06,719
Usually the Denver gets treated like another piece of machinery

233
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,999
Velvet looks at it says

234
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,559
Well if I have to I'll put it in

235
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,607
I don't want to but if I got it all right

236
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,143
It takes up space

237
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,471
It cost me money I got to maintain it I got to buy it you know it's a thing

238
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,495
That they have to pay for

239
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:22,079
And so if there's a damper at all it's usually hidden away

240
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:25,663
You're the top of the building in some sort of machine room or attic space

241
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:29,759
Put in Taipei 101 the wind damper isn't just visible

242
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,551
It's the main attraction

243
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,575
So of course

244
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,111
Avery went to see it

245
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,671
This is like the 90

246
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,439
First

247
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,255
Oh my God my ears are

248
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,607
Okay now we are walking into the tunnel where it says

249
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:47,935
Giant Windber with her friends bike

250
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:48,959
Come here

251
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:50,751
This is

252
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:53,055
This is the pig camper

253
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,591
It is a massive

254
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,871
Massive pendulum

255
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:58,943
An orb made of 41 stacks of solid steel

256
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,503
Wayne 728 tons

257
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:06,111
According to an informational video elephants

258
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:09,183
It's suspended by 4 bundles of thick cables

259
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,207
And all of it

260
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,487
Has been painted

261
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,255
Goal

262
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,791
Really surreal again

263
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,839
Just kind of

264
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:16,607
Dystopian

265
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,631
If you're coming today

266
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,655
Gigantic

267
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,935
Golden orb

268
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,215
Paris

269
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:26,079
And the damper is on display because the engineering at work

270
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,359
Make people feel safe

271
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:32,223
Even in today's volatile climate you don't need to worry about the title

272
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:35,039
Even the Wave A Lot in Taiwan in December but

273
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,063
You don't need to worry

274
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,623
And to promote their awesome damper

275
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,159
Taipei 101

276
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,951
When even a step further

277
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:47,327
We hire the San Diego company Hello Kitty

278
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,631
So they created Denver babies

279
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,447
Powerball

280
00:11:56,543 --> 00:12:01,919
The Denver babies are little cartoon figures that have a body like the orb of the damper

281
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:04,223
The big head and little arms and legs

282
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,271
Becoming black red

283
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,039
Yellow

284
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,319
Silver and green

285
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,367
Can you get to this corner

286
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:14,463
Next to the damper itself you can watch a little video with a damper babies

287
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,255
Explain how the damper works

288
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,303
Are the Denver like that so terrible

289
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,839
Sway in a strong wind

290
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:24,191
By the way the damper babies are in speaking Chinese

291
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,471
Where Taiwanese

292
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,495
Or Japanese

293
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,567
They speak their own made-up cutesy language

294
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,359
But the video is subtitled

295
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,895
With all the information about the damper

296
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:37,759
And the Denver babies decorate the hallways leading to and from the damper itself

297
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,831
It's a whole wall of glowing damper babies

298
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,671
Music kind of rules

299
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:51,327
In all different forms of taipei101 gift shops sell all kinds of damper baby souvenirs and Webster

300
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,607
A lot of different kind of Prada

301
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,399
That's we have bugs we have

302
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,423
Cops

303
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,191
Sweetheart

304
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:56,959
Amox

305
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,495
So we have you know hats

306
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,287
I totally bought some damper baby stuff

307
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,079
A lot of other tourist

308
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:07,199
Just so funny to me that this huge crowd was geeking out about a tuned Mass damper

309
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,223
The factory

310
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:11,551
Been taking a stage further and used as a

311
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,575
Tourist object

312
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,367
Does just smile really

313
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:20,767
Anthony Wood of the Council on tall buildings and urban habitat says the damper help keep taipei101 on the glow

314
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:21,791
Global stage

315
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:25,375
Long after it lost its title as the world's tallest building

316
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:27,679
What position is held from 2004

317
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:28,959
2010

318
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:34,335
And I'm yes the world has largely move. We now have an 828 me to building

319
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,639
In the bridge Khalifa Dubai

320
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:43,039
The Burj Khalifa in Dubai took the title of tallest building in the world in 2010

321
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:46,623
As we record this it is still the tallest building in the world

322
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:47,647
It's over

323
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,927
Thousand feet

324
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,463
Taller than Taipei 101

325
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,279
163 stories it is

326
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,303
Staggeringly

327
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:01,983
The US may have once led the race for the tallest buildings but now most of the contenders are in East Asia and the men

328
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:08,383
At least according to the Council on tall buildings and urban habitat taipei101 is currently the fifth tallest build

329
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,151
World

330
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:14,271
But at the rate that super-tall buildings are being erected that ranking won't last very long

331
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:18,111
The council to find buildings that are taller than 300M

332
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,647
Or 984 feet

333
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,695
As super tall building

334
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:26,047
Right now there are a hundred supertall buildings in the world

335
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,863
In fact if we go back 5 years

336
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:32,191
There were only 50 super-tall buildings complete in the will

337
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:35,007
ATL to use to come to fruition

338
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,871
And the next 50 super tall buildings were completed in 5 years which shows

339
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:44,479
The absolute massive boom that tall buildings have been going through in the last decade or so

340
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:49,599
Supertall buildings can't just depend on their height anymore for notoriety

341
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:53,951
And this is why I taipei101 try to rack up all the superlatives you could

342
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:56,767
Including the biggest wind damper in the world

343
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,815
Fastest elevators in the world

344
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:01,887
And tallest leed-certified green building in the world

345
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,959
Which is a little bit of a a marketing thing but

346
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:09,567
Which shows the commitment you know what shows this commitment to progressing not building

347
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:12,639
Beyond just hate we're going to build the world's tallest

348
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:17,759
After all the title of world's tallest building is earned slowly and lost

349
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:18,527
Quickly

350
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,807
A lot of things

351
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,855
Pull together for beauty

352
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,647
Tallest building in the world

353
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:28,767
It's a contest that Architects C Wiley isn't planning on throwing his hat into again

354
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,071
Do you think you'd ever do it again would you dissolve

355
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:35,423
No that was quick why

356
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:40,287
I think the one is enough

357
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:00,511
99% Invisible Boy produce this week by Avery Trucking
