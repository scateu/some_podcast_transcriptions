Earlier this year I saw the movie Trading Places again on Netflix and I thought

19
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:24,736
I've seen this movie over and over again but I'm never really understood what happens on the trading floor at the end of the movie

20
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:27,552
Great things about working in public radio

00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,664
Back in the 1980s

29
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,712
Louis winthorpe the Third

32
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,064
You work at a fancy from in Philadelphia

00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,784
What I love is movie I saw it when I was

58
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,832
Way way too young I was probably 9 or 2

59
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,880
And I just wanted to know

60
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,416
Is this

61
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:14,048
The most sophisticated depiction of the inner workings of a financial Market in the history of Cinema

62
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:19,936

68
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:31,968
What the Movie Trading Places can teach you about financial Market

69
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,736
And

70
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:33,504
I know this

71
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,552
It's of particular interest to running

72
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:39,904
We are finally going to explain one of the great enduring Mysteries

73
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,440
What the hell

74
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,976
Actually happened

75
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,512
At the end of this crazy

76
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,816
Oh I definitely need that

77
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,408
So it's been a while since you've seen Trading Places

78
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:04,736
Everything is going really well for Louis winthorpe until

79
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:05,504
Bosses

80
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,528
They have an argument

81
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:10,880
Mad about nature versus nurture and the evil Randolph Duke that's his

82
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:13,952
Maybe even slightly more evil brother Mortimer Duke

83
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,000
That he can take away Lewis's job

84
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,280
His fiance

85
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,815
And his home is friends

86
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:19,839
And they can turn it

87
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:20,607
I'm into a car

88
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,679
While at the same time the Duke brother

89
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,983
Pick a comment from the street

90
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,519

00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,543
Rockies play by Eddie Murphy

92
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,335
Any given Louis's

93
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,359
Empire life

94
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,127
Job

Home his Butler

96
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:36,735
And they try to turn him into a Hotshot commodity

97
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,319
It's kind of a modern-day Twist on Prince in the Paw

98
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,879
Guinea pigs they find each other

99
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:46,463
And Lewis and Billy Ray conspire to get back at the Dukes

100
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:49,535
And they make a brilliant plan to make themselves really rich

101
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,351
And put the Duke Brothers in the foreground at the same

102
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:54,911
It is a crazy complicated

103
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:57,215
Plan that involves Futures trading at

104
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,263
Commodities and cornering the market

105
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,823
And Frozen concentrated Orange

106
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,127
Right there that's my first question

107
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,431
Frozen concentrated orange juice

108
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,735
Central to the move and when I first saw it

109
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:11,039
I totally thought that was made up as a commodity

110
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:11,807
They just to be fun

111
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:12,831
In the real world

112
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:13,855
My thinking was

113
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,647
You just trade oranges

114
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,439
Who would spend their lives

115
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:19,487
Trading little cans of Frozen

116
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,255
Concentrated Orange

117
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,535
I found some

118
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,559
This guy

119
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:27,679
My name is time for honest and I'm a commodity Trader I'm just coming back from

120
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,727
Before the New York Mercantile Exchange

121
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,543
Where I can have spent the last 4 hours

122
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,591
Buying and selling orange juice options

123
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,615
Futures

124
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,407
It's real

125
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:41,247
It's totally real estate doesn't all day long

126
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:47,647
Call Brody you give me a first expert on all things Frozen healthy orange

127
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,695
And women are second expert in just a moment

128
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,975
We're going to use both of them

129
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,255
Fact check this

130
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,023
Grandmas

131
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,303
Ramen

132
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,583
The Trading Places

133
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:58,911
Basically could be a university-level course

134
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,935
In financing

135
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:00,703
Commodities

136
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:05,311
And as someone who explains economics for a living in this is my job

137
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,591
Take my hat off

138
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,383
To the writers of this movie

139
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,687
Just listen to this scene

140
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:11,967
The Duke Brothers

141
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:12,991
In the scene

142
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,015
Weed Eddie Murphy

143
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,295
Billy Ray Valentine

Wood table

145
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,343
Enchantment table

146
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,111
Beautiful breakfast

147
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:20,159

148
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,719

151
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,303
Tried

152
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,839
Explain to you what it is

153
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:28,607
We do here

154
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,631

00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,911
Commodities broker

156
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,727
What are commodities

157
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,287
Commodities are agriculture

158
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,055
Products

159
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,335
Like

160
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,103
Coffee

161
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,383
For breakfast

162
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:43,199
Sweet which is used to make bread

163
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,527
Pork belly bacon

164
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:50,367
Which you might find in a bacon and lettuce and tomato sandwich

165
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,183
Eddie Murphy

166
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,743
Did deadpans right into the camera

167
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,791
I suspect that sometimes Planet Money listeners

168
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:01,119
History

169
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,935
I don't know either come out of this like

170
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,471
Frozen orange juice

171
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,007
And go

172
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,567
Of course

173
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,871
Gold doesn't grow on trees like orange

174
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:15,199
Clear so far

175
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,479
Yeah

176
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:20,319
In reviewing the movie they really really did a good job I mean someone

177
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,087
I'm there

178
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,879
Knew what they were doing

179
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,159
This is our second

180
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,951
Bob Lassen Trello

181
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,487
He's a Commodities Trader in

182
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,255
Chicago

183
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,535
Can use to trade cattle

184
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,607
Like Roman you might find any roast be

185
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,631
Cheddar and

186
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,399
Tomato sandwich

187
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,727
Of course if you watch that scene you might think of these guys

188
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:42,591
Trade-in physical things the physical things that you see on the table the bacon the weed

189
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,127
The cans of orange juice

190
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:47,199
The temperance says that in that words use Market that's not quite right

191
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:54,111
Yes. Store just a little candy had to probably have large refrigerator type units for them

192
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:59,231
All the stuff you have no idea what it looks like know and as a matter of fact if you trade agricultural Commodities most

193
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:06,399
Commodity Traders go their whole careers without ever seeing the physical product am I used to trade pork bellies and live Hogs and

194
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,959
I would know a pork belly fat dropped on the table here

195
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:12,799
Yeah the recent Tom fronis wouldn't recognize a pork belly on the table

196
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:16,127
It's because people like him who do this in real life or Trading

197
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,151
Country

198
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,175
On pork belly

199
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,455
Or technically

200
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:24,319
The future promise to deliver a certain amount of pork bellies at a certain time at a store

201
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,855
Price what really is a

202
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:29,951
It's a wager the bet on whether you think something is going to go up or down in price and

203
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:32,511
Mortimer and Randolph Duke in the movie

204
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,535
They make money

205
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,327
Weather goes up or down

206
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,375
As a good part William is that

207
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,935
That no matter whether our clients

208
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,959
Make money

209
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:42,239
I lose money

210
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,031
Duke and Duke

211
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,567
Commission

212
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,359
Well

213
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,151
What do you think Valentine

214
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:53,247
Sounds to me like you guys are

215
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,575
I told you he'd understand

216
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,903
I know this whole contract thing Macy

217
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,671
Theoretical

218
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02,719
But the bats are based on an a

219
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,767
Actual contract when an actual real thing

220
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:08,095
The traitors just hold the contract for just a few minutes or a few days

221
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,887
Enough time to make a little money

222
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,935
But before the contract

223
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:14,495
Spires and the actual good have to be delivered

224
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:15,775
That traitor

225
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,055
Needs to unload the car

226
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,615
Need to sell to someone who actually

227
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,383
Wants

228
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,919
Thing underneath the car

229
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,199
Who actually wants

230
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:23,967
The oranges

231
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,247
Who wants the bacon

232
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,039
What's the life cow

233
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,599
Remember that's what Bob Last Cinderella trailer

234
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,623
Live cattle

235
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,671
Moana

236
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,207
How he just wanted to make a

237
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,231
Bet on the future

238
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:35,999
Prices of cow

239
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,047
But once popped

240
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,399
Did you ever receive an actual cow

241
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:45,471
Oh boy did I

242
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,519
Yeah not a cow 40 of them

243
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:50,335
And more than 40 you made a mistake

244
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:54,431
You made a mistake and somebody called you on the phone and just said

245
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,199
We have

246
00:09:55,711 --> 00:10:01,855
I don't hear from you wear them a trucker's oh yeah they're in the pain there actually off the truck in Independence

247
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:06,719
What it is and so when the guys in the East st. Louis Stockyards found out that a Futures Trader

248
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,255
Delivery on some cattle

249
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:10,303
They generally aren't super hopeful about

250
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,863
They don't really give you a hand letting you

251
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:13,887
Tell him that

252
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:14,911
Think they kind of

253
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,703
Sticky with some extra fees and

254
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:21,567
You know they they they don't like us guys they picked it in it and it's Times Like These Guys

255
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,615
Sort of meddling in their world

256
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,407
Now back to the movie

257
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,199
Billy Ray Valentine

258
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:29,503
Now called William Valentine by the Dukes

259
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,783
Is learning this commodities

260
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,343
He has some talent for it

261
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,111
Because it's not

262
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,671
Just about knowing the facts and the figures of the contract

263
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,439
Commodities

264
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,743
A lot of it is about knowing psychology

265
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:42,815
Tell me just quiet think the price of pork bellies

266
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,839
It's going down

267
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,143
Christmas time

268
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:50,751
Could we please buy now Randolph

269
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,543
What are you trying to say what

270
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,079
Okay

271
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,103
Potbelly prices

272
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,383
I've been dropping all morning

273
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,431
Is everybody sitting in the office

274
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,479
Hit rock-bottom so they can buy cheap

275
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:06,367
The people on the park by the contractor going back

276
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,719
Christmas is around the corner by Joe with the Kung Fu grip

277
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,487
Okay

278
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,511
And my wife ain't going

279
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:18,399
My wife want to make love to me cuz I ain't got no money right

280
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,751
I can feel it

281
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:27,103
Oh my God

282
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,687
I wait till you get to about 60 for the night by

283
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,479
If it at all the seconds by then

284
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:36,063
Of course Billy Ray Valentine makes them a ton of money

285
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,623
Baba blessin Giraldo has a small quibble with

286
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:43,487
He says people don't really declare a particular price for a commodity no one ever says

287
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:46,047
It's going to 64 and really know exactly

288
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,351
But people make bets on whether things

289
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,375
Just go up and down

290
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:54,495
Is that right to people to weigh up to Lungi what would happen

291
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,287
You know their guys would just

292
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:02,175
You'd be standing around and you'd have to start to have a feeling that the market was going to go up or down and then you would trade accordingly

293
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,455
It's sort of like

294
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,479
Your brain

295
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:09,599
Processing all this information ends up manifesting itself is

296
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,367
What's called

297
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,671
A field and then you buy resale accordingly

298
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:15,231
So far according to rxp

299
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,023
The Movie Trading Places

300
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,351
Is nailing it that is Commodities thing down pat

301
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:25,215
But then it gets a little Hollywood Lewis Winthrop are down and out Rich Boy

302
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,519
He teams up with his former Butler

303
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:30,079
And a prostitute with a heart of gold

304
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:30,847
We do not fight

305
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:31,615
Fact check that one

306
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,383
You don't even need

307
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,175
It's a given

308
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:38,783
Exactly Emily rata con man turns trading Savant figures at

309
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,575
Women I've been played

310
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,855
A joint with Winthrop

311
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,391
Hatched this plan

312
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,671
How to make millions of dollars

313
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,439
And bankrupt

314
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:48,255
And it's the end of the movie where I have my biggest question

315
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:50,559
I was a kid I saw it and

316
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,327
I know that

317
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,631
Something important is happening on the trading floor

318
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:54,911
The Underdogs

319
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:55,679
When

320
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,447
I get rich

321
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,983
The Dukes go bankrupt

322
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,775
But I didn't really understand

323
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,311
When I watch it again

324
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,591
Funny thing is I

325
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,871
I still don't really

326
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,895
I understand it as an adult

327
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:08,479
Ed before I don't think I would have gotten

328
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:14,111
But I have now study the movie over again we've talked to the experts and we are going to

329
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:14,879
Break

330
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:15,903
This thing

331
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:16,671
Down

332
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,695
Because Roman

333
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,231
If you were paying attention

334
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,023
This movie has already taught you

335
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,815
Everything you need to know about commodity

336
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,095
And how to Corner the market

337
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:24,863
Now

338
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,143
Remember the orange juice

339
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,679
That was in the breakfast

340
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,447
Yes

341
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,983
Frozen concentrated Orange

342
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:32,287
Okay so in the movie The Duke Brothers

343
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:35,871
Have bribed the guy to get an advance copy of the

344
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,455
Neuropathy in his copy of the USDA

345
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,991
Orange crop report

346
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:45,087
Which of the totally real thing you stop reports come out every month to tell you how much of a

347
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,111
Commodity is out there

348
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:50,463
Now this if they know it in advance how many oranges are out there

349
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:52,511
They will then know whether the price is

350
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,279
Is going to go up

351
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,815
Remember understand

352
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:55,839
The crop report

353
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,119
Is going to say

354
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,655
But the supply of oranges

355
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,679
Is fine

356
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,471
Plenty of good cheer

357
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:04,287
Orange juice to go around at the normal day in the market

358
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,591
Except our heroes are going to trick

359
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,359
The Duke Brothers

360
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,407
They're going to pull the old switcheroo

361
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,455
So they slip the brothers

362
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,223
Fake

363
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:12,991
Crop report

364
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,527
A report that says

365
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:18,367
Oh my god there was this terrible Frost in Florida lots of dead oranges

366
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,415
Fake report would make

367
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,951
Any Savvy trade or no

368
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:24,511
The price of orange juice is going to go through the roof

369
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,791
Saudi Brothers think that

370
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,327
Get the supplies low prices

371
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,351
To go up

372
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:30,655
And they're willing to bet everything

373
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,447
They are so long

374
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,727
Ciroc

375
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:34,751
Are gyros

376
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,055
Billy Ray Valentine and Louis winthorpe

377
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,847
Former Trader gets screwed by the Duke

378
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,895
They know the truth

379
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,175
They know that the orange.

380
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,455
Why is fine

381
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,479
And they know

382
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,759
Did the prices going to go down

383
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:50,623
Silver Spring back roj expert Tom peroneus and we're going to watch this final scene together

384
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,647
And get a play-by-play

385
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,255
Are gyros

386
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,559
With their stolen Insider information

387
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:01,631
Our heroes are striking out onto the trading floor

388
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,167
Of the New York Mercantile

389
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,447
There's

390
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,495
My old place of employment

391
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:11,615
That's the World Trade Center office in that building right there that's that's where the exchange was

392
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,663
Inside

393
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:16,223
You see all the traitors in their ugly vest

394
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:19,039
Gathering on this large floor staring up at

395
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:19,807
The clock

396
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:27,231
Why don't you and it's pandemonium song

397
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,535
This is exactly what was like before computers

398
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:33,631
Maybe not quite so many people excited about frozen orange juice but still

399
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,655
Cuz make me nostalgic

400
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:37,983
4 floor base Trading

401
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:42,335
Now once again Roman get to keep all these things in your head if it's still excess

402
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:45,407
The Duke Brothers think there's going to be a shortage of Orange

403
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:48,223
Because according to their fake crop report Harvest

404
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:48,991
D-BAT

405
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,271
The prices should go up

406
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,831
They tell their guy their Floor Trader

407
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:56,927
We want you to buy as much OJ as you can in the instant pot

408
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:59,743
Don't worry if the price starts going up just keep

409
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:05,375
Play starts at $1.02 a pound

410
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:09,215
Prices to go up and thought their bidding up the price of orange juice

411
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:11,519
And the rest of the traitors started notice

412
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,663
They know something I can feel it.

413
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:21,759
Okay I got to tell you here Roman the actor who says

414
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:24,063
They know something I can feel it

415
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:28,159
That is Jack Davidson father of play nobody's very own Adam Davidson

416
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:30,207
And as I will say it really is

417
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:35,071
It really is the most critical line in the entire movie delivered by his father

418
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,607
That's

419
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,679
What is actually important for the plot because

420
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,983
Everyone starts to buy orange

421
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:44,287
The price was higher and higher dollar temp

422
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,823
A dollar $28 30

423
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,895
Everyone now thinks there is an orange shortage

424
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:49,919
The only problem

425
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:50,687
Is a

426
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,967
Of course we know it's the audience

427
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:52,991
It's based on a lot

428
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,807
The Billy Ray Valentine Louis winthorpe stand

429
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:56,575
Quietly

430
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,623
In The Madness of the trading floor round

431
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,415
They know the prices

432
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:02,463
Just too high they know it's getting higher

433
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,487
And they know it's about

434
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,255
Collapse

435
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:06,559
And so they want to do a little trick

436
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,607
Have heard of called Short Selling

437
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,679
They want to sell orange juice while the prices High

438
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:12,959
So

439
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:15,519
When the price gets 142

440
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,311
Dan Aykroyd looks like

441
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:24,223
And he screams

442
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:30,111
Is a good candidate for the second most important line of the movie with all respect to Jack Davidson and I totally

443
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:33,439
Mystic Ivory watch that movie again and again I have no idea

444
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,975
What you says they're what

445
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:35,999
Dan Aykroyd Seth

446
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,535
Do we have time explained

447
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,327
Sell 30 April 142

448
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:43,679
What you doing you selling 30 Futures contracts at a price of 142 per pound

449
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:48,799
And there's kind of a Feeding Frenzy driving the market higher but these guys

450
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:52,383
Have what they believe is the real information and they're selling it at rally

451
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:56,223
So selling it to the rally means you think the price is going to go down

452
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:56,991
Yes

453
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,527
I'm starting to get this

454
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:02,367
Billy Ray Lewis they're selling High they're selling orange juice

455
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,695
To everyone who thinks that is going to go even higher than that

456
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,231
Yet it's a really

457
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:07,999
Tricky

458
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,023
Find point

459
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:11,071
Here but I'm just going to say this

460
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:13,631
You don't have to own any orange juice

461
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,679
In order to sell it

462
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,447
Because

463
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:23,871
They're selling a promise they're selling this thing I will promise to deliver you orange juice in April that was April part of that

464
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:26,175
And you will pay me this large amount of money

465
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:26,943
Sometime in the future

466
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:29,503
Our Heroes have until then

467
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,271
Find some

468
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,831
Cheap orange juice and to fulfill their contract

469
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:36,159
If you heard the old saying like Buy Low and sell High

470
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,439
Yes that one I know

471
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,463
It's

472
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:42,303
Turns out though and this is the key to short side but keep the entire movie

473
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,607
Is you can do it the other way

474
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,911
You can sell High first

475
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,215
And then turn around quickly and Bi-Lo

476
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:50,239
Make a ton of money

477
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,263
Aunt

478
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,055
Our heroes are about

479
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:56,639
To get to buy extremely low because the crop report

480
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:58,175
The real crop report

481
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,967
Is about to come out

482
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:03,039
It's kind of crazy cuz everyone on the tree Ford to stop

483
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,063
Looking TV

484
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:06,879
Ladies and gentlemen

485
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:09,439
The orange crop estimates for the next

486
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:17,887
And I mean this is obviously a Hollywood moment prater's don't really just stare the TV and there's not a long awkward pause while the Secretary of

487
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:18,655
Culture

488
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,423
Come on

489
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:23,775
This is dramatic tension Robert

490
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:26,079
After calculating the estimate

491
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,359
From various Orange

492
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,383
Music States

493
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,687
We have concluded the following

494
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:34,783
The cold winter has apparently not affected the orange Harvest

495
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:49,631
That sound you hear is a bunch of people who just realize that they bet the wrong way but there's no shortage

496
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,655
The Dukes

497
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:53,471
And everyone who bought with them including Adams dad

498
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,519
Now own a lot of various

499
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,543
Expensive orange juice

500
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:57,823
Way too expensive

501
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,871
Another real proper Port is out

502
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:00,895
The price is dropping

503
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:01,919
It's 102

504
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:02,943
96

505
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:03,967
Plunging.

506
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:07,295
7264 everyone who bought high now once

507
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,063
The cell

508
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:08,831
And cut their losses

509
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:11,391
And it's driving the price down even further

510
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:12,415
46

511
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,463
And remember our heroes

512
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,231
New

513
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,511
This was going to happen

514
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:19,839
They sold a ton of orange juice at a crazy high price

515
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,887
And now the entire

516
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:22,655
Trading floor

517
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,935
Including the Duke Brothers

518
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,471
Guitar Floyd's begging

519
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,519
Excel them orange juice

520
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:34,431
Crazy chief

521
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,455
Estrostep

522
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,735
As the chaos clear

523
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,807
Other people have promised to buy orange juice from

524
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:43,135
At a price as high as 142

525
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,159
142

526
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:47,999
And now minutes later people are promising to sell orange juice to them

527
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:50,559
As cheap as $0.29 a pound

528
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,351
Billy Ray and Lewis

529
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,375
Get the pocket

530
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,935
It is a Epic Movie

531
00:20:56,191 --> 00:21:00,287
Probably a significantly bigger one day move in the orange juice Market has ever had in it

532
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,311
Entire history

533
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,871
It surely fictional move but you know

534
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:07,199
And enough to enable these guys to retire in

535
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:10,527
We had our Commodities guys watchthisfree closely

536
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:14,879
But it's hard to estimate just how much money Billy Ray and Louis made on this

537
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:15,647
Scam

538
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:17,952
We see the price of orange juice futures

539
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,232
But not how many contra

540
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,768
That's all we know at the end of the movie is that

541
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:21,792
Brothers

542
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:22,816
They are Bank

543
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:27,680
Yeah they bought all of that orange juice when he was a crazy high prices they bought High

544
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:29,728
And if and when they sell it

545
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:30,496
It's going to be at

546
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,520
Terribly low price

547
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,544
They did the

548
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,312
The opposite

549
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:35,104
What you need to do to make money in the market

550
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,384
They lost nearly

551
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,176
400 million dollars

552
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,712
Tarzan the way trading works

553
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:41,504
I hear is probably pocketed most

554
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,552
And as far as villains

555
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,344
The Dukes they get their come up

556
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,624
At the end

557
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,392
Training Day

558
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:53,024
Turns out they borrowed a lot of that money they just lost

559
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:55,328
Margin Call gentlemen

560
00:21:55,584 --> 00:22:01,728
You can expect the exchange all accounts to be settled at the end of the day

561
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,520
Without exception

562
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:09,664
You know perfectly well we don't have 394 million dollars in cash

563
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:16,320
Put the Juke brother seats on Exchange up for sale at once seized all assets of Duke and Dubuque

564
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:19,904
Randolph and Mortimer

565
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,976
And this dramatic

566
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:27,328
Crazy clearly Hollywood ending bad guys lose everything they get

567
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:29,120
Booted out of the rich

568
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:30,656
Positions in the market

569
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:34,240
This really happen sometimes according to Tom

570
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,288
He says people would borrow money

571
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:38,592
Bet it all on a market move

572
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:40,640
And when I went the opposite direction

573
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:41,664
Better pay app

574
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,200
Most Clearing Houses had

575
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:45,248
People who are referred to as leg-breaker

576
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:48,064
There they were like a real

577
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:54,464
Mobster you know leg Breakers but the they were the ones who would say alright you know the time to Pony up alright well you know we want your house

578
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,744
Yes we want your IRA

579
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,792
It would happen right there on the floor

580
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:03,424
That's a little over dramatize but it would happen that day or the next day another there wouldn't be much

581
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,192
The time lag

582
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,984
He said there's one more unrealistic

583
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,264
At least in today's world

584
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,800
Computer Trading

585
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,336
Took over the Commodities Market

586
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,128
That climactic scene

587
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:15,200
If they remade the movie today it would sound a lot like

588
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:15,968
This

589
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,576
Tall people staring at screens

590
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:24,672
Today you know it is this kind of obvious trauma is gone from

591
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,488
It would be a very quiet

592
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,864
Yes Klymaxx Brothers will be in their own private hell you know looking at a computer screen

593
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:34,656
Head buried in their hands

594
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:41,056
Tom perona says and this makes me very happy that people still bring up the movie when he says he trades in orange juice futures

595
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:43,616
And even among his fellow traitors as a sort of

596
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,384
Reverence

597
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,152
For the movie

598
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:48,736
The lines from the script I become part of the lingo of Commodities Trading

599
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:55,392
Definitely some of these these lines to become stock phrases like over the years especially the ocean Market I heard people say like sell Mortimer sell

600
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,416
El Amor De Marino

601
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:59,488
Duke and Duke is buying I've heard that too many times

602
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:03,328
Account it's definitely become part of the boj lure

603
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:10,496
It wasn't much OJ Lord

604
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:13,312
The stuff from Trading Places makes up a significant chunk of it

605
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:32,256
Did this whole scam with illegal

606
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:35,840
Are Hue hose basically stole inside information

607
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:38,400
Basically stole the crop report

608
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:41,984
They took all this money not just from The Dukes but

609
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,056
From the market and at the end

610
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:47,104
They're sitting on a Caribbean Beach

611
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,640
And I thought oh

612
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:50,432
They're on the Run

613
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,712
From the law

614
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,016
It turns out

615
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:55,808
At the time

616
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:58,112
Insider trading with knots

617
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:00,160
Strictly illegal in the commodities

618
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,464
China makes

619
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:08,864
Sense because there's so many people involved if you are a farmer training corn you have the ultimate inside information

620
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:14,240
How about corn and everyone in the agriculture business that's a little something that someone else doesn't

621
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,008
But

622
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:19,104
If the part with a steel across report that seems way way over the line

623
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,920
Yeti 75 the actual fact of

624
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,456
The suitcase would happen

625
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,480
Invite movie

626
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:30,880
You shouldn't steal which is illegal in every respect but the actual way in which they made money with stolen in

627
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:31,648
Information

628
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:34,208
That was legal

629
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:35,488
And I learn this because

630
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:38,048
When Congress was coming up with the banking

631
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,584
Reformed law Dodd-Frank

632
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,352
Can mm

633
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,632
They were

634
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:43,168
Debating what should be in the building

635
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,448
And it came up with the

636
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,728
Special provision

637
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,264
It seems that the chair of

638
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,032
The commodities

639
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,056
Future Trading

640
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,592
Gary Gensler

641
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,384
He said we need this thing

642
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:53,664
It is called

643
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,688
The Eddie Murphy

644
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:58,016
A rule that will make what happened to Trading Places

645
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,064
And it made it in

646
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:03,648
Dodd-Frank section 746 with Paisley says

647
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,184
Federal employee can't

648
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:11,584
Leaked information about the price of a commodity so that someone can make money off of it and a person who gets that leaked information

649
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:17,728
They can't use that to make money off of the market before this into effect

650
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,008
What Eddie Murphy

651
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:20,032
Billy Ray Valentine

652
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,312
And Dan Aykroyd

653
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:22,848
Lewis Winthrop the Third

654
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,128
What they did

655
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:28,224
Misappropriate information and then use it to Corner the orange juice Market

656
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:29,248
What they did

657
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,272
Was not

658
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:34,624
Got away with it got away with it

659
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,416
Oh that makes me so happy

99% invisible it Sam Greenspan and me Roman Mars

00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:10,464
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices were immersed in a cluttered world of May

664
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,488
Man-made sound

665
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:18,144
If I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexis talking to me in my

666
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:24,544
Wife is in another room in a small hearing. Voice technology talk to us

667
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:26,848
It is a creation of Sonic trash

668
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,920
That's Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

669
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:35,552
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology to make them more human

670
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:39,392
Turn the living room lights on

671
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,184
Okay

672
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:43,744
Dim the living room lights to 50%

673
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:45,536
Okay

674
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:51,936
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

675
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:55,008
Makes for a much more natural experience

676
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,800
Turn the living room lights on

677
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:00,896
Dim the living room lights to 50%

Laxatives modify your diet and exercise routine but thinking about it all the time is frustrating but doesn't have to Define you

686

Before we go I want to tell you about the body genius a five-part series from fellow radiotopia show the truth

694
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:31,520
The body genius is a Dark comic mystery

695
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:34,848
That whines through a treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

696
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:36,384
We're looking the part

697
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,920
Might cost you your life

698
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:43,296
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

699
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:47,648
Or lose a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

700
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:52,000
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like a dad

701
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:56,352
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

702
00:29:56,608 --> 00:30:02,752
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that kind of thing if you'd

703
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:08,384
Days ago Wesley Stern in actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

704
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:14,784
Was found dead in my private gym crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

705
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:21,184
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it now I need to

706
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,464
To clear my name

707
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:28,864
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes to find them
