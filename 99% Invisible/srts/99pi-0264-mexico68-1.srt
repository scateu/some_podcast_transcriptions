On October 16th

25
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:17,312
1968

26
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:22,432
American sprinters Tommie Smith and John Carlos climbed onto the podium at the Mexico City Olympics

27
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:24,480
To accept their medals today

28
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:26,784
They came in first and third in the

29
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,064
200m Dash

30
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,600
Smith had one goal

31
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:30,368
Carlos

32
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,392
Edwin Braun

33
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:35,232
As the national anthem begin to play the men

34
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,768
Both African American

35
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,048
Bowed their heads

36
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:39,328
And raised their fists

37
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,376
In the black power salute

38
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,912
Best producer Claremont

39
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:47,776
They kept their fists raised until the last note of the anthem faded away

40
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:51,616
The gesture was a statement of black pride and defiance

41
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:58,272
It still considered one of the most overtly political statements made in the history of the modern Olympic Games

42
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:06,464
But that wasn't the only politically significant moment at the Olympics that year

43
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:11,840
Mexican hard learning enriqueta basilio became the first woman to ever light the Olympic cauldron

44
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:15,680
Gymnast beat out Soviet gymnast for the overall women's title

45
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:19,264
Does two months after the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia

46
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:25,152
It was also the first time a Latin American city or even a Spanish speaking country that hosted the game

47
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,784
It was a big deal to have hundreds of thousands of international Travelers come visit next

48
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:35,136
The Mexican Government saw the Olympics as an announcement to the world

49
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:37,184
Mexico City had arrived

50
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,488
As a major International Metropolis

51
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:42,816
So almost everything about the 1968 Olympics

52
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,608
Felt revolutionary

53
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,400
Including the design of it

54
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:50,240
The images and logos associated with the 1968 Olympics

55
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,264
Ubiquitous

56
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:54,336
They were plastered all over the city

57
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:58,944
Is complete design campaign will become one of the most famous in Olympic history

58
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,272
And it would set a whole new standard for games to come

59
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:06,880
But these government commission designs would also be co-opted by local activists

60
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:10,720
Who wanted to reveal the darker political reality in Mexico

61
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:13,792
That was hidden behind the beautiful glossy imagery

62
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,584
Of the 1968 games

63
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:22,240
In the decades leading up to the 1968 Olympics

64
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:26,080
Mexico has gone through. Of major economic growth

65
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,384
It became known as the Mexican

66
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:35,808
Toomics an air-cooled typically units historian conventionally speak about it as a. Standing from the

67
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:38,112
Mid-1940s to the late 1960s

68
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:44,000
The country had rapidly industrialized rapidly urbanized and its capital Mexico City

69
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,792
I have grown into this enormous

70
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,072
Sprawling Metropolis

71
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,352
Citigroup

72
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:51,424
Faster than it ever had in Mexico's modern history

73
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,216
That's Luis Castaneda

74
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:55,008
He's the author of spectacular men

75
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:58,080
Mexico design propaganda and the 1968 Olympics

76
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,128
Because of its size and layout

77
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:04,736
Mexico City was a challenging place to host a major International Event like the Olympics

78
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,528
Mexico City with sprawling

79
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,296
Spreading

80
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,320
Still at the height

81
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,088
It's a miracle

82
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:15,488
I mean even until the Olympics are literally about to happen there all these doubts about whether

83
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:19,071
The Mexican Government will be organized enough to undertake the whole

84
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,351
Spectacle of that magnitude

85
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,911
The Olympic organizers needed to show The Parent Trap

86
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:25,471
Safe navigable cohesive

87
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,007
Exciting

88
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:30,079
They wanted to create a visual identity for the Olympics

89
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:34,431
Do wheelies L Mexico City to all these visitors seeing it for the first time

90
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:38,783
So they decided to hold an international competition

91
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:43,391
Define a designer who would create a logo and graphic design campaign for the Olympics

92
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:47,999
They wanted something that looks Cosmopolitan and contemporary

93
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,279
Distinctly Mexican

94
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:52,863
And this is where an unlikely character comes in

95
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:56,703
I'm Lance Wyman I'm a designer I work here in New York

96
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,495
In 1966

97
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:01,567
Lance Wyman was a 29 year old graphic designer

98
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,871
We heard about the competition

99
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:06,943
He knew that he and his design partner Peter Murdock

100
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,479
Had to get on the short list

101
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,247
Chicken tenders

102
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:15,647
This list included design teams from all over the world who would come down to Mexico City for a two-week trial run

103
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:16,927
After their two weeks

104
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,487
Each team represent their design for consideration

105
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:24,863
And we got on the list to go down in November of 1966 and

106
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:28,703
Peter and I had just started out we didn't have any money so

107
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,751
Willie could only afford one way tickets

108
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:33,311
They hopped on the plane with their one way ticket

109
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,335
And landed

110
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,615
In Mexico City

111
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:38,943
By the way neither of them had ever visited Mexico before

112
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,479
They didn't really know

113
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,759
Anything about the country

114
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:44,319
If they were going to design a logo

115
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,599
To represent Mexico

116
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:48,415
Wyman and Murdoch would have to learn a lot

117
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,439
And fast

118
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,487
They started where most tourist

119
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,535
By visiting museums

120
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:56,095
It's been a lot of time at the Museum of anthropology

121
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:58,655
Where they studied artifacts from pre-columbian Mexico

122
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,447
Like the Aztec sun stone

123
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:02,239
An ancient Mayan murals

124
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,519
I actually was

125
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:09,407
Floored by some of the early cultures because they were doing things in the Contemporary way with Jama tree with graphics

126
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:16,063
The Bold lines and bright colors and geometric shapes reminded Wyman of a kind of Opera

127
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,135
Art that was popular among contemporary artist back in New York

128
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,439
Op art or optical art

129
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:26,559
Uses contrast geometry and other tricks to give the viewer the impression of movement

130
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:30,399
And so informed by both indigenous artifacts

131
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,679
And modern

132
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:36,031
Wyman came up with a logo that Rift on the 5 rings of the Olympic symbol

133
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:38,591
I realize that the geometry

134
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,871
Of the Five Rings

135
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,919
To be integrated with the

136
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,967
The year of the event 68

137
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,015
He superimpose the digits

138
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,295
6 + 8

139
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,343
Over the classic Olympic rings

140
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,695
The circles on the Rings rated out on the circles in the digits

141
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,743
And it created a hypnotic

142
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,767
Stripe effect

143
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,839
It's from that I develop the

144
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:02,655
Typography to make the word Mexico

145
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:05,471
It's this very groovy looking typography

146
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,519
Made of three parallel stripes

147
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:11,615
Wyman created a logo that he considered both very modern

148
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,383
Anne Curtis

149
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,151
Essentially Mexican

150
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:18,527
The end of the two weeks came and we started making prints of the next bus 68

151
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:19,295
Logotype

152
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,831
And people from

153
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,623
Publications people from

154
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:25,183
The public relations they wanted copies of it

155
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:28,511
You ain't working like crazy making copies and doing all of that

156
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:32,351
And then one realize that no one actually told him that if he had the job

157
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,887
So we asked one of the organizer

158
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,959
Did we win the easy cuz like I guess so

159
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:45,919
Woman who created this stunning logo in Taipei for the competition but choosing this white guy who would never been to Mexico

160
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,711
Before it was a bit problematic

161
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:51,039
It's not that unusual for people not born in Mecca

162
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:57,183
Bicycle for artists and people in the culture and the Arts to be involved with these kinds of state-sponsored campaigns

163
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:00,767
Set entirely unprecedented but it's still a very unique situation

164
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,815
Especially given the fact that

165
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:06,143
You know this is a this is a very very significant project

166
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,935
That's author Lewis ksenia.

167
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,727
What is very

168
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,519
Striking almost shocking perhaps

169
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,287
Is that

170
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:18,687
The fact that of course Lance Wyman is is very much unproven as a designer is very young and he hasn't had much time to

171
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,967
Did you much yet

172
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,783
And yet somehow he is given this

173
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,063
Very

174
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,623
High degree of responsibility as part of the design camp

175
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:31,487
Wyman and Murdoch ended up staying in Mexico

176
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,535
For two years to work on the campaign

177
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:36,863
And along with a team of designers many of the mechs

178
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:41,471
Mexican they came up with ways to use their typeface logo and other designs

179
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,495
All over the sea

180
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:45,823
Hypnotic Stripes were turned it described uniform

181
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,871
As for the events workers and volunteers

182
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:51,199
The patterns and colors used in the logo ended up on hats

183
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,991
Postage stamps balloons

184
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:53,759
All sorts of

185
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,551
What's the hype theme wedding games

186
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:59,903
And these these objects range from very small objects all kinds of memorabilia

187
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,951
You know things from ashtrays and

188
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,231
Furniture r

189
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:07,327
Apparel all the way to the stadiums

190
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:10,911
Stadiums across the city were painted with these

191
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,703
Radiating op art pattern

192
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:15,519
Bright colors decorated sidewalks

193
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,055
Walzem Plaza

194
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:21,151
Chinese bright hypnotic designs and just give the Olympic Games of visual coherent

195
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,455
The graphic design language of the Olympics

196
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,991
Expanded into an entire system

197
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,783
That helps visitors navigate

198
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,807
The mass of neutron

199
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,343
To do this

200
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,903
Wyman Made Simple color-coded icons

201
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,695
Represent every sporting a

202
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,719
They were

203
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:41,119
Not stick figures but they were they were focused more on no part of the body or piece of the equipment or combination of the two

204
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:45,727
Gymnastics for example was represented by a hand gripping a single suspended ring

205
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:48,799
Track and field head its icon boxing head its icon

206
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:51,359
So on the ticket you knew what your ticket was

207
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,383
Or

208
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,175
Play the icon only

209
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:57,503
If you're visiting from Japan didn't speak any Spanish you'd see

210
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,063
Save the soccer icon on a green background

211
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,879
And you follow the green signs of the stadium where the soccer was

212
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,183
In the system wasn't just for sport

213
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:10,559
Wyman the team made universally understandable icons for 19 cultural events

214
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,095
Happening around the city as well

215
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:17,471
We had children's painting we had folk dancing we had science programming

216
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:21,567
By following these cultural icons visitors could continue to entertain themselves

217
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:24,383
Explore the city after the sporting events were over

218
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:28,479
The 1968 Olympics have been decreed Los juegos De La Paz

219
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:29,759
The games of peace

220
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:36,159
So Wyman designed a little outline of a dove which shop owners all over the city were given to stick in their windows

221
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:41,279
Between the logo the typeface the colors the icons and the doves

222
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:45,375
Wyman created a visual identity that saturated the whole city

223
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,911
It was everywhere

224
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,215
It was a total design campaign

225
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:53,567
Holes I can pay right this design that every single

226
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,639
Thing Idea Place object

227
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:01,503
Associated with the Olympics is immediately and Powerful recognizable part of a whole

228
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:05,599
In the completeness of the campaign would set a precedent for years to come

229
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,135
I think it's safe to say that

230
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,415
Although

231
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,975
Design and architecture and

232
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,767
The Arts in general have been

233
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,327
Very powerful associated with

234
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,095
Olympics

235
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,631
Before Mexico 68

236
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:21,215
It's really after Mexico succeed it becomes a kind of

237
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,495
Standard expectation

238
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:24,031
Design campaigns associated with

239
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,871
Well Lance Wyman was designing the

240
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,407
This extensive campaign

241
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,431
He was holed up

242
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,455
Swamped with work

243
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,503
And he really didn't get a chance to go out

244
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:36,831
Nose to the grindstone really almost through the whole thing

245
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:39,647
We're pretty isolated at the Olympic Committee

246
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:47,327
He didn't see the protest movement growing in the city around him

247
00:11:55,775 --> 00:12:01,407
The movie was led by students who believe the long-ruling institutional revolutionary party

248
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,687
Cater to wealthy next

249
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:06,015
Rather than the poor Rural and working-class

250
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,831
Country have been experiencing

251
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,367
Huge economic growth

252
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,927
The millions of people have been left behind

253
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,975
The Mexican miracle

254
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:15,999
Hadn't reached every

255
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:20,095
The government was talking of the Mexican miracle

256
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:21,887
Even though

257
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,935
In the reality of those days

258
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,983
Things were note that says

259
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:26,751
Happy

260
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,031
Are they appear

261
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:33,919
These are excerpts from interviews with students involved in the protest against Mexico's single-party government

262
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,223
Courtesy of our friends everyday.

263
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:38,527
In 260 Sweetwater Steilacoom

264
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,831
The government control everything

265
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,623
President Swift

266
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,647
Equivalent

267
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,671
Monarchs

268
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:45,695
I mean

269
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,999
It was forbidden to demonstrate

270
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,535
You could not go on

271
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:50,815
Express jewelry

272
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,583
Descendants

273
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,863
And for the students

274
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:56,959
Protesting the government mint protesting against the Olympics themselves

275
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,495
The so-called

276
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,263
Games

277
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:06,687
Olympics are attic Baby By Design By definition always about propaganda on some level or another and so

278
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,735
What the Olympics start to present as a

279
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:13,087
Kind of a happy picture of social harmony and as a n

280
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:15,903
Very sanitized idea of how modernisation happens

281
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,439
Was of course not

282
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:20,767
The reality of what many of these inhabitants of the city experience

283
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:25,119
Tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets

284
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,911
Repeatedly throughout 19

285
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:27,679
58

286
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,471
Wework Urban middle-class

287
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,751
No middle class

288
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,031
Bunch of drunk people

289
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,055
It was

290
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,335
Miss Molly weigh

291
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,103
The Clash

292
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,895
Clovis New Mexico

293
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:37,919
Answer

294
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:38,943
Alone mix

295
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,735
You have the middle class

296
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,271
Eyes closed

297
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,807
Group of students

298
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:44,575
Saying

299
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,367
These was not a democracy

300
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,927
This is not working

301
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:54,559
Again and again please have come out and violently dispersed protesters with clouds of tear gas

302
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,351
As the Olympics near

303
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:59,679
And as International attention turned towards Mexico City

304
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,215
The government was desperate

305
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,007
To make the unrest go away

306
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:08,639
On October 2nd just 10 days before the games of Peace were set to begin

307
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:14,015
Thousands of students gathered at the local Square in the northeast of Mexico City

308
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:18,111
To demand the release of people who have been locked up at a previous protest

309
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:25,791
It was a quiet Gathering of people with signs walking slowly around the Plaza

310
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,863
And with look back and there was all this

311
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,399
Infantry troops

312
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:33,215
They started to Advanced what's a crowd

313
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,751
And at some point

314
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,031
We heard

315
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,311
Sub shops

316
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,359
We didn't know where they came from

317
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,407
And seconds later

318
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,455
How do you say in English

319
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:45,503
All hell broke loose

320
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:55,743
Soldiers opened fire on the protesters

321
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:00,607
To this day we don't know exactly how many students died in the massacre

322
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,167
But the number is likely in the hundred

323
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:07,519
Strickland

324
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:12,383
The scene was cleared before there can be an accurate body count

325
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,175
The blood was washed away

326
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:17,503
Thousands of protesters were arrested and locked up

327
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:20,575
The government took great pains to cover their tracks

328
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,623
The amount of student War

329
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:25,695
Shot and many others were in prison

330
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:28,255
I forgot some time with you no cover.

331
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,815
The government claimed that the students had fired first

332
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,351
To provoke the military

333
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,399
Evidence has since come to light

334
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,935
That disproves I claim

335
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,519
A shocking event

336
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:45,919
For a long time, sir Preston in Mexican national memory and in many ways it is the the Crocs of the cry

337
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:46,943
That's that

338
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,479
Set the stage

339
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,527
For the Nevada day Dramatics

340
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,575
For the Olympics themselves

341
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:56,415
The massacre was so horribly devastating

342
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,439
But of course

343
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,975
Lance Wyman heard about it

344
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:00,255
When I heard about it

345
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:02,047
What how severe it was

346
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:06,143
It was difficult situation because I felt as working for the government and

347
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,679
I couldn't do anything about it

348
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,471
But he says he really empathize

349
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,239
With the student

350
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:14,079
I wasn't much older than they were so late I had that feeling the car

351
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:18,175
Might have felt good if I just walked away from the whole thing

352
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:20,735
Wyman felt Stuck in the Middle

353
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,271
But in a way

354
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:25,087
He didn't need to choose between the governments in the protesters

355
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:28,159
Is designs found a way to serve both sides

356
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:32,511
Students began imitating Wyman's images and co-opting them

357
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:38,911
It took a poster he made with a silhouetted image of Runners racing and turned it into silhouettes of troops

358
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,447
Beating people with baton

359
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,775
Do you say signature typography to create ant

360
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:44,543
A government post

361
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:48,639
And that very simple image of a dove and all the shop windows

362
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:51,967
Students went around the city spring a small burst

363
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:54,527
A bright red paint over the doves chest

364
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:55,807
Like I've been shot

365
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:59,135
They were playing with the propaganda of the Olympics

366
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,951
And hinting at a darker political reality

367
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:03,999
And Wyman

368
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,023
He like that

369
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:07,583
Email design campaign so ubiquitous

370
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,863
So resonant

371
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,143
Better resistance

372
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,167
Could use it to

373
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:14,239
And I've always been questionable where you feel good about that

374
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:17,311
And I guess that's why because I was in a situation where I was

375
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,079
Kind of

376
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,103
Torn

377
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,895
I was very sympathetic

378
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,943
As far as what was happening to the students

379
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,479
But I was also very

380
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,247
Not wanting

381
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,783
To see the Olympics be stopped

382
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,063
And they weren't stop

383
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,855
On October 12th

384
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,135
1968

385
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:33,183
The games began on schedule

386
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,743
As if nothing out of the ordinary had happened

387
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:40,863
Mil novecientos setenta y Ocho

388
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,167
De-cluttering

389
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:46,495
Los juegos olimpicos de Mexico

390
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:55,199
The 1968 Olympics Winona become one of the most important in history of the games

391
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,759
Marked not only by athletic achievement

392
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:00,319
But Buy open political defiance

393
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:04,159
You think you're represented all black athletes and doing this

394
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,463
I can say

395
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,487
I represented

396
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,511
Black America

397
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,303
I'm very proud to be

398
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,327
A black man

399
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,119
And also to have won the gold medal

400
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,215
Mexico 68

401
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,799
Also set a new precedent for how governments would use design

402
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:24,127
To promote their country's image to the International Community

403
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,919
For Better or For Worse

404
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:30,783
The 68 games also left a permanent mark on Mexico City's infrastructure

405
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,927
Mexico City is one of the largest cities in the world

406
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:39,999
If the largest metropolitan area in North America

407
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:45,375
Around 4.4 million people ride on Mexico City's Metro System everyday

408
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:47,167
Including producer Claire Mullen

409
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,703
Who visited a couple months ago

410
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:52,799
I'm in the Metro on the pink line

411
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,591
At Cuauhtemoc

412
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,127
Which

413
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,919
Has an eagle

414
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:58,687
Icon

415
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:02,527
Mexico City's Metro is incredibly crowded and very extensive

416
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:06,623
And yet it is often recognized as one of the easiest rail systems to navigate

417
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,927
Partly because of its iconography

418
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:14,047
La catolica which is a big ship it looks like a pirate ship without the pirate symbol

419
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:18,399
And then we have Merced where there are

420
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,679
6

421
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:23,263
Those icons are there thanks in part

422
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,287
Lance Wyman

423
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,615
The Metro was supposed to make its debut during the Olympics

424
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:31,967
Excavators kept unearthing ancient architecture in the path the tracks

425
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:33,759
And the opening was delayed

426
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:36,575
But women was still involved in its design

427
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:38,111
Specifically it's a map

428
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:43,999
He employed the same visual system he developed the Olympics to help International visitors navigate the trains

429
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:46,303
In the Olympics we relied on the graphics

430
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:49,375
And I thought well why Kansas City do that

431
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:54,495
The Wyman color-coded each line and created a unique icon for every single stop

432
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:59,359
So even if you're visiting from Japan and can't read any Spanish at all

433
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,639
You can say to yourself

434
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:03,455
I want to take the pink line to the stop of the grasshopper on

435
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:06,271
The station at stopped at the chapultepec

436
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,295
Park

437
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:09,343
Chapultepec means grasshopper Hill

438
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:12,415
In the nahuatl the Aztec language should I use the grasshopper

439
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:13,951
Again

440
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:20,351
Some Mexicans took issue with his young Foreigner coming in to design something that would be such a huge part of their City

441
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:24,959
But eventually Mexican designers took up the project and made it their own

442
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:28,543
UI design the first three lines of the Metro

443
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,103
Are all the they have 12 lines

444
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:36,735
Now and they were designed by Mexican designers and some of these are better than I did in the original lion you know

445
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,295
After the Olympics

446
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,575
After the Metro

447
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:42,367
Wyman did some more work from EX

448
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:45,439
Like the design for the 1970 World Cup

449
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,231
But he went back to the US

450
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,791
Why did went on to design more map

451
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:50,815
Big ones

452
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:53,631
Like for the National Zoo in the DC Metro System

453
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:59,519
Although none of them use symbols and icons and colors as completely as in Mexico City

454
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:07,967
The clear iconography of the Metro system is a reminder of a complicated and sometimes terrible. In Mexico

455
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:08,735
Cities history

456
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:13,343
It's a simple design and invites you to explore the massive and complex metrop

457
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:15,903
It's a design that is true

458
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,184
If you get lost

459
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,464
No matter where you're from

460
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,744
What language you speak

461
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,536
You can find your way around

462
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,072
And see the city

463
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,096
For your self

Oakland California

481
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:36,544
Between the beats

482
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,848
Bongs and chatter of our devices

483
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:42,432
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man made sound

484
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:43,456
If

485
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:49,856
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife is

486
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:53,952
Another word for all hearing that voice

487
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:54,720
Technology

488
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:55,488
He talked to us

489
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,792
It is a creation of Sonic trap

Turn the living room lights on

494
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,128
Okay

Dim the living room lights to 50%

496
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:16,736
Okay

497
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:22,880
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

498
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:23,648
Mix

499
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:25,184

A five-part series from Bello radiotopia show the truth

525
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:04,000
The body genius is a Dark comic mystery that whines through a

526
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,792
Treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

527
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,584

Might cost you your life

529
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:14,240
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

530
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:18,592
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

531
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:22,944
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like a dad

532
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:27,552
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

533
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:29,600
Actually if I'm being honest

534
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:31,904
I'm one of the main guy to know how to do that kind of

535
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:39,328
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

536
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:42,656
Was found dead in my private gym

537
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:45,984
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

538
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,336
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

539
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:53,664
Now I need to clear my name

540
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:59,040
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes

541
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,064
To find them
