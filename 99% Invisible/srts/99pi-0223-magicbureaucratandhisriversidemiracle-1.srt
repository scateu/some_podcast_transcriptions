I'm Roman Mars

27
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:11,168
20 years ago

28
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:12,704
Back in 1996

29
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:16,800
A crowd of reporters and politicians gathered in the White House Rose.

30
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:18,848
Vice president

31
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:23,712
President Bill Clinton stepped up to the podium and announced that he was signing a landmark bill

32
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:27,296
They would dramatically redesign welfare

33
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:30,368
The 16 billion-dollar government program

34
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,208
That millions of poor Americans relied on for basic support

35
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:35,232
Today we are

36
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,256
Ending welfare

37
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:38,816
We know in this as well as another Prescott

38
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:41,888
Clinton made it clear that a central tenet to his readers

39
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,448
Was the idea of welfare to work

40
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:46,240
First and foremost

41
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:51,872
It should be about moving people from welfare to work this new reform said that in order to collect welfare

42
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:54,176
Recipients would need to work

43
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:54,944
Better job

44
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,992
Transform a broken system

45
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,808
The traps too many people in a cycle of depend

46
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:02,112
The one that emphasizes work

47
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,136
And Independence

48
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:06,208
Give people on welfare a chance to draw a paycheck

49
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:07,488
Are welfare

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,792
This whole idea of a paycheck

51
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,072
Not a welfare check

52
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,608
Work not welfare

53
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,168
It's relatively familiar to us now

54
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,824
But there's a complicated backstory behind how it came to be at the center of the reforms that President Clinton pass that day

55
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,360
Day in 1996

56
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:26,432
Reforms that still affect many people today

57
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:30,272
Over the last 20 years the number of families living in deep

58
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,040
Poverty

59
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,088
Unless than $2 a day

60
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:33,856
Is rising

61
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:36,928
And most of them don't receive welfare

62
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:37,952
Miss Chrissy Clark

Set from that Siri

68
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,800
It's about a guy who basically

69
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:53,568
Pioneer

70
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,616

71
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,664

00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,736
My name is Lawrence

75
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:01,504
Townsend

76
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,040
Larry for short

77
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:07,392
Larry is 79 retired he's got close-cropped white hair

78
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:13,792
Broad shoulders and a serious face with one of those Army General Smiles that never quite turns up at the edges

79
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:16,352
Today Larry lives in a beached

80
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,632
Town in California

81
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:22,752
Where he drives around in a green Cadillac Seville that has a brass frame around the lights

Play Undead

83
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,056
Into the brass

84
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:25,824
It says

85
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,872
Life works if you work

86
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:28,896
Larry

87
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:29,664
Love's

88
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,432
Work

89
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,712
Just the idea of it

90
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:36,576
He has a binder full of work ethic slogans that he's collected over the years

91
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,368
These are from famous quotes

92
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,672
From all over the world

93
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,208
Alphabetically

Spectre

95
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,304
There's something that way

96
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,328
Just show you

97
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:52,960
He starts with a Aristotle suggested that happiness results from meaningful activity

98
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,240
Goes all the way down

Quantity Tolstoy

00:03:56,032 --> 00:04:00,640
Des Peres a duty of each man to earn his living by the sweat of his brow and calloused hands

101
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,176
Makes independent

102
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,456
A virtuous man

103
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:05,504
Oh that was a little sexist but

104
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,296
That the point is very valid

105
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:11,392
And just as much as Larry Townsend loves the idea of hard work

106
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,416
He hates

107
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,440
Welfare program

108
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:15,488
I've seen so much of damage

109
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,839
Two people that are on welfare they have no hope for a better future

110
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:26,495
They are setting a good example for their children once when Larry was working in County government he noticed two children

111
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,287
Run in the welfare office waiting room

112
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,567
Waiting for their mom

113
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,591
And they were

114
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,359
Tending

115
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,127
Play welfare

116
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,919
What are the children

117
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,479
Was playing the welfare recipient

118
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,807
The other one was Steve playing the eligibility

119
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:43,391
Now you tell me they aren't learning how to get on welfare

120
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,719
Like they were like he's like kids wood Playhouse

121
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:49,535
Playing House in the waiting room while their mother was

122
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:50,559
In the

123
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,839
Office with the

124
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,119
Eligibility

125
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,423
Now they're catching on

126
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,703
About the concept

127
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,471
Getting

128
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,519
Now that one

129
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:04,383
And then there's the story about the two women he says he overheard an elevator one

130
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,527
And that's why I said that the other one is my oldest child's going to become 18th and I won't get welfare benefits

131
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,575
You know I need to get pregnant

132
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:16,927
These are the kind of anecdotes that got told and retold among critics of welfare

133
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,207
Individual moments

134
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:21,279
That may not be typical of welfare recipients in general

135
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:24,607
But for critics B stories represent all the failings

136
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,167
But in the late 1980s

137
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:29,727
Larry suddenly found himself in a position to

138
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,775
To change welfare in a big way

139
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,335
Because he became the head of a welfare

140
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,615
Apartment in a big

141
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,919
Suburban County east of LA called

142
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:38,687
Riverside

143
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,967
The way he saw it

144
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,759
His role in the welfare office

145
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,295
Was to invade

146
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,063
Concur

147
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,855
That was my attitude

148
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,903
Quick history lesson here

149
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:51,487
Since the Great Depression when the program was first signed into law

150
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,535
Welfare had worked pretty simply

151
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,559
At least in theory

152
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,351
If you are a single parent

153
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,631
If your family was poor enough

154
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,935
And if you met a few other technical requirements

155
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,215
You qualified

156
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,239
For welfare check

157
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,519
End of story

158
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,823
There was little expectation that

159
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,103
Mother's woodwork

160
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:12,991
This is James riccio a sociologist who's been studying welfare programs for most of his career

161
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,271
And she's talking about this

162
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,831
Crazy flip-flop that happened over the years

163
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:19,391
Around who we thought deserved welfare

164
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:23,231
When the program began the whole point was to help single mothers

165
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,767
Mostly widows at the time

166
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:28,351
Make ends meet so they could stay out of the workforce

167
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:31,167
Focus on raising their kids into productive citizens

168
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,959
Attitudes begin to change

169
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:34,495
But you really in the 1970s

170
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,519
In early 80s

171
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:39,871
Part of it had to do with the fact that more middle-class mothers were entering the workforce

172
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:43,199
So somewhere asking the question what about mothers on welfare

173
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,479
Shouldn't they have jobs

174
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,247
2

175
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:48,319
Joe Hudson's a labor Economist at Duke and he says

176
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,879
Well most welfare moms did have jobs

177
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,159
At least on and off

178
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,951
There was this persistent group of

179
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,743
Largely single mothers

180
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:59,327
Who stayed on welfare for long periods of time and it didn't work

181
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,351
NL

182
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,655
Are arguably had a life of

183
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,191
Dependence on welfare

184
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:04,959
And that

185
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:09,311
Small but persistent group of completely dependent welfare recipients

186
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,359
Started to get all this Focus

187
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,383
Lot of

188
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,991
Academic attention to this certainly a lot of attention in policy circles to

189
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:19,551
This problem of welfare dependency

190
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:24,415
The View was that you know what's key to changing this was to make

191
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:27,231
Changes in the welfare system which encourage people to work

192
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,023
But then the question was

193
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:29,791
How

194
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,607
Out in the suburbs of Riverside California

195
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:34,655
Larry Townsend had some ideas

196
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:38,495
And his County got a special waiver from state and federal authorities

197
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,543
To try some of those ideas

198
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:43,359
I was absolutely stunned that I was forgiven

199
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,151
Freedom to design a program

200
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,943
To implement a program

201
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:50,271
Higher the staff that are needed

202
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,551
I felt like it was

203
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,319
Honor

204
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,087
Oceanographer

205
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:53,855
Tunity

206
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,903
And it's got a chance to

207
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:56,671
Change

208
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,207
The concept of welfare

209
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:02,047
Larry's changes happened under a California pilot program

210
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:02,815
How to gain

211
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,863
Short for greater Avenues

212
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:05,631
For Independence

213
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:09,471
See what the time in the 80s there was the standard welfare approach

214
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,519
Which is like you make less than x amount

215
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,055
And you get welfare check every month

216
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:19,711
And there were two basic Avenues counties could take to get more of their welfare families closer to Financial

217
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,479
Independence

218
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:23,295
One was the Education and Training route

219
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:27,647
The idea here was to help for single moms who dolphin dropped out of high school

220
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,183
To get more skills

221
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,463
Maybe a GED

222
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,511
To fare better on the job market

223
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,047
But down in Riverside

224
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:36,863
Larry did not have much patience for that approach

225
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,887
His approach

226
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:38,911
Much simpler

227
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,447
Get people into a job

228
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,215
Immediately

229
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:47,359
Don't worry about are you trained enough for do you have enough education just get that

230
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:52,735
We're not going to train you for years we're not going to send you the school for years

231
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,551
We're going to show you how to find

232
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,319
A job

233
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:59,903
No vocational training or GED to get in the workforce

234
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,927
ASAP

235
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:06,559
Anyway you can you can still hear the conviction and Larry's voice talking about this program almost

236
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,839
30 years later

237
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,863
Listen to it

238
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,167
To find a job

239
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:16,543
And the point wasn't to find a perfect job or even a well-paying job

240
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,639
But at least your foot is in the door and how will you succeed

241
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,687
From there is up to you

242
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,455
With

243
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,479
Unimportant cat

244
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,527
If you do not cooperate

245
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,295
With us

246
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,599
We will take you off of welfare

247
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,415
Your children will still get money from us

248
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,439
But you won't

249
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:40,607
The carry out his Jobs first plan Larry restructured his welfare office to run job search

250
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,375
Classes

251
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,655
And job clubs

252
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,423
For welfare

253
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,727
James riccio and Joe Hut

254
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:51,871
The sociologist in The Economist we heard from a minute ago both sat in on some of Riverside's job clubs

255
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:54,943
And they left an impression imagine people sitting

256
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:57,503
In the circle chairs in a circle

257
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,527
There be a job

258
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,551
Club leader

259
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:00,831
Who would

260
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,879
Talk about what it means to work

261
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,927
How to find a job

262
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:08,255
How do you approach potential employers how do you dress

263
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:10,559
Dealing with testy supervisors

264
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:14,911
Eventually the people on welfare would be handed a list of job leads

265
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,935
And the telephone

266
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:19,263
I'm told to start calling around and asking for job

267
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,055
Is Joe Hudson again

268
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,847
And there's a whiteboard right

269
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:27,711
So somebody would get us if you know an interview and it would go up on the board and everybody you know

270
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,503
Pause Gracepoint in cheer

271
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:34,879
This is like going to these Weight Watcher meetings where you know I lost 15 pounds right I got a job offer

272
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:40,255
And that sense of this is exciting we're doing something that's really important and novel

273
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:43,839
You could see had an impact on the the recipient or

274
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,119
Involved in these jobs

275
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,911
But those job clubs

276
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,983
The cheers and the white boards and a Weight Watchers vibe

277
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,775
They were just the beginning

278
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:54,847
Of Larry's plans for the welfare recipients of Riverside

279
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:58,175
Larry says his vision was much

280
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,199
Bigger in

281
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:02,527
Fact welfare recipients with a positive attitude

282
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,295
With

283
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,599
That the beauty and Glory of work

284
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,135
And so I became sort of like

285
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,159
The preacher for work

286
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:13,279
This was a campaign to change hearts and minds and get people excited about getting a job

287
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:15,071
Cymbalta alarm marketing

288
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,119
Booklets posters billboards

289
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,911
Full of welfare-to-work slogan

290
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:24,543
Success depends on your backbone not your Wishbone action turns dreams into reality

291
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,591
Get into gear start a career

292
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:32,479
The messages were printed on bumper stickers to catch the eye of a welfare recipient walking through the welfare office

293
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,247
Parking lot

294
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:36,831
Unbuttons that the welfare intake workers with pin to their love

295
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:43,231
Powell's personally answered nothing as a Target he can't miss out of honestly don't wait for your ship to come in

296
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,511
Men swim out to it

297
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:48,351
But even if you somehow missed these messages on the bumper stickers and

298
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,375
Posters

299
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,167
Pins and outside of envelope

300
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,215
It was especially hard

301
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,239
Kumasi death

302
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,543
I thought music is a

303
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,567
Very inspiration

304
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,335
Go formative

305
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,103
Acacia

306
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,919
And soleri made this CD

307
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,711
Called work makes the

308
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:08,063
Use $2,000 of taxpayer money no authorization

309
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:08,831
To record it

310
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,879
I figured I might get fired over

311
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,159
But he didn't

312
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,439
This is the first track

313
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,207
The title

314
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,511
William

315
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:21,375
The Next Generation

316
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:37,759
Play

317
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:45,439
The music was made to be played in welfare waiting rooms over the PA system

318
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:48,767
To be the hold music when people called up the welfare offices

319
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:51,071
It would play during voicemail greetings

320
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:53,631
I have to say since I first heard me songs

321
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,423
Cannot get them out of my head

322
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,727
There are 10 songs in all

323
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:00,799
Different genres to appeal to different demographic

324
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:04,383
There's a song that features a whole rap

325
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:10,783
Section

326
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,367
And there's a song with the kind of

327
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,903
Slow reggae Jam

328
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:18,719
Get back home

329
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:31,519
Evan there's a jazzy Andrews Sisters 40s style thing

330
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:37,919
It's very hard not to snap your fingers to

331
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,255
But we're not done yet

332
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:55,327
There are also three different versions of a song called

333
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,375
Feels so good to have a job

334
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:03,519
Country

335
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:06,591
Urban contemporary

336
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:13,247
And for the Spanish-speaking audience

337
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,135
And all these songs were written

338
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:19,903
Compose

339
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,183
Produced and recorded

340
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:23,999
By the staff of the department of public social service

341
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,535
Or SPSS

342
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:28,863
Which was the welfare department at Larry Townsend Ranch

343
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,911
What happened was he sent out a memo

344
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:35,263
Paper memo memo

345
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,615
Keith Rogers was working in the Mailroom of DPSS back then

346
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,639
His job was to

347
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,175
To send out the welfare check

348
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:45,247
That's according to one of the songs he would later write

349
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:48,319
Welfare recipients should be envisioning in their path

350
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:55,231
The Memo from Larry said he was looking for volunteers to take some of the work ethic slogans he'd collected

351
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,255
And put them to music

352
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,535
Turn them into songs

353
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:00,863
Keith was a musician The Mailroom thing was just as day job

354
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,423
So when he saw this all set memo he was like

355
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,471
Oh I got a chance to do

356
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:06,495
My thing

357
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:09,567
Let me just go up and whip something up

358
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,359
And then submitted

359
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,639
Tulare Townsend

360
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,175
So after work

361
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,711
Keith sketched out of Melody

362
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:19,039
He still remembers it will first temporary

363
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,343
9 way of life

364
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,391
And he sent a demo over to Larry

365
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,159
I love it

366
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,207
Next and I'm up in his office

367
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,487
He's as naughty

368
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,255
Your

369
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,839
You're not doing well right now you're you're going to be a

370
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,887
Producer you're going to produce my CD

371
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,935
Wow

372
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:38,239
Six months in the studio later with

373
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:42,079
$2,000 of taxpayer money and musical contributions

374
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:45,407
From The Mailroom on up through County social workers

375
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,943
And they had their CD

376
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:50,783
It's worth pointing out that before he worked in the Mailroom

377
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:53,855
Keith had actually been on government assistance himself

378
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:57,439
Back when he was struggling to make it as a musician and in between gigs

379
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,207
Yeah

380
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:00,255
I don't mean I receive Food Stamps

381
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:06,655
You know but that was just something that I needed until I became gainfully employed that was not anything that I wanted

382
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,423
Depend upon

383
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,471
It was temporary not a way of life

384
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:12,543
Oh I knew it wasn't well I try to live off food stamps

385
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,847
Keith was already on board with the message

386
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,383
Getting a job was important

387
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,431
And he was game to spread the word

388
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,479
You know you hearing that beer in a beer

389
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:22,271
Bumps all over in the system

390
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,295
And then

391
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:26,111
You might call at some of the welfare office

392
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,135
Dezeen

393
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:31,487
You know they put you on hold year welfare the temporary way of life

394
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:35,583
And I'm thinking you know you play certain things over and over again

395
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,119
It does have a

396
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:37,887
Subliminal

397
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:39,679
Guess what

398
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,959
I want to find a job

399
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,263
And whether it was the songs themselves

400
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,543
What's or the buttons

401
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,311
The Billboards

402
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:47,359
The bumper stickers the job Club

403
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:50,431
Or the jobs first strategy altogether

404
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,711
Somehow

405
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:53,759
Larry's plan in Riverside

406
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,039
Seemed to work

407
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,391
Three results in Riverside

408
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:00,671
Where

409
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:03,999
The most impressive we had ever seen in a welfare-to-work

410
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,023
Program

411
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,047
Up to that time

412
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:11,935
This is sociologist James riccio again hired by the government to study Riverside

413
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,215
Jobs first program

414
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:16,287
His team followed the families who participated

415
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,823
Cracked what happened to them

416
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,103
First five years

417
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,639
And compared to that

418
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:24,479
To what happened to families who stayed on the plain old welfare program

419
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,503
Or they just got checked

420
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,551
No job clubs are job kept

421
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:31,647
Turns out the ones who participated in the jobs first program

422
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:38,303
Five years later they were doing way better on average earnings that were 42%

423
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,071
Entire

424
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,095
In those

425
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:40,863
Who

426
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,655
That were assigned to the control group

427
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:49,055
They were making 42% more money than the families who hadn't gotten any of the jobs first

428
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:53,919
James also compared the people who went through the jobs first program in Riverside

429
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:58,527
Two people who lived in other parts of the state that emphasized Education First

430
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,831
And the Riverside Jobs first group

431
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:01,855
Came out on top

432
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:02,879
In that comparison

433
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:03,647
Listen to

434
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:07,743
Five years later they were employed more and had higher wages

435
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,279
Funny education first group

436
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,815
And because of all of this

437
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:14,399
Larry Townsend the director became

438
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:19,263
I kind of star in this narrow world of welfare reform

439
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:23,359
But this narrow world of welfare reform was about to widen

440
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:26,943
And play a very big role on the national stage

441
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:31,039
And Larry's get a job any job approach for welfare recipients

442
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:33,855
Became known as Riverside miracle

443
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,391
The Riverside miracle

444
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:42,303
The Riverside Department of Social Services received an award from the Harvard Kennedy School of government

445
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,071
Riverside miracle

446
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:49,471
Got a lot of attention from the national news and I'll just read a few quotes here from The New York Times no Pro

447
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:53,311
Program has done as much to raise the earnings of people on welfare

448
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,615
As one here in Riverside County

449
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:57,151
And from the LA Times

450
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:02,015
Riverside is pursuing a notion so obvious as to be stupefying

451
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:04,063
If you want to get people off welfare

452
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,343
Stay on their backs

453
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,623
Until they get a job

454
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,647
They call me the

455
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:13,023
Magic bureaucrat or something in it it was an editorial page

456
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,815
But I picture

457
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,631
Special over the top

458
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:21,215
Larry has a framed copy of the editorial hanging in his house

459
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:25,055
But in all the news coverage Larry's thoughts about the welfare system

460
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,335
Sometimes revealed

461
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,871
A more aggressive

462
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,663
Then the one you hear in those song

463
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:30,943
In one article

464
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,223
Call from 1993

465
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:36,063
He says that every time he sees a bag lady on the street

466
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,367
He wonders if it's a mother on welfare

467
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,135
Shoe quotes

468
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,927
Hit the menopause wall

469
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:43,231
Who can no longer reproduce and get money to

470
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:43,999
To support herself

471
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:45,791
I asked him about

472
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,583
Please don't go

473
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,423
Well it is out in the

474
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,519
The public record I just wanted to give you an opportunity to

475
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,287
Chicago

476
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,847
I don't know about the need to clarify it

477
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:02,175
Well since we're going into history you know we

478
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:06,527
Part part this whole story is about the history of them

479
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,295
Regard

480
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:10,623
Soleri clearly did not want to talk about this

481
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,671
But I still wanted to know

482
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:16,255
Whether he ever worried some of his welfare-to-work rhetoric

483
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,303
Might be hurtful to people

484
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:23,679
There is this tricky territory it seems like in discussions around this where

485
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,215
There can be

486
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,519
Stereotypes that come up

487
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:31,359
Or feelings of judgement examples at that

488
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,127
Toxic

489
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:32,895
About

490
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:33,919
I'm it was

491
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:39,039
Concept where I was concerned about ladies getting into a nun

492
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:43,647
Unfortunate situation and nobody ever helped them to discover how good they are

493
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,951
And that's all he wanted to say

494
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:50,303
Regardless of what you think about Larry's opinion of work and work ethic

495
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:53,375
And how that applies to who's on welfare and why

496
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:56,703
The fact is these opinions were widely embraced

497
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,775
Eventually Larry story

498
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:01,055
His Riverside miracle

499
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,103
Started getting noticed in political Arena

500
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:07,711
The results in Riverside influence thinking among Republicans and out

501
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:11,039
Many will come to order is one of the continuing

502
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:11,807
Series

503
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,623
And in the Years leading up to welfare reform

504
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:16,672
Larry flute Washington DC

505
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:17,952
Five different times

506
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,488
To testify before Congress

507
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,792
As they debated how to restructure

508
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:22,816
The Summit

509
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,352
16 billion dollar program

510
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,632
If we have heard anything

511
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,168
From the witnesses

512
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,704
The date it is work work

513
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,472
Work

514
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,776
But that will work better

515
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:34,336
And anything else we might consider

516
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,128
The attempt to

517
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:36,896
You're the

518
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:38,176
What we would regard as a

519
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,200
Baby River

520
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:45,344
Welfare United States that's Republican senator Bob Packwood from Oregon in 1990

521
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:49,440
Just a year before welfare reform legislation would be signed into law

522
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:52,000
Impact what dies the Riverside miracle

523
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,024
Would be the key to

524
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:53,792
To fixing welfare

525
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:57,888
Lauren Townsend who's the director of the Department of Public Social Services in

526
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,424
Riverside Middle

527
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,960
Upstanding succession examples

528
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,008
And

529
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,800
Their Larry was in a dark

530
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:07,104
Suit with a big blue button pin to his

531
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,432
Lapel that read self-sufficiency is supporting

532
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,736
Thank your honorable chairman

533
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:13,760
Backwood

534
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:16,832
Larry told the senators all about his welfare to work

535
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:17,600
Programming

536
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:20,160
All the ways he had enlisted his

537
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,184
Staff to promote it

538
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,792
If you call Riverside County and nobody answers the phone will get a work ethic message

539
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,840
We have posters in the

540
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,912
Waiting room we have produced a compact disc

541
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,192
With work ethic music

542
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:34,752
Benefiber

543
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:35,776
Epic music

544
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:38,848
Now what we found commercial reproduce

545
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:39,872
Compact disc

546
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:40,896
And then we started

547
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,688
The new

548
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:49,344
Hi ho hi ho it's off to work we go

549
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:55,488
Eventually the laughter would die down

550
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:59,328
And the Senators would come to take Larry's methods and philosophy

551
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,096
That's seriously

552
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:00,864
As he did

553
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,472
Where is the dismissal of educating welfare recipients as a waste of money and time

554
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:08,288
Is emphasis on getting a job any job

555
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,336
Both those ideas show up

556
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:15,456
In various ways in the welfare reform bill that Congress passed and President Clinton signed

557
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,736
In 1996

558
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:19,040
It had a name that Larry would approve of

559
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:23,392
The personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation

560
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,720
But just a few years after this change was made

561
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:29,792
It came to light that thing that all of this reform was based on

562
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:31,072
The Riverside miracle

563
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:33,632
It turned out it wasn't a miracle after

564
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,936
He just get a job approach

565
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,472
Was it the magic thing

566
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,752
Text that everyone wanted it

567
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,032
Unfortunately

568
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,056
It wasn't that

569
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:43,360
In the early 2000s Joe Hut

570
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,640
The Duke economist

571
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:46,176
Can two other researchers

572
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:48,224
Check the back in on what it happened

573
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,248
To the welfare

574
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:51,040
Pantsuit gone through the Riverside

575
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:51,808
Job first

576
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,624
And they compared their circumstances

577
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,160
The folks who gone through other Pro

578
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:58,464
Sand counties like LA and Alameda

579
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:01,024
But it's focused on Education and Training

580
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,840
What we found was that yes indeed work for

581
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,632
Work better in the first few years out of

582
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:09,216
Treatment but by years 7 and 8 and 9

583
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:11,008
Actually the effect reversed

584
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:13,312
Meaning the people who gotten more education

585
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,336
More skills

586
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:18,688
Rather than being told with buttons and songs and slogans

587
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,480
To just get a job any job

588
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,272
They were doing better

589
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:28,672
They were more likely to be still in work they were making slightly more money and less likely to return to welfare

590
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:29,440
The effects

591
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,976
Of the Riverside miracle

592
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,256
Had all but this

593
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,024
Appeared

594
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:38,912
Joe says the Riverside Miracle had less to do with Larry's work first

595
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:41,216
The tactics and more to do with the fact that

596
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:42,752
In Riverside back then

597
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:45,568
It was a booming job market for low-skilled workers

598
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,176
This plan doesn't work in places where there aren't a lot of low-skilled jobs

599
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,456
When there are jobs out there

600
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:55,296
You can have all the job clubs you want right you can have him calling this many employers is

601
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,064
Is it one

602
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,600
It's not going to change the fact

603
00:24:57,856 --> 00:25:02,208
There are no job and by the late nineties there was a very very little of his kind of Labor

604
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:03,232
Even in Riverside

605
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:06,560
It turned out a better name for the Riverside Miracle might have been

606
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:08,608
It's not as catchy but maybe it's something like

607
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:10,656
The Riverside short-term

608
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:12,448
Spike in the labor market

609
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,824
Was a fluke and

610
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:23,712
That's probably not going to get a sound bite the Riverside Miracle did not look like a miracle

611
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,736
9 years later

612
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:25,760
It didn't

613
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:30,624
Put people on a trajectory that was going to last a lifetime but this discovery

614
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,952
That may be climbing out of poverty and an unpredictable economy

615
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:37,024
Takes more than job clubs and songs that

616
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,584
Did not get the same kind of media play

617
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,376
As the Riverside of Miracle have gotten

618
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:43,424
Because in the meantime

619
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,216
The ship had already left the dock

620
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:46,752
The Riverside miracle

621
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:51,104
Have inspired a whole raft of federal welfare reform legislation

622
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,688
Based on the get a job any job work first mantra

623
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:57,760
And collectively changed how we think about welfare

624
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:59,040
Today we are

625
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,320
Ending welfare as

626
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,088
As we know it

627
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:04,928
And the thought of revisiting and restructuring welfare

628
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:05,952
Again

629
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,512
Just wasn't something that the federal government

630
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:13,376
Or the states that ran welfare-to-work programs had the political will to deal with

631
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:15,680
Cuz their view was how we took care of the

632
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:17,984
25 and we don't need

633
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:21,056
It wouldn't be till later but the weaknesses

634
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:24,128
Is out of the get a job any job welfare-to-work approach

635
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:25,920
Revealed themselves on a big

636
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:26,688
Painful

637
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,480
In the Great Recession

638
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,016
Started in 2008

639
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,808
When job markets crash

640
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:32,576
All over the

641
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,624
Especially for low-wage

642
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:37,696
Joe says the Riverside Miracle had been such a

643
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:39,488
A tantalizing low-cost

644
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,768
Quick fix

645
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:41,536
The poverty

646
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:45,888
Get people off welfare and in the self-sufficiency just Inspire them

647
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,424
Tell them to get jobs

648
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,472
It was a hard approach to let go of

649
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:50,496
Unfortunately

650
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:51,776
After a while we realized

651
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,312
These problems are age-old

652
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,336
It's

653
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:57,152
If it were that simple we would have saw that much earlier

654
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,176
Unfortunately

655
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:01,760
In the people who went through the Riverside Merrick

656
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:04,832
Are still dealing with the Bittersweet aftermath

657
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,880
Okay so we got paid.

658
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,184
A Carl

659
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:13,536
After going through the Riverside jobs program more than 20 years ago

660
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:16,352
Sophia Elsman has been off welfare Everest

661
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,400
For the last decade she's worked

662
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:20,448
In this plus size dress shop

663
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,984
She's a store manager

664
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,056
In charge of a small staff and figuring out where to put

665
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,592
The pink sweaters so they don't

666
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:28,128
Clash with the coral one

667
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:30,944
But this Coral here with this that looks good

668
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:33,248
The fact that Sophia has a job

669
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:36,064
Is evidence that the Riverside Jobs first program

670
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,088
Did have it sick

671
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:37,856
Excessive

672
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:41,440
In fact she was featured in a newspaper article in the early 90s

673
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:43,744
As an example of the Riverside miracle

674
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:46,304
But for a woman in her fifties she has

675
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,840
Physically taxing job

676
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:50,400
She's on her feet all day dragging racks

677
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,936
The clothes from here to there

678
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:52,960
My hands are

679
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:53,728
Screwed up now

680
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,008
I bet crap

681
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:58,848
And for all this she makes less than $15 an hour

682
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:02,944
Sophia lived up to the Riverside program's name

683
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:03,968
Game

684
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,016
She found greater Avenue

685
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:06,784
For Independence

686
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,064
But I asked

687
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:10,368
Do you consider yourself

688
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,648
A games

689
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:12,672
Success story

690
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:17,280
She thought for a long time

691
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:18,816
Yes

692
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:19,584
Endnote

693
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,352
She said

694
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,376
And then she correct

695
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,144
Their self

696
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,424
You know what to tell you

697
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,192
The truth

698
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:26,496
You know I've been working for it like

699
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:28,032
Since I was 14 years old

700
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,568
The work requirements

701
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,336
The job Club

702
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:32,896
They were actually a bit of a distraction she says

703
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:36,480
She'd already had low-wage jobs and she knew how to get them

704
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:38,784
I felt like it was more a hindrance

705
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,552
Tumi

706
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,600
Yes because I

707
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:42,624
I had to go there

708
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:43,648
But

709
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,464
I did what I had to do because they said I had to do it

710
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,232
So I did it

711
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:49,024
Sophia has moved out of

712
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,072
Poverty and off of government assistance

713
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:53,376
But she says she would have done that anyway

714
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:57,728
Welfare was just a temporary bit of help she needed when she had her husband

715
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:02,336
But two decades later she hasn't moved that far out of poverty

716
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:03,872
Things are still tight

717
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,920
And rather than getting pep talks

718
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,712
Find a job any job

719
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:08,736
She wishes

720
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:11,040
She'd had encouragement to get the training to do

721
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:12,064
What she really want

722
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,344
I want to be a nurse

723
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,904
Probably if I got offered

724
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:18,464
The opportunity to go back

725
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,232
Score

726
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:21,024
Right now I could be in a hospital be

727
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,048
RN

728
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,864
Make it a lot more than $15 an hour

729
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:54,304
