I'm Steve Burrows CPA and I'm a professional engineer

33
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:11,072
And when he saw the Great Pyramid in Egypt for the first time he reacted pretty much the way I imagine most people react

34
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:15,168
When you actually come and see something that somewhere in the region of 40 stories high

35
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,216
It was built for Thousand Years

36
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,008
You know you just have this

37
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,800
Incredible wow mount

38
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:29,504
But then that structural engineer brain kicks in every time you look at something you think

39
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,296
Festival how did they do that

40
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,832
Then I start thinking

41
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,112
How would I do

42
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:38,464
In a recent article in design intelligence he took those questions

43
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,232
Head on

44
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:45,120
As if a client gave him a brief to build something like the Great Pyramid today we got these incredible challenges

45
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,936
Why you doing something that's never been done before

46
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,728
So one of The Incredibles

47
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:52,288
Facts for me you was at the Great Pyramid still too

48
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,824
Tallest building in the world

49
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,104
The century

50
00:02:55,872 --> 00:03:00,480
And as someone who in the present-day is hired to Engineers seemingly impossible structures

51
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:07,136
Ceebros thinks that the engineers of 2600 BC really knew what was possible and made most of the major

52
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:07,904
Decision

53
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,440
As a present a engineer

54
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:11,232
So some of the things they knew

55
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,256
Why

56
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:14,304
If they built on the Giza plateau

57
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:16,352
They could put stones that

58
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,632
To a certain pressure

59
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:18,912
On the ground

60
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,192
Didn't collapse beneath

61
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:25,824
You can look at other pyramids and see the previous mistakes that were made out to no

62
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,616
What the ground capacity was

63
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,920
I'm think about determine the size

64
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:30,688
Inside the Great Pyramid

65
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,504
Because if you're going to build the tallest building in the world

66
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,552
How tall do you want it to be

67
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:42,976
Or just a bit taller than the last till this building got to make a decision decision was made for them by

68
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,280
The quality of the ground that they were building up

69
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,304
So that was number one

70
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,584
Secondly they had

71
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,376
The Builder in the Pharaohs life

72
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,424
I'm pretty sure that somebody

73
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,472
You know I can tractor

74
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,240
Set

75
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:58,336
You know with the best will in the world we can only lay this number stands a day

76
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,872
Am I can only Assemble

77
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:05,760
This many men and assembling men to be the right wording here because and I totally miss this

78
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,040
Historical revision

79
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,832
But the consensus now is that

80
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:13,440
It was a rather privileged well treated class of Egyptians that built the pyramids

81
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,208
Not

82
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:14,976
Slaves

83
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,024
That blew my mind

84
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,327
Cecil B Demille is going to be pissed

85
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:22,399
Twenty thousand men can only lay this many times a day

86
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,447
On the ferry typically lives

87
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:26,239
35 years so

88
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:29,567
You know that many men sounds that many stones * 35 years

89
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,615
Means it's going to be this hot

90
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:35,967
So the ground Can Only Hold so much mass without buckling the workers can only build

91
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:38,271
So much an affair with Lifetime and finally

92
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:42,879
The material had to be delivered to the side in time to build the thing

93
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:43,903
And I would think

94
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,671
Depending weather

95
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,439
The Quarry wall

96
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,207
Relative

97
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,487
To the actual sites

98
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,511
Just chosen

99
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,559
Known ground bearing capacity

100
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,095
I'm so sorry

101
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,375
Heightened visibility

102
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:54,655
Cairo

103
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,935
They also I figured out

104
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,983
I can only get so many stones

105
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,263
I only have so much

106
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,799
Ontario off the quality

107
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:01,823
At the Quarry

108
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,615
50 Bros things that these

109
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:07,455
Practical engineering considerations determine the size of pyramid

110
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,223
Tight

111
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,271
The number of stones and ultimately

112
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,807
What we all marveled

113
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,343
Thousands of years later

114
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,391
It wasn't so much missed a class

115
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:16,671
Practical nurse

116
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:22,815
Another practical consideration that led to the pyramids longevity is

117
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,095
Material chemistry

118
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:29,471
There are other agent buildings that I'm not held up as well as the pyramids the buildings are sore

119
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:30,495
I'd lost it

120
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:33,055
Thousands of years

121
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,079
Perfectly well

122
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,127
Sorry it was pretty clear to me that

123
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:38,943
The Egyptians had a pretty good understanding of the material.

124
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,967
What they were working with

125
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,759
But it wasn't

126
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,039
100% perfect

127
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,575
For example

128
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,879
The first large mud brick

129
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:47,903
As I looked

130
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,951
Had Massive Attack

131
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:50,719
Cracks in the

132
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,791
He was very clear to me that they with thermal crack

133
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:56,863
What has happened is that they were used to building walls

134
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,423
But when the world turns a corner

135
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,727
That point becomes very stiff

136
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:05,055
And because the temperatures vary hugely between day and night

137
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07,103
These materials least walls

138
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,127
Binding contract

139
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,407
When it contracts

140
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,711
Masonry will always break

141
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,247
Next to the stick

142
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,551
So every time there was a corner

143
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,575
Found a huge bus

144
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,343
Bicycle crack

145
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:19,391
So they clearly didn't understand

146
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:20,927
The thermal performance

147
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,207
Of mud brick

148
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:27,583
And that problem is exacerbated by the fact that they laid these mud bricks on a mortar bed

149
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,911
So they actually have two materials for building so they do

150
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:31,935
Mud-brick

151
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,215
And Malta

152
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,287
And by putting these different materials together

153
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,847
They thermally move at different amounts

154
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,127
I made crack

155
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,919
So somebody must have said

156
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:44,991
Well if we only use one material lay the bricks dry

157
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,783
Would they have performed better

158
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,831
And the answer is yes

159
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,111
And the pyramids

160
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,391
Are exactly that

161
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:54,207
There is only one material is used

162
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,231
That means

163
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,255
The pyramid st. Louis

164
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,303
I got very hot in the day and very cold at night

165
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:01,631
But the material throughout the pyramid is consistent

166
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,423
I'm so it didn't crack

167
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,983
Because they move together they effectively breathe

168
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,775
And because they breathe

169
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,055
To account for the

170
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,591
Changes in temperature

171
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:13,663
Able to last a long time without cracking and breaking up

172
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:16,479
This prompted Burroughs to think about modern building

173
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:22,111
Where we put so many materials together all the time steel and glass and aluminium

174
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,391
Concrete

175
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,183
Cementitious materials and pasta

176
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:28,767
And I saw you walking round modern buildings in

177
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,815
Looking at where all the cracks where

178
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,863
I know every crack is Italy joints

179
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,911
Between different materials

180
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:37,471
I'm starting to think maybe we could

181
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,799
Think about this a little bit more time if we did

182
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:43,615
We can actually make buildings last longer

183
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,639
Just buy

184
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,687
Thinking hard about those joints

185
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,247
Which presently we solve by putting

186
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:53,599
You know Dewey material in the joint to try and take up that feel movement

187
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:54,623
But if we just

188
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,647
Detailing back

189
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:56,671
In the first

190
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:57,951
They would last

191
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,487
Nothing

192
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:02,047
Galanga buildings lost the most sustainable AR

193
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,327
So long as I live

194
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,375
Materials we use in the long run

195
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:12,543
Longevity is probably the most basic route to sustainability in the pyramids are the poster children for longevity

196
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,223
In addition to chemistry

197
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,527
Adhering to basic principles of physics

198
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:25,855
Keeps your building around for Millennia with little or no maintenance

199
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:28,927
A pyramid is a nice stable shape

200
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:32,767
And I think they would have loved not but it isn't as simple as the way I was thinking about

201
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,559
If I had a bucket of sound

202
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,583
Can I put it on the floor

203
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,375
Then it actually nuts

204
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,655
What makes a pyramid shape

205
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,447
So intuitively

206
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,519
They never the thoughts is a stable thing to do

207
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:46,335
But actually one of the interesting things is

208
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,639
That the gradient of the science of

209
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,967
Is not determined like sand by snot

210
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,503
Natural angle of repose

211
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,807
You can actually make it whatever you want to make it

212
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,111
But you can see from the prior permit

213
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,135
It's from a step pyramid

214
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:02,719
On the bent pyramid the pyramids that preceded the Great Pyramid

215
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:05,535
But they were sort of going a little bit steeper

216
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,327
But they never never really got above

217
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,095
50 degrees

218
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:11,167
I'm cuz I think somebody felt that this is sort of

219
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,471
A maximum angle about which

220
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,495
You should never exceed

221
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:18,079
So get an empirically derived knowledge sets the agenda

222
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,615
If you put these things together

223
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,407
How much Stone you can get

224
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,967
The bearing pressure that you can put on the ground

225
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,247
I'm the angle

226
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,039
United determines the height of

227
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:30,623
The building and I'm pretty sure the simple mathematics in the world between the ark

228
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,415
Engineering contractor

229
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,207
Gave a practical limit

230
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,487
So what could be built

231
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:42,911
This exercise in using engineering principles to augment the archaeological data may give us some insight into why the Great.

232
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,983
That is both the oldest and the largest Pyramid of Giza

233
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:49,055
These people probably thought it was the limit of everything

234
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:55,711
It's the biggest bearing capacity it's a steep as they can go and it says many stones as can be laid in a lifetime

235
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:57,759
You can't do any bigger than that

236
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,551
What's the speed of light

237
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,087
If you like for building permits

238
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:07,487
I know it's no Revelation that the pyramids are well-designed

239
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,767
I'm not an idiot

240
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:14,655
But learning about these practical considerations from Steve Burrows just made me appreciate their Majesty in a new way

241
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,191
These structures are not

242
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,215
Otherworldly

243
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:21,311
You don't need to come up with crazy theories to explain them they are the product

244
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:25,151
Smart Architects and designers and engineers and skilled workers

245
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:28,991
Who played knowledge that was gained over time and passed down over Generations

246
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:33,855
And do that perfectly understandable and repeatable process they discovered

247
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,879
Their limit

248
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,415
I don't get me wrong

249
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:39,743
I don't ever want to see the tallest building we could possibly build

250
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:43,583
But I might like to see the one designed with enough durability

251
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:44,863
Flexibility

252
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,167
The last 4000 years

253
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:53,823
99% invisible was produced by me Roman Mars with support from lunar

254
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,383
Making a difference with creativity

255
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:02,783
It's a project of kalw 91.7 local public radio in San Francisco

256
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,855
Just got in the center for architecture and Design

257
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,135
Define armoire

258
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:09,183
Good websites 99% invisible

The note

264
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:58,847
Before we go I want to tell you about the body genius a five-part series from fellow radiotopia show the truth

265
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:01,407
The body genius is a Dark comic mystery

266
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,943
That whines through a

267
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,991
Treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

268
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,271
We're looking the part

269
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,063
Might cost you your life

270
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:13,183
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

271
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:17,535
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

272
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:21,887
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like a dad

273
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:28,543
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff actually if I'm being honest

274
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:31,871
I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that kind of thing

275
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:38,271
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

276
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:41,599
Was found dead in my private gym

277
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:44,927
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

278
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:49,279
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

279
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,303
Now

280
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,607
I need to clear my name

281
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:59,007
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes to find them

282
