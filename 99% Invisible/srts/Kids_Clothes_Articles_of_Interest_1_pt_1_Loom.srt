00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:32,160
When you crank the gear of the music

28
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:34,464
You make the tune go as fast

29
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,256
Or as slowly as you want

30
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:40,096
As you spend the little handle around and around

31
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:45,472
The music is read from the series of little bumps like Braille

Producer Avery trufelman

33
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:51,104
These little bumps stick up and they hit a series of time

34
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,384
Which creative song

35
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,200
It's a form of storage this is dag Spicer

00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:59,808
Senior curator at the Computer History Museum

37
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,600
Program which is the music

38
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:04,160
You think of that as software even though you

39
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:05,696
Think of it as that

40
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:07,488
That's really what it is it software

41
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:11,584
In this method of data storage series of bumps or series of holes

42
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:14,400
Was also used in player pianos

43
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:17,472
It's also the mechanism behind computer Punch Cards

44
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,008
Ask your grandfather

45
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:24,384
Throughout most of the twentieth century Punch Cards were the dominant form of data processing

46
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,408
Input and output

47
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:27,712
Form paper punch card technology

48
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:30,016
Precursor to electronic computing

49
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:32,832
Was the way that data was stored and tabulated

50
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:36,160
Decades back when computer is would take up a whole room

51
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,696
Best technology

52
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:39,232
Bumps and holes

53
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,512
Is also

54
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:41,536
Why you wearing

55
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,816
What you wearing

56
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:46,656
Write well one of the things you may not know is that an early

57
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:51,008
Automated weaving machine actually has a role to play in the history of computing

58
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:54,336
When he says a weaving machine

59
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,640
Dag is talking about a loom

60
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,176
Illume is gigantic

61
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:01,760
Well there are lots of different kinds of looms in different sizes but

62
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:02,784
Yes

63
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,112
European industrial Looms in the 1700s

64
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,392
We're really

65
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,160
Big

66
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:12,256
About 30 feet high in some cases and maybe 30 ft long and

67
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:14,816
It's an enormous enormous piece of

68
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:20,448
The design in the fabric is determined by how many threads the Weaver goes over or under

69
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,984
Which one's come to the top

70
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,544
Which ones are submerged in the Wii

71
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:29,664
These patterns were so complicated and intricate industrial Weaver's needed to hire

72
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,248
Little delicate fingers to pull the threads and keep track of them

73
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,856
It's on the 17th century this was a job for the draw boy

74
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,904
An actual boy

75
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,440
So your draw boy

76
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:45,024
Would go and say well we need to have the white showing through here

77
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,072
So I pull this one

78
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,608
This one needs to

79
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:53,984
Go all the way through but this one needs to be skipped and on and on until he's pulling these thread this is Chris Garcia

80
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,008
Also a curator

81
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:56,288
The Computer History Museum

82
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,568
It must have been

83
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,360
Murder on fingers

84
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:02,176
Well they were tools created to help the draw boys

85
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,712
Forks and leavers in harnesses

86
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,504
It wasn't all done with bare hands

87
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:06,784
But

88
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,576
It was a lot of work to do

89
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:12,928
You could imagine if you have significantly large item you might have

90
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:13,952
200

91
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,232
Friends that have to be pulled

92
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,791
At the beginning of the eighteenth century

93
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:21,631
Clothes imported from China became All the Rage in France

94
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,959
And a fashion developed for beautiful tiny

95
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,239
Ornate weaving

96
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,799
Making closer little bit finer a little bit

97
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,847
More interesting to look at

98
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,383
You can use a check card

99
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,431
Patterns sophistic

100
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:39,807
The Jacquard Loom was the device invented by Joseph Marie Jacquard

101
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,087
In 1804

102
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:46,719
This is me and you can attach it to the power loom

103
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,487
Nothing it's like

104
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,511
An added feature

105
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,071
People with the word private clubs you can produce

106
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:55,679
Each new fabric design was encoded in thick

107
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,447
Cardboard

108
00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:00,287
Each whole position of the whole represents

109
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,335
A hook on the loom

110
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,895
A hole in the card told the loom yes

111
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:08,735
Lift This Thread is raised or lowered

112
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:11,039
Depends on whether there's a hole or not a hole

113
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,319
Indeed Jakarta

114
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:15,391
Cool cards tied together into a loop

115
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,183
Said automatically

116
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,207
Into the loom

117
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:21,279
In one card represented just one pass of thread

118
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:24,095
But there'll be lots of cards so together

119
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:27,935
And loop of cards went around and around and around

120
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,727
Create a repeating pattern

121
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,775
Just like the music

122
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,311
Encoded in the music box

123
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:37,407
Didn't mean the machine was weaving the cloth automatic

124
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:41,247
It still required a master Weaver and a pattern designer and

125
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,807
But it did mean

126
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,831
The draw boys

127
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:45,855
We're out of a job

128
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:48,159
Once you have a Jacquard mechanism

129
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,951
You don't need the driveway

130
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,487
Half of your

131
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,255
Workforce

132
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,279
Can be eliminated

133
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,327
Manufacturers who wanted to make

134
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:58,655
The most beautiful the most intricate patterns

135
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:01,215
It was increasingly more important than labor

136
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,007
Was intellectual property

137
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,543
The designs

138
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:08,383
In Jacquard Stein people stole these control cards

139
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,943
Because they represented patterns

140
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,223
If they

141
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,783
Patterns for popular could be very lucrative

142
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:21,695
Fashion goes in Styles and everybody comes out with the same stuff every each other almost

143
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,231
The same trends

144
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:27,583
So I like to think of this is the first instance of software piracy

145
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,119
The people are stealing these

146
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,399
Jacquard Loom cards

147
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:36,031
And the Jacquard Loom cards would lead to the development of an entire new industry

148
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,567
I would change the world

149
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,127
In 1890 a German American

150
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,919
Invention in Sherman Hall

151
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:48,575
Devised a solution to the United States Census Bureau has problem of counting all the new

152
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,367
Prince to the country and citizens

153
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,951
Tabulating the census used to take about 10 years

154
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:56,255
So they mean by the time the sentence with finished

155
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,303
Start taking the next one

156
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,095
How old is came up with a sister

157
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:02,399
Where is each individual's information

158
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,679
Punch on cards

159
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,727
It could be process more quickly

160
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,751
Herman Hollerith

161
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,311
Specifically quoted the Jacquard Loom

162
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,591
As his influence

163
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:14,175
His influence for coming up with computer Punch Cards

164
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,199
Once you have

165
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:18,015
Patterns of holes in the card it's now machine-readable

166
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:21,087
And that's how the census was done in 3 years instead of

167
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:26,975
The 1890 census was a huge advance in the history of computing

168
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,023
Now just to wrap up the story

169
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:35,423
Hollaras punch-card patents were actually the foundation for a small company you may have heard of called international business machine

170
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,447
Or IBM

171
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,007
Which in some ways owes its existence

172
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:39,775
To the Moon

173
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:43,615
And to that Rising demand for beautiful ornate pattern

174
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,151
Pictures of fashion

175
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,175
Because of fashion

176
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:52,063
Fashion is just another word for the constant inevitable shifts in popular taste

177
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,599
Garments

178
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,415
Just like buildings and cars and movies

179
00:07:57,183 --> 00:08:00,767
Reflect the circumstances of Our Moment in history

180
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:03,327
That's what fashion is

181
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,631
Another way of telling time

182
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:06,911
Back

183
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,215
And back and forth

184
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,519
Around and around

185
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:15,103
Tulum inspired as the computer

186
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:18,431
Computer changed the way we think about clothes

187
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,967
Clothing and culture

188
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:20,991
Impact each other

189
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,807
We need to dedicate some serious time

190
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,855
The talking about what we wear

191
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,391
So that's what we're going to do

192
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:34,303
The past eight years we've asked you to start noticing elements in architecture and design because architecture

193
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,583
Is the art we live in

194
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,631
The medium in which we move

195
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,911
Influencing us

196
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,959
In a thousand invisible waves

197
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:44,031
The next three weeks we're going to ask you to do the same

198
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:46,847
With another Universal art that we all live in

199
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,127
Clothing

200
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:51,711
It's our first spin-off show hosted by Avery

201
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,503
Cold articles of Interest

202
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,039
I'll be right here

203
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:55,807
Twice a week

204
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:58,623
For the next 3 weeks in your 99.

205
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:01,439
We'll have the first episode after this break

206
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,487
About what happened to working children

207
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,023
Like those draw boys

208
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,559
And how their clothing change

209
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:12,959
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices

210
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:16,543
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man made sound

211
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:17,567
If

212
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:23,967
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife isn't

213
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,599
Technology talk to us

214
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,903
It is a creation of Sonic trash

215
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:34,975
Mets Joel Beckerman he's a sound designer and composer

216
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:38,559
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

217
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,607
To make them more human

218
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,447
Turn the living room lights on

219
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,239
Okay

220
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,799
Dim the living room lights to 50%

221
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,847
Okay

222
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:56,991
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

223
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:59,295
Makes for a much more natural

224
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,063
Experience

225
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,855
Turn the living room lights on

226
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,183
Dim the living room lights

227
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,207
50%

228
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:13,631
We're presenting two special episodes from 99percentinvisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

229
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:16,447
About how are soundscape is impacting our health

230
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,007
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:21,823
Look for them Fridays May 17th and May 24th

232
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,591

00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:34,879
Constipation abdominal pain and bloating

235
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:35,647
Routine

236
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,695
Thinking about it all the time is frustrating

237
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:44,095
It doesn't have to Define if you're constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again and you don't know why

Can't explain it

250
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:17,631
My friend and colleague Joe Rosenberg is a really good dresser

251
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,935
He just had this Rich understanding of

252
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:20,959
Styles and cuts

253
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,775

What I wear

259
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,759
Joe shops in kids sizes

260
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,783
I'm forfeiting

261
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,319
I guess you could say I'm a

262
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:39,903
But

263
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,719
I don't think myself

264
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,511
I'm just the size

265
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,047
10 year old

266
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,143
Joe doesn't have the typical dimensions of someone with dwarfism

267
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,935
Just called

268
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,703
Pronunciation

269
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,239
I'm spondylo

270
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,543
Dysplasia

271
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:57,567
It's a mutation

272
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,151
To demonstrate out Rarity

273
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:02,943
My entire life

274
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,991
Only have one occasion to meet someone

275
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,295
Who was my height and was short in the way I was short

276
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,087
Harding College

277
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,671
And we talked about

278
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:24,447
Articles of Interest a show about what we wear and so maybe the ideas about clothes

279
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:30,847
Ideas about craft modular home to a piece of cloth

280
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,527
But if you ain't got the attitude install the car at all

281
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:41,599
Manuel District closed.

282
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:45,439
Close our records of the bodies we've lived in

283
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:46,975
Think of an old

284
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,511
What are you used to have that's

285
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,047
Just not your style anymore

286
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,863
Or jeans with us aren't your size anymore

287
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,935
We are like snakes to shed our skins

288
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,727
And grow new ones as we age

289
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,519
And it all starts

290
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,543
In the kids.

291
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:05,151
Oh wow Joe and I went to J.Crew together

292
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:10,527
He was pretty much ready to give up as soon as we walked in a vignette

293
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,319
Kids section was

294
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,343
One row

295
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,391
And everything in it was very loud

296
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,695
This shirt glows in the dark

297
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,487
Has many

298
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,279
Tie-dye bicycles on it

299
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:25,119
So many stripes that maybe it almost were

300
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:32,799
The color palette of the children's Department tends to be really bright and way over decorated as Joanne died

301
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,079
Debriefed in his car

302
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,431
Short person having shop for kids clothes

303
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,479
Is that your life is just

304
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,759
Desales game

305
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:42,783
I've liked

306
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:48,927
Ripped jeans and deliberate patches and fun slogans and crazy zippers

307
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,999
Bold colors and prints and the idea that you're

308
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:54,815
Slim

309
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:56,863
Jeans

310
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,143
Enough

311
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:58,911
Subtle

312
00:13:59,423 --> 00:13:59,935
Hugh

313
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,215
Dark wash

314
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,519
It just doesn't matter

315
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:06,079
It almost makes no sense

316
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,127
You'd think that we would also

317
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,431
Start as young blank canvases

318
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:12,735
Dressed in shades of white and gray

319
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:15,807
Slowly acquiring more and more colors

320
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,087
Moore graphics

321
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:21,951
More signifiers of we are as we age and solidify into ourselves

322
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:27,327
Finally retire in jeans that we've ripped and distressed and patched ourselves

323
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:32,191
Paired with graphic t-shirts that list all the bands TV shows we've watched

324
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:34,495
Cities we've visited throughout our lives

325
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,287
But no

326
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,359
All that decoration and phony self-expression

327
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:42,943
Is put in a blender with birthday cake in sequence and then

328
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,223
Put in a hanger on a rack

329
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:47,039
That's the kids section

330
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,063
It's really bad

331
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,855
And actually even if I'm just

332
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,391
Slightly

333
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,975
So how did we get here

334
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:59,071
Where did the style we call children's clothes come from

335
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,887
Children's clothes haven't always been a thing

336
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:04,703
And historically especially in the United States

337
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:06,495
Childhood itself

338
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,775
Was a luxury

339
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,311
Cuz you have working children

340
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,359
Parents Sue

341
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,639
Are not slaves

342
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,407
But have to work

343
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,175
Can the children

344
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:14,943
2

345
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:15,711
Are slaves

346
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,479
But have to work

347
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:17,759
And maybe.

348
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:18,783
Have a childhood much

349
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,551
Billy at all

350
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,343
This is Erin lgo

351
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,903
She's the curator at the lacis Museum of lace and tie

352
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,927
Textiles in Berkeley

353
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:27,487
Some children always clean and some children always

354
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:29,791
That's class

355
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,071
What are some of the slave

356
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:33,887
Free The Children who are not considered

357
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,167
Clean or precious

358
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:35,935
Didn't get

359
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,703
Children's clothes

360
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:39,775
I'm sure you seen pictures of children that are working

361
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,567
And they do book my

362
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:42,335
Mobile.

363
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,615
As they're standing in the

364
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,383
Cotton mill

365
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,175
Boys at the down and work in the mines

366
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:49,247
Basically poor children were given what was around

367
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:53,855
Well upper-class children had the privilege of being deliberately dressed

368
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:58,207
And although fancy children were also sometimes dressed like little adults

369
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:00,511
Underneath their clothes

370
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,815
A lot of them were wearing corsets

371
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,863
Parents want to raise you Crackle

372
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,143
They would put you

373
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,423
Boys and girls in cursive

374
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:10,495
There's a whole idea that children had to be cultivated

375
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,031
Like a dog in a harness

376
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,823
Or flower on a trellis

377
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,871
Nova courses for not as intense

378
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,407
As older women wore

379
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,687
But yes please

380
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,735
Who's considered

381
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:21,759
That you would be in

382
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:24,319
And although it happened slowly

383
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:27,903
The demise of the child corset is thanks to philosophers

384
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,439
Jean-Jacques Rousseau

385
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:32,255
A concept of childhood that we have now

386
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,047
Was really formed

387
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,607
In 1762

388
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,887
Rousseau wrote

389
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:42,239
Hold childhood in reverence

390
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:46,079
I do not be in any hurry to judge it for good or for ill

391
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,639
Give nature time to work

392
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,431
Before you take over her business

393
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:55,551
Less you interfere with her dealings the time childhood is

394
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,087
In the 18th century

395
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,111
Close

396
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,135
Just for child

397
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:02,463
And they look different than adult clothes

398
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,743
Annies close

399
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,279
Children are dressed up

400
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:07,327
For the occasion of their youth

401
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,911
This amazing time free from cares

402
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:14,751
Separate from the rest of their lives

403
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:17,311
When we look at them today we can't believe anyone

404
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:21,663
They may have been easier to move in then a corset

405
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,967
But these clothes are still really formal

406
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:27,039
Like embroidered dresses for girls and boxy little suits

407
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:27,807
For boys

408
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,879
But it just looks like a little suit I guess

409
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:33,439
I know it is it is adorable actually

410
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:37,023
Two children are wearing these adorable mini me get up

411
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,583
It's almost like a parody of adulthood

412
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:42,655
Stuff meant to look like adult clothes

413
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:45,215
That adults would never actually wear

414
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,775
Which is what we see now in the kids Department

415
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:53,151
It has everything to do with our evolving concepts of childhood

416
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,175
And how much

417
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:57,759
Freedom and protection we think children ought to have

418
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,831
Because although their corsets are long gone

419
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,879
Children are still bound

420
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,183
By legal requirements

421
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:07,231
What what is this thing you gave me

422
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:13,119
This is from the NRA no not that NRA National Association of

423
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:13,887
Australia

424
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:16,447
My friend Morgan is not Australian

425
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:19,775
See the technical designer for a big children's clothing company

426
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:24,127
She'd rather not say which one one of the major children's clothing retailers

427
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,151
In the United States

428
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:30,015
Her company has many many many rules about what can and cannot be until it's closed

429
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:32,063
But those rules are top secret

430
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,879
Don't Morgan brought me that Australian safety guy

431
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:37,439
Because it's kind of similar and it gives you a rough idea

432
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,207
276

433
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:38,975
Pages

434
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,255
Long

435
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,023
And thorough

436
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:43,583
And it goes through at the beginning

437
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,631
The way you assess risk

438
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:48,191
Which is high to low based on

439
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,727
A kid could die from it

440
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:56,383
You don't want choking hazards no sharp edges and no drawstrings

441
00:18:56,639 --> 00:19:02,783
Injuries and deaths occur in would not tacos or cord ends to come snatch your cotton to moving parts or closing doors

442
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,599
Naruto dress that you can't have

443
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:09,439
A car that's longer than three inches and that goes all the way up to

444
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:15,071
12 years in the United States sometimes in the kids section you can see drawstrings on hoodies or sweatpants

445
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:21,727
But those are actually function there just decorative

446
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:25,823
It's basically so that kids can look like little adults

447
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:28,895
Without running the risks of adult dressing

448
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:35,295
To the clothing companies don't get in trouble you can get sued for sure if you could kill kids you know

449
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:38,367
You're not doing it just for the sense of morality

450
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:44,767
These guidelines are the cobbled-together aftermath of a series of disasters

451
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:51,167
Every time an item is recalled or clothing company gets sued for endangering a child the guidelines get revised

452
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:51,935
Or Titan

453
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:54,751
I'm one of the biggest legal differences

454
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:57,311
Between children and adult clothes

455
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,103
Is flammability

456
00:19:59,359 --> 00:19:59,871
Flame retardant

457
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:02,943
Everything has to be flame retardant if they're sleeping

458
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,991
If a child is going to sleep in it

459
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:05,759
The fabric

460
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,039
Has to be flame retard

461
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,831
And the Garment has to

462
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:09,855
Fit tight

463
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,647
They are concerned about

464
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,695
Candles Night Lights

465
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:14,975
Fires in house

466
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:16,511
Whatever could happen if

467
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:20,095
Their kid is wearing loose-fitting clothing and it's hanging this from YouTube

468
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,375
How about an ox

469
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,935
Give you a bunch of third-degree Burns

470
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:26,495
Anything that could potentially be sleepwear

471
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,799
How to renew your skin tighten a city climbers

472
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:29,567
Distance of that

473
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,383
And this

474
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:37,247
Starts to get at our question about why kids clothes look the way they do

475
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:41,343
Because note how Morgan said anything that could

476
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:43,391
Potentially be sleepwear

477
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:47,487
Probability rules don't just apply to clothes labeled as pajamas

478
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:50,559
They could apply to Any Garment apparel

479
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:54,143
Put the kids to sleep in for that a kid decides that they want to sleep in it

480
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,959
So anything that is comfortable or soft

481
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:00,799
Which means that kids clothing if it's not sleepwear

482
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:04,895
Have to go through great pains to prove that it's not sleepwear

483
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:08,735
So that they don't have to meet all those flammability in size requirements

484
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:13,599
So let's say you're trying to design kid clothes that are not for sleeping

485
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:17,952
They can't have pictures of anything that could be interpreted as

486
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,232
Weepy like what is

487
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:25,632
Pictured on it is it sleeping animals is it a sleepy scene that make you feel sleepy if it makes you feel sleepy

488
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,168
Knit sleepwear

489
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:30,752
Sono images of the moon no images of stars

490
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:33,824
And no clouds

491
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,432
Your legal department at your company like you can't do that cuz that makes me feel like sleep

492
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,200
And then

493
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,224
Certain animals

494
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,248
Like I will

495
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:43,552
Same with other nocturnal creatures like bat

496
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:49,440
Unless you're designing a Halloween line and you really really really want to have a shirt with a bat on it

497
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:55,072
But enough is on Halloween in that had enough like sequins on it or something maybe you can get away with it

498
00:21:55,584 --> 00:22:01,728
Sequence of good way to show garment is not for sleeping same with glitter and Action Graphics and bright colors in order

499
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:05,056
You could bring it enough out of sleepwear.

500
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,592
The kid would never want to sleep on

501
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:10,432
A jacket or something like that

502
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,016
It's decoration as a form of protection

503
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:18,880
Sending kids from fire and also protecting the companies from liability

504
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:21,952
Sometimes behind the glitter and garishness

505
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,232
It illegal subjects

506
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:24,768
Sometimes

507
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:31,168
Not all the time I would say that that they believe that they're giving you something more special

508
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,704
Something more marketable

509
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,496
By putting tchotchkes

510
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,264
On the Garmin

511
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:41,152
This is Lana Hogue the industry expert has been working in garment development and production for over 30 years

512
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,688
And the sequence

513
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,480
Are usually to appeal

514
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,272
To the child

515
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,808
Pets groups in focus

516
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:55,488
You know I think they should more I have not seen that anywhere really I worked

517
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,768
Manufacturers will ask

518
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:59,328
Parents what they're looking for in terms of styles

519
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,120
But not the kids themselves

520
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:06,496
Probably the closest they've come to focus groups and test groups

521
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:11,616
Where the photo shoots well and fit sessions we want to see how something fits but if they're kind of

522
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,432
And they want out of it

523
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:21,088
Then you know that that's probably just a special occasion

524
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:21,856
Cancel

525
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:23,136
A garment because

526
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:26,208
Kid didn't like it personally they don't

527
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:26,976
Estelle

528
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:30,304
The loudness of a kid's department has to do with safety rules

529
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,328
But not entirely

530
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:37,728
So it's not because of flammability it's because of what kids want but we don't ask kids what they want

531
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:40,032
Exactly now I think you're right

532
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:42,848
But if you took a child into the store

533
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,640
And you're walking around

534
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:46,432
A lot of them are drunk

535
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:48,992
To the the silly things hanging off a Garmin

536
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:55,648
But only up until a certain age and I think that kids go through a really awkward. Where they're trying to figure

537
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:56,416
Route

538
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:58,976
What school again cuz they don't trust their

539
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:00,256
There

540
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,536
Previous

541
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,560
Chase

542
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:03,328
Hello

543
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:05,376
This is true for anyone at any age

544
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,912
We move out of one face

545
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:07,936
And into the next

546
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,472
Unless you are trapped

547
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,752
In the children's section

548
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,056
And forever relegated

549
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,080
Phyllis bright

550
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,104
Loud

551
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:17,152
Strange way of dressing

552
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:24,832
The piece of paper

553
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,952
Words from yes

554
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,632
