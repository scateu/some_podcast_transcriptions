This is 99% invisible

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,608
I'm Roman Mars

23
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,192
Tell quick announcement before we start

24
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:17,056
Earlier this year I went to the Ted conference in Vancouver and I gave it talk about flag design

25
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:19,360
It was an incredible experience

26
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:20,640
And even though

27
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:23,456
There's a little bit of skepticism when I started the talk

28
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:24,736
You know when everyone

29
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:31,392
Learned that it was really going to be about 5 design the talk totally won over the crowd and I got a standing ovation

30
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:33,696
It was a real highlight of my career

31
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:36,000
And last week the video was finally released

32
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:38,560
So I really hope everyone who listens the show

33
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,584
Go watch it

34
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,352
Insurance

35
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,376
You're going to dig out

36
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:44,704
The cool part is that let me perform the talk

37
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:51,360
Like a radio piece instead of the normal Ted talk I'm sitting down and playing audio clips and talking over music

38
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,384
If it wants to get there

39
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:54,176
See my face while I do it

40
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:59,040
If you've been listening to 99percentinvisible for a while and you know that one of the thorns in my side

41
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,344
Is the city flag of San Francisco

42
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,904
If you're not familiar with that flag

43
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,696
You'll see the video it's not

44
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:06,976
Anyway

45
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:11,584
99 P I had some fans at the company Autodesk maybe don't know Autodesk

46
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,864
All you need to know is this

47
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:13,888
If

48
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:20,288
The thing you're looking at exists in three dimensions in the real world that object was probably design

49
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:22,080
Find on Autodesk software

50
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:25,408
So Autodesk has this big office in San Francisco

51
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,944
And they saw the TED Talk

52
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,040
It suggested that we partner together and help plan a redesign

53
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,832
Of the San Francisco flag

54
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:35,392

Thanks so much

70
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,728
This is 99% invisible I'm Roman Mars

71
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:28,384
The office of the chief medical examiner in Baltimore Maryland is a busy place

72
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:33,248
Anyone who dies unexpectedly in the state of Maryland will end up there for an autopsy

73
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:36,576
On an average day they might perform 12 autopsies

74
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,880
I have your day they might do more than 20

75
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,952
The building is 6 stories tall

76
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,000
Around 80 people are employed there

77
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,560
All day long please are coming in and out

78
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:49,120
People are calling about their deceased loved ones

79
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,424
The Press is calling with enquiries

80
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:54,240
But there's this one room on the fourth floor

81
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:57,312
That sits apart from the buzz of normal Act

82
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,336
Tivity in the bill

83
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:02,432
Producer Katie mingle was just there in Baltimore

84
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:05,504
This room feels a bit more like an art gallery

85
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:06,528
Because

86
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,576
Well it is kind of an art gallery

87
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:11,136
It houses the nutshell studies

88
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:14,464
Which of these miniature dollhouse like dioramas

89
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,256
And each one is a different

90
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,024
Scene

91
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:20,863
There's a kitchen Log Cabin a barn a bathroom

92
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,911
There are 18 different scenes

93
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:25,727
And each scene has different tiny features

94
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:26,751
I need furniture

95
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,799
I need Windows and Doors Atlanta

96
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,359
And they're also tiny people

97
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,383
Dolls

98
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,407
In each scene

99
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,223
And all of the tiny people in these scenes

100
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,271
Have one thing in common

101
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,063
They're all

102
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:40,831
Death

103
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:47,487
When you look at a nutshell diorama you're looking for clues about how the person or persons died

104
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,279
Was it a suicide

105
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,559
Homicide

106
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,095
An accidental death

107
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,399
The guns are you obviously going to get a lot of evidence off

108
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,679
Forgotten so why would

109
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,959
So when I came in and murdered

110
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,239
Why would they leave a gun

111
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:05,407
So I said a minute ago that the nutshell room is usually a quiet sanctuary in an otherwise busy off

112
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:07,967
Usually

113
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,271
But this week there are quite a few

114
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,039
People in here

115
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:16,415
They're mostly police a few FBI and they're here for a week-long seminar

116
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,695
A homicide

117
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:19,743
Is that you know maybe he

118
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:23,839
Attendees will hear speakers Delsea an autopsy

119
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:27,935
And will be broken into groups and assigned a nutshell diorama

120
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:33,055
At the end of the week I'll be asking for that their theories of what happened in their dioramas

121
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:40,479
This group is looking at one of the few multi-room. Tell studies

122
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,503
Point gets in the bed

123
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,807
And then fall asleep.

124
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,575
But he tries

125
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,599
Compare under him

126
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:51,487
He might have thrown it off before him just one room in about the size of a shoebox

127
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,559
This one is a little bigger and has three rooms

128
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,839
Plus a porch

129
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:59,935
It's in a glass case so you can look down and see the interior

130
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:02,495
House from above he doesn't

131
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:05,055
Inject around until it comes into the the baby's room

132
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,639
The scene is of a lovely well-kept Suburban home

133
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,943
There are lace doilies on the tables

134
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,503
Flower print linoleum in the kitchen

135
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:14,783
And blood

136
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,063
Everywhere

137
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:20,671
In the bedroom a husband and wife are dead from gunshot wounds

138
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:24,511
In another room a baby has been shot dead in her crib

139
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:28,095
Blood is splattered all over the pink wallpaper

140
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,887
It's a gruesome saying

141
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,215
It was supposed to be a murder-suicide with him and his wife

142
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,751
He wanted the neighbors

143
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:35,519
Casinos near me

144
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,079
The seminar that brought these folks

145
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:42,175
Have been happening every year for the last 70 years

146
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,223
And the person who started it

147
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,319
Is the same person who made the little death scene dioramas

148
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:54,975
Her name was Frances glessner Lee and her work in the field of forensics has shaped just about everything that

149
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:59,071
It happened inside the office of the chief medical examiner in Baltimore Maryland

150
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,375
To tell her story

151
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,655
I want to introduce you to

152
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,423
A couple of people

153
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,959
Medical examiner's office

154
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,751
Are you can call our investigations to

155
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,799
That's Bruce Goldfarb

156
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:11,615
And I'm the executive assistant to the chief

157
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,151
Medical examiner for the state of Maryland

158
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:16,223
And this is Karin I am Korean box

Author of The nutshell studies of unexplained death

162
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:25,951
Prince spent seven years researching Frances glessner Lee

163
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:32,095
Frances glessner Lee would have loved the opportunity to study medicine and going to college but her parents were not to

164
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:32,863
What about that

165
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,959
This was around 1900 women weren't really going to medical school

166
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,263
Her brother got to go though of course

167
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,543
And he brought a friend home one

168
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,847
A guy by the name of George McCrae

169
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:47,199
Who is a pioneering medical examiner

170
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:51,295
And when you come to visit he tell her stories about cases he was

171

She was supposed to be a proper Society lady with Lady Hobbies

174
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,303
Take me to work

175
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:05,887
Interest in death wasn't really

176
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:06,911
Courage to buy her

177
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,679
Family

178
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,215
Which meant for years

179
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,751
She quietly studied it

180
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,543
Pictures of operations reader

181
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,591
You're talking to experts

182
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,383
Getting first-hand experience

183
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,151
Bye

184
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,431
Going to

185
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,455
Crime scene

186
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:23,551
And then came to realize that people were getting away with murder literally

187
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,343
Police would routinely pot

188
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,111
Investigate

189
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,207
They would contaminate crime scenes move bodies do things that

190
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:32,767
Today will be obviously you don't don't do that

191
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,071
But at the time they didn't know any better

192
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:40,447
Beyond that the police just didn't know how to get information from the scenes

193
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,751
Another might not realize the significance of

194
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,055
You know a pile of cigarettes

195
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,079
Sore

196
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,895
The positioning of a firearm

197
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:50,431
And the other thing was

198
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,199
Autopsy

199
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:55,039
Either weren't being done at all or being done by doctors

200
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,343
With no specific training in forensic

201
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:01,951
Eventually Lee's parents and her brother passed away

202
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,487
She was in her 50s by then

203
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:08,863
And she finally had access to the family money and agency to do what she wanted

204
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,911
1936

205
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,191
Money

206
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:14,239
To Harvard University to establish

207
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:17,055
The first program in legal medicine to train.

208
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:19,359
And make them medical examiners

209
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:25,759
Amanda in 1945 least arts and presides over these week-long training seminars for police

210
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,807
The ones that are still going on today

211
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,623
She wanted to displease some other things

212
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:34,463
How to gather Clues from a crime scene of course in terms of his

213
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:37,535
Legalities and time constraints and weren't actually able to visit

214
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,839
A crime scene during the seminars

215
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:46,239
We decided to build miniature death scenes for the police to study each one will be based on a real

216
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:52,127
The nutshell studies of unexplained death basically she would come up with

217
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,687
That Concept in the design and

218
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,223
Carpenter would drop

219
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,503
The blueprints

220
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,551
Scale of an inch to a foot

221
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:05,951
Lee's Carpenter belt the structural frame the room exactly as you would a real life size rim wheel studs

222
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,487
Real doors with real locks

223
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:12,095
Worked Lee handled all the figures and the textiles the rugs and drapes

224
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,399
Some tiny clothes on the tiny figures

225
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,215
Finally those Society lady skills

226
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,495
For being put to use

227
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:23,359
She wouldn't it the stockings with needles aside to straight pins using a magnifying glass and of course

228
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:26,687
She can only work for like a few seconds before her eyes which

229
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,455
Fatigue

230
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:33,855
The figures in the nachos also sometimes show rigor mortis which is a post-mortem stiffening of the body

231
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:40,255
And lividity which is the way the blood pools or settles in the body after death both provide clues

232
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,303
Set the how and when a person die

233
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:45,375
The detail in the nutshells is bordering on abs

234
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,143
Excessive

235
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,727
In one an ashtray overflows with tiny cigarettes

236
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,567
Made with real tobacco and rolled by Lee herself

237
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,847
Each one burn

238
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,127
And then stopped out

239
00:10:56,383 --> 00:11:02,527
The coffee pot she has there's a stranger inside and coffee grounds in it

240
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:05,087
We were life is you know you going to somebody's home

241
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:07,391
They can have a bag of drugs

242
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:10,975
But a weapon over here and I have a heart attack it may or may not mean anything

243
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,863
Frances glessner Lee spared no expense on her dioramas

244
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,143
Lavished

245
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:18,911
Love

246
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:19,935
Aunt Annies

247
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,471
Brutal crime scenes

248
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,031
Each one took about six months

249
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:26,079
At around $6,000

250
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:30,175
That's about the same amount of time and money it would cost

251
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,199
To build a real house

252
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,223
The 1940

253
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,759
Lease out like if

254
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,807
The policeman looked at them

255
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,855
And so any fault in her

256
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,647
And take some seriously you know

257
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,183
They won't learn from them

258
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:41,951
So

259
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,999
That's why she felt like everything had to be

260
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:44,767
Be done

261
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:45,535
Perfectly

262
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:51,935
Of course Frances glessner Lee was always trying to be taken seriously and they all male world

263
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,703
She had entered

264
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:57,567
She was ultimately both respected and adored by the police that she worked with

265
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,895
The week-long seminar she led were thought to be the best

266
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,455
Training homicide detectives could receive

267
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:06,527
And they're still thought of that way actually even today

268
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:13,183
After Frances glessner Lee died in 1962 the program so you find it at Harvard including the week-long summer

269
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,207
Branded

270
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:16,255
In the nut shells were put in storage

271
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,047
Possibly headed for the trash

272
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:24,703
And then the medical examiner in Baltimore at the time a guy named Russell Fischer who was a former student of

273
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,495
Please programs at Harvard

274
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,287
Stepped in and said

275
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:32,383
Will do it will do somewhere and it will just pick it up here in Maryland

276
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:38,783
And they brought the Nationals down and so it's been the seminar and the Nationals been used here since 1969

277
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,063
68

278
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:44,927
Going up

279
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:51,583
The building that houses the medical examiner's office in Baltimore is fairly new it was built in 2010

280
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:57,471
Bruce is giving me a tour of the building

281
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:03,615
It has some pretty unique features including a full-size apartment that investigators can use to stage

282
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,639
Stuffing

283
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,919
Right behind us we got it all

284
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,687
Dining area

285
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:10,527
Bruce refers to it as a life-size nutshell study

286
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:14,879
And the most violent room in Baltimore

287
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:20,767
They also have a parking garage that in an emergency can quickly turn into a huge mark

288
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,559
And they have a biosafety

289
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:25,887
Facility to deal with death from highly contagious diseases

290
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,423
Holy solution Suites

291
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:30,495
And it has its own power generation is on ventilator

292
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,567
As we walk around the autopsy floor

293
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,591
Second floor

294
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,383
I'm on high alert

295
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,967
I'm basically terrified of running into something I'm not prepared to

296
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,735
To see

297
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,015
Or smell

298
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:48,415
If you go to the deep end. If you want to stop and turn around 6 will be fine with me.

299
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:54,559
What will hold it together mangle

300
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,351
Totally not being cool

301
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,399
But we go through and the

302
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:01,215
Fine I mean DS there are dead bodies

303
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:05,055
And I have many existential feelings about that that I won't

304
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:05,823
Cher here

305
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:10,175
But mainly this place feels like a really clean Hospital

306
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,199
Protect people

307
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:14,271
If you like yeah this is how it should be

308
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,551
Francis

309
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,575
Believe

310
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:17,855
And

311
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,623
Science

312
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,647
Based death

313
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,439
The

314
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,743
The whole institution top to bottom

315
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,023
I think it is

316
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,327
Probably

317
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,095
Fullest

318
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,631
Embodiment of

319
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,423
Her philosophy

320
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:32,959
And for approach

321
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:37,055
Bruce is talking of course about Frances glessner Lee

322
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:41,151
He says not only is this building and embodiment of her philosophies

323
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:46,271
But so is the whole Maryland system for dealing with death investigation

324
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:53,951
If you die unexpectedly in the state of Maryland your death is likely to undergo a thorough investigation in

325
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:58,303
Putting an autopsy by medical examiner with specific forensic training

326
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,095
But this is not what you get

327
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:02,655
Everywhere depending on where you die

328
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:09,055
You could end up in a facility like Maryland are you could literally end up on a makeshift table in someone's garage

329
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:15,199
From state-to-state and even county-to-county there can be huge variations in quality

330
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:18,527
And there are definitely no federal regulations

331
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:21,855
There's a lot of substandard work

332
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,903
Unfortunately being done in that

333
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,999
Field it's not like CSI it's not like what you see on TV very often

334
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,047
That's a c Thompson

335
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:34,655
He did a bunch of reporting on this for propublica a few years ago very often

336
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,679
It's

337
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,727
People working under

338
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,775
Dismal conditions

339
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,079
For very little money

340
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,359
With very little oversight

341
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,759
When someone dies in the US and Authority has to issue a death certificate with a cause of death

342
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:53,343
If you die from an illness in hospital this is something your doctor would do

343
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:57,695
If you die unexpectedly like if you murdered or a fall down some steps

344
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,767
A death certificate is issued by either a corner

345
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,303
Or a medical examiner

346
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,607
Maryland is on a medical examiner's

347
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:09,471
South Carolina Colorado and several other states are on corners

348
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:13,055
And then you have states that are weird mix

349
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:13,823
Both

350
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,591
Depending on what

351
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,615
County you're in

352
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:20,223
In Frances glessner Lee was actually really passionate about abolishing corners

353
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,015
In favor of medical examiners

354
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,039
Because

355
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,831
Well I don't know if she would have put it

356
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:28,927
Like this but basically Corner system is crazy

357
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:34,303
It's it's Bonkers and it's a scientific thing from another era

358
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,679
First of all you don't necessarily have to be a doctor to be a coroner

359
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:44,031
That is to be the person who issues a death certificate with a cause of death

360
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:49,663
Like I'm a high-school graduate in a lot of places I could just roll out and say I'm running for coroner

361
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:55,295
And be the County coroner now I would typically work with an MD who would do the autopsies

362
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,575
But I'd be the one

363
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,111
Who make the final decision

364
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,903
And that's the other thing

365
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:00,927
The coroner

366
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,207
Is an elected office

367
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,487
When you have

368
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,791
Medical professionals

369
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:08,607
Professionals who have to run for office

370
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:11,679
Based on what happens in the morgue

371
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,471
Satsop

372
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:15,007
Potential conflicts of interest

373
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:20,639
One of the situations where you might see conflicts-of-interest are cases where someone dies in police car

374
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:27,551
AC actually did some reporting on this very thing in New Orleans what you see in New Orleans

375
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:30,879
Over and over and over again

376
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,159
Is that when

377
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,951
People died in police custody

378
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:36,511
1 people died in Jail custody

379
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:40,863
That would be pretty good evidence that something

380
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,399
Untoward had happened

381
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,935
They've been neglected

382
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:46,495
They've been severely beaten

383
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,775
They've been attacked

384
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:50,847
And what was happening with the corner there

385
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,663
Was basically trying to pretend that these things didn't happen

386
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,943
He was ruling death

387
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,503
To be accidental that should have been ruled as

388
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,271
What's homicide

389
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:05,183
His name is Frank Minyard he actually was a doctor but he wasn't trained as a medical examiner

390
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,975
He was an OBGYN

391
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,023
And he seemed to have a bias

392
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,559
Toward protecting the police

393
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:13,887
Maybe because he constantly had to campaign to keep

394
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:17,983
Job who does he want to endorse while he wants the police to endorse him

395
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:21,311
And if he's got a big spat with the police

396
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,359
Is that going to look good for voters

397
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:30,271
In New Orleans BFDI finally stepped in and did some of their own investigations and some police did eventually go to jail

398
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,551
They offer some of those deaths

399
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:35,647
But Minyard was never fired by the voters or anyone else

400
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:37,951
He served as coroner for 40 years

401
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:40,255
Finally retired in 2014

402
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:43,071
So it's worth noting when you're talking about

403
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,119
Incidents involving a

404
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,679
Edith the police shoot somebody

405
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:50,239
The coroner medical examiner is going to say

406
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:52,543
It was a homicide can't really get around that

407
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,591
Then the question will be is it justify

408
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:58,175
But then there are cases that are less cotton dry

409
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:03,807
And there's the ones where an impartial scientific death investigation might matter the most

410
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,879
And actually while I was in Baltimore

411
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:09,183
One of these cases was playing out

412
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:11,231
You probably heard about it

413
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:14,815
Forsook

414
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:19,167
Contagion Baltimore a demand for answers into hell 25 year old Freddie Gray

415
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:21,215
Suffered a fatal spinal cord injury

416
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:22,495
311 police custody

417
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:25,823
Freddie gray sustained his fatal injury on April 12th

418
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:28,127
He died a week later on the 19th

419
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:31,199
And 4 days after his death people protest

420
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,479
Unweighted

421
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:36,063
Deceive the state's attorney Marilyn Mosby would bring charges

422
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:38,111
Against the police involved in the incident

423
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,927
Mosby was waiting to

424
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:44,511
She was waiting to see how the medical examiner would rule the death

425
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:47,071
As soon as she got their findings

426
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,351
She made her announcement

427
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,143
The findings of a comprehensive

428
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,167
Scarborough

429
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,447
An independent

430
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,007
What's the medical

431
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,287
Examiners determination

432
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,359
What's a homicide

433
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,383
Which we receive

434
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,151
Today

435
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:01,919
Athleta

436
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:05,247
Believe that we have probable cause to file criminal charges

437
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:12,415
We don't know if the officers charged in Freddie Gray's death will be conducted

438
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,951
But they were charged

439
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:17,023
And a lot of people this was an important first step

440
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:23,167
I have left Baltimore by the time the medical examiner's office released their findings on Freddie Gray

441
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:28,287
How to say that having just been there and seen the way they do things

442
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:30,847
I felt pretty confident in their process

443
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:34,175
It felt like their findings would be based in science

444
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,711
I'm not tied to politics

445
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:40,063
I don't think it's a stretch to say that Francis Pleasant early

446
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,599
Had something to do with that

447
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:45,183
You know if she were to walk around

448
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,719
See what we do

449
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:48,255
How we do things here

450
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,303
I think she'll be very pleased

451
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,863
And if she really is

452
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:57,727
I love her believe in guiding spirit so that sort of thing but she is very definitely a presence here

453
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,775
Everyday

454
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:08,735
At the end of the Frances glessner Lee seminar in homicide investigation

455
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:13,343
Attorneys present their theories about what happened in each of their nutshell studies

456
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:16,159
And then they get to find out the actual Solutions

457
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:19,232
Was it a homicide staged to look like a suicide

458
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:22,304
Or suicide staged to look like a homicide

459
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,608
Or something else entirely

460
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:27,168
This is the folder that contains

461
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,984
The solutions to the nutshell

462
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:36,640
They didn't then the guy that has the answers to these questions might be the most Baltimore guy

463
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:37,920
In Baltimore

464
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:42,784
Hi my name is Jerry judge you have a job also known as Jerry d

465
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:45,600
Sometimes the police will come up with their own

466
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,136
Solution then

467
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:52,768
Since they're all wearing guns I don't challenge him to say you're wrong I just say that's not how France's saw it

468
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,304
But I do have the

469
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,584
Yeah the answer

470
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:58,912
Gdb is not going to let me see the folder

471
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:00,704
Or record when he tells

472
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,472
Fruition

473
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,312
They guard the nutshell Secrets like the recipe for Coke

474
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:09,920
For the code for the Google search algorithm because they're still valuable secrets

475
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:13,248
As long as the solutions aren't easily searchable

476
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:17,344
The nutshells are still great tools for teaching homicide investigation

477
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:21,696
And that is something that the medical examiner's office in Baltimore Maryland

478
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:22,976
Pixelberry

479
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,512
Very seriously

480
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:45,760
Thanks to everyone at the office of the chief medical examiner in Baltimore Maryland especially Bruce Goldfarb

481
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:52,672
Green boxes but the nutshell studies of unexplained death is full of amazing photographs of the nutshell

482
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:55,488
So which you can see on our website is 99 pi

484
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:59,840

70th anniversary

486
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,704
In order to celebrate we've actually had a 70th

487
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:11,104
Anniversary challenge coin made with Francis Bismillah on the back and Associates on the friends

488
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:16,992
Yep Katie got a Frances glessner Lee challenge going when she was there and Avery is so jealous

489
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,552
Make sure you coincheck Katie when is here

Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices were immersed

494
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,792
The cluttered World a man-made sound

495
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:07,424
If I'm in room listening to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexa

497
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:15,104
Technology talk to us

498
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:17,408
It is a creation of Sonic trash

499
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:24,064
That's Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

500
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,856
To make them more human

501
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,952
Turn the living room lights on

502
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:31,488

It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake

507
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:42,496
Human and adding in some thoughtful sound

508
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:45,312
Makes for a much more natural experience

509
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,360
Turn the living room lights on

510
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,944

Is impacting our health

514
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:04,512
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

We need to talk about something constipation abdominal pain and bloating

519

What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath
