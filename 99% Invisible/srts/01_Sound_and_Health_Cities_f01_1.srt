3
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:08,448
And influence our health and well-being

00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,016
This is 99% invisible

9
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:23,552
I'm Roman Mars

10
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:29,952
Nearly everywhere we go

11
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:31,232
We're bombarded with

12
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:32,512
Human-made sound

13
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:34,560
It's especially bad Insidious

14
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:36,608
Cities in the past

15
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:38,400
Think about where you have

16
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,168
Horses

17
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,752
And Buggies clapping you here

18
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:44,544
Banging of wood against

19
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:45,568
Stone

20
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,616
Very noisy experiences

21
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:49,152
Best Joel Beckerman

22
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:52,736
He's a composer and founder of a Sonic branding and design company

23
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:54,016
Called man-made music

24
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:57,344
Then cars came along and we're sharing the road

25
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:58,880
With these horses

26
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,928
And so not only did you have

27
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,304
Horses at 1 rate of speed the cars at a different rate of speed so lots of honking

28
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,584
Of the horns

29
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,376
It must have been

30
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:11,168
Cacophonous mess

31
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:18,080
But things got even worse when cars came to dominate the road

32
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:20,640
You fast-forward to

33
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:21,920
Really

34
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:24,480
What the soundscapes were let's say in the 50

35
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:27,808
So in the fifties it was all about muscle cars

36
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:32,928
It was all about the loudest car you could have the Mustangs

37
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:38,304
Corvettes that were really really loud

38
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:44,448
We might not have muscle cars anymore but our cities are still noisy places

39
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:46,752
We're pretty good at tuning it out

40
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:49,568
But our Sonic environments have serious impacts

41
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,360
Are mental and physical health

42
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:54,176
So is the blurring modern soundscape

43
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,456
Movie killing us

44
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:58,528
This is part one of a two-part series

45
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:01,856
All about how sound can be designed create more well-being

46
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,136
And reduce harm

47
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,928
We really respond

48
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:09,280
To sound quicker than the other since it really becomes the Arbiter of all our sense

49
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:15,680
But many of the sounds we hear are created with very little thought for how they interact with each other

50
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,472
They could be a byproduct

51
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:20,032
Like engine sounds of a computer

52
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:24,128
Or they could be made intentionally like alarms or cell phone pings

53
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,664
At the doctor

54
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,432
Sound

55
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,456
Overhead planes

56
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,736
Air conditioning unit

57
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,528
Patios in stores

58
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,808
Pumping up music

59
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:35,904
Sirens and people talking loudly to be heard over the rest of the noise

60
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:36,928
You have truck

61
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:42,048
Buses other kinds of Transit and then unit mechanical things like Construction

62
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:44,608
Of course

63
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,632
Americar

64
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,680
The sound of cars

65
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:50,240
Is kind of inescapable which is

66
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,032
Depressing if you think about it

67
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:56,384
Has Kate Wagner you might know her from her fantastic blog mcmansion hell

68
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,712
Xi'an architecture and design critic and she cares a lot

69
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,736
About sound

70
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:01,760
Cars

71
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,040
Tend to drown out

72
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:06,112
Other things like Birdsong human speech

73
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,648
The rustling of leaves

74
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,208
Conversation things that maybe

75
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:14,048
Armored personnel are like Kelly Hold and it higher like aesthetic value

76
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:18,912
Joel Beckerman says we need a new approach to sound

77
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:22,240
One where we decide what we hear in our everyday environment

78
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,288
Really about

79
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,568
How do we

80
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:27,104
Use Music and Sound

81
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:30,176
To make people's lives richer and simpler

82
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,760
Joel wants sound to be something we're thinking about all the time

83
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:36,832
What cities have more noise laws than ever

84
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:41,440
Over half of the world's population live in urban areas experiencing

85
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,976
Way too much noise

86
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:46,816
Sound is measured in decibels

87
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,120
The louder the sound the higher the number

88
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,680
Quiet library is around 40.

89
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:59,104
B-52 8790. Supposed to be really close to the highway

90
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:03,200
The decibel scale isn't linear that means 80 decibels

91
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:05,504
Isn't twice as loud as 40 it's actually

92
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,296
10000 times louder

93
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:10,624
If you have to pull over on the side of the highway

94
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,440
This may be a flat tire or something

95
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:15,232
The sheer noise that

96
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,256
You hears

97
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,815
Play starlink

98
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,631
Of sound that is an 8 Lane Highway

99
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:27,007
The average level of car noise in a busy City

100
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:30,847
It's about the same as having your TV on at top volume

101
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:31,871
All the time

102
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:35,199
Some silly noises are designed to be loud

103
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,759
Police sirens and ambulance sirens

104
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,295
120 decibels

105
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:45,439
We might try to escape all this by sticking in a pair of headphones and cranking up the volume

106
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,487
But depending on what you're listening to

107
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,047
Headphones can be over 90s

108
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:53,631
Prolonged exposure to anything over 80 decibels

109
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,911
Will lead to hearing

110
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,959
So before we go any further

111
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,495
What we're talking about the idea of

112
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,519
Sound and health

113
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:00,799
Do yourself a favor

114
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:03,359
Get into a little bit quieter area

115
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,919
And turn this episode down a couple of notches

116
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,711
Your ears will thank you

117
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:14,623
When it comes to City sound volume is not the only thing

118
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:18,207
Not just how loud the sound is its

119
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,999
The character of the sound

120
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:23,327
It's whether or not you have control over the situation

121
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,607
That's Erica Walker

122
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:30,239
She's a researcher at the Boston University School of Public Health in a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation grantee

123
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,519
For Erica

124
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,055
Impact of sound

125
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,335
Is all about contacts

126
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:39,711
I live in an apartment building and above me where these neighbors and they had two small kids

127
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:45,087
And the kids used to run across the floor 24 hours a day

128
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:49,695
The sound wasn't more than 50 or 60 decibels that's the same volume as

129
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,487
The background music in a coffee shop

130
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,303
But Erica could feel that sound

131
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,327
Every moment

132
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,607
Of every day

133
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:03,263
I think for different people as different things but for me it was the rumbling it's that low frequency sound

134
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,567
You can't hear it but you know it's there

135
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:09,151
And you don't know where it's coming from but you can feel it

136
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:14,783
Living so close together we're going to make sounds that will cross over into other

137
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,807
People's faces

138
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,087
And that's not always bad

139
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:19,903
It's one of the reasons why I love living in sin

140
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,695
Sun Communities

141
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:25,535
Say that they appreciate the sound levels like they like hearing their neighbors

142
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:30,143
At the barbecue because it makes it feel like a sense of community so there is a positive aspect

143
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,191
But when we don't have control

144
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:34,239
That's what health problems start

145
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:39,359
Matthias basner is a professor at the University of Pennsylvania

146
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,663
He said he's out noise affects our sleep

147
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,455
The noises stress

148
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:46,015
Especially if we have little or no control over it

149
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,807
And so the body will

150
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:50,367
Discrete stress hormones like adrenaline

151
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:53,951
Cortisol that lead to changes the composition of our blood

152
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:56,511
And of our blood vessels

153
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:00,863
I would text you have been shown to be stiffer after a single night of noises

154
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:01,631
Exposure

155
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,423
People who are irrelevant

156
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:06,751
Exposed for prolonged period of time have an increased risk

157
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:10,335
For cardiovascular disease including high blood pressure

158
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,383
And myocardial infarction

159
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:15,455
But also in some studies high risk of

160
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,223
Stroke

161
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:20,831
A myocardial infarction by the way is another term for a heart attack

162
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:24,671
Aldovia risk increases are relatively mild

163
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,231
Relative to other exposures like smoking

164
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,255
King for example

165
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:33,119
This still constitutes a major public health problem because so many people are exposed

166
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,167
These different noise sources

167
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:39,007
And the World Health Organization published a report on the

168
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,543
Burden of disease

169
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,335
By environmental noise

170
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:43,615
And they base

171
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:47,199
Sukisho that in the Western European member states alone

172
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,223
1.6

173
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,527
Million healthy life years are lost

174
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,063
Every year

175
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,623
Due to the exposure to environmental noise

176
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,439
There's a study from the University of Michigan that looked

177
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:00,767
The effect of lowering sound exposure by 5 decibels

178
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,303
That could save

179
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:05,375
3.9 billion dollars in healthcare costs

180
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,935
And it would also save lives

181
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,591
There are so many other ways that noisy environments are bad for you

182
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,127
Think about allowed rest

183
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,687
There's a sound of the open bar

184
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,711
Puppy music

185
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,503
Your shouting at your friend

186
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,807
Everyone else is shouting at their friends too

187
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,343
Pretty stressful

188
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,879
And when we get stressed

189
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,695
Studies show we reach for comfort food

190
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,975
And alcohol

191
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,119
Academic performance

192
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,935
Are mood hurt or concentration basically

193
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,215
We are being killed by noise

194
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,239
And some of us

195
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,287
Or being killed faster than others

196
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,823
More after this

197
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:54,527
Support for this special two-part series exploring the power of sound to influence our health

198
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,575
Comes from the Robert Wood Johnson found

199
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:03,231
The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation is working to build a culture of Health that ensures everyone in America has a fair

200
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,791
And just opportunity for health and wellbeing

201
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,071
Which includes

202
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,887
Exploring how our current or future environment

203
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,423
Will impact daily life

206
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:22,175
We know noise causes health problems but they can be especially pronounced

207
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:24,735
If you live in a less affluent neighborhood

208
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:31,135
If we live in a place for example with lots of environmental noise as do many people in American cities especially people

209
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,183
Bose color and low income families

210
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:37,023
Then we have to deal with essentially

211
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,303
Does mechanical

212
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,071
Sound

213
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:42,399
That can shave off sort of the high frequencies

214
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:44,191
History repeated

215
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,727
Relentlessness

216
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:49,567
Neighborhoods near factories highways in Flight paths

217
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:53,663
And usually they're the least expensive places to live

218
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,223
This is a noise equity

219
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:56,991
Problem

220
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,527
We should have the choice

221
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:03,135
Living in a space that is not doing damage to us

222
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,183
Without having to move

223
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:09,023
We should have the agency to Good Health good hearing health

224
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,327
We should have agency

225
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,351
Over

226
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,655
The things that could harm us essentially

227
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,959
The most obvious solution is to make laws

228
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,263
Some cities car about quiet hours

229
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,823
You can't run a noisy leaf blower or

230
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,151
Practice grooming in your garage at night or else you'll get fined

231
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,479
But there's a couple of problems with noise abatement laws

232
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,503
One thing

233
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,295
They're often used to Target

234
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,319
Vulnerable people

235
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,623
Noise abatement lawsuit of always

236
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,391
Singled out

237
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,415
Powerless people

238
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,951
People who

239
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,743
Livelihood is impeded

240
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,023
Middle class

241
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,047
Station

242
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:48,447
A quiet or orderly or bustling City Etc sort of like what the ideas

243
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:51,007
What the ideal soundscape would be for the city

244
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:53,567
The very first restrictions on city noise

245
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,103
Came in the early 20th century

246
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:55,871
Tree in New York

247
00:10:56,383 --> 00:11:00,735
A rich woman named Julia Barnett rice campaign to silence the horns and whistles

248
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,783
Tugboats in the nearby Forest

249
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:06,111
All these noises were bothering her and her Riverside mansion

250
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:09,951
It's not hard to see the thread of connection from someone

251
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,999
Like Julia Barnett rice and someone like

252
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:16,607
BBQ Becky the white woman who called the police on a black family having a barbecue

253
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,631
Last year in Oakland

254
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,215
It was the beginning of what we call gentrification which is

255
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,751
Is pushing out those

256
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:29,151
Rely on the city for work in order to satisfy these sort of aesthetic tastes of the wealthier people who depend

257
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:32,223
Chickens were more of a concern to those in power

258
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,783
This is very much both a literal and a Sonic

259
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,551
Displacement

260
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,903
Is that they aren't very effective

261
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,207
So the way we currently

262
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,231
Regulate

263
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:47,583
Measure sound

264
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,863
That's Erica Walker

265
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,679
Remember the decibel measures how loud something is

266
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:56,287
The moose sound meters only listen to a specific range of frequencies

267
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,335
The kind that we hear with our ears

268
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,639
That's called in a weighted system

269
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:06,783
Does a weighted system that tells us that is only the sound so we process to the auditory system that are important

270
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:10,111
But there are some sounds we don't process with our ears

271
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:16,511
Once the pitch gets low enough we no longer hear it but feel it is that

272
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:21,119
Sweetly vibrational so is essentially that feeling so

273
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,191
When you're in a community that's in a flight path and you say it's

274
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:26,239
65 a weighted decibels

275
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,007
Your

276
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,823
Trappin out the components that come from

277
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:33,151
The lower frequency sound so you're leaving out

278
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,943
Story

279
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:40,831
Not only is it a flawed metric that using this metric to determine who's eligible for soundproofing criteria

280
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:46,975
Erika is working on a project called the community noiselab

281
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,511
And she hopes that by

282
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,839
Taking a much wider range of frequencies into a Canon

283
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,375
We can get a better grasp

284
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:56,703
How sounds are affecting our neighborhoods and our health

285
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,007
In the meantime

286
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:03,359
Kate Wagner says that there are steps everyone can take to make things sound a little better

287
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:07,455
Acoustics changes to the spaces here in

288
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:13,599
There are certain architectural and design choices that we can make to make our spaces a little bit quieter

289
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:18,463
Going to be 50 installation or have a footing for any other service

290
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,743
Expensive Solutions

291
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,559
Isolating noise

292
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:26,399
Get off sticker curtains which is cool because velvet is in

293
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:29,727
Velvet curtains might be a solution to noise problems in her home

294
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:35,359
But addressing the noise from cars and Industry requires a fundamental change to the way we live

295
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:36,895
Austin

296
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:41,759
The things that are making the most noise especially sort of industrial noise

297
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,295
Are the things that are

298
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,599
Perhaps not exactly the healthiest

299
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,391
For the environment for example

300
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:53,791
Takes a lot more noise to have a natural gas plant or drill or do what have you for any kind of

301
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:58,399
Extractive purposes and it does to have a solar farm which is almost entirely silent

302
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:05,055
The quietest City I've ever been in that was a major city was Helsinki in Finland

303
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,847
I was astonished because

304
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:11,455
The Metro are the subway trains and the buses and what not their silence

305
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,735
The

306
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,015
Train station

307
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,295
Are very quiet

308
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:18,623
That's partly because the majority of their trains are electric

309
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,695
But it's also down to the design of their station

310
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:28,351
From a mixture of materials sound absorbing materials and also psychoacoustic tricks like pumping in noise

311
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,143
That has this weird reverse

312
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:34,751
Effect of making things seem quieter which is a technique used in offices as well

313
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,287
The fins are able to make

314
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,823
Spaces quieter in

315
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,127
That idea that they should be quieter

316
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,199
Seems to be more popular there

317
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:48,575
Prepster quieter public spaces play a small part in making Finland reportedly

318
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,367
The happiest country in the world

319
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,903
It's a country that is

320
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,975
So taken into account

321
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,255
The public good

322
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,791
From all aspects

323
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:01,375
Things like Health Care Child Care Social Services

324
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,911
Robust

325
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:08,031
Welfare state and things like their outlook on sustainability

326
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:11,103
So cleaner quieter Vehicles make you happier

327
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:13,151
And when things are less noisy

328
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,687
Is a great opportunity

329
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,991
Please create a richer and more useful

330
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,015
Sonic landscape

331
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,831
Electric cars don't naturally make a sound

332
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:23,391
So if you've ever had one creep up on you

333
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,695
It's a really really scary experience

334
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,487
Joel Beckerman says

335
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,535
This Silence of electric cars

336
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,071
Can actually be a drawback

337
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,375
Total silence is not a good thing

338
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:36,703
Joel says that electric cars need to make noise

339
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:38,495
Or else they won't be safe

340
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:43,103
It's not the people in the car it's for the pedestrians to know that the car is coming

341
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,151
But the opportunity

342
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,711
Also to create a personality

343
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,271
For the vehicle for the electric vehicles

344
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,319
He actually worked with Nissan

345
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,343
How to create an identity

346
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,879
For their new electric car

347
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,671
Here it is coming right at you

348
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,351
In this case what we were looking to do was

349
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,375
Create

350
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:09,215
A car that had a personality which is really in association with clean energy

351
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:11,775
One of the things we know is it's going to be frictionless

352
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,335
When you hear a car

353
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,103
Accelerate

354
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,383
If it accelerates

355
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,431
It's very quickly let's say

356
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:20,479
And there is a sense of

357
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:22,015
Really smoothness

358
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,551
Lack of friction

359
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,831
There is a

360
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:27,135
Almost in natural ambience

361
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:27,903
To it

362
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,695
We actually used

363
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:34,303
Natural sounds

364
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:40,703
It still sounds like a car and it absolutely had to because we don't have to destrian to hear it and say oh what's that

365
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,727
Get hit by the car

366
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:45,567
Joe wants a future city dominated by natural sound

367
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,639
It also sounds that we consciously chosen

368
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:51,967
Some cities are already taking a more thoughtful approach

369
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,271
In the Tokyo subway station

370
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:55,807
Each station

371
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,855
Has a little tune associated with it

372
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:01,951
And if you know anything about the Japanese subway system it is packed

373
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:04,255
So if you're in the middle of a car

374
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:07,327
And you miss an announcement because it's noisy

375
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,607
Your son

376
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,143
You're going to miss your stop

377
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,703
The Tokyo trains have a short jingle

378
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,519
Unique to each and every station along the line

379
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,543
Like this one

380
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,079
Pre-K bukuro station

381
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,359
On the yamanote line

382
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,855
These little Tunes

383
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,135
That

384
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,927
Show up at each station

385
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,975
Helps you understand where you are

386
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:38,815
And also their pleasing their they're not a screening announcement

387
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:47,263
We could live in cities full of intentional sound

388
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:52,127
What's soundscapes that we've chosen

389
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,919
Really annoying

390
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,967
The nice thing is

391
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:57,759
You get to decide that for yourself

392
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,551
Because you'll be able

393
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:00,575
The mall

394
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:11,071
