I'm Roman Mars

28
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,904
Today we start out with something a little different

29
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,184
Love

30
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:36,000
The typical and atypical story

31
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,792
Love story

32
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:41,120
Kostas meat Setauket says it's a typical love story

33
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:42,912
But it's not that typical

34
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,192
It began like this

35
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,032
The early 2000s he was living in Greece where he's from

36
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:48,800
When

37
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:51,872
I meant to say Spanish girl

38
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,920
Her name was Sandra delpozo

39
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:56,736
One thing broke the other and we decided to

40
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:59,552
Ami I decided to give up everything

41
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:03,392
And sell everything and she decided to give up her job

42
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:07,232
Batu Bata small RV on eBay and started driving across Europe

43
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,768
In the direction of Spain

44
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:09,792
Mercante restaurant

45
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,096
She told me once

46
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:14,912
Will you think if we go we go to see my grandma

47
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:19,776
Sandra grandmother lived in a small farming town the northeast corner of Spain called

48
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:20,544
Sodexo

49
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:27,200
About 300 little farming Villages that the dictator Francisco Franco built in Spain in the

50
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,224
The 1950s

51
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,784
He wanted to bring people and aggregate

52
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,088
Culture to some of the more desolate parts

53
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:33,856
Of the country

54
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:37,440
Producer Katie mingle travel to Soto Spain recently

55
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:43,072
All the towns built during this time looks similar and Sodexo is no exception

56
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,656
There's a church in the center of town and one bar

57
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:51,264
Which is also the one restaurant which is also the one place to hang out

58
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,544
As far as I can tell

59
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:00,224
They're about 200 people who live in soda so permanently all in homes built from Stone the color of Sam

60
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,272
And with red tile roofs

61
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:07,136
The met you always see at the front of the main house in the back of the

62
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:11,744
Let's Coast he's giving me a tour of this little town

63
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:15,072
After he and Sandra came to visit her grandmother here

64
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,352
They ended up staying

65
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:20,704
So that sounds

66
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,752
Oh and Sandra Dacosta

67
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,544
They're not together anymore

68
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:27,104
They actually broke up years ago

69
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,432
New boyfriend of Sandra

70
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,480
Daddy-O

71
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:33,760
Girls

72
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:41,184
Narcos season Sandra broke up they both stayed incident though

73
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,720
Went on with their lives

74
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,512
And then something

75
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:46,304
Really incredible happen

76
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:52,192
Something that brought everyone in this small town into the streets to celebrate all day and all night

77
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:54,240
Into the wee hours of the morning

78
00:03:56,032 --> 00:04:00,640
December 22nd 2011

79
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,688
Almost everyone in this town

80
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,712
1 a piece

81
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:06,784
Of the biggest lottery jackpot in Spain

82
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,576
By chance

83
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,112
Hostess Meats attack

84
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,392
About himself

85
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,928
In the luckiest town

86
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:13,696
The world

87
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:20,351
I've never heard of an entire town winning the lottery

88
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,143
Maybe a group of friends

89
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,167
Our co-workers

90
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:28,287
But more often than not in the United States the lottery winner is just one person

91
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,615
In Spain though they do Lottery differently

92
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,151
First of all it's a

93
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,175
Countrywide

94
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:34,943
Obsession

95
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,247
Evic the Spanish Literature

96
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,271
Reba deal

97
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:45,183
Then that's that completely crazy if you're not from Spain if you cannot understand that you are surprised by the therapy

98
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,719
People are taking the day off

99
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:47,999
To watch

100
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,023
The lottery

101
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:53,119
There's more than one lottery in Spain but the one that Kostas is talking about that

102
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,911
People go nuts over

103
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:57,471
It's called La Loteria de Navidad

104
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,007
The Christmas Lottery

105
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:04,895
And it has incredible buy-in from the population about 75%

106
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,431
Spaniards participate

107
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:12,575
Christmas Lottery is also the oldest running lottery in Spain and one of the oldest in the world

108
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:15,903
The drawing has happened every single year since 1812

109
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:18,719
This includes the years of the Spanish Civil War

110
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,743
And all the way

111
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,023
To the Franco dictatorship

112
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:27,935
For Better or Worse lotteries have long been considered a useful way for governments to raise funds for things like

113
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:30,495
Infrastructure projects and public programs

114
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:34,847
Colonial America was basically built using Lottery Revenue

115
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:40,479
But in the early eighteen-hundreds opposition to the idea of lotteries was growing all over the world

116
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,759
Especially in Europe

117
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,039
Lotteries were

118
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,575
And still are by the way

119
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:47,391
Thought to be a regressive tax on the poor

120
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,695
Churches found lottery Play to be blasphemy

121
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:50,719
Superstitious

122
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,767
Mid election was like Karl Marx

123
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:56,607
But that public libraries were a Sinister instrument of the capitalist state

124
00:05:56,863 --> 00:06:00,959
Designed to convince the proletariat but there was an easy way to escape poverty

125
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:06,335
In 1826 the British outright bans the lottery for nearly a hundred years

126
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:10,431
In 1862 Spain responded to the opposition as well

127
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:15,807
By redesigning their national lottery so that it wouldn't take as much money from the poor

128
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,879
They decided to make the the tickets very expensive

129
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:21,695
Irrational

130
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,463
Babies R Us

131
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:25,279
An affordable poor people won't buy them

132
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,327
Let's pair tennis table light

133
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:32,703
She's an economist at York University in Toronto who studied Spain's Christmas Lottery

134
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:37,567
She says the Spanish government figured that if they set the price of lottery tickets

135
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,591
Really high

136
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,383
Only rich people would buy them

137
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,431
But that's not how it worked out

138
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,711
What happened is

139
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,735
Disabled people

140
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:49,599
Not buying a lottery anymore they decided to turn to their Networks

141
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,135
Istara syndicate

142
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,183
People began syndicate

143
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,975
We're playing in groups

144
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:57,535
New Lottery became more popular than ever

145
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,583
Two people in the same neighborhood

146
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:03,935
Or family or friends that would buy one ticket

147
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:06,495
By putting together their money

148
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:12,895
The Christmas Lottery works like this there a hundred thousand possible numbers ranging from

149
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:16,735
0 99999

150
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:22,367
When you go to the lottery office they'll tell you what numbers are available in your area and you pick one

151
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:27,231
But it's really expensive to own an entire number like tens of thousands of euros

152
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:31,839
What is much more common is that an organization will buy a share of a number

153
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:34,655
And then sell of even smaller shares the individuals

154
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,191
50 shares

155
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,471
Two-year-old shares

156
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:41,311
Thousands of people may own small fractions of the same number

157
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,103
The smaller the share you have

158
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,895
The less you get of the total jacket

159
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,687
If your number should when

160
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,807
And one of the things that this is done is to turn this Christmas Lottery into a

161
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:52,575
Huge

162
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,599
Social event

163
00:07:54,111 --> 00:08:00,255
Local organizations sell tickets at a markup for fundraisers so your soccer team might be selling shares of

164
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:03,327
The number the school your kids go to maybe selling shares

165
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,607
Different number

166
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:11,007
Most Spaniards have a stack of tickets all different tiny shares of different numbers that they've been

167
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:13,055
Talked into buying by someone

168
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,359
The numbers go on sale in the summer

169
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,407
And then on December 22nd

170
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,479
All of Spain Tunes in to watch the drawing

171
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:23,807
Every year is being done the same way in the same theater

172
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,575
Madrid

173
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:31,999
Start relaxing at 8 in the morning and the TVs and the Raiders are always everywhere on

174
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,791
Showing listing

175
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,863
If you turned on Spanish TV that

176
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,143
Here's what you'd say

177
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,495
There's a stage and on it are two giant golden orbs

178
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:45,567
One contains balls with all the possible lottery numbers Prince

179
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:49,407
The other smaller warm has balls with the prize money in it

180
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,711
But one orb spits out a number

181
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:54,527
The other drops down the corresponding prize amount

182
00:08:55,295 --> 00:09:01,439
After the balls drop a couple of Catholic school kids and their uniforms sing the numbers and prizes out

183
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,719
Loud and it kind of

184
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,255
Gregorian chant

185
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:08,351
The whole thing goes on for several tedious hours

186
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,143
And the kids aren't

187
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,935
Particularly great singers

188
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:20,127
Hike

189
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:28,063
They are a bunch of small price mounts that drop

190
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,111
But at some point the orb spit out the

191
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,135
The biggest prize

192
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,439
The day and its corresponding number

193
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,487
Listing price is called

194
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,511
El Gordo

195
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,535
The fat one

196
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:41,887
The total jackpot for El Gordo can be close to a billion dollars

197
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:49,311
Video

198
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:04,927
When El Gordo drops reporters all over Spain rush to figure out who has won the jackpot

199
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:09,279
But it's almost certain that the winning number isn't held by a single individual

200
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,815
It's held by hundreds

201
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:15,935
What do you mean thousands of people who probably all live in the same geographic region of Spain

202
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:19,263
Reporters scrambled to find out where the winning number was sold

203
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,311
And on December 22nd

204
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,359
2011 everyone looks

205
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:26,431
A little farming town in the northeast corner

206
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,199
At the country

207
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:33,087
I got a phone call from a friend of mine that he was on the train

208
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,879
He keeps telling me that

209
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:41,535
Something is going on inside because I'm in the train and everybody's on the phone talking on on the phone and I hear old

210
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,327
All the time

211
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:47,423
58268

212
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:50,495
That was the lottery number that aguanto Bordeaux

213
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:55,359
The winning tickets have been sold all over so that though by the housewives Association

214
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:59,455
A group of women who host parties and activities in town

215
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:03,039
The association sold lottery tickets door-to-door

216
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,063
46 euros

217
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:07,903
5 Euros for the lottery share and one Euro for their fundraising

218
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,463
Call Ashley Medical number

219
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:15,071
Is your Schofield numero Dela Loteria number

220
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,887
And I chose the winning number in so they don't

221
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,215
When I was the Secretary of the housewives SOC

222
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:27,359
When Mari Carmen heard that their number had one El Gordo she started calling friends

223
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,407
No one could believe it

224
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:32,991
On a PA system that the town normally only used to announce

225
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,015
Water shortages

226
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,807
The mayor came on inside

227
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:39,647
Congratulations so. Oh we have just won the lottery

228
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:45,279
Come to the plaza to celebrate aside experiencing

229
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,327
That experience

230
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,863
You kindly explain it

231
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,167
If you need to leave it

232
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,959
You can't imagine

233
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:56,031
If you had been there in the moment you would have thought

234
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:58,335
These people have gone completely crazy

235
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,383
The residence of soda.

236
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,431
Frantically searched for their tickets

237
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,991
They bought one from the Housewives

238
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:09,343
H-60 tickets the housewives that sold was now worth a hundred

239
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,367
Thousand

240
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,135
Euros

241
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,951
How many did each person have

242
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:20,095
Soon the entire town was congregated in the closet

243
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:26,495
People chanted their winning number at cars drove through the streets honking their horns

244
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,919
Anna the bartender had one

245
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:37,759
Paco the farmer and his wife Marisol the hairdresser had one

246
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,831
Rosa the mayor of the Town had one

247
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:41,855
It seemed

248
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:47,999
Every single resident of the small town of soda throw had bought a lottery ticket from the Housewives

249
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,047
And want a piece of El Gordo

250
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,583
The whole village

251
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:52,607
Everyone

252
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,399
Everyone

253
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,167
Except one

254
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,727
Yeah there was

255
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,007
One person

256
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,287
Who didn't have a ticket

257
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,823
And who was it

258
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,871
That was me

259
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:11,039
Coasties did not have a ticket coasties who would move to the town for love and stayed

260
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:14,879
Even after he broke up with his Spanish girlfriend Sandra

261
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,159
Who yes

262
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:16,927
How to take a

263
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:23,327
Coasties lived on the edge of town and somehow the housewives had missed him when they went knocking on doors

264
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,375
They drove everywhere

265
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,143
Except

266
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,423
At my place

267
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,959
Which they didn't do it on purpose

268
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:32,543
He just is the only one which is outside you know

269
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,823
From the village show

270
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:37,151
They do feel a little bit guilty

271
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:45,599
The people of so data we're not the only ones to win on the number 58268 in

272
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,367
11

273
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:49,951
A few thousand other people also had small shares of a number

274
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:52,511
Mostly scattered around in towns nearby

275
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:57,887
I told Jack bought that year for El Gordo was about 750 million euros

276
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,703
But it was divided by thousands of people

277
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,775
Enzo detto the people who bought more tickets

278
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:04,799
Got more money

279
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,615
And everyone got at least one hundred thousand Euros

280
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:08,639
Everyone

281
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:09,919
Except Coast

282
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:20,671
6 years later coasties still lives inside at though

283
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:27,327
Hand sander good friends now she lives in the center of town and he just outside of it in a barn that he's turned into a

284
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,095
House

285
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,119
It still feels

286
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,655
Kind of like a barn

287
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,543
He has a couple of big German Shepherds

288
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,591
You can hear one of them jumping into my mic

289
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:50,111
When I asked him if he's if he felt or still feels any regret or jealousy about not having a tick

290
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,647
He laughs

291
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:54,207
It's like it's a ridiculous question

292
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:59,583
For a while after so that those when reporters swarm the little town

293
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:02,399
They especially wanted to talk with Kostas

294
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:05,727
The one unlucky guy was left out of the lottery

295
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,799
But Kostas doesn't feel unlucky

296
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:11,359
In fact is anything he feels like

297
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:13,151
He got something that day too

298
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,431
He's a filmmaker

299
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:16,479
And the David Town won the lottery

300
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:19,295
He grabbed his camera and went to the plaza

301
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,831
The moment that happened

302
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:24,159
He was literally like somebody was giving me a script in

303
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:28,255
He filmed all the celebrating and he's been filming ever since

304
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,303
He says it's been really interesting

305
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:33,375
See what happens when a whole town gets well fall at once

306
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:40,031
The whole thing is like a social experiment with really

307
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,311
Fast results

308
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,079
Study

309
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:45,663
And see what an event like this can do to people

310
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,455
Is not always for good

311
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:53,087
Cuz he thinks the people and said it. Become a little more insular since the wind

312
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:57,951
More focused on the nuclear family and less on the town as a community

313
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,535
You do see how it's affecting how they have changed how they have

314
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,559
Closed

315
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:03,839
Before that

316
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,631
All the doors were constantly

317
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:11,263
The way he talks about it makes me wonder if the people in the town will like the film when they see it

318
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,799
Because he says

319
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,079
Do you think they will

320
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,103
Mostly

321
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:18,687
Maybe if you do small things they might not like it

322
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,479
But that that's reality

323
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,951
One thing about set at though

324
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:30,975
Thoroughbreds

325
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:31,999
A lot of them

326
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:35,839
Luckily this is also one of the things I'm able to say in Spanish

327
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,471
Another thing about said that though

328
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,239
It's hot

329
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:49,151
Mari Carmen the former Secretary of the housewives Association tells me it's not usually this hot until later in the summer

330
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,295
This heat she says

331
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,319
I just can't

332
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,087
What does he

333
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:02,719
As we walk around so that those she's pointing at a few houses that have been fixed up with Lottery money

334
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:11,423
But mostly Mari Carmen says the town hasn't changed that much

335
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:15,775
So that was the town of farmers and some of them installed new irrigation

336
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,567
Thumbs are bought new tractors

337
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:22,687
Some people made modest additions to their homes but nothing that extravagant

338
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:25,247
Get overnight service

339
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:31,135
I'm like kosice Mari Carmen hasn't noticed the town being more closed off since the lottery

340
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:35,999
She thinks there's been some little jealousies here and they're not everyone one the same amount

341
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:41,631
But overall she thinks it's been an incredible thing for everyone in this little working-class town

342
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,679
To live without the worry of death

343
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:48,031
She's been battling cancer which keeps going away and coming back

344
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:50,079
And the money's allowed her to stop working

345
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,103
And not worry

346
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:57,247
I need the phone number for me personally

347
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:59,039
The lottery has juice

348
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,575
Broad sense of calm

349
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,111
I don't know like

350
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,415
To have they do they cover that you know

351
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:08,767
And that's the thing with this Syndicate style Lottery

352
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,047
Unlike the Powerball

353
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:13,631
I bought which keeps hundreds of Millions on one or two lonely winners

354
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:17,983
The money from the Christmas Lottery get divvied up among thousands of people

355
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:20,543
And they don't generally win enough to buy mansion

356
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,311
Yachts

357
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:23,615
They want enough to pay off their debts

358
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,151
Maybe buy a Honda Civic

359
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,735
The lottery brings wealth to a whole geographic area

360
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:31,295
Distributed relatively evenly

361
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:34,111
At least among those lucky enough to have a ticket

362
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:40,255
After a short walk Mari Carmen and I arrive at the new office of the housewives Association

363
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:45,631
Which now to be more modern is officially called the women's Association

364
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:47,935
Everyone still seems to call it the Housewives

365
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:48,959
Association

366
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:53,055
Back in 2011 when they were selling lottery tickets

367
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,335
The group kept

368
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,615
Or for themselves

369
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,407
Which ended up winning them

370
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,175
400

371
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,455
Thousand Euros

372
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,735
The time

373
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:04,063
Enough to cover their budget for the next 200 years

374
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:15,839
With all the new money they fix up an old school building in town and made it into their office / Community Center

375
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:20,447
As a nice kitchen for parties a laundry room and a fitness center

376
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,495
Queso Panela Dinero

377
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:26,847
All of these was made with Lottery money

378
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:29,407
These living room was built

379
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,687
Description

380
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:34,015
And the association gave coasties some money for his film

381
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:37,087
Is Olivia

382
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,183
I don't remember how my

383
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:44,511
MattyB was 15000 Euros or how much

384
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,791
I don't know it was a good day

385
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,839
But she also mentions that

386
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,631
He hasn't finished it yet

387
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,447
Everyone is waiting

388
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,359
Either is or anything

389
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:04,479
The people here in the village are waiting like what's up

390
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:11,391
Mari Carmen isn't the only one to mention this to me

391
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:14,719
It actually seems to be the Talk of the Town

392
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:17,791
A little later that day I run into a group of older guys

393
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:20,863
When I tell them I met with coasties one of them says

394
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,423
El Que hizo la pelicula

395
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,959
The one who made the movie

396
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:27,263
Paranormal represent

397
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,311
But he hasn't even come out with it yet

398
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:35,455
I told him I think it'll be another year before the film is finished and he says

399
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:37,759
But it's already been five

400
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:41,087
Another guy comes in and says

401
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:45,183
Didn't win the lottery but he's done quite well for himself

402
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:46,463
He says

403
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:49,535
He's been getting paid for all the television interviews he's done

404
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:52,607
Then they talked about how much he's been getting paid

405
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,887
Mucho

406
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:55,935
I could have you.

407
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,215
Idaho

408
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:01,567
For the record Kostas told me he's never been paid for any interviews

409
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:06,175
Conspiracy theories aside I got the feeling the people inside at the like

410
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:09,759
The strange Greek artist who lives on the outskirts

411
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:10,527
Town

412
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:15,903
But I also wondered if they see him as an outsider and if the lottery is made this even more pronounced

413
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:18,976
When I asked Marie comment about this she says

414
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:19,744
No

415
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,768
He's one of us

416
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,584
We just wish you'd come out with that movie

417
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:30,240
Economist have long struggled to figure out why people play the lottery

418
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:33,056
It's not a rational investment of your money

419
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,592
The odds of winning

420
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:35,616
Are terrible

421
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:36,896
Worse than blackjack

422
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:38,432
Worse than slot machines

423
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,456
Worse odds

424
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:41,504
In any other form of gambling

425
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,272
And yet

426
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,296
It's the most

427
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,832
Popular form of gambling

428
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,112
But in Spain

429
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:48,928
Pretty obvious why people play This Love

430
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,720
It's a social thing to do

431
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:54,560
You buy a ticket because the housewives Association will pester you

432
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,584
Until you do it

433
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:58,656
You buy tickets because your friends are buying tickets

434
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:01,984
You buy because you don't want to be that one guy in town

435
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,008
Who doesn't win

436
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,544
You don't want to be

437
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:05,568
Coasties

438
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:13,248
The housewives Association continues to choose a number each year for the Christmas Lottery and sell tickets and soda at the

439
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:15,040
And in the surrounding little towns

440
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:19,648
And while they used to knock on doors for months they don't have to do that anymore

441
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:23,488
Now the people come to them and tickets sell out in a few days

442
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:26,560
They were lucky ones and they could be again

443
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:27,584
People say

444
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,144
And no one wants to be left out

Bongs and chatter of our devices

466
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:50,272
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

467
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:57,696
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife isn't

468
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:01,792
All hearing that voice

Technology

470
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:03,584
She talked to us

471
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,632
It is a creation of Sonic trash

472
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:08,704
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

475
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,176
Turn the living room lights on

476
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:19,968

Comic mystery

Might cost you your life

515
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:28,480
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

516
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:32,832
Or lose a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

517
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:37,184
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like a dad

518
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,720
I'm having

519
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:41,536
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

520
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:43,840

521
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:45,888
I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that

00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:52,288

Was found dead in my private gym

Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

526
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,576
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

527
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,600
Now

00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:07,648
