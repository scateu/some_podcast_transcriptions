I'm Katie mingle filling in for Roman Mars

27
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,720
In the early morning of September 20th

28
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,000
2017

29
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:42,656
A category 4 hurricane hit the island Puerto Rico

30
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:44,960
You heard one official saying the island

31
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:51,360
Is destroy the power lines are down

32
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,640
Street art

33
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:55,456
Possible many roads are flooded

34
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:02,368
Maria was a beast of a hurricane the strongest one that hit the island since 1932

35
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,024
The wind was blowing 155 miles an hour which is very close to being a cat

36
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:09,792
Curry 5

37
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,864
And it didn't just hit one stretch

38
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,632
The coast

39
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:18,752
Actually moved across the whole island ripping up everything and it's

40
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:21,056
Airbrush everywhere

41
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,336
Trees down

42
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:26,688
Power lines down obviously everywhere going to be the tire Island

43
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,712
In the dark

44
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:34,624
That's Daniel Alarcon he spend some time reporting in Puerto Rico after the storm and wrote an article about

45
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:41,024
Audit for Wired Magazine wake up they go out of their houses or apartments they'll

46
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:41,792
Look on the street

47
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,072
The survey the damage and

48
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,352
And

49
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,120
Start

50
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:51,520
Trying to make sense of what they're seeing in front of them you know

51
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:56,384
And one of the people out there that day driving around in a state of

52
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,408
Shutterstock

53
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:04,064
Was a guy named Jorge Bracero

54
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:10,464
Please God let a video that or he took the day after the storm

55
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,560
Cheese from the capital city of San Juan and he told me he was just

56
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:17,888
Totally caught off guard by how bad the storm was

57
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,936
They've really became

58
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:24,288
Obviously known for everybody around that we were in deep trouble

59
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,664
But it wasn't for a few days when Jorge actually made it into work that he fully grasp

60
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,200
Scale of the crisis

61
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:36,064
Do you worship prepa which stands for Puerto Rican Electric Power Authority

62
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,928
It's the public utility that provides electricity for nearly the entire Island

63
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:45,024
I actually arrived at the power plant I noticed that I was one of the

64
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,072
The few that actually made it cuz

65
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,608
Most people live inland

66
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:52,448
When he gets there he makes his way over this big computer screen that shows

67
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,288
The outline of Puerto Rico and inside of that

68
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,312
A bunch of lines

69
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,848
Kind of like a big connect

70
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:02,176
The dots with each line representing a power line

71
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:06,272
And every blinking line

72
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,344
The whole island was blinking

73
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,136
Every single line was down

74
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,696
Every single line in the island was down

75
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,327
The trajectory of

76
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,351
Maria was

77
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,655
Almost as if it has been designed by

78
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,935
An evil genius

79
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,727
The weight cut across the island

80
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:26,495
Such that it

81
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:27,519
Essentially

82
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:30,335
Struck every major transmission line

83
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:37,759
The scale of the destruction to the power grid was hard even for Jorge Bracero to comprehend

84
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,575
And he knew that day that he would spend the next

85
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,599
Several months

86
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,391
Helping Puerto Rico recover

87
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,927
Through his work with prepa

88
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,719
What he didn't know yet

89
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:49,535
What's the thousands of people would come to count on

90
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,303
Him

91
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,839
Specifically him

92
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,399
To help them get through their year in the dark

93
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:04,895
Jorge Bracero is one of those people who you can tell you're going to like just by seeing a

94
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:05,919
Picture of them

95
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,759
He's in his late thirties with short brown hair and a beard

96
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,575
And he just looks like a nice guy

97
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:14,367
I think it's something about his eyes

98
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,927
Danielle Alarcon describes him as

99
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,463
Delightfully nerdy

100
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,511
He's a guy who

101
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,279
Will

102
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,583
Sit and explain to you

103
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,887
How an electrical grid works

104
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,167
You know like

105
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:30,495
And continue to explain it in my new detail even after

106
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,287
It's clear that you like

107
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,823
I no longer understand

108
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,591
Talking about

109
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:39,711
Jorge has worked for prepping for 13 years and his job there is a grueling one

110
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,503
He's responsible for operating

111
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,783
215

112
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,575
Story tall boilers

113
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:50,207
These boilers are cheated by 20 giant burners that Jorge also looked after

114
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:50,975
And so he's

115
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,023
Constantly hiking up and down these

116
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:53,791
Stairs that

117
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:57,887
Service the different parts of this massively tall equipment

118
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:58,655
It's

119
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,935
Extremely hot

120
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:02,751
Everyday just smelling off

121
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,519
Petrol

122
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,799
And Diesel

123
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:05,567
And

124
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,103
It's extremely exhaust

125
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,383
Sometimes you just hate it

126
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:09,919
When Maria hit

127
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:12,735
Or he and his wife Charlotte rode out the Storm at her

128
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:13,759
Her family's house

129
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,039
They weren't hurt

130
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:17,599
But they were surrounded by devastation

131
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,415
And they found out some really sad news

132
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:23,231
Charlotte's best friend who was pregnant

133
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:28,863
I've gone into stress induced early labor at the day the storm hit and lost the baby

134
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:33,983
This was particularly frightening to them because Charlotte was also pregnant

135
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:37,823
It was the most the most tense I've ever been in my life

136
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,639
What if Charlotte also went into early labor

137
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,431
What is the baby was born but

138
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:48,063
Couldn't survive the post Maria world with no electricity and temperatures routinely in the 90s

139
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:48,831
Because

140
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,367
When you sleep at night

141
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,695
So unbearable

142
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:59,839
Serious that the amount of heat in the air was so so brutal

143
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:04,703
Did you think I'm just going to get naked outside because I can't contain

144
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,727
This damn Heat

145
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:09,055
So I'm thinking a newborn can survive this

146
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,407
Jorge even considered trying to get his wife off the island

147
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:15,967
But eight months pregnant they don't allow you to fly

148
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:23,647
After the Storm Jorge and Charlotte Bounce from place to place staying with friends who have generators

149
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:24,927
At home

150
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,463
Jorge fretted over his wife

151
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:30,047
Send baby who is coming ready or not in November

152
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,863
At work things were even more stressful

153
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,959
The first priority was to get power to hospitals and water treatment plant

154
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:40,287
Aarhus power plant was one of seven major plants

155
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:44,383
On the island but all of the others were down and without those to help

156
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,967
His kept crashing over and over again

157
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:48,735
Dead

158
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:52,831
It would connect as many hospitals that we can but it just wouldn't hold it

159
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:55,391
Could you describe this like a tug-of-war

160
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:58,207
The power plants are on one side and their Giant

161
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:02,047
But the consumers are on the other side and they pull hard

162
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:05,887
If one power plant goes down the others will have to work harder

163
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,167
And they get tired

164
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,703
Sometimes to the point of

165
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,471
Collapse

166
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:14,335
After Maria there was only one giant power plant on Jorge side of the Rope

167
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:17,919
And on the other side hospitals and water treatment plants

168
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,967
Which were pulling like crazy

169
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:26,367
Every time there's a collapse you have to reboot everything just went down the drain and you have

170
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,159
How to restart from Step One

171
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:32,511
With just one plant that was constantly collapsing they had to triage

172
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,279
Is like

173
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:36,095
I only have one power plant that just got fired up

174
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,911
And I only have enough power for one

175
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,703
Of those two hospitals right there

176
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:47,103
Out in the field things weren't any better lines are down all over the island and there weren't nearly enough workers

177
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,127
To fix them

178
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:54,527
Eventually support would arrive from the US Mainland but for the first week or so Puerto Ricans were basic

179
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,551
Glee on their own

180
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,855
You know we only had 230

181
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,903
Power Brigade bats

182
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,927
All we have

183
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:01,695
4

184
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,487
For the company for the island

185
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,535
And that is not enough

186
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,327
That is just not enough

187
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:11,423
They're about three workers in a brigade so that's 690.

188
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,703
People give or take

189
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:15,263
As a point of comparison as Florida

190
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,103
Prepared for Irma they had 16,000 workers on call

191
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:26,015
Before anyone paying attention it was no surprise that prep I did not have the resources to respond to this disaster

192
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,831
Again here's Danielle Alarcon

193
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,367
Before Maria

194
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,391
The island

195
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:33,439
Was in a terrible economic state

196
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:39,839
A decade or more of economic stagnation Puerto Rico a u.s. territory and popular getaway destination

197
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:43,679
Try to avoid a default on its staggering that it would be the

198
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:50,079
In the decades before Maria businesses has left the island in droves as the US government phased out a c

199
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,359
Series of tax breaks

200
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:56,735
To make up for all the Lost Revenue to the Puerto Rican government began borrowing money in the

201
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,759
The form of bonds

202
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:03,391
Year after year issuing more and more bonds kind of hoping things would turn around

203
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,695
But things did not turn around

204
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:11,071
By the time Maria hit the government was in the middle of an enormous debt crisis

205
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,887
And in the course of that River was not spared

206
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:17,471
And prep has settled over the course of many many years

207
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,751
With a lot of debt

208
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,543
9 billion dollars in debt

209
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:27,967
Or I could never could have not that sounds like a lot can I look at my article cuz I'm not sure

210
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:33,343
Daniel actually had to stop and check his notes while we were talking to make sure this was right

211
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,623
Wow

212
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,695
Yeah I know that's it that's it that's insane

213
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:44,351
Because of cost and because of dad they're constantly postponing

214
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,119
Maintenance

215
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:52,031
Like for example in the mainland us the vegetation is kept mode so that there's basically a rose

216
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:54,591
That runs underneath the power lines

217
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:58,687
That's called right of way right and you're supposed to maintain the right of way

218
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:01,247
To make it easy in an in the case of

219
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,783
You know some disaster

220
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,807
To access

221
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,599
The Fallen Towers

222
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,135
So in Puerto Rico that doesn't

223
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,159
That doesn't exist

224
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:12,511
When Maria hit prep ahead been limping along

225
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:16,863
Now they would have to deal with one of the biggest crises the island has ever faced

226
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,983
But there was another problem and it was a big one

227
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:26,079
It basically had no strategy for communicating with the public

228
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:29,151
Didn't have a presence on Twitter or Facebook

229
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,455
Their the Twitter feed was

230
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,479
Alba dead

231
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,783
The Facebook page was not exist

232
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:40,415
There was no communication saying to people where are the brigade's working everything was kept hush

233
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,183
Hushed

234
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:43,487
Just to prevent conflict

235
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:46,559
And with little actual information from prepa

236
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:49,631
TV news stations just kind of made stuff up

237
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,167
Which made Jorge went to

238
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:53,471
Bros television across the room

239
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:56,287
There was a political analyst and he was saying

240
00:11:56,543 --> 00:12:00,639
He was what he was saying was wrong first completely wrong

241
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:03,199
And not only that he was

242
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,991
Inciting more fear

243
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,295
And Desperation rather than comfort

244
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:10,367
And I spend the night

245
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,671
Just screaming at the TV my family was

246
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,695
Nodejs

247
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,463
Tell me the

248
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,743
Be quiet

249
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:20,863
Dad action right there is basically what you know it just gave me an epiphany

250
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,679
He felt like people need to hear what's really happening

251
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,727
I decided to become the news Outlet

252
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,519
Portuguese tarts

253
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:30,079
One man campaign to educate

254
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,871
Puerto Ricans about

255
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:32,895
Electrical power

256
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:36,479
Keep do it on his Facebook page and he wouldn't ask

257
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,503
Commission

258
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,039
Update October 30

259
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,319
Reshare please

260
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,343
Spread the knowledge

261
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,879
Didn't 9

262
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,671
All because of broken boiler

263
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,207
It will take days to repair

264
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,487
What's in 40 megawatts

265
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:53,375
Leon Focus posts are very technical and very specific

266
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,655
Starter relay test

267
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,679
Everything will be good

268
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:59,263
Turn it on and it will be at such-and-such line

269
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:03,359
You know working to restore such-and-such wattage to such-and-such Neighborhood

270
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:06,175
That information was basically for company use

271
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,967
So I decided to start

272
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:10,015
Leaking that information to the public

273
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:14,367
Every night Jorge would come home from a 16-hour shift at work

274
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:18,207
Hang his smelly clothes out on the porch and start writing

275
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,999
Update October 31

276
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,279
85 + 6

277
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,351
I was spending around for hours

278
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:27,423
Just riding and calling calling friends on the field

279
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:34,847
And asking them for to validate the information I never revealed any sources that I had because I was afraid

280
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:37,919
For any backlash that it would get

281
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:42,015
After he gathered all the information from his sources in the field

282
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,551
Or he would type out these

283
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,087
Extremely long post

284
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,647
Sometimes a thousand words are more

285
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,415
With his

286
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,463
On an iPhone

287
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,231
Update

288
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,255
November 3rd

289
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,535
Turn the man

290
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,071
993 megawatt

291
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:58,655
Cell service with so spotty that sometimes you have to drive to

292
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,679
Define a signal

293
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:02,495
His wife Charlotte who was still pregnant

294
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:03,519
Would be like

295
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,799
What are you doing

296
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,335
My wife would be angry

297
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,871
But then something happened

298
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,663
People started responding

299
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:12,991
More and more people started sharing Jorge's posts

300
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,527
Post of his we're getting

301
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:20,927
You know thousands of a repost and you know hundreds and hundreds of comments and he switched at a certain point for my personal page

302
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,207
Do you like a fan page

303
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:25,023
That was my wife's idea

304
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:27,839
And it was important so I decided to close everyday

305
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,375
Update November 4th

306
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:30,911
I wanted to give

307
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:37,311
People information but he also wanted to show them that people were actually out there working on getting their power

308
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,383
It was just a really difficult problem

309
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,687
How to fix there's a basic problem to the grid

310
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,455
Which is

311
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,991
The majority of population lives

312
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,015
In the North

313
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:48,063
Sebastian like a rectangle

314
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,343
Across the middle

315
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,879
Is a mountain range

316
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,695
And the majority of the population lives

317
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,743
Above that mountain range

318
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,559
And the majority the power is below.

319
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:03,935
And servicing the towers in the mountains was not easy that involves

320
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,727
In some cases you know

321
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:10,847
Flying a tower in by helicopter and then dropping it in and then guys hiking in and I'm trying to set it up

322
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:15,455
On top of the difficulty of the work probably just didn't have the supplies it needed

323
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:22,111
Remember Marie was the third in a series of devastating hurricanes That season

324
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,391
Harvey's Ranch

325
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:27,487
Keep coming son returned here today and reveal the devastation left

326
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,511
Goodbye Irma

327
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:29,791
The once-powerful

328
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,583
This hurricane

329
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:37,983
Triple whammy meant that all the things Puerto Rico needed were in high demand in other places

330
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:40,287
So we had no materials know anything

331
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,823
Like basic stuff

332
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,871
Lack of supplies of like

333
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:46,175
Not having enough Nuts and Bolts

334
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:47,455
You know

335
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,479
Screws

336
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:54,623
You know I time at guys who were finding stuff in the grass and they're like on can I use this and this stuff is like 60 years old

337
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:59,487
Has prevented the slow work of restoring electricity

338
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:03,327
Puerto Ricans who could afford them relied on generators for power

339
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,447
There were so many that the noise of them drowned out the natural sounds at the island

340
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:12,543
The sound of the cookie cookie cookie cookie like that sound

341
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:16,639
I've been replaced by the sounded like me which is like

342
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:19,711
The horrible horrible like a rumble of

343
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:22,015
Hundreds of generators

344
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,087
Meanwhile in post

345
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,623
After post on Facebook

346
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,903
He did his best to

347
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:31,999
Explain why things were moving so slowly

348
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:35,839
I think he did a good job at that critical moment people

349
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,375
Yeah this is the reality of

350
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,655
The grid that we have

351
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:41,471
Will great that was flawed even before

352
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,751
Maria came in

353
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,031
Andretti

354
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,335
But if you scroll through Jorge's

355
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:50,175
You'll see that they aren't just technical information

356
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:54,271
He's also encouraging people to be their best selves

357
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,807
And look out for each other

358
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,343
All I'm thinking is like

359
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,623
Do you imagine

360
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:03,231
If you had one committed that has power and the community next it does not

361
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:06,047
How dead people are going to start you know

362
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:11,423
Baton young lashing out and start feeling resentment and jealousy

363
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,215
There's going to be riots in the streets

364
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,775
Can you

365
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,823
Can you read one of these

366
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,103
Little pep talks

367
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,127
That you wrote

368
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,663
I'm here I'm going to send you one

369
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,015
K Domingo

370
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:26,783
Yeah

371
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,319
Let me

372
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,367
Play kitchen

373
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:34,463
You could read that may be first in Spanish and then

374
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,255
You can tell us what it mean

375
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:37,535
English

376
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,583
Yeah it says

377
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,679
Bob and Dave

378
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:46,751
Seattle

379
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:47,775
Mira La serie

380
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:57,759
Add yellow Cocina El Dorado Casino

381
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:00,319
Not that would be nice. Solo

382
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,855
Atonement

383
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,695
What it says is

384
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,743
I know that next to you everything is

385
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,511
In darkness

386
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,047
It's going to light up

387
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,863
If you already powered up

388
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,911
Healthy A1C meat

389
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:17,215
Do the best thing that you can

390
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,239
Make ice

391
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,007
Cook

392
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,543
Cleaner clothes

393
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,335
You are not forgotten

394
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,895
You are never alone

395
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,199
This moment will pass

396
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:37,695
Angels brought back

397
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,719
A lot of memories

398
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:45,887
Overtime for his post earned him a kind of celebrity status on the island

399
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:48,703
But yeah I went to go see a comedy show

400
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,239
And

401
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:52,031
And he was mentioned in the comedy show

402
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,823
And everyone

403
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:57,151
Cracked up like an entire theater, like hundreds of people

404
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:59,967
These owls of recognition in like

405
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:03,551
Applause and people doubled over laughing because it seems like everybody

406
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,831
Was checking

407
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,879
Everyday one word he said was saying

408
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:10,719
It's the first time in my life that I became a meme

409
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:16,863
140 meme was an image of his face on one of those Latin prayer candles

410
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:21,215
They would say don't let this candle burn out if you want Power

411
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,519
Another meme referred to him as

412
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,543
Fake beard

413
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,615
I had a very very rough beard

414
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:30,431
I didn't come down so these

415
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:32,479
Start calling me saying beard you know

416
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:35,039
Just caress his beard if you want Power

417
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:40,415
By this point for his bosses knew what he was doing and whether they approved or not

418
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:44,511
They sort of had to go along because the public was on his side

419
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:46,559
People were stopping in the streets

420
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:50,655
Thank heaven when they do see me on the street at now they give me a hug because

421
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:52,959
I'm not I'm not usually a handshake guy

422
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:57,567
I'm more of a hug guy

423
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:03,967
On November 14th 2017 who his baby was born the healthy baby girl who they named Leia

424
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:08,319
Amazingly Charlotte's mom and dad had just gotten power the day before

425
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:11,903
So when they left the hospital the family went straight to her parents

426
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,183
Air-conditioned house

427
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,719
Their new baby girl

428
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:22,911
This was the first Christmas in Puerto Rico since hurricane Maria devastated the island local engineers

429
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:25,471
Half of the island had their power restored

430
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,263
But the mood was Grim

431
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:32,127
So many people have lost friends or relatives or had their homes destroyed in the storm

432
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:34,431
Many people were still in the dark

433
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:37,247
No one felt much like celebrating

434
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,039
Still there were moments

435
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:39,807
The blackness

436
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:43,135
A local musician Rewritten the song All I Want For

437
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:43,903
Christmas

438
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,695
So that instead of all I want

439
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,487
For Christmas Is You

440
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:49,535
It says all I want for Christmas

441
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,559
Is loose

442
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,607
Which means light in Spanish

443
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:57,727
One line in the Rewritten song even name-drops Jorge pleading in Spanish

444
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,263
Jorge Bracero

445
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,799
Please give me what I want

446
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:03,615
Okay I'm sending you this

447
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:04,639
Songs

448
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:06,431
All right

449
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,455
On Facebook

450
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,759
Oh my God you have the video

451
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:12,063
Will Smith singing

452
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:25,120
Eventually the woman who wrote the parody song reached out to Jorge and they made a video of the two of them singing

453
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,144
Together

454
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:34,848
Yo te quiero para me

455
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:38,432
Capital Tri-State

456
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:44,064
Ask me sueno

457
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:57,376
Lose

458
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,424
Oh yeah this is

459
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,192
Is great

460
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:03,520
I'm going to watch this again later on

461
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:06,592
I forgot I almost forget about this

462
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:14,528
By spraying around 85% of the island have power

463
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:17,088
Still there were thousands of people who did in

464
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,624
In the spring I visited

465
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,672
A kind of old folks home

466
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:21,696
Up in the hills

467
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,000
And at the bottom of the hill there was power

468
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,536
But there there was no power

469
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,840
And they just couldn't understand why

470
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:30,912
And they were just beside themselves and just

471
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:31,936
Desperate

472
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:32,960
And

473
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,752
The sense of being forgotten

474
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:35,776
You know

475
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:40,384
Holy continued with his daily updates which lines were being fixed

476
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,176
Where the brigades were headed next

477
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:44,992
The team a irrigates and the American contractors

478
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:50,112
And to keep up a sense of momentum he also shared videos as new places got power

479
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:55,488
Like this one where an elementary school in the town of Puerto Nuevo finally gets electricity

480
00:22:55,744 --> 00:23:01,888
The video was taken on some

481
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:04,192
IPhone from the hallway of the school

482
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:08,288
Kids are running by with their arms in the air going completely bananas

483
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:10,592
The teachers are jumping up and down

484
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,128
Just pure joy

485
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,576
It made me so happy

486
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:21,344
See it

487
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,136
That I figured people would be happy

488
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:23,904
Etsy at 2

489
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:30,048
Every week it seemed a new town was celebrating I started telling people

490
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,592
But

491
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:48,480
Soon it would be their turn just remember that even if you don't have power right now you will have it in this is going to be you

492
00:23:55,136 --> 00:24:01,280
I've been restored all of Puerto Rico it's been nearly 11 months since hurricane Maria

493
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,304
And took out

494
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:08,704
Finally in August of 2018 prepa announced that the entire Island have been reconnected to the grid

495
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:14,336
It was six weeks before the year anniversary of Maria and just in time for the next

496
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,616
Hurricane season

497
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:20,480
Peppa meanwhile is arguably in a worse place than it was before Maria

498
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:26,880
There's been a lack of steady leadership over the last year with five different directors cycling through the position

499
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:27,648
At the helm

500
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:29,440
One guy lasted you know

501
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:32,768
Like a day there was a sense of a rudderless ship

502
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:35,072
To be honest sense of an absolutely vital ship

503
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:41,984
4 years a weird funeral have been in place that recipients of disaster money couldn't replace anything

504
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,264
Staying with a different

505
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,568
I eat more expensive thing

506
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,920
For example wooden post can be replaced with stronger metal posts

507
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:55,552
So Puerto Ricans didn't actually get the opportunity to improve their infrastructure

508
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:58,880
That's the same grid they had before with a population that's

509
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:01,184
Significantly more vulnerable

510
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:04,768
Antonio's Estes Park can't be overstated

511
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,816
Puerto Ricans were traumatized

512
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:07,584
Maria

513
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:10,400
It's not just that they went through

514
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:11,680
This

515
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,264
Storm and then went through the aftermath of the storm

516
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,288
It's I think

517
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,824
For a lot of people

518
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:22,176
It's what the aftermath of storm told them which is essentially we don't care about you

519
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:25,504
You're not you're forgotten you don't matter

520
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:28,064
The depth of this wound is

521
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,088
Just

522
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,112
Adjust

523
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,904
Very very deep

524
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:35,744
Now propose in the process of

525
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,768
Privatizing

526
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:43,424
Basically selling itself off piece-by-piece and hopes that a private company or various private companies will

527
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,984
Be able to deliver a better service and the government

528
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:46,752
Has

529
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:49,312
But a lot of people are skeptical

530
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:52,128
Jorge Bracero is still working at prepa

531
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:57,248
Still doing the hot exhausting job of maintaining a 15-story boiler

532
00:25:57,504 --> 00:26:00,320
You'd like to stop doing such hard physical labor

533
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:03,648
You'd like someone to put them in charge of social media

534
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,440
Put his other talents to use

535
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:09,024
I'm up for it I would love that but so far

536
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,048
They haven't

537
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:16,704
Hurricane season was in full swing when I talk to her

538
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,032
So of course I asked him how he was feeling about that

539
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:24,128
When people ask me is like I'll be ready for a next hurricane I'm like no

540
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:28,224
We need a break just give us maybe two years

541
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:34,880
Just give us that time that window in which our people can keep working keep working key working so that

542
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,416
Can hold a little longer

543
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:40,512
Climate change and everything that comes with it is a reality

544
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:42,304
You know hurricane seasons are going to get longer

545
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:44,864
We're going to see more you know and that's

546
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,400
That's pretty scary

547
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:51,776
Freddy told me he thinks Puerto Ricans could survive another hurricane if they had to

548
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:54,336
Another year in the dark event

549
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:57,920
You wouldn't worry as much about the island devolving into Anarchy

550
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:58,944
As he once did

551
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:01,760
He saw the best of people after Maria

552
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,552
Let me think they could do it again

553
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,088
Just please

554
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,112
Please

555
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,904
Not this year

556
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:35,808
Bracero was not the only person in Puerto Rico to take matters into their own hands after Maria

557
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:41,952
All over the island people were stepping into new roles and figuring out DIY Solutions

558
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:45,792
But one time that Daniel Alarcon visited took this

559
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:47,584
Really really far

560
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:51,424
The people actually said to hell with meaning on prepa

561
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,472
We're doing this work ourselves

562
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:56,288
Daniel tell us that story

563
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,056
After this

564
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,160
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices were immersed

565
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:14,720
The cluttered World a man-made sound

566
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:21,632
If I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexis talking to me in my

567
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:26,240
Wife is another word for all hearing.

568
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,032
Technology talk to us

569
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:30,336
It is a creation of Sonic trash

570
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:36,992
That's Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

571
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,784
To make them more human

572
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,880
Turn the living room lights on

573
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:44,416
Okay

574
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:46,208
Dim the living room lights

575
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:47,232
50%

576
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,024
Okay

577
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:55,424
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

578
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,240
Makes for a much more natural experience

579
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:00,288
Turn the living room lights on

580
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:03,872
Dim the living room lights to 50

581
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:04,640
80%

582
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:13,088
We're presenting two special episodes from 99percentinvisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation about how are sound

583
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,880
Escape is impacting our health

584
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:17,440
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

585
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:20,256
Look for them Fridays May 17th and May 24th

586

NPR

We need to talk about something constipation abdominal pain and bloating yourself it's not that bad

589
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:36,128
You take laxatives modify your diet and exercise routine but thinking about it all the time is frustrating

590
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:42,528
It doesn't have to Define you constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again and you don't know why

591
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:44,832
Then it may be time to seek help

Dot and Bo

Flask podcast

597
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,800
So it seems like all over Puerto Rico people were

598
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:07,872
I'm taking matters into their own hands

599
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:14,272
Tell me about this town you went to the basically took it upon themselves

600
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:16,832
To get the lights turned back on

601
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:17,856
Yeah absolutely

602
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:20,672
In this one town called San Sebastian de Pepino

603
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:23,232
They took a pretty radical step witches that they

604
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:27,840
Took volunteers intermed turn them into lineman and created their own

605
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:30,144
Kind of unofficial Brigade

606
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:30,912
2

607
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,448
Connect and reconnect

608
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:35,264
San Sebastian to the great amazing

609
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:40,384
The mayor he's a Charming guy with a rhetorical flourish in like knows how to give a speech in

610
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,176
And make a statement end

611
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:45,248
I had no choice like it was more dangerous

612
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,112
Leave my vulnerable population without electrical power

613
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:53,440
Because a lot of people are older and sick and would have died

614
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,208
Without

615
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:55,488
Power

616
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,280
I got tired of waiting

617
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,328
They start doing the work on their own

618
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,352
Which is

619
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,376
Super dangerous

620
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:04,960
But how did they even know how to do it like today

621
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:11,616
They watching YouTube tutorials or less well as it happened before the storm.

622
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:13,408
Bought a couple of decommissioned

623
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,176
Prepper truck

624
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:16,736
With the with the buckets that dries

625
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:18,784
They bought them so they could cut brush

626
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:22,368
The hurricane comes and they're like well we've got the trucks

627
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:25,440
And they had one guy who had

628
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:27,744
It worked as a lineman

629
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,864
And another guy who knew a little bit about it and it's say okay when everybody we need help with

630
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,448
This brush so we can get to that line enough to that

631
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:41,824
Electrical pole over there and then everyone would take out their machetes and help through the line in the new go and

632
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:43,360
And and do the work

633
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:44,384
They

634
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,920
Had their whole town connected

635
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:46,688
6

636
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:47,968
Day weeks before

637
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:48,992
The other towns

638
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:50,784
So the other areas around there

639
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:53,856
And this was just

640
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:56,160
Okay like they didn't get into

641
00:31:56,416 --> 00:32:00,000
Trouble like they did Pepa know what they were doing

642
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:01,792
You know

643
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:03,840
They couldn't officially sanctioned

644
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:06,912
They were certainly you know they had to coordinate

645
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:08,192
Cuz I couldn't be

646
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,496
Energizing a line well

647
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:13,056
You know Pepino Power Authority guys were

648
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:16,384
Connecting it to symposium

649
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:22,272
Power Authority it sounds so official was this an official body or

650
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:24,320
Is this just a made-up

651
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:25,856
Name

652
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,160
Filipino authorities

653
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:30,464
Completely an informal

654
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:32,000
Made-up thing

655
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:34,048
Pepino means cucumber in Spanish

656
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:37,632
I guess it sounds less official when you know it

657
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:42,496
Cucumber

658
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,312
David Jimenez the mayor is

659
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:46,080
You know

660
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:48,384
Play on

661
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,152
You know

662
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:49,920
It worked

663
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,712
One of the results

664
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:52,992
Is

665
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:56,064
It was a law proposed after all this

666
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:59,392
That was going to loosen the restrictions for

667
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,160
Mayors

668
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:04,768
And local local authorities to do the kind of thing that he did

669
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:13,216
Just a final note it actually wasn't a lot that got past it was more of an agreement between prepa and mayors of

670
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:14,752
Cities that basically says

671
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:19,616
American do the work of connecting people to the grid if they want

672
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:23,712
And prepa is not responsible if anyone gets hurt

Before we go I want to tell you about the body genius

707
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:13,280
A five-part series from Bello radiotopia show the truth

708
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:17,376
The body genius is a Dark comic mystery that whines through a

709
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:19,424
Treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

710
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,704
We're looking the part

711
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:22,496
Might cost you your life

712
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:27,616
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

713
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:31,968
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

714
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:36,320
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like a dad

715
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:40,928
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

716
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,976
Actually if I'm being honest

717
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:46,304
I'm one of the main guy to know how to do that kind of thing

718
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:52,704
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

719
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,032
Was found dead in my private gym

720
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:59,360
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

721
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:03,712
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

722
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:04,736
Now

723
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:07,040
I need to clear my name

724
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:12,416
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes

725
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,440
To find them

726
