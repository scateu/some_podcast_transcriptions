00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:57,248
Anyways we parted ways

41
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,528
He handed me this

42
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,296
Queen like that

43
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:05,696

46
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:10,560
I felt

47
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,096
Incredibly honored

48
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:16,192
But I didn't know what it was or what the hell I was supposed to do with it

49
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:18,240
I also got a coin like

50
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,544
The Pentagon

51
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,848
Ask him what it was and he was like

52
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:26,688
Just something we do

53
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,552
I told my housemate been about my coin and he was like oh yeah I have one of those

54
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,088
It was my grandfather's

55
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,184
Your dad's been up before I came to work so we sound really sleepy

56
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,512
So his coin is from the hundred first airborne

57
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:41,792

Caillou Lego

69
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,760
I actually never met him

70
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,552
This is the only thing that I have

71
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,088
His

72
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:07,904
Avery and I figured out that these coins are called

73
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,928
Challenge coins

74
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,464
And they are coins

75
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,488
But they're not currency

76
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,280
And they're not quite metal

77
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:16,096
Challenge coins are something different

78
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,424
Everything that I say here today is my own

79
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,728
Personal opinion

80
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,008
Reflect the position of the Marine

81
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,288
Roger that

82
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:28,640
Carrie Fisher is not in the Marines cultural anthropologist

83
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,432
At Marine Corps University

84
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:35,296
She's encountered challenge coins many times throughout her career

85
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:38,624
Except for brand new

86
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,904
People coming in

87
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,208
Everybody will know that they exist

88
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,280
The degree to which they are used

89
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,584
Varies a great deal

90
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,424
This can depend on which military branch you serve in and your rank

91
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,960
But it goes further than that

92
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:55,776
There are so many different uses so many different

93
00:03:56,288 --> 00:04:00,128
Kinds of things that the coins can symbolize depending on the context

94
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:00,896
Extinguisher

95
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,944
Looking at them or somebody is giving them

96
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:08,320
Carrie says that one of the meanings of the coins is made apparent in the act of giving or

97
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,088
Exchanging them

98
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:12,416
The coins are literal tokens of gratitude

99
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,464
Depreciation or love

100
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,488
Sympathy

101
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:22,655
There are powerful and tangible form of connection within an institution that is not known for being very touchy-feely

102
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,447
Billy can be difficult

103
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,495
In certain context

104
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:27,519
2

105
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:30,591
Express emotion especially if it's across the ranks

106
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,127
Band

107
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:32,895
I do think

108
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:35,199
The coins are used in that way

109
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:37,759
It's a physical symbol of

110
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:43,647
Love affection or gratitude people might be given a coin for a job well done

111
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:47,231
Because they're only so many ways to show appreciation within the military

112
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,559
You can't give a person a raise you can't give them a promotion

113
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,863
At least you can give them that symbolic

114
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,911
Indicator of our feelings about

115
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:56,959
What you're doing

116
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:02,079
Of course as Avery and I learned these coins are occasionally

117
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,127
Most of the time I would give

118
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:06,687
A coin just to say thank you for

119
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,455
You know helping me out

120
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,735
That's Chris McGrath

121
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:11,039
He's a chief petty officer in the Navy

122
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,319
And

123
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,343
Collect and trade

124
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,111
Challenge coins

125
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:19,999
Chris says he gives coins out to co-workers old friends anyone who does a massage

126
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:26,655
And for that reason you end up finding these coins in places where you would not expect to find any connection to the military

127
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:29,727
Do you know like millions of wimpy podcasters like us

128
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,543
Unicorns are way to establish relationships

129
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,567
Outside of the inside

130
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,847
Esthetician

131
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:37,151
Queens get sent out there

132
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,943
Physical reminder

133
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,503
The fact that the military is

134
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,063
Is there but perhaps more importantly

135
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,111
That it's not some

136
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:46,879
Faceless

137
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,159
Monolithic

138
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,463
Structure sitting in the Pentagon

139
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:54,559
There are human beings involved and they are human beings who can develop

140
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:57,887
A professional or personal relationship with somebody outside

141
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:58,655
The military

142
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:02,239
When I received my coin from the Pentagon tour guide

143
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:05,055
He just got of unceremoniously handed it to me

144
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,847
But within the military

145
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:10,431
What a sailor or Soldier or Pilot or Marine gives a coin

146
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,711
I don't just hand it over

147
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,759
There's a traditional handshake

148
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,295
Of course there is

149
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:21,695
You'll have shakers is used whenever someone is transferring one of the coins over and essentially you have the coin you know sitting in

150
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:24,767
In the palm of your hands and then with a coin in your palm

151
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:28,863
You firmly grasp the hand of the person you want to give the coin to

152
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,631
And then you flip your

153
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,167
Flip your hands over sweating

154
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:35,007
Chris has an amazing collection of challenge coins

155
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,823
Some don't look like regular coins at all

156
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,383
I've got one here shaped like a ninja star I've got another one

157
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,151
I'm shaped like a

158
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,175
Crown

159
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:45,247
You know this one is it shaped like a cougar

160
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,271
Profile view butt

161
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,295
The teeth are open

162
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,575
And you can actually use it

163
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,343
What is a bottle opener

164
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:52,415
The bottle opener could actually be quite practical

165
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,975
Because in addition to being gifts

166
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:57,535
And heirlooms and tokens of appreciation

167
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,327
Challenge coins are used

168
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,863
Two-player drinking game

169
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,911
If you're in possession of a coin

170
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,703
You can be in on the game

171
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:08,031
Jordan Haynes a veteran of the Air Force plays like this

172
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,823
If I was at a bar

173
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:15,967
Have the coin in my pocket and if I felt you know embolden at pull coin out of my pocket and I would

174
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,783
I would throw it down on the bar

175
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,599
Carmike tapet

176
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:24,159
And maybe holler out coincheck

177
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,719
Nobody's and crew members would take out their coins

178
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,279
We expect them to reply with their

179
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,815
Coin doing the same

180
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,351
Thanks so now you've got

181
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,399
All this craziness going on

182
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,447
Cuz people slamming the swans down and yelling out

183
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,215
Coincheck

184
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:43,871
And they go down a line and each person pulls out their coin hopefully what happens if somebody doesn't have the

185
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,175
And if they don't have the coin

186
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,455
Then boom

187
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:50,527
The person without their coin buys everyone a drink

188
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,295
But

189
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:52,575
The person who died

190
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:56,159
Is liable for round of drinks

191
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,439
If everybody does have their

192
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:01,023
So starting the coincheck is also a Gamble

193
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:04,607
Not all of the branches of the military are into the drinking game

194
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:11,263
I will say that I have not seen Marines initiate that kind of game

195
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,311
If somebody from another service

196
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:18,431
Did that with those who play the game are in It to Win It

197
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,455
Always

198
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:22,783
That little useless coin pocket having your jeans

199
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,063
That actually found a use for it and it's

200
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,647
For my child going to be on your toes you know I mean if you're in the shower you know

201
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,671
Take your coin with you

202
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:29,951
If you're out running

203
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:32,511
Whatever you're doing you carry a coin with you

204
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:35,071
You could be going right here in the studio

205
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,863
As far as the history of challenge coins

206
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:40,703
There's sort of an apocryphal story that traces them back to World War 1

207
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:42,751
What an American army officers

208
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:45,823
Supposedly had some special coins minted for his men

209
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:48,895
And then one of those men was captured by French soldiers

210
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:51,967
Who mistook him for a German and then he use his coin

211
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,247
To prove that he was in America

212
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,575
So the coins have also always been about identity

213
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:03,231
They do tell a story about how the union for the organization wants to be pursued

214
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:03,999
Received

215
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,535
What did they sing car

216
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:11,935
The most important things that they can communicate about themselves to an outside audience in it graphic form

217
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:17,567
Instant identity in the military has a lot to do with hierarchy there is also a hierarchy with challenge

218
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,871
As you move up through the ranks EOS

219
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:20,639
The challenge coin

220
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:22,943
Valuable

221
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,223
Heart attack

222
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:24,991
It's harder to get up

223
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,271
Cuban evil operator

224
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:28,831
Steven harder do

225
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:29,599
To get a secretary

226
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,391
Incredibly hard to go

227
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:39,071
Yes the president has a coin As A really lovely video of Obama giving his coin to a woman who lost

228
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,607
Monster brother in Afghanistan

229
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:43,679
And the military isn't the only institution to use town

230
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:44,959
Although they were the

231
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,775
Now some police departments make coins in

232
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:48,799
Fire departments

233
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,591
NASA gets coins minted

234
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,871
Sports teams have coins

235
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,199
Jimmy Buffett have a coin

236
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:58,527
That's Jordan Haynes again he's the one who told us about the drinking game

237
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,575
A lot of these performers you know

238
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,111
But they're doing a USO tour

239
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,135
Still have feathers

240
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:03,903
Coin with them

241
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,183
Return

242
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,463
Whoever presents the McCoy

243
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,767
In addition to being a collector coins

244
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:11,071
Jordan is actually in the business of making coin

245
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,375
He's made over three million of them

246
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,911
Including Jimmy Buffett

247
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:18,239
I am the founder and CEO of

248
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,775
Coinforce.com

249
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:24,127
Coinforce is one of the private men's that designs and manufactures challenge coins

250
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,151
I'm holding a

251
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:25,919
Coin that I

252
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:26,687
I brought with me

253
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,711
Studio

254
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,735
A diamond shaped

255
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:29,503
Coin

256
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,807
That we made for astronaut Lindgren

257
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,343
It's got his name on it

258
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,367
Translucent

259
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,391
It's like

260
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,415
Just super

261
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,231
Oh my God we do also

262
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:46,143
You don't have to be a president or an astronaut or Jimmy Buffett you too can have a coin you can design your own and then

263
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,423
Just go online and order it

264
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,215
It's basically with the military.

265
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:54,591
Most of the time a unit gets together and talks about what they want on their coin and then gathers the money for it

266
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,359
Themselves

267
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,127
So we're not using tax

268
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,431
It's all by our own for our own

269
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:02,015
Phone so we are swear fundraising internally or we're doing car washes

270
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:05,599
Because coins are not in the budget there's no set procedure for making

271
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,135
And no rules

272
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,927
Which means the design process

273
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,975
This is very informal

274
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,279
Nine times out of ten in the Navy

275
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,815
Someone take that sketch

276
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:15,839
And they

277
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,375
Use clipart put into PowerPoint

278
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,399
And then send it off to

279
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,191
Manufacture PowerPoint

280
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,471
Microsoft

281
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:22,751
PowerPoint

282
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:26,335
PowerPoint is installed on every government computer and it

283
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,359
Mosquito for us

284
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:29,407
It's free and then Jordan at coinforce

285
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,687
Or whoever the manufacturer

286
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,991
Will take that Mark up and finish

287
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,015
Final design

288
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,807
Unreal professional-grade software

289
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,367
A design studio does not use power

290
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,135
Point

291
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,415
To design a challenge

292
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:41,951
Oh that's a relief

293
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:46,815
The individual coins take on a whole new meaning when a bunch are displayed together

294
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:50,911
And a lot of military folks make a labret displays or even custom furniture

295
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,191
Sure to show off their collection

296
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:55,007
Of course some displays are much simpler

297
00:11:55,263 --> 00:12:01,407
In Clinton's presidential portrait he's posing in front of his collection of challenge coins and there in a simple way

298
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:04,223
Wouldn't display but these coin displays are not

299
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,783
Like a flashy show of achievement at all

300
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:09,087
It becomes less a display of

301
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,903
Look at me in more a display of

302
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:15,743
A lot of long quiet hard work over the course of decades

303
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:21,119
The coin show all the professional and personal relationships established over the course of a career

304
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,703
So if you're in the Army and I'm coins from the Air Force in your collection

305
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:30,079
It shows that you've collaborated across military branches which can be really hard to do

306
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:33,663
The coins are physical proof of hard-fought relationships

307
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:34,943
Tumi

308
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:37,503
The coins are full of interesting contradiction

309
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,783
Their combination of

310
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,319
Gravitas in Tradition

311
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,855
With levity enjoy

312
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:48,511
Like my friend then if you wanted to go take that heirloom of his grandfather's time and World War II and Vietnam

313
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,279
Win a beer with it

314
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:55,679
The same coin

315
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,983
Contradictions that you find all over

316
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,007
Military life

317
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,079
The world is regulated and rigorous

318
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:04,127
Is that of the United States military

319
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,407
The coins of this

320
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,943
Fluid quality about them

321
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:10,015
Are different coincheck rules for different branches

322
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:12,575
Coins you some popularity various

323
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:15,135
The history doesn't have a set telling

324
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,671
The design doesn't have

325
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,439
Set rules

326
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:18,975
There is

327
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:23,583
Obviously a very

328
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:24,863
Aspect

329
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,399
To the military but

330
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:29,727
Challenge coins and a lot of other

331
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:33,567
Things that are routine parts of daily military life

332
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,383
Mitigate that structure

333
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:42,527
Challenge coins are a reminder of the human elements of the massive US military

334
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:46,111
A reminder that some servicemen constantly carry

335
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,415
I've been coin checked at the airport

336
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:52,511
Quite check at trade shows I've been coincheck

337
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,535
Everywhere

338
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,839
Now my now my home is off limits

339
00:13:56,095 --> 00:14:00,703
Don't be like crawling up my balcony at 3 a.m. to do a coin check on me on my property

340
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,543
But you catch me outside of my property then you know game on

341
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:08,127
There's no way I'm climbing up on that dude's balcony at 3 a.m.

342
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:21,951
99% invisible West produced this week by Avery trufelman with Katie mingle Sam Greenspan and me Roman Mars

343
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:24,767
Special thanks to Ben glass for waking up so early

344
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:31,423
We are project on 91.7 kalw San Francisco and produced out of the offices of arcsin

345
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:35,775
An architecture and Interiors firm in beautiful Downtown Oakland California

346
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:42,431
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices

347
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,199
We're immersed

348
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:45,759
In a cluttered World a man-made sound

349
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:51,391
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexa

350
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:57,279
Is talking to me and my wife is in another room and a kid is another remembrall hearing that voice

351
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,303
Technology

352
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,071
You talk to us

353
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,375
It is a creation of Sonic trash

354
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:04,447
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

355
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:08,031
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

356
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,823
To make them more human

357
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,919
Turn the living room lights on

358
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,711
Okay

359
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:17,247
Dim the living room lights

360
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,271
50%

361
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,063
Okay

362
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:26,463
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

363
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:29,279
Makes for a much more natural experience

364
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,327
Turn the living room lights on

365
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,911
Dim the living room lights to 50

366
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,679
80%

367
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:44,127
We're presenting two special episodes from 99percentinvisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation about how are sound

368
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,919

00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:16,031
This is not an advertisement I just want to tell you about something I wasn't Radiolab I've been making her last few months

The GPS triggered audio iPhone app called detour

401
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:33,695
The reason I specifically wanted to mention it is because a few weeks back

402
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:36,767
Avery to the story about Austin tower

403
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,047
And one of the story is that

404
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,351
Hans the origin of the towers

405
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:43,167
Is the legend of the servant-girl annihilator

406
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:46,239
And that's a lot of what Radiolab saucin stories about

407
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:49,823
The writer O'Henry was living in Austin back then in 1885

408
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,615
He wrote this one letter I'll never

00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,383
Forget

410
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,663

The murders all happened during this big moment of change in Austin's history and it really showed Austin

417
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:20,287
