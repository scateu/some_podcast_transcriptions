I'm Roman Mars

29
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:34,208
On a Friday evening in the summer of 2011

30
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:37,280
Los Angeles resident Brighton rain was driving home from work

31
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:42,912
He was coming from a job site and took a route he doesn't usually take to get to his neighborhood

32
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,752
And I might not have come this way I mean I'm glad I did because

33
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:50,848
I saw this I knew that it was a problem and I got out of my car

34
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:51,616
What did you say

35
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:55,712
That's a producer Sam Greenspan he met with Brant in Los Angeles

36
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,736
I saw

37
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:00,064
About 25 to 30 guys with

38
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,648
Heavy equipment all wearing orange jumpsuits they had

39
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,440
Backhoes they had

40
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:12,608
Transfer printing machines any like large tractor material like stuff that you can't just like ignore you and I

41
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:16,448
I might not think there's anything weird about a bunch of guys doing work on a freeway burn

42
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,752
But Brent took one look and thought

43
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,032
Well this all seems

44
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:26,688
Fishing charters it seem laid for a city work crew to be doing landscaping

45
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,504
Domo 77

46
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:30,528
What are you doing

47
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,552
Look up be up to something

48
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:36,416
The crew was manicuring some trees and a fenced-off piece of land next to a freeway

49
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,976
Inwood long being a low-income neighborhood

50
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,792
It's a patch of land that never gets landscape

51
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:45,376
The only reason the trees were there was because about 40 years ago

52
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,936
The bird flew over and pooped out fertilized

53
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,728
And no one ever touch

54
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,008
It's not like

55
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:55,104
They're just putting the tree up to make it look better on the freeway look at all the rest of them they look like crap

56
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,896
And that's when Brent put it together

57
00:02:57,408 --> 00:03:02,528
A work crew doing an after-hours landscaping job in an area where they never do any work

58
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,088
DeBrands this meant one thing

59
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,624
I know

60
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,160
With all my

61
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,464
Being that there's 30 seconds free

62
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:13,280
Stealing trees

63
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,840
Now the reason that Brent Green was able to deduce all of this

64
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,632
Is because he is by

65
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,656
Grade a landscape

66
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,728
And so he knew the worth of the trees

67
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,264
Did the work Rueda messing with

68
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,592
How much to purchase these trees for projects and then like 20 grand

69
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,640
$20,000 a tree

70
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:31,456
Rent in front of the workers and ask them what they were doing

71
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,736
Some of them took off running

72
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,784
Later a woman who lives in mats

73
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,320
Street came down from her apartment

74
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:37,344
Inverness

75
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,904
If you knew what was going on

76
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:44,000
Didn't just take that one and I think they took like six other ones

77
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:47,584
They took two over there for when they are living here all week

78
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,120
You know that I called

79
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:56,800
This is not the first case of poem theft bomb wrestling has been reported in Texas and San Diego it even get to

80
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,104
Mentioned in Susan Orlean's book The Orchid Thief

81
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,920
And understand why someone would want to steal a pump

82
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:04,224
We need to really understand their value

83
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,760
Which has a lot to do with it

84
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,808
Space they occupy in our Collective

85
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,344
And for that

86
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,368
We need to talk.

87
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,928
My name is Jared farmer

88
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,720
I am the author of

89
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,744
Trees in

90
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:18,559
It is book

91
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:21,375
Beard farmer traces the history of the Golden State

92
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,911
Four kinds of trees

93
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:23,935
One of them

94
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:24,703
The Palms

95
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:28,287
The others are the Redwood the Citrus and the eucalyptus

96
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,335
That we should get sent away first

97
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,127
A palm tree isn't really a

98
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,663
It's actually not a tree

99
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,015
What kind of grass is like a super grass is like hundreds or thousands

100
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:43,135
Long Blades of grass in extensions like fused together don't make bark

101
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,159
Or branches

102
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,719
If you cut them down you won't find any rings in the trunk

103
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:53,375
All the roots grow on a compact making them easier to steal that say like an oak tree which has next

104
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,167
Vantiv underground root Network

105
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:59,775
And as far as trees go we don't plant palms for any of the normal reasons we want other tree

106
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:03,103
It's not for the shade is not for

107
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:05,919
Climbing you can't really climb a palm tree very well It cast

108
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:06,943
Precious little shave

109
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,479
Palm trees it seems

110
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,759
Do something else

00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,551
Darrell vocativ

112
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,831

They Inspire us

114
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,647
To dream big

115
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,927
Image of beauty

116
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:17,695
In fashion

117
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,463
And Design

118
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,743
Architect

119
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,791
Palms

120
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:25,375
Especially Urban Palms in places like Los Angeles are planted less

121
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,655
For what they do

122
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,471
Then what they mean or rather what they mean

123
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:30,239
Is

124
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,007
What they do

125
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,127
If you trace the history of what palm trees have

126
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,919
Have symbolized in the western imagination

127
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,455
Ask Jared farmer has

128
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:45,343
You start to get the idea that palm trees have always been about evoking a spirit of Elsewhere

129
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:50,207
Even 200 years ago palm trees were planted in California by the Spanish

130
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:52,511
As a way of signifying on the Holy Land

131
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,047
Orthodox Christianity in Rome

132
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:54,815
Catholicism

133
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,351
Dolphin demands actually happen

134
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:59,935
Franzen at the wrist reason the Spanish in California Groupon

135
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,471
Pounds for

136
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:05,055
On Sunday so palm trees were around by the time that California be

137
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,079
Estate in 80

138
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:06,847
1850

139
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,127
And around that same time

140
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,223
There was a trend in art and literature of what we now call orientalism

141
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,759
A kind of fascination

142
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:19,135
So that fantasy of like Arabs and Bedouin sand

143
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:21,183
Oasis in Sahara Zod back on

144
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,999
The palm trees dovetailed quite nicely

145
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,279
Put those kinds of fascination

146
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:29,119
Palm trees were also used to make people think of the tropics

147
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,167
MLB Street ropes are unfolding

148
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:34,239
Palm tree symbolizing the Holy Land the Orient

149
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,007
The tropics

150
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,591
They also kind of do this thing where they all congeal and collapse

151
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,359
Sent you a bigger nose

152
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,895
That we can still recognize

153
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:41,663
Today

154
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,199
Palm trees in the symbol

155
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,223
For luxury

156
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,807
And Leisure survive if you went to San Francisco.

157
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:48,575
Two Union Square

158
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,343
Corky went

159
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,159
To Manhattan or to Paris or The Londoner

160
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,439
Uniworld City in

161
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,207
In the West

162
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:56,255
You would find a Palm Court

163
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:57,791
In the hotel

164
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:01,119
Even the RMS Titanic had a Palm Court

165
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:05,471
Even though Palms were already going International by the dawn of the 20th century

166
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,751
It was in California

167
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,543
Around Los Angeles especially

168
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:11,359
Their place in the global imagination really

169
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,127
Took root

170
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:12,895
So good

171
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,687
A trend emerged among homeowners

172
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:18,015
Price of planting palm trees on either side of their front door

173
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:21,855
At first this was only thing that wealthy people did but at some point

174
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:25,695
You're not rich you just have a little starter Bungalow in LA but like you got palm trees

175
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:28,511
Ways to that really did sort of signify you have achieved

176
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:29,791
Not just

177
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:33,375
The American Dream by the California version of the American dream which was

178
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,911
Everything in the American dream

179
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,191
Offer but also

180
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,215
Great weather

181
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,751
Gorgeous setting

182
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,847
Trees that flower smell good and look good every month

183
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,919
Am I taking off

184
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:48,991
Something happens in the rich suburbs outside of LA

185
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:51,295
In towns like Redlands in Riverside

186
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,087
Which were then Super affluent

187
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,135
People there started planting Palms

188
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,927
Not just on private property

189
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,975
But also along city streets

190
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:03,071
Almost as if to say we will be reminded of luxury

191
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,607
Everywhere we go

192
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,631
It's about

193
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:08,191
Really what I would call the Municipal Park

194
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,215
The Palms At

195
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:12,287
Symbolizes the city of Sailfin symbolizes good life in the city

196
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:16,895
Eventually Los Angeles proper got hip to this idea of Municipal trees

197
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:21,759
And during the Great Depression the works progress administration put a lot of unemployment work

198
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:22,783
Planting trees

199
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,551
Throughout the cell

200
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:29,183
There are more than 2500 species of palm tree

201
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:34,303
What is Palm Trees florist in California there's one particular species that still down

202
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,095
The Canary Island date palm

203
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,119
Or

204
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,399
Phoenix canariensis

205
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:41,471
Yeah it is probably the most spectacular Palm in the world.

206
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,543
In terms of the number of Franz

207
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,591
What's the width of the France

208
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,383
And it has a kind of bumpy

209
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,407
Crosshatch

210
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,687
Truck front window

211
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,711
Franz detach

212
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:54,783
The Phoenix canariensis is so stately and Majestic

213
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:59,391
It was used as a v symbol of California boosterism a pattern of descent

214
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,695
When Phoenix was even dug up

215
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,231
Put on a railcar

216
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:03,999
And freighted

217
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,279
All the way to Chicago

218
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,327
For the 1893 Columbian

219
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,375
And everyday

220
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,655
On the trunk

221
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:14,751
California boosters would put up a piece of paper that listed

222
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:15,519
The temperature

223
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,567
At Coronado Beach

224
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,591
It San Diego

225
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:24,991
And at Lake Michigan just for comparison always Bendix about our weather

226
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:25,759
Exposition

227
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,295
The palm tree was sent back to

228
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,063
California

229
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:33,951
Obviously it wasn't going to be left to suffer in The Frigid City of Chicago can you imagine

230
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,743
This is me being a dick about our weather

231
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:41,887
For a long time the Phoenix canariensis was mostly a symbol of Southern California

232
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,167
But eventually

233
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:48,031
Especially for the 1990s they were also in hot demand up north in the Bay Area

234
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,847
And since of Phoenix canariensis takes 52

235
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,127
60 years to mature

236
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,151
Tree nurseries

237
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,687
Couldn't keep up with the demand

238
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:58,015
You just can't manufacture more 50 year old palm tree

239
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,807
So broke

240
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,367
They go to older residential neighborhoods

241
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,671
What people have liked a little bungalow

242
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,695
They're like a 3rd generation

243
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,487
Uncle are they now have this

244
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,023
84 Palms

245
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:12,863
They might have some sentimental attachment to a profession not doing much for them

246
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,143
If someone offers them

247
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:14,911
A few hundred dollars

248
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,191
Take it off there

249
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,471
Many people

250
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,239
Will take that opportunity

251
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:19,775
Recession

252
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,567
Canary Island date palm trees has

253
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,591
Has died down a little

254
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,383
But they are still in high demand

255
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:27,967
Between the demand the time it takes for a tree to mature

256
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,783
And this year have to move in these things

257
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:35,391
Phoenix canariensis is the most expensive palm tree to buy

258
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,415
The going price

259
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,951
Including a truck to move it

260
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,231
A crane to lift it

261
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,511
Fruta planta

262
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,535
A lot of money

263
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:46,143
Twenty Grand apple tree Des again $20,000 a tree

264
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,215
And that is why to bring it back to work earlier

265
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:56,127
Angeleno Brent Green was so outraged when he saw that work Brew in his neighborhood that summer night into

266
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:56,895
2011

267
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,175
They were there

268
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:58,943
Rental lease

269
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:03,295
To steal more than $100,000 worth of palm trees

270
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,855
Reported what he sought the police

271
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:08,415
Also got the local NBC affiliate on the trail

272
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,975
And our investigation is found this could be

273
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,767
An inside job

274
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:15,583
We found at least one Caltrans official

275
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,375
Could be involved in these staff

276
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,167
Long story short

277
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:25,567
Employee of the California Department of Transportation had signed off on a work order allowing the third party to go

278
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,847
Go in and remove the tree

279
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,639
A lawsuit followed

280
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,663
One result of which

281
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:33,503
Was six Canary Island date palms getting put back on the freeway burn

282
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,271
Inbreds neighbor

283
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:40,927
At any rate it might not matter too much in the grand scheme of things because the treescape of Los Angeles is about to have

284
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:43,231
A lot fewer palm trees to co

285
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,279
Fungus called fusarium wilt

286
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:48,607
Has been randomly killing off certain species of palm trees

287
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,655
Including the Phoenix canariensis

288
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:56,799
Several different landscape designers told me that they avoid using the Phoenix canariensis Palms right now

289
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:59,359
Because of their susceptibility to the wilt

290
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:06,015
And on top of that as of 2006 the city of Los Angeles has greatly kuerbitz replant

291
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,039
Dana fan Palms

292
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,575
Those are the really tall

293
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,623
Spindly guys with the skinny trunks

294
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:17,023
The motion approved by the city council stated that fan Palms don't provide adequate recover they don't release novox

295
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,303
Oxygen into the atmosphere

296
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:21,631
And they said so many fronts that they are considered hazard

297
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,471
All the palm trees that got planted in the teens twenties and thirties

298
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:28,543
Are all going to be dying of old age in the next

299
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,311
Few decades

300
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,847
I'm helping getting replanted

301
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,895
Pompa largely disappear from the law

302
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:40,063
No course Palm Trees will still get replanted in the iconic spots where people expect palm trees to be

303
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,879
Designated tour sounds like Hollywood and Sunset Boulevard

304
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:43,903
That's where they will always be

305
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,791
But Jared farmer is actually not too sad

306
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,071
I see the palms of Southern Calif

307
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:56,191
When you go this is a guy who writes about trees for a living and it's a self-proclaimed lover of pain

308
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,727
The time of

309
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,007
Up less water more

310
00:12:59,263 --> 00:12:59,775
People

311
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,543
I think we have to make

312
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,079
Wiser choices about the country

313
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:05,663
California was still have an incredibly diverse

314
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,687
A treescape

315
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,991
But Los Angeles without palm trees

316
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,295
Not unfriend greens watch anyway

317
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:14,367
He told me that when he was a kid he used to draw house

318
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,159
Houses with palm trees next to them

319
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:21,023
And now that he's a grown-up he's fulfilled his own California American Dream

320
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,071
Though his house is a modest bungalow

321
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:27,423
It's made so much more stately by the 10 or so Palms in front of his home

322
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,215
And even knowing

323
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:34,079
Everything I know about palms that they were basically marketing tools and how they play this

324
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,127
Sony sense of exoticism

325
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,663
I have to say

326
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,199
It all still kind of works on

327
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:41,247
I found myself in awe

328
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:44,575
And a little jealous of Brent's California Dream

329
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:48,159
Palm of Gumball bumpers now

330
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,951
The number problem hello my phone

331
00:13:56,095 --> 00:14:01,983
99% invisible with Bruce this week by Sam Greenspan with Katie mingle Avery trufelman and me Roman Mars

332
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:06,591
Special thanks to Cindy Gilliland Jason DeWees Darren Sears and Tom Dreisbach

333
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:13,247
We are project to 91.7 kalw San Francisco and produced out of the offices of arcsin in architecture

334
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:16,319
Interiors firm in beautiful Downtown Oakland California

335
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:20,927
Between the beats

336
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,231
Bongs and Charter of our devices

337
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:23,999
We're immersed

338
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:26,815
The cluttered World a man-made sound

339
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:27,839
If

340
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:32,191
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexa

341
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:38,079
Is talking to me and my wife is in another room in a kid is in another room and we're all hearing. Voice

342
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,103
Technology

343
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:39,871
You talk to us

344
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,175
It is a creation of Sonic trash

345
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:45,247
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

346
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:48,831
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

347
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,623
To make them more human

348
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,719
Turn the living room lights on

349
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,511
Okay

350
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,047
Dim the living room lights

351
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,071
50%

352
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:00,863
Okay

353
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:07,263
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

354
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,567
Makes for a much more natural

355
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,335
Experience

356
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,127
Turn the living room lights on

357
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,223
Dim the living room lights to 50%

358
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:24,927
We're presenting two special episodes from 99percentinvisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation about how are sound

359
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,719
Landscape is impacting our health

360
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,279
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

361
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:32,095
Look for them Fridays May 17th and May 24th

362
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:32,863
Right here

363
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,399
NPI fate

364
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,239
Family ghosts
