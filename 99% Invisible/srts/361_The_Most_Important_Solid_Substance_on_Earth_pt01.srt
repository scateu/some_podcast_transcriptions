To take your survey today that serving art.com invisible

10
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:32,768
This is 99% invisible

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,048
I'm Roman Mars

12
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:40,704
Today Show is about something so tiny and unremarkable and ubiquitous

13
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:43,264
But I can't quite believe we're doing whole episode about it

14
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:44,544
It's sand

15
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,896
The tiny grains of eroded rock that we sculpt in the castles at the beach

16
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:52,736
Send my nuts like a topic worthy of our attention

17
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:55,808
Vince beiser wrote a whole book about sand is called

18
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:59,392
The world in a grain and I promise you it is fascinating

19
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:00,928
Is my conversation with Vince

20
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:02,208
All about sand

21
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:04,512
And how it transformed our civilization

22
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:13,472
You know when you were spending a few years on this I imagine you told someone you're working on a book about sand

23
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:15,264
What was the look on their face

24
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:18,592
And how did you explain to them to make them understand

25
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:21,152
How cool and important the subject is

26
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,504
So every single time I would get this looked at was just like

27
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:28,576
Like why my trap

28
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:34,464
You know why am I trapped in a conversation with this person who's about to you know who's so obsessed with the most boring

29
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,488
Thing on earth

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,536
And based my comeback was

31
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:41,376
Why would I write a book about what sounds like the most boring thing in the world

32
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:43,680
And the reason is because

33
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:48,288
Sand is actually the most important solid substance on Earth

34
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,616
It's the literal Foundation of modern civilization

35
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:52,640
Yeah

36
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:55,456
And so how do we use sand in our daily life

37
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:56,992
So basically

38
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:59,040
If you look around you

39
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:03,392
Right now I don't know where you are but chances are excellent no matter

40
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:06,464
What kind of building or office or room you're sitting in

41
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:09,792
Floor underneath you the walls around the ceiling overhead

42
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,120
The building you're sitting it is probably made at least partly out of

43
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,144
Concrete

44
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,240
Just like every shopping mall every apartment building every

45
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,544
Office tower everywhere in the world

46
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,592
From Beijing to Lagos is made out of

47
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,360
Concrete

48
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,896
And what is concrete

49
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:27,456
Concrete is nothing but Sand and Gravel

50
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,736
That's been stuck together

51
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:31,296
The roads that connect all those buildings

52
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,088
Also made out of sand there either

53
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:35,392
Concrete are there asphalt asphalt is also J

54
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,672
Sand that's been glued together

55
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:40,000
The windows in every one of those buildings are made of sand

56
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:42,816
Glass is nothing but sand that's been melted down

57
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,352
The Silicon chip

58
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46,656
The power our computers or cell phones

59
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,192
Also made from Sand

60
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,472
Other words

61
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,496
Without sand

62
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,032
No modern

63
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,080
And here's the real kicker

64
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,128
We are starting to run

65
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:00,736
Possible if you feel like there is

66
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,528
So much sand in the world

67
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,088
There is a lot of sand in the world

68
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:07,648
It's actually the most abundant thing on the planet

69
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,416
But

70
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,952
We are also using

71
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,768
Way more of it than ever before in human history

72
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,864
We use more sand than any other natural resource in the world

73
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,400
Except for air and water

74
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:22,752
We're about 50 billion tons of the stuff every single year

75
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:25,568
Which is enough to cover the entire state of Calif

76
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,336
California

77
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,360
Why

78
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:30,944
Don't we just go to the Sahara and take all the saint there

79
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,480
Write great question

80
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:33,760
So there is a course

81
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:37,088
You know practically infinite amounts of sand in the desert

82
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:37,856
Problem is

83
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:40,928
That's and is pretty much useless to us

84
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,488
The reason is that desert sand

85
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:49,888
As a different shape that actual greens are shaped differently than the sand grains that you find at the bottom of rivers

86
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:50,656
Beaches

87
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:55,776
It's been eroded by wind rather than water over if you know thousands of millions of years

88
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:58,080
And as a result the greens are a lot

89
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,616
Rounder and smoother

90
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:02,688
And the crazy fun at the bottom of rivers

91
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,992
So the number one thing that we need sand

92
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,784
4 by far is concrete

93
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:10,112
And that desert sand just doesn't lock together

94
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:10,880
Format

95
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:13,440
Strong stable structure that you need for conch

96
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,488
If I could difference between

97
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:19,583
Trying to build something out of a stack of little marbles as opposed to a stack of little

98
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:23,167
It's all that desert sand pretty much

99
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,959
And so we have to get it

100
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:25,727
From

101
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:30,079
Water eroded sand that comes off of mountains and then accumulates in

102
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:33,663
Rivers and things like that that's that's the sound we need

103
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:34,687
Exactly

104
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:37,759
Exactly this is why I become such a problem because

105
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:41,087
You know when you're talking about extracting millions of tons of

106
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,111
Saint from

107
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,647
Bottom of a lake or the bottom up

108
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:48,255
River inevitably we are doing tremendous environmental damage

109
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,535
To get that sand

110
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:54,655
Ripping up riverbed stripping beaches bear stripping Lakebottom spare

111
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,447
Even picking it up out of the ocean

112
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,215
Cousin

113
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,519
Huge environmental damage all over the world

114
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,311
And in some places

115
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,359
Supplies have gotten so tight

116
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:06,943
Organized crime has actually moved into the industry that

117
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,735
Black Market in sand

118
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:11,295
So the demand for Sandi's Sewing Center

119
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,087
That is actually leading to

120
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,111
Global

121
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:17,951
Conflict it's true there is so much demand for sand that

122
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:22,047
In many places around the world people are being imprisoned

123
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,839
Tortured and murdered

124
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,119
By the hundreds

125
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,399
Oversand

126
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:32,543
And the violence is probably at its worst in India where they actually called in the sand Mafia

127
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:33,823
But it's

128
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:40,223
By no means the only place a lien keenyah in Indonesia and Gambia and many other places around the world

129
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:44,063
Same kind of thing people are are fighting and

130
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,367
Killing and dying over sand

131
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,135
Ma

132
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,439
And you've actually witnessed some of this

133
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,975
In India you witness

134
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,023
Some of the crime associated with

135
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:53,791
Cassandra

136
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:57,375
Yeah absolutely this is what got me started on it is I just

137
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,655
Stumbled across

138
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:03,007
An article about the murder of a farmer in India

139
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,287
And

140
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:07,615
What really caught my eye was that he had been killed over

141
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,383
Send

142
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:11,711
And you know that point I was like most people I never even

143
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,479
Thought about

144
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:17,343
Send my life and never given it a second thought Beyond like how am I going to get this sand out of my bathing suit

145
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:22,463
But then I do a little more research and found that special in Indian

146
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,767
Hundreds of people have been murdered over stand

147
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,303
In the last few years

148
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,351
And I just thought that was the

149
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:33,983
Craziest thing I've ever heard of like what what in the world would makes and so valuable so important

150
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,007
People jail for it

151
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,311
And what I discovered was

152
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,615
Did its sand is really the

153
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:42,175
Substance that we need to build cities out of

154
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:46,527
And in India as in most of the developing world right in China

155
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,831
Nigeria Indonesia you name it

156
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,879
We're building cities

157
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:54,719
At a rate and at a speed that has never happened before in human history

158
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,511
Means we need huge amount

159
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,279
Send

160
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:07,007
Weiser says that today massive amounts of sand are being moved around the world

161
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:07,775
The glass

162
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,567
Beer chips and asphalt

163
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,615
The years and has more

164
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,407
The little ground beneath us

165
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:16,223
Into a commodity that's mined and refined

166
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,783
And sold in a global Marketplace

167
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,831
And will Sanders the bases

168
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:25,951
I'm so many different products by far the biggest driver of a demand for sand

169
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,231
Is the production

170
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,255
Concrete

171
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:31,327
Yeah it's the story of concrete is complete

172
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:35,679
Completely fascinating to me I didn't know anything about it until I started the research for this book

173
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:40,031
You make concrete by taking sand and gravel and

174
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,335
Gluing them together with cement

175
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:46,175
And you can make cementing in a few different ways but basically

176
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:51,295
You take a substance like lime and you bake it down and it turns into a powder

177
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:54,111
And then when you mix that powder with water

178
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,159
I-84 misses paste

179
00:07:56,671 --> 00:08:00,511
The clues together all that sand and aggregate but the real magic of it is

180
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:05,887
It does more than just hardened it actually forms a chemical bond between all those

181
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,679
The constituent parts

182
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:10,239
Like the grains of sand in the gravel in the cement

183
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,543
Which is why it's such a great Building Material rights

184
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,847
Really really strong it's really flexible

185
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:15,871
Anyway

186
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:19,455
There are at least a couple three ancient civilizations that

187
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:22,527
Somehow figured out how to do this the ancient Mayans

188
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,319
Use the form of concrete

189
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,367
Ancient Egyptians

190
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,903
Might have had a form of cement

191
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:32,255
But there was the Romans who really figured it out and they actually used concrete

192
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,047
And I really

193
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,607
Extensive way they build roads out of it they do

194
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,887
Aqueduct out of it

195
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:41,983
They build buildings out of there still standing today like the pantheon

196
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,263
In Rome

197
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,359
Has a concrete roof that's over 2000 years old and it

198
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,639
Still standing

199
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,455
So here's the really bizarre twist to the Romans

200
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:53,503
Figured out how to use concrete music

201
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,295
The great effect for centuries

202
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:58,111
But then when the Roman Empire collapse

203
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,391
The world should have

204
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,415
Forgot

205
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:03,743
How to make concrete like the secret of concrete making

206
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:06,047
Have disappeared with the Roman Empire

207
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,583
And nobody built

208
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,911
Anything with concrete for about 1500 years

209
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:12,959
Brookside now

210
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:15,007
I love the story because I feel like

211
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:21,407
It's the stroke that you seen a lot of Science Fiction and Fantasy that there's this ancient forgotten knowledge that holds the key to the Future

212
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,991
Is that a busy week never exist in the real world

213
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:25,759
Except

214
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,807
The story of concrete

215
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:34,207
Concrete is it amazing technology that gets completely forgotten for hundreds of years until the turn of the century

216
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,999
And then it re-emerges

217
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,535
In a big way

218
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:40,095
And what really made the big change

219
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:41,887
Was

220
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:44,191
An architect named Ernest Ransom

221
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,775
Was a British architect who had immigrated to the United States

222
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:48,799
Set up shop

223
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,079
In San Francisco

224
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:53,151
And he started tinkering around cement and with

225
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:53,919
Concrete

226
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,199
And

227
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:57,247
Figuring out different ways to

228
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,783
You're the perfect mix

229
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,319
And eventually

230
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:03,135
Literally threw tinkering in his backyard

231
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:06,719
He came up with the idea of reinforced concrete

232
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,535
Which is concrete with those steel bars

233
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,815
Running through it

234
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,095
And that is was

235
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:16,191
Ernest R and sounds great Innovation Paisley found the pie pudding

236
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,215
Steel bars

237
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:20,287
Inside the concrete to concrete woodbine's those bars

238
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,055
Edward

239
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,847
Massively increased

240
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,127
Tensile strength

241
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,407
Of the concrete

242
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,687
And you realized

243
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:33,087
Wow this is an incredible building material I can build the walls and the roofs of structures with this stuff

244
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:36,415
And it'll be cheap and it'll be strong and

245
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,975
Holy smokes this is the tale of the future

246
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,511
Darkness Ransom

247
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:46,655
So he ran around the country trying to sell people on this idea and basically people laughed at him

248
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,423
They're just like

249
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,447
Why the world

250
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,031
Would we even try this this crazy new building material

251
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:54,335
We build with stone we build with

252
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,383
Bricks we build with Timber

253
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:59,711
These things have been tried and trusted for centuries

254
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,991
Why on Earth would we

255
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:03,039
Take a chance on your wacky new idea

256
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,367
So he literally tries for years and years

257
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,719
Sell people on this idea and he gets a few commissions he manages to build a

258
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,767
You get a few buildings

259
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:15,839
Built out of concrete in a couple of different places

260
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:18,399
Two or three of them in San Francisco where he lives

261
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:19,935
So

262
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,983
Then comes 1906

263
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,287
The Sam great San Francisco earthquake

264
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:31,967
Massive earthquake demolishes most of the city followed by an enormous fire that basically Burns

265
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,271
San Francisco to the ground

266
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,575
But When the Smoke Clears

267
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,855
And the dust has settled

268
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:41,951
Some of the very few structures left standing in San Francisco are

269
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,231
Ernest Ransom

270
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,511
Reinforced

271
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,047
Concrete buildings

272
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:51,679
And that was a real Turning Point people all around the country and in fact all around the world

273
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,959
Look at that instead

274
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:53,727
Wow

275
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,287
That concrete stuff

276
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,567
I really works

277
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,663
You know it wouldn't make it withstood the fire

278
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,455
That stuff looks great

279
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:06,015
And in your book you talk about how

280
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:09,599
The new concrete industry that was developing really took advantage

281
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:15,231
Which of these images from the San Francisco fire in the concrete warehouses that survived his way to argue that

282
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,511
Like hey check out this

283
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,047
Amazing new

284
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,071
Fire safing

285
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,607
Earthquake proof material

286
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,399
Yeah absolutely

287
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:27,519
They push themselves you know to to builders to Engineers to the General Public

288
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:32,383
In a really big way advertising themselves really as you have the material of the future

289
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:33,663
And in fact

290
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:37,247
It is I mean concrete is an amazingly

291
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,807
Versatile and useful material

292
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,087
Very easy to work with

293
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,367
Cheap

294
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:46,207
And it's really strong as long as you build it correctly

295
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,767
But you can see it I mean I certify

296
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:51,583
Trawled through a lot of newspapers at the time

297
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,399
And he was almost like

298
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:58,751
Like their computers and digital technology in the 90s

299
00:12:59,007 --> 00:12:59,519
It's the way that

300
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,311
Journalist writing about this

301
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,151
Amazing science has revolutionized our

302
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:09,247
Way of building Nevermore will we have to worry about fire like

303
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:13,855
You know as though concrete was going to solve every problem known to man it was really

304
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:15,135
People are just

305
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,183
Ecstatic over it and in fact

306
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,975
Thomas Edison

307
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,279
He was just in love with concrete

308
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,071
He thought concrete was going to be

309
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:29,215
You know it was not only going to be an important building material but they basically you could build anything out of concrete

310
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:33,055
He built several completely all concrete

311
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,079
Houses

312
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:37,407
At what she furnished with concrete furniture

313
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:39,967
Even though the concrete piano

314
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:43,039
50 Cent touring around the country

315
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:46,623
It doesn't allow architects

316
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,415
Quite inventive because if it

317
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,439
You know

318
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:52,255
Its ability to be shaped and all different kinds of way

319
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,791
Oh absolutely

320
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,327
Absolutely I mean you know

321
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,375
Look at things structures like

322
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,911
Like the guggenheimer

323
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:03,775
You know this the Sydney Opera House these incredibly fanciful

324
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,823
Annie's beautiful creations

325
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,871
You can make those things out of bricks

326
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,919
You know RR Stone

327
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:12,223
Yeah no concretas

328
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,503
Alien addition 2

329
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:17,855
To making it easy to to build really strong durable structures it makes

330
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,623
Is it possible

331
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:19,903
To build

332
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,463
Some of the most beautiful land and inventive

333
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,743
Structures in the world

334
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,303
Not to mention the most useful I mean

335
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,583
Things like

336
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,887
You know these enormous dams

337
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,703
That's really made possible the

338
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,007
The modern Southwest in a lot of ways

339
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,567
And we went through

340
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:42,943
In the Western World we went through our phase of a building a lot of concrete in the 20th century and now

341
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:43,967
There is a

342
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:47,295
Huge growth in cities in Asia and Africa

343
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:50,111
So is that where a lot of the Santa's going today

344
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,647
Yeah so we

345
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:56,767
I mean we're still building of course in the Western World we still use a lot of sand in a lot of concrete here

346
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,327
But it is absolutely dwarfed

347
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,143
The master we use in the western world is

348
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,215
Absolutely dwarfed by what's going on in the developing world

349
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:10,847
And the reason for that is number one there's more and more people in the world all the time right populations growing

350
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:14,431
And more and more than we're moving into cities all the time

351
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:18,015
Same thing to happen in this country a hundred years ago people left

352
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:22,111
Agricultural Countryside they left farming villages

353
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,391
And moved into cities

354
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:26,207
The same thing is happening in India and China

355
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:30,303
Oliver Africa but on a much bigger scale and how much

356
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,607
Faster rated a much more compressed

357
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:33,887
Time frame

358
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:36,959
So to give you an idea we're adding the equivalent to

359
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:39,263
Eight New York cities to the world

360
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,799
Every single

361
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,847
Here yeah

362
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,895
Here's another way to think about it

363
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:48,223
The amount of concrete that we use every single year

364
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,783
Is enough to build a wall

365
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:55,391
88 feet high is 88 feet wide right around the equator

366
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,415
Every year

367
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,719
And most of that is happening

368
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:02,303
In the developing world and more than anywhere else it's happening in China

369
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,327
China is

370
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,887
Far and Away the world's number one

371
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,191
Consumer of sand a concrete

372
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,239
Hundreds of Millions

373
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,519
The people in China

374
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:14,335
Have moved from the countryside into cities

375
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,615
In the last

376
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:18,431
Decade or two and remember of core cities are made of

377
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:19,455
Concrete

378
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:22,527
Into where is China sand coming from

379
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,063
Yasso

380
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:30,463
Famous Andy's you always want to get it from somewhere close to where you're going to actually use it because sand is very

381
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,231
Heavy

382
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,791
Cubic yard of sand weighs more than a ton

383
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:39,167
If you have to transport it more than a few miles the cost of it goes up very quickly

384
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,959
So basically

385
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:45,311
Builders in China and everywhere else are always looking for sand that's close by

386
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,335
So

387
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:50,687
Think about Shanghai for example Shanghai is one of these cities that is Jessica

388
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,455
Exploded

389
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,991
In the last 20 years

390
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:55,039
More skyscrapers have been built

391
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,319
In Shanghai

392
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,111
In the last 20 years

393
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:00,415
Then there are in all of New York City

394
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,463
So obviously they are using

395
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:05,791
Just a staggering amount of sand where's it all coming from

396
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:06,815
Well

397
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,351
Fur in the early

398
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:11,423
Part of this Century there getting most of it from the Yangtze River

399
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:14,751
They're just scooping it right off the bottom of the Yangtze River

400
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:20,639
And that caused a lot of problems number one it was causing Riverbanks to literally collapse

401
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,943
Apps right when you dig out the middle of the river

402
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,271
The sides of the river off and just collapsed taking with it

403
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:28,575
Agricultural land villages

404
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:31,903
You know it is snarls up shipping in a really terrible way

405
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:32,927
And also

406
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:35,487
Does serious damage to the river's ecosys

407
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:38,303
Emacs anything that was living on the bottom of the river

408
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,631
Obviously has gone their habitats just been destroyed

409
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,655
And also

410
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:49,055
That when you set up the water like that it blocks the sunlight from reaching plants that are growing underneath

411
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:49,823
The water

412
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,615
Huge damage

413
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:56,991
And the Chinese authorities realized this they were like well this is a serious problem for the Yangtze River which is

414
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,527
Probably important

415
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:02,879
Resource for China is the source of drinking water for hundreds of millions of people

416
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,159
Fish temperature

417
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,439
So

418
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,719
They had to ban

419
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,279
Buy sand mining on the Yangtze River

420
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,815
As a result

421
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,143
Sand miners just to push their operations

422
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,935
She doesn't miles Upstream

423
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:18,751
To the biggest freshwater lake in China

424
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,031
It's called Lake poyang

425
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,615
So lake poyang has now become the biggest

426
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,383
Sand mine

427
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,151
In the world

428
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,431
Spotify

429
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:29,759
230 odd million tons of sand are scooped out of the

430
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,039
Lake every year

431
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:33,599
And that now of course is starting to

432
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,647
Generate its own set of Environmental

433
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:38,463
Problem set Sun causing real damage

434
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:45,119
Two of the many many fish and and birds that live there including endangered species like freshwater porpoise

435
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:51,007
So basically where does China get its Ann from it gets it from wherever is Handy

436
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:56,127
And when you wrote that much pressure on whatever river or lake or whatever is Handy

437
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,663
It causes problems inevitable

438
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,223
I mean is this

439
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:02,015
A race to the bottom of weed

440
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,551
Going to run out of sand

441
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,855
So we're not going to

442
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:12,255
Completely run out of sand anytime in the foreseeable future we're not going to be fighting over the very last little

443
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:14,047
Pilot the last few grains on Earth

444
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:18,655
But what's happening with Sanders is much more like what's happening with oil and gas

445
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:21,727
Right there still a lot of it on the planet

446
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:23,263
But

447
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:26,591
The stuff that's easy to get at has been mostly Tapped Out

448
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,615
Stopped at stats

449
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,663
Close to the surface and chiba

450
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:32,223
And and easy to get our hands on

451
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,527
Is increasingly disappearing

452
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:38,111
And we're having to go further and further and do more and more damage

453
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,391
How to get the stuff

454
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:43,487
The same thing that you see happening with oil where we're having to do things like

455
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,255
Fracking

456
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,791
Offshore oil drilling

457
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,327
To get the oil that's left

458
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,119
Similar kind of thing is happening

459
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,399
Sad we're having to do

460
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:53,215
To dig deeper and deeper into more and more damage

461
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:55,007
To get at the dwindling

462
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:55,775
Supplies of sand

463
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,079
Beyond the damage that

464
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:00,895
You can inflict on the land by

465
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,431
Mining the sand

466
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:03,711
What is

467
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:06,271
The cost of concrete to the planet

468
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,623
Yashow concrete has some very significant costs number one

469
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:12,415
Is carbon emissions

470
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,719
So manufacturing cement

471
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,743
I is

472
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:19,327
Depending on how you measure either the second or the third biggest

473
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:22,655
Carbon dioxide is better greenhouse gas emitter

474
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,423
On the Platte

475
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:28,031
Did the energy that's required it takes up a lot of a lot of energy to

476
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,311
2

477
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:31,103
Incinerate all the

478
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:34,943
The line that you need to make cement number one and also the process

479
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,479
Self gives off a lot of gas

480
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,015
So it creates

481
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:40,319
Somewhere in the neighborhood of 10%

482
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:42,623
Of all greenhouse gases are created by

483
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,159
The cement industry

484
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,951
Course you need cement in Bangkok

485
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,999
So that's that's number one

486
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:49,791
Number two

487
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,607
Is that by covering so much ground

488
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,887
With concrete

489
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:57,983
You created a lot of places What's called the urban heat island effect

490
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,519
The sun's Heat

491
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:02,335
Gets soaked up and held by all that concrete

492
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:05,919
The temperature of cities can be raised by as much as

493
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,455
10 or 15 degrees

494
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:12,063
Just due to the fact that the concrete has is retaining all of that

495
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:15,135
And that's obviously a big problem in the world

496
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,928
It's getting harder all the time

497
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,720
Another fact

498
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,256
Impact it can have

499
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,536
Which is better can make

500
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,304
Flooding

501
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:23,328
Worse

502
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,352
Because

503
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:26,400
For the most part concrete is not

504
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,424
Poorest right at

505
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:29,216
Water flows over it

506
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:30,496
So

507
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,800
What princess what happened in

508
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,336
In the last

509
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,872
Set of floods in Houston

510
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:42,784
Is it made those floods worse because when those rivers rivers overflow their Banks all the water goes pouring into

511
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,552
Cities

512
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:48,928
And it has nowhere to go it just flows through the concrete streets of the Cities

513
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:51,232
So it can really exacerbate

514
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,512
Flooding I really

515
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:53,536
Serious way

516
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:56,864
Do we need to build with as much concrete as we do

517
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,656
No

518
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:00,448
Kitchen hutch Shelf

519
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:06,848
I mean listen we need concrete right this is not ring it's not analogous to oil

520
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:09,920
Right which is something that we can actually replace

521
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:12,736
What's something cleaner and more sustainable

522
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:14,784
What's solar and wind

523
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,832
Concrete is a great building at

524
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,368
It is created

525
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,928
Safe durable housing for

526
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:23,744
Billions of people the world over who didn't have it

527
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:24,768
20-30 years

528
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,304
That's pretty good

529
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:28,352
We need concrete we got to keep using it

530
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,400
But yeah we could use a lot less

531
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:31,936
How can we do that

532
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,472
Well

533
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,752
First of all by

534
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:37,568
Figuring out ways to restructure how we live

535
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,664
And said we don't need quite as much infrastructure cars being the most obvious

536
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:44,480
Also just by making things

537
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,784
Smaller I mean I just got back

538
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:50,112
I was just getting some talks about about my book

539
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,392
In the Netherlands

540
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,928
And

541
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:56,768
The size of the hotel rooms that I stayed in woodshock

542
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,120
Any hotels being American I mean they are

543
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,144
Tiny

544
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:04,192
There's room for a bed

545
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,216
A single bed

546
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,496
And a little desk

547
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:07,776
And a window

548
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,312
And a little sink

549
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:10,592
And that's it

550
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,920
Hi there I mean you can literally fit

551
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:17,504
Two or three of these rooms in the average Motel 6

552
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:21,600
You know it's kind of shocking when you first walk in or in that size but really like

553
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:24,672
Who cares I was in most of these towns for one night

554
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,720
I'd go in the ghetto

555
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:30,304
Do a little work on my computer go to sleep get up pack up and leave

556
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,840
I don't need more than

557
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:34,144
That's all I didn't need more than that amount of space

558
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:38,496
All the millions of hotel and motel rooms

559
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:41,056
In this country we could easily cut

560
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:43,104
Many of them in half

561
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:45,408
You know or

562
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:49,248
Houses I mean you know Americans famously we build

563
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:51,808
Cheyenne houses we love to have

564
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,600
Big huge sprawling

565
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:56,672
Tract houses in the size of the average American

566
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:57,440
Open Home by the way

567
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,232
Has nearly doubled

568
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:00,512
Justin the last

569
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:02,816
We don't need that much

570
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,352
You don't need

571
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,448
We can ease you know

572
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,216
Really

573
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:10,752
We can easily

574
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,032
Cut down

575
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,568
You know create a system of

576
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,872
Extra taxes or tax

577
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:17,152
Sentence for whatever

578
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:19,200
To encourage people to live

579
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,224
Smaller

580
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:20,992
And I

581
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:23,040
Cement we would be no less app

582
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:27,136
Are there other materials we could be using

583
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,184
Yes and that's the other thing

584
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:32,000
There is a lot of research going on around the world

585
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:35,584
To come up with other materials that we could use in concrete rather than

586
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,608
Since and so

587
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:38,912
There are people who are looking at using

588
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,448
Bamboo

589
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,496
Or shredded plastic

590
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:47,616
Or recycled tires shredded tires or hemp actually there's a thing

591
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:49,408
There's a product called hempcrete which

592
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,688
Actually buy right now

593
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,480
And all those things I think

594
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:55,296
Help I think they're all to the good I think they should all be

595
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,320
Encourage

596
00:24:57,088 --> 00:25:00,928
But at the end of the day there's only so far we can go with with alternative

597
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:02,976
Materials because the like I said we use

598
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,768
50 billion tons

599
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:06,560
Sub sand and gravel every year

600
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,352
And even if we could replace

601
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:10,144
All that sand with you know

602
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,424
Bamboo

603
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:15,520
Where we going to come up with 50 billion tons of bamboo every year

604
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:17,824
Right that would create its own set of problems

605
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:20,384
Raid spray

606
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,176
I mean I think

607
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,736
The real way to think about

608
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,272
The sand

609
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:27,040
Crisis

610
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:30,368
Is too kind of referring to question the question isn't really

611
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,648
What's going to happen

612
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:33,952
When we run out of sand

613
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:34,976
And the question is

614
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,768
What's going to happen

615
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:38,048
When we run out of

616
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:38,816
Everything

617
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:41,376
We shouldn't just be thinking about like how can we

618
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:43,680
Solve the problem of sad because really

619
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:46,240
It sounds familiar right we know

620
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:48,032
That were using too much

621
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:48,800
Freshwater

622
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:51,360
We know that we're cutting down too many trees

623
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,920
We know we're harvesting too many fish out of the ocean

624
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:55,968
We know we're burning too much fossil fuel

625
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,528
Now come to find out where using too much sand

626
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:01,088
Welcome to My Mind these are not

627
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:01,856
Separate

628
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:03,136
Problems they're all

629
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,928
Symptoms of the same problem

630
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,232
Which is just that we're consuming

631
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,000
Too much

632
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:09,536
Write the way that we live

633
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:12,864
Here in the western world and that lifestyle that we have now

634
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,656
Exported to the rest of the world

635
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,192
It just consumed

636
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:18,240
Way too many natural resources

637
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,264
And the planets

638
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,288
Simplicam

639
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,312
Sustain it

640
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,592
Now

641
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:24,896
Where can I buy think we're going to hit that wall

642
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:26,432
With water

643
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:28,480
Sooner the word ahead with sand

644
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,016
But ultimately

645
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:32,064
It's the same problem which is just that

646
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,392
The way that we live our lives just isn't sustainable

647
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:37,440
We have got to find ways

648
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:41,280
To build our cities which is where most human beings now live

649
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:43,072
In ways that use

650
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:43,840
You are resource

651
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:47,424
That's the only way we're going to avoid total collapse

652
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:54,848
Vince Wiser's book is called the world in a grain

653
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:59,456
There's so much more to the story of Saint that we didn't even touch on here including

654
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:01,760
How glass change civilization

655
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:02,784
That's a big deal

656
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,320
So if you like this discussion

657
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,344
Joel of the book

658
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:13,024
There's a lot of sand locked up in all the concrete in the built world

659
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:15,328
But it's also a lot of embodied carbon

660
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,096
In concrete

661
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,888
How to quantify that

662
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,424
And concrete alternatives

663
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,192
After that

664
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:29,664
Concrete is the building Industries favorite material

665
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,200
But it's a problematic

666
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:31,968
Big save

667
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:34,784
And not only because of the global sand crisis

668
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,832
Has Vince beiser noted

669
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,904
Concrete is also extremely carbon-intensive

670
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,952
The production of cement

671
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:43,744
Which of the key ingredient in concrete

672
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,584
Is responsible for about 8% of the world CO2 emissions

673
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:53,984
In this section of program talking about the climate change impacts of the buildings we create

674
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,288
What is air made of concrete or wood or

675
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:59,104
Some novel material you've never even heard of

676
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:01,664
Did you do that I called Advocate synonym

677
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:07,808
I'm done and I'm an architect and structural engineer and faculty member at University of Washington

678
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:11,392
And my research has focused on the environmental impact of building the

679
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:17,280
When we think about the environmental impact of buildings most people really do think about the environmental impact of operating them

680
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:23,936
The energy cost of operating a building is stuff you probably know of energy that it takes the heat the building and cool the building and key

681
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:24,704
Keep the lights on

682
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:30,080
The Kate says that when we think about buildings and climate change that is not the full picture

683
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:34,176
There are also the emissions associated with the materials themselves

684
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:39,296
Emissions that were required to make all that concrete and steel and glass

685
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:45,952
The factories the steel mills the trucks that drive around all of those create emissions and those emissions are termed the embodied in

686
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:48,768
Emissions that are sort of embodied

687
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,352
In the materials although they're really the emissions that happened when making the

688
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:59,520
These emissions are known as embodied carbon the carbon emissions that were needed to create the built environment all

689
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,288
Around us

690
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:04,128
Kate heads up a carbon leadership Forum at the University of Washington

691
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,200
Is a group of Builders and designers and academics

692
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:09,504
Working to reduce embodied carbon

693
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:14,112
And she says that new materials and Greener manufacturing are important for the future

694
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:17,184
But the first thing we can do to reduce embodied carbon

695
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:17,952
It's just a

696
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:20,768
Keep using the buildings we've already built

697
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,560
If we can keep what we have

698
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:25,376
That's the first step to producing a body car

699
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:26,656
Wenzhou renovating buildings

700
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:27,424
Maintaining them

701
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:28,704
Isky

702
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,008
We've invested a lot in that concrete and

703
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:31,776
So

704
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,312
Let's make our choices

705
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:34,336
Is correctly when we

706
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:36,896
Choose to make new things and maintaining

707
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:45,344
But even so we know there's going to be a building boom in the coming decades we need to housing new green energy in purse

708
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:50,720
Construction new transportation and aldose structures are being made using traditional steel in concrete

709
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:53,280
Is going to be a problem for the climate

710
00:29:54,048 --> 00:30:00,192
But Kate says there's a lot of potential low-carbon building materials out there these days including alternative conquer

711
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:04,544
And low carbon steel

712
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,824
Growing rocks

713
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:09,664
By capturing carbon from the atmosphere or at smokestacks

714
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,456
And turning it back into limestone

715
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:14,272
So that if we talk about carbon capture

716
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:15,808
Storage

717
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,368
Think about carbon capture and using

718
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,904
That carbon to build

719
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,952
Buildings with so we could take those rocks

720
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,232
Two buildings

721
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:27,328
That kind of carbon capture technology is a long way from becoming a reality

722
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:33,984
But when the most promising Green Building Materials that people are using right now is actually one of the oldest building materials on

723
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:34,752
On Earth

724
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:35,520
What

725
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:38,848
A wooden building stores carbon within it and so

726
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:42,944
If you can build with more wood instead of concrete you have the potential

727
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,016
To dramatically reduce the embodied carbon emissions

728
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:49,600
You could potentially even have a building that is a net carbon negative

729
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,648
And with that goal in mind

730
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:57,024
Architects and Engineers are developing large manufactured wood products that they call

731
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,304
Mass Timber

732
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,376
So Mass Timber is a term that defines

733
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:03,680
What buildings that are made out of large

734
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:05,728
Pieces of wood so massive

735
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:06,752
This is what

736
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:11,104
You make Master Timber products by layering sheets of wood on top of one another

737
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,384
And then compressing

738
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,432
Create extremely strong

739
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:18,784
Prefabricated wood panels that can be assembled into all kinds of structures

740
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:23,904
Architecture beginning to experiment with using mass Timber to build anything from skyscrapers to Bridges

741
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:27,232
And the advantage of mass Timber is that

742
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:30,304
The thick pieces of wood have an inherent fire resist

743
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:31,328
Characteristics

744
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:34,144
So it majan if you're trying to build a

745
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,680
Campfire

746
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:39,264
And you make it a little too small sticks they all burn up and you get a pile of Ash

747
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:41,056
But if you start with really big D

748
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:41,824
Pieces of wood

749
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,920
And then you fall asleep and Let the Fire Burn itself out you come back and you still have a log

750
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:46,688
In your fireplace

751
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:51,808
Buildings with a heavy Timber building at start of

752
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:52,832
Almost put

753
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:53,600
Itself out

754
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,904
I mean how

755
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,928
Skyscraper

756
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:57,952
Behaves

757
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,744
In fire is one thing

758
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,024
But it feels

759
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:04,352
I'm strange to think about skyscrapers made of wood at all

760
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:06,656
Not like in a modern age

761
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:08,448
Why is anything weird

762
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:15,104
Because we haven't heard of them if you went back a hundred fifty years nobody would have heard of a steel building

763
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:20,224
Wright cast iron so they were cast iron buildings in cast iron melted in

764
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,504
People were very concerned about it

765
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:22,784
So if you

766
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:24,320
If you look back

767
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,088
In time

768
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:27,904
There's been a massive Innovations about what we do

769
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:33,024
And if you look back in time there's been massively large tall wood buildings that have built-in last

770
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,048
To the long period of time

771
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,328
Sophie

772
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,864
We learn a trade

773
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,888
In a

774
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:39,680
That is handed down to us

775
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:43,520
I'm from other people so a lot of what we learn we've been told of work

776
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:45,312
So we have confidence two things

777
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:46,592
Because they've been done before

778
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:47,616
So

779
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:49,664
I don't think it's unreasonable to be

780
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,968
A little conservative

781
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:54,016
I mean we wouldn't want to build a high-rise building

782
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:55,808
And kills lots of

783
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:58,112
The people nor would we want to build a building that

784
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:01,184
Wasn't able to maintain over a long period of

785
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:06,048
My driver is climate change

786
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:07,584
My driver is

787
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:10,144
In order to

788
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,936
Have the building sector be part of

789
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:13,984
The climate solution we're going to have to take some

790
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:15,520
End

791
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:19,872
The risks will be trying novel materials new methods

792
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:20,896
Of using those

793
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:21,664
Materials

794
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:25,248
How to drive to a market where we have carbon-negative building

795
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:30,368
Cities full of carbon negative wooden skyscrapers is definitely

796
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:34,720
Attractive vision and Kate says that wooden buildings have the potential to be carbon negative

797
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:37,024
But it's not that straightforward

798
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:42,144
You to really analyze every aspect of the supply chain before you can make such a declaration

799
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,984
One of the most important things to consider is where that would is coming from

800
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:47,264
Because the forest

801
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:49,824
SBR NFA

802
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,616
To take wood out of the Forester change

803
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:52,896
Forest carbon balance

804
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:55,968
Turn order for would be a great building material for the climate

805
00:33:56,224 --> 00:34:02,368
You have to make sure that it's being harvested sustainably

806
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,648
Incentivize wasting

807
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:04,416
Wood

808
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:06,720
And chopping down forests and not replanting

809
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:11,328
Kate simonin says that mass Timber isn't a perfect building material

810
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:13,632
There is no perfect building material

811
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:17,216
But building stuff always involve difficult choices and trade-offs

812
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:22,336
Skates goal to make sure that Architects and Builders are considering embodied carbon

813
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:25,920
When they make their decisions about what to build and how to build it

814
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:27,968
Because we're all going to be living

815
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:28,992
With the consequences

816
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:31,040
Body carbon is upfront

817
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:31,808
These are the emission

818
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:32,832
Is it happened when we build things

819
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:33,600
Now

820
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:35,648
We're going to be building a new New York every month

821
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:36,928
Until 2050

822
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,208
Across the world

823
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:39,488
Those emissions

824
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,792
Huge and if we don't figure out how to address them

825
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:42,560
We're not going to meet

826
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:43,328
Climate Target

827
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,888
The more and more people are recognizing that looking

828
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:46,656
Four strategies

829
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:47,424
To figure out how to

830
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,704
Reduce and drive the market

831
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:49,728

About what materials to use in construction

839
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:28,128
Depending on how it was made

840
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:34,016
1 steel beam may have much lower and body carbon than another one that looks and performs the same
