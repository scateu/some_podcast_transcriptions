17
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:01,184
Sarah Berger up in Hawaii

18
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,720
Just outside of Honolulu

19
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:03,488
When I was in

20
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:06,048
High School I visited New York for the first time

21
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,584
And noticed that a lot of

22
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,608
Vintage shops had all these

23
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,400
Tacky Hawaiian

24
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:11,168
Shirts

25
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,192
And that it was Fisk

26
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:13,984
Skinny jeans

27
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:18,848
This is a good thing right yeah that was totally a thing and it's still kind of a thing now

28
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,688
These days high end designers are making versions of Hawaiian shirts

29
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,760
Hawaiian shirts are in style

30
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,296
Most hilarious

31
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:28,576
Trapped

32
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:29,600
Why it just

33
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:30,624
So

34
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:32,928
Like where L L Hawaiian

35
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:38,304
Well first of all they wouldn't call them Hawaiian shirts

36
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,840
No one would say Hawaiian

37
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:42,656
In Hawaii that just sounds

38
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,496
In Hawaii there Aloha shirt

39
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,544
Are slightly different

40
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,592
The Aloha shirt is a very common thing

41
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:52,128
To where and why everyone has

42
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:54,944
It doesn't look

43
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,736
The same as a Hawaiian shirt

44
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,808
I don't know about you but I think of Hawaiian shirts as having like

45
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,624
Tiki heads in bikini ladies on them

46
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,648
Aloha shirts

47
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,440
A little more professional

48
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:06,976
Aloha shirts I like

49
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,512
Down you know like

50
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:09,280
Like really taste

51
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,304
Floral print

52
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,096
If you're going out to

53
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,424
You would wear a antelope

54
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:16,704
Really

55
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,472
Yeah

56
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,240
It's a very calm

57
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,312
But it's definitely

58
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,336
Still

59
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,360
A product of

60
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,920
You know what I mean like it's not like

61
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,224
Back in the day

62
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,504
Native

63
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,296
Aloha

64
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:42,816
Articles of Interest a show about what we wear and so maybe their ideas about clothing

65
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:49,216
Ideas about to a piece of cloth

66
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,896
But if you ain't got the attitude install the car at all

67
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,432
Manuel District closed

68
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,272
Markers

69
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:09,184
Which are the jigsaw pieces of the shirt that is the sound of an Aloha shirt maker wielding a giant and

70
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,208
Industrial blade

71
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:13,024
And he is cutting through about 50 layers of

72
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,560
Brightly patterned fabric

73
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,096
Stacked in a pile

74
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:22,496
Cutting all of the puzzle pieces out together like a perfectly plan

75
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,776
Jigsaw puzzle

76
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:24,544
And so this

77
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,640
Stack of 50 fabric squares will create 50 Aloha shirt

78
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,456
Is the back of the shirt

79
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,480
Placket

80
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,040
That's the front panels

81
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:38,112
Sa Yo there's a collars in the pocket over there

82
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:42,208
Jason Morgan but general manager of Kahala sportswear

83
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:46,048
Show me around kahala's Factory & Design Studio on Oahu

84
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,096
Kahala mix Aloha shirt

85
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:53,216
It's actually one of the earliest companies to do so it's been around since 1936

86
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:57,568
And is Jason and I watch this worker definitely cut out the puzzle pieces in the stacks

87
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:03,712
You can see that all the different parts are strategically placed along the pattern of the fabric

88
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:08,576
So json informs me with pride so we always match

89
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,624
And so that

90
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:14,208
Is why that pocket is specifically placed right there

91
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,256
When json does match the pocket

92
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,815
He means at the breast pocket of the shirt

93
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,095
Doesn't disrupt

94
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,375
The overall pattern

95
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:24,959
Like the breast pocket will be a continuation of the design

96
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:28,031
So that it Blends in it for Splash you don't even notice it

97
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,823
Looks like it's a lot of extra effort

98
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:34,431
It's a lot of extra effort it signifies a higher quality garment just more attention to detail

99
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:40,831
There are a few ways to tell if you're looking at a real authentic

100
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,879
High quality Aloha shirt

101
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:47,999
If the pocket matches the pattern that's a good sign but it's not the be-all end-all

102
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:51,839
Much of the understanding of an Aloha shirt is about

103
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:54,655
Paying attention to what is on the shirt itself

104
00:04:54,911 --> 00:05:01,055
If it tells a story and it has real references that are specific to Hawaii

105
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:07,455
We know what fish that is and that it you can find it out here in the waters around

106
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:13,855
You know we're not going to slap something on a shirt just to do it cuz it looks cool

107
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:20,255
Visionland it's about a real place all the animals all the fruit all the landmarks

108
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:26,655
We'll all be real and significant to Hawaii or to the many cultures that have melted into it

109
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:33,055
How would you describe this classic

110
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:39,455
Simple one color ground one color print

111
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:45,855
Since the sixties it's white flowers on a solid color background this part

112
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:52,255
Saturn features breadfruit flowers because breadfruit was a primary staple a lot of Polynesian cultures

113
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:58,655
What they call the new plants which were the plants at the Polynesians took with them as they explored Polynesia

114
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:05,055
Has explored Polynesian Sailors discovered Hawaii and migrated there in significant numbers these kind

115
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:11,455
Find the specific cultural references or rather specific Multicultural references

116
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:14,015
Makes the difference between aloha

117
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:20,415
And Resort where is more informed by

118
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:26,815
What makes Hawaii unique it's something that you'll Bankers wear in downtown Honolulu

119
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:33,215
Bankers are in aloha shirts in downtown Honolulu everybody is leaving wear them for funeral

120
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:40,383
And part of the logic of Aloha tire is of course that's it's too hot in Hawaii to wear a suit

121
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:46,783
That does explain why the shirts are so colorful and patterned and fun they could have just as well worn plain white shirt

122
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,647
Hypothetically truly understand the origins of the shirt

123
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:54,719
One must understand the origins of the state

124
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:59,071
I don't have a copy hotfoot

125
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,863
Got to pronounce it correctly

126
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:06,239
Aloha kakahiaka that's good morning in Hawaiian this is data capture

127
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,543
The historian of Iolani Palace

128
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:12,895
Iolani Palace is the last official residence of the monarchs

129
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:16,479
Who wrote Hawaii is it combines Kingdom for 100 years

130
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:20,575
And its predecessors will here for over a thousand years prior to that

131
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:24,671
You only Palace is the only actual Bonafide Palace

132
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,719
On United States soil

133
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:29,791
Turn on Ballroom reception room

134
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,095
Formal receptions here

135
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:36,191
Receptions in the Blue Room would have included food Beverages and entertainment

136
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,727
You want a palace is

137
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:38,751
Truly elegant

138
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:42,847
With Sumptuous wooden staircases and crystal glassware

139
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:45,663
And what was then cutting-edge technology

140
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:49,503
They had electricity in 1887

141
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,271
4 years

142
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,319
For the White House in Washington DC

143
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:58,975
The king also installed a telephone oh yeah by 1889 home little probably had more phones for free

144
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:02,815
Person than any other city of it same size anywhere else in the world

145
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,607
This is all just to say

146
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:07,935
Hawaii as an independent constitutional monarchy

147
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:10,239
Transcended it's tiny geography

148
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:15,871
The kingdom was technologically advanced and known diplomatically all over the world

149
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,151
Queen liliuokalani

150
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:19,967
Our last Monarch is in the portrait on the wall over here

151
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:24,063
In this portrait she is wearing the Gown that was

152
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,647
Created to be worn at Queen Victoria's golden jubilee in London

153
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:31,487
Liliuokalani became queen of hawaii in 1891

154
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:36,095
And choose a musician as well he was a musician she composed over a hundred fifty different songs

155
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,631
Including Aloha toy

156
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,471
It's a really famous song

157
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,775
The highway is actually a love song

158
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:46,591
Aloha means goodbye to you

159
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,127
It was written

160
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,663
In 1878

161
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,687
She saw

162
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,991
A woman and a man saying goodbye to each other

163
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:56,575
And it was such a touching scene as she was coming home

164
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:59,135
She's humming and writing in her head

165
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:02,719
She had a wonderful ability to write songs

166
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:09,631
So we're talking about Billy okalani because she's a major character in the story of how Hawaii became a territory

167
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,167
And then part of the United States

168
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:14,495
Which led to the rise of the Aloha

169
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,055
And in many ways

170
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,847
This all starts

171
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:19,871
With sugar

172
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:22,943
Sugar became a minor industry until the Civil War

173
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,479
When is sugar planters

174
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,015
In the United States

175
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,039
Could no longer grow back

176
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,575
Because they were fighting the war

177
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,879
To the sugar industry Skywalker

178
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,927
An influence and in

179
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:33,695
Income

180
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:36,511
Most of the sugar plantations were owned by

181
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,047
Americans and Europeans

182
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:41,375
Many of the Hawaiians may not have had the money

183
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,167
To be able to buy the property

184
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,447
Some of the immigrants

185
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,263
Fortunately does it have family that had money

186
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:53,663
European and American sugar magnets who had been setting up plantations all over the Hawaiian Islands work their way in

187
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,455
Into the legislature of Hawaii

188
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,527
Give themselves better deals on the shipping and tariffs

189
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:01,087
They impose a constitution

190
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:03,903
That dramatically reduce the power of the monarchy

191
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,439
Any more of a figurehead

192
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:09,279
The Constitution also allowed non-hawaiians citizens to vote

193
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,839
Allowed non-citizen residence

194
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:15,679
Are American and European ancestry basically it was those

195
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:20,287
Who could read or write English or some other European language

196
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,055
2 Bolt

197
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:23,103
So disenfranchised were native Hawaiians

198
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,919
Left out the huge Chinese community

199
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,967
Sugaring European so why can't we

200
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:33,855
This allowed American and European business interests him Medellin Hawaiian government even more

201
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,391
Estelle

202
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,695
With what little power she had

203
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:42,047
Wheely okalani tried to get that imposed Constitution repealed

204
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,863
Pretends to put into effect a new constitution

205
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:49,215
Cuz your group of 13 local residents of American and European ancestry

206
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,031
To create the Committee of Public Safety

207
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,311
To protect their own in

208
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,127
That's a group that opposed Lido kehlani

209
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,663
The long and short of it

210
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:02,783
Is that well-connected businessmen used the US military as backing for a coup

211
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:08,159
In 1893 the monarchy was overthrown and a provisional government was established

212
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,207
McQueen was accused

213
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:12,511
Treason in America video kehlani

214
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,815
They brought her here to this room

215
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:20,191
This is called the imprisonment room this is where she was held under house arrest

216
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,983
Very sparsely furnished

217
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:24,287
And initially no writing material

218
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,335
For eight months

219
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:30,943
Emilio Kalani was Prisoner in this front room of Iolani Palace

220
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,223
Edison lights

221
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,503
Screams in hot

222
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,551
For lack of writing materials

223
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:38,367
Video kehlani and her one permitted companion

224
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,391
Sewed

225
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,927
She made a quilt

226
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:44,767
From brocaded silk fabrics and ribbons from her own wardrobe

227
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,607
And she stitch them with the names of her friends and supporters

228
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,911
Embroidered are the words

229
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,215
Imprisoned at Iolani Palace

230
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,519
And that's as we began this quilt

231
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,287
There

232
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,847
Which means they completed it elsewhere

233
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:03,967
The quilt was probably completed after liliuokalani moved to her private residence down the

234
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,015
Street where she continued her life as a

235
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,039
The private citizen

236
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:11,647
Until she died in 1917 she was considered until her death

237
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,183
As Queen of

238
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:13,951
Hawaii

239
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,999
And respected as such

240
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,535
And the queen quilt

241
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,327
Would not be the last time

242
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,887
Story of Hawaii would be told and cloth

243
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:26,751
From overthrow to statehood Hawaii was in sort of limbo as a territory

244
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,543
The sugar industry had changed

245
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,311
Everything

246
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:32,127
From the Constitution to the configuration of the government

247
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:36,479
Actual makeup of the population of the Hawaiian Islands

248
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:40,063
The Hawaiian Islands from the late 1800s

249
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,599
What's a 1924

250
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:47,231
Were the scene of many different immigrants coming into work in the sugar industry

251
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:51,839
The sugar plantation owners were mostly white Americans and European

252
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:58,239
Recruited field workers from China Korea the Philippines and Portugal

253
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:02,847
Japan this is just sort of brown the historian at the Bishop Museum in Honolulu

254
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:03,615
And

255
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:06,175
The federal government of the United States ended

256
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,967
Asian immigration in 90

257
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,759
24 but by that time

258
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:12,575
The population of Hawaii was about

259
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:18,463
40% ethnically Japanese

260
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,767
Excluding Japanese

261
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:21,535
Fabric

262
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,327
The Japanese fabric

263
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,095
Was

264
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,119
A witch

265
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,935
Which was made specifically for kimonos

266
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,471
Just the Japanese Nash

267
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:30,495
Costume

268
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,543
And there was one particular company

269
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,335
In downtown Honolulu that

270
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:38,431
Call Worcestershire Worcestershire sauce Japanese fabric

271
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:42,783
And you can go in and choose the fabric you like and they would make a shirt for you

272
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:47,135
You could buy a western-style collared shirt

273
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,927
Made out of kimono fabric

274
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:52,767
Became a fun special thing to buy especially for the Youth

275
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:58,911
Buy about 1936-37 local manufacturers then begin to

276
00:13:59,167 --> 00:13:59,679
Have

277
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:00,703
Fabric

278
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,983
Custom made

279
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:05,311
With tropical or Pacific or Hawaiian motif

280
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,103
In addition to the Japanese mochi

281
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,383
Which were already available

282
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,431
Kahala

283
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:12,735
The company you heard cutting the pile of shirts

284
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,783
Established in 1936

285
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,855
And it was one of the first to mass produce aloha

286
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:21,695
Because these shirts sold like hotcakes as souvenirs

287
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:24,767
Americans first started coming to Hawaii on map

288
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,303
A soldier's

289
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,583
And as Taurus

290
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:31,167
It was always intended to be like souvenir shirt

291
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,703
DIYs

292
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,983
Where is the desire to have

293
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:37,311
Something as a reminder a token the souvenir of

294
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,335
Of the experience

295
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,615
And then one day

296
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:42,943
Went back home after World War II and all that

297
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,783
But aloha shirts were still nice

298
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,855
People didn't wear them around in a real way

299
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,159
Even on the territory of Hawaii

300
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,695
Look like the Westin one

301
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:57,279
Everyone was dressed like they lived in an American Metropolis

302
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,559
Prior to

303
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,375
2 it wouldn't be unusual

304
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,167
Everybody in downtown

305
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,703
Suit tie

306
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,263
90 degrees outside

307
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,799
Humidity and everyone's walking

308
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,615
Is ridiculous this is Josh Feldman

309
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,639
CEO of

310
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,407
Tori Richard

311
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:17,247
Which is a Resort Wear company and the parent company of Kahala

312
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,527
The Aloha wear manufacturer

313
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,831
Josh's father

314
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,855
Mort Feldman

315
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,135
Was the founder of the

316
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,439
And even he

317
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:27,743
The founder of a Resort Wear company

318
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:28,767
Used to wear

319
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,047
Suit and tie to work

320
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:30,815
Everyday

321
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,351
My father and I

322
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:34,655
He's wearing

323
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,935
Coppola Mad Men suiting

324
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:37,983
Dapper looking guy

325
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,263
But

326
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,031
It's kind of farcical

327
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,055
Write that

328
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:43,871
On a tropical island

329
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:50,527
Josh's father joined forces with some other Aloha a tire manufacturers

330
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,063
And they formed a lobbying group

331
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,623
Called the Hawaiian fashion Guild

332
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,927
In 1962

333
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,463
They began a campaign

334
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,231
Called

335
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,535
Operation liberation

336
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,583
It's all started with operation liberation

337
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,863
Which was to get mint

338
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,399
Where are the hotter in the summer months

339
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:10,751
In operation Liberation the Hawaiian fashion Guild gave each

340
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,799
State representative and senator

341
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,079
To Aloha shirt

342
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,127
And then

343
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,663
They took it a step further

344
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,711
They decided let's Lobby

345
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,735
And get this

346
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:21,503

358
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,887
Where this product

359
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:41,215
That meant every Friday members of the State Legislature

Wore Aloha shirt

361
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,543
And then that spread to the business

362
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:45,823
The way to

363
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,103

And wearing a suit

And that went on for a number of years in pretty much every day B

369
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:55,295
Became a lot

370
00:16:56,063 --> 00:17:00,415
On any given day of the week in downtown Honolulu you can see people in Aloha shirt

371
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:03,743
Not the Jimmy Buffett vacation kind of way

372
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:06,303
A workplace casual kind of way

373
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,351
And to this day

374
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,655
This especially ramps up on Friday

375
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:16,287
And if you live in the mainland United States this notion of a casual Friday

376
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:18,335
Might sound Vaguely Familiar to you

377
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:19,615
Casual Friday

378
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,943
And casual

379
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:26,527
Would go on to affect how we all dress at work

380
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:29,599
Not just in Hawaii all over the United States

381
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:30,879
The Casual Friday cam

382
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,183
Evelyn credits Dockers

383
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,231
Dockers in a company that makes khaki

384
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:38,815
And they are owned by Levi Strauss jeans

385
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:39,839
Babe

386
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:40,863
Fully acknowledged

387
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,167
They do

388
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,703
We're here on the West Coast

389
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:51,359
Aloha and the prince once aloha shirts at the scene Levi's started manufacturing them

390
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:54,431
Aloha shirt since the thirties I hear at Levi Strauss

391
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,223
Company this is Tracy Penick

392
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:58,271
Historian at Levi Strauss & Company

393
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,063
But you needed a companion

394
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:03,647
Peace and we introduced in the early in the 90s

395
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:09,279
We introduced the idea that human resources department said that you could let your workers come to work

396
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,815
Rest one day a week

397
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,607
In something a little bit more

398
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,887
Casual.

399
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,935
Curse Princeton's in with Dockers

400
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:18,239
Levi's really created the concept

401
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,519
The business casual wear

402
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:25,663
Which they then sold to businesses we took the idea to Human Resources departments in fact

403
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,687
We created a kit

404
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:30,015
How to put casual business wear to work

405
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:33,343
And we sent thousands around 2 HR department

406
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:36,159
And in it and included a guide to what was

407
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:39,487
Appropriate wear and in this guy that we're looking at here is

408
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:44,863
A man dressed in his Dockers slacks and a collared shirt and other

409
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:48,447
Clothing that he could wear Aloha Friday came from Hawaii

410
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,471
Casual Friday

411
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:51,519
Came from Levi Strauss & Company

412
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:54,847
We are credited Levi Strauss & Company for creating

413
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,639
Business casual Fridays

414
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:58,943
This business casual movement in now

415
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,479
It's not just one day a week

416
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:02,527
A business casual for many

417
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:06,111
Workplace environments is okay all through the week

418
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,695
This might be one of the largest seismic ship

419
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,487
In recent fashion history

420
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,535
Turn to casual

421
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:21,471
Goodbye silk ties and garters and stockings

422
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,263
And knowing how to use an iron

423
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,311
Hello

424
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:27,103
Two CEOs in sweatshirt

425
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:32,735
And it's not that Casual Friday invented casual wear that is a much

426
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,015
Target phenomenon

427
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:36,575
It has its roots in the rise of Leisure Time

428
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:42,207
And the rise of sportswear and the influx of college students dressing more practically to Trippers campuses

429
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:44,767
What Casual Friday gave us

430
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,559
With a foot in the door

431
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:48,351
Casual wear

432
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,655
Spread into public life

433
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,935
Where does casual break

434
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:52,703
It hurts up

435
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,007
When does it start to B12 churches

436
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:57,055
Regional specific

437
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:03,455
This is Deirdre Clemente historian of 20th century clothing and fashion and author of the book dress casual

438
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:06,015
And she says business casual was the Tipping Point

439
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,039
Because

440
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:11,391
The office was kind of The Last Vestige of everyday Formal Wear

441
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,671
The office

442
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:17,791
What's the last place to break which I think because it's such a public

443
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:23,935
Runt the places where people had more interaction with clients like maybe Banksy or somebody

444
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:28,031
Sales rep who had to go into attic

445
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,383
And yet many bankers and politicians still wear suits

446
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:39,039
But for Life Industries now where workers sit in front of a computer they don't need to change into heels or iron a jacket

447
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,575
I think casual dress

448
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:42,367
Speaks to America

449
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,135
Desire to be

450
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:45,951
Comfortable it speaks to our desire

451
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:48,511
To create in many ways

452
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,559
Classless society

453
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:56,959
Or at least the appearance of a classless society

454
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:02,079
America as a nation where everybody considers themselves middle-class matter who you ask

455
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,639
70% of Americans

456
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,919
Poor or wealthy

457
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,967
Call themselves middle class

458
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:12,575
Casual dress really speaks to everyone sooner wanting to dress more towards

459
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:14,623
Socio-economic middle

460
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:17,952
Send the edges it's almost uncool

461
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:19,232
To dress up

462
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,256
Watch now

463
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,280
Dressing up with

464
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:23,072
Call too much attention to yourself

465
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,608
And that way

466
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,192
The Aloha shirt is a beautiful aberration

467
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:28,960
When I think

468
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:32,544
Aloha shirts I think of my dad because my dad wears almost

469
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,080
Solely aloha

470
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,360
She has probably

471
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:36,896
Aloha shirts

472
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:37,664
Because he wears one

473
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:41,504
Obsessed with buying different ones

474
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:45,088
Where he'll get really into the pattern I really like this

475
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,880
Textile or whatever

476
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,928
Aloha shirt is bright

477
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,208
Aloha shirts

478
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:53,280

479

Bongs and chatter of our devices

00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:01,280
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man made sound

513
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,304
