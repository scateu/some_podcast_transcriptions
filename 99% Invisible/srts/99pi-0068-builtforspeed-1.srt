Family ghosts is a podcast explores all the unexpected ways our family structure and shape our view

9
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:31,488
Of the world

10
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:37,120
Each episode of Family ghosts takes a look at the story behind a different person's family lore

Digging into unanswered questions about their history

12
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:45,824

18
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:04,768
Every house is haunted

19
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,328
This is 99% invisible

20
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,352
I'm Roman Mars

21
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:15,520
I want you to conjure an image in your mind of the White Stripes

22
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:21,920
Not those white stripes but the White Stripes that divide the lanes of traffic going in the same direction on a major

23
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:27,552
How long are the stripes you can spread your arms out if you want to

24
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:34,208
Over the course of many years of psychology researcher named Dennis Shaffer at Ohio State

25
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,024
Costumes from many different parts the country

26
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,048
This question

27
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:40,096
And the most common response was

28
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:40,864
Two feet

29
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:44,704
So do you like most people you estimated that those white stripes are 2 ft long

30
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,984
Maybe a little more

31
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,264
But if you did

32
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,824
You be very very wrong

33
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,360
This is Tom and Jerry

34
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:53,920
When was Tom Vanderbilt summer writer in New York

35
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:57,504
And author of traffic why we drive the way we do

36
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,296
And what it says about us

37
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:05,184
Every three pages of Tom's terrific book traffic I can probably turn into a 99percentinvisible episode

38
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,464
But back to the highway

39
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:13,120
What early on in my research I was talking to a highway engineering if your car is ever broken down on the side

40
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:16,960
Are the road if ever been to force to get out of your vehicle

41
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:23,360
On a highway just take a moment to notice what a strange landscape it is you're having a stent in your

42
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,384
Road sign

43
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,688
Is there a huge they're not meant to be

44
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,296
Experience as humans on foot they're meant to be experienced at 75

45
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:36,160
Miles an hour with the Clearview typeface perfectly visible retro-reflective

46
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,696
And then there are the whites tree

47
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,000
You actually kind of got out of your car

48
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:42,048
And were able to walk on a closed Highway

49
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,096
Walk from one end of those

50
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:47,168
Stripes to the other you can find that

51
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:49,216
And I mean years ago United States

52
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:52,288
Highway standard was 15 feet long

53
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,824
Which is longer than

54
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,848
Cartel

55
00:02:55,104 --> 00:03:00,480
Current Federal Highway Administration guidelines suggest a length of 10 feet with 30 ft between the dash

56
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,784
That's something that that is shocking to people

57
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,624
And remember most people in the Schaefer study said that those stripes

58
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,184
Or two feet long that's such a vast

59
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,464
Golf there between

60
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:13,792
You know that there are

61
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:14,816
If I see without them

62
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,864
Margin of error going to sing

63
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:24,288
And it goes back to this fundamental point that when you're in a car at high speeds you're experiencing only a sin

64
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,312
Of the landscape

65
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:27,360
Rather than the actual answer

66
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:30,176
This kind of sense the landscape has been presented to you

67
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:37,088
To make you feel comfortable and to make a highway work at what are wheelie evolutionarily

68
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:40,160
Ridiculous speeds for a human to travel

69
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,184
You have this big

70
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,256
Flat wide open no kind of stretch of road that

71
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,584
You even if you have a 65 mile-an-hour sign

72
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:51,680
The message of the road is telling you something entirely different and I think

73
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:55,520
Especially where a lot of our Behavior comes from

74
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,312
Speeding willful

75
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:59,360
La breaking but a lot of it is just

76
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:03,456
People are paying attention to the visual messaging the road not to their speedometer

77
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:07,040
Long dividing lines in clearvista

78
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,832
Give the illusion

79
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:11,136
That you're going at a reasonable speed

80
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:13,440
As soon as something encroaches into view

81
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:15,488
You get a sense of how fast you're going

82
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,024
That's one reason why those

83
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,839
Temporary concrete walls that Cruz put up

84
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:22,143
Right next to the road during construction

85
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,935
Are so unnerving

86
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:27,007
The air in perception of white stripe length

87
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,311
Is attributed to the fact that when we drive

88
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,591
We tend to look

89
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,871
So far ahead

90
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,943
That we usually only experience the dashes in gaps

91
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,527
When are very far away in an angle where they look shorter

92
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:41,855
But there's no consensus as to why people all over the country

93
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,159
We're so consistently wrong

94
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,695
With the two Fiesta

95
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,327
My favorite cocktail

96
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,351
Party

97
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,631
In a pack

98
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,655
Stump the driver

99
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,447
Does White Stripes information

100
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:02,591
I don't want to leave you with the impression that the Y dividing lines are UNIF

101
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,895
You won't find Juno 10-foot

102
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:05,663
Highway lines

103
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,223
San Jose Boulevard in New York City

104
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,319
And you probably won't find 10 or 15 foot stripes on Bridges or Highway on-ramp

105
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,367
Or let's hope you don't do that soon

106
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,135
Government

107
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,159
Entirely

108
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,183
Designline

109
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:17,951
Which for that

110
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:18,719
Space

111
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:23,071
Limited access highways are designed for a very precise purpose

112
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,863
The Highwaymen

113
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,631
4

114
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,655
Uninterrupted

115
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:29,983
Fast flowing traffic get people from point A to point B

116
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,287
Quickest possible with no interruptions

117
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,847
Sort of environment does not work

118
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:41,247
Cities were or suburbs the problems when that approaches grafted into places where it doesn't belong

119
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,271
Paying the price

120
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,063
Right now and some

121
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,599
Suburban environments where you find these

122
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:48,159
Arterial highways that were built

123
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,463
Almost to Highway engineering standards

124
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:52,255
Again these long sight lines

125
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,047
Wide roads encourage

126
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:59,935
We go fast and then we went and built all kinds of development along those arterial highways was never really supposed to be there

127
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:05,567
But with so many people driving on these roads they became absolutely irresistible to,

128
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:09,407
This is score of the new American Main Street right where you have

129
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,199
Are Costco's in your ear

130
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,223
Fast food in

131
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,759
All sorts of in and out

132
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:18,623
Parking lots driveways drive-thrus yet people also going very fast and

133
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,159
Annenberg Dunbar

134
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,719
Does a lot of research suggests these are releasing

135
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,255
What's the most dangerous places

136
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,303
The drives in America not

137
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:27,583
Crowded

138
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,607
Urban cities

139
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:34,239
The whole approach is called the forgiving Road

140
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,519
The idea was that

141
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,823
First try to minimize the

142
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,847
Potential at a crash

143
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:39,615
Could happen

144
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,383
Through

145
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,431
Again through lack of obstacles

146
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,223
You know General sightlines all these rich

147
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,015
Crushed it happened

148
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:46,783
Mitigate

149
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,063
The effects

150
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,623
Survive what would happen to not punish the driver

151
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,439
For the mistake that he will inevitably make

152
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,743
According to language in the time

153
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:59,583
So you see that nowadays in things like in California will have your

154
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,119
Guardrails that are

155
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,655
Wire guard rails that

156
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,447
Car strikes

157
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,727
That guardrail at 10

158
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,495
The catch

159
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,519
On the guardrail rather than

160
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,287
Bounce back

161
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,311
Backing out into traffic

162
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,383
Another series of collisions

163
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,503
So this forgiving road is a positive thing in terms of good safety engineering

164
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:23,391
But they were they were so seduced by it that the call was made to bring it into the even the Surface Street Network

165
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:28,255
So things like Street trees began to be deemed a hazard

166
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,559
Buy Engineers just outright hazard

167
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,143
That makes sense on a high-speed country road but

168
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,191
If you're talking about a residential street

169
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:38,751
We're not supposed to be going more than 25 anyway

170
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:42,335
Is the presence of a street tree on the side of the road where it's providing

171
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:46,687
Shade and Comforts pedestrian snow is that the same sort of Hazard is it even a hazard at all

172
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:49,247
The conclusion many planners

173
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,039
Trees are a hazard

174
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,575
Define pre-war suburbs

175
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,111
You have a son you have the

176
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:54,879
The street

177
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,927
Set of trees and then

178
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:57,695
The sidewalk

179
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:01,279
Post-war the Starship again happen where

180
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,583
Trees removed on the other side of the sidewalk

181
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:07,423
Suddenly pedestrians were put into the position of being the buffer

182
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,703
Between drivers

183
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,751
And those menacing trees

184
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:14,591
As you move those trees away

185
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,383
The visual sensation of the road

186
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,663
Became wider

187
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,455
And if there's one

188
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:25,855
Iron law of traffic engineering it gets into this visual perception thing as well as the wider a road is or

189
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:29,439
Is perceived to be the faster driver speed dance in Grease

190
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,231
Of course you know the final if you look at

191
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:37,631
Suburbia that they just kind of eliminated the sidewalk in the trees

192
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,911
All together

193
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:39,679
The final

194
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,703
Final solution

195
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:48,383
And Tom Vanderbilt size you can almost data subdivisions development based on that shift

196
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,855
Road engineering is that humans tend to consume

197
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:58,879
Extra

198
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,951
Engineering measures have been built in for their safety

199
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,791
Much in the same way I like to draw the analogy with

200
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:09,887
So the research has been done on food packaging by by Brian wanzek

201
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:13,215
Cornell University experiments where you give people

202
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:17,311
I just ran over people large buckets of popcorn

203
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:20,127
Filled to the top with popcorn to get them a smaller

204
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,919
Smart popcorn in a smaller package

205
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:24,223
Don't don't just eat more of a larger pack

206
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,783
It's whether there it has nothing to do with their level of hunger it's just

207
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,319
The size of the package

208
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,111
Influences their behavior

209
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,647
Varmints

210
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,743
Over-engineered for the safety and then we

211
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:39,327
Time to consume a lot of the extras getting us back to this kind of

212
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,375
Homeostatic ads that were

213
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,143
We're always kind of

214
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,423
Playing with I think

215
00:09:54,431 --> 00:10:00,575
99% invisible is Sam Greenspan and me Roman Mars that the project

216
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:05,951
Public radio kalw in San Francisco and the American Institute of Architects in San Francisco

217
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:12,095
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices

218
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:15,679
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

219
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,703
If

220
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:23,103
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife isn't

221
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:27,199
Another

222
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,991
Technology talk to us

223
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,295
It is a creation of Sonic trash

224
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:34,111
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

225
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,695
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

226
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,743
To make them more human

227
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,839
Turn the living room lights on

228
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,375
Okay

229
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,423
Dim the living room lights to 50

230
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,191
80%

231
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:49,983
Okay

232
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:56,383
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

233
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:59,199
Makes for a much more natural experience

234
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:01,247
Turn the living room lights on

235
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,343
Dim the living room lights to 50%

236
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:12,767
We're presenting to special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

237

238
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,839
Is impacting our health

239
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:18,143
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

240
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:21,215
Look for them Fridays May 17th and May 24th

259
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:39,551
When I buy t-shirt and they have hands down my favorite t-shirt design in the whole world

260
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,831
Across the front

261
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,367
Is the word listen

262
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,903
Written in Braille

263
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,207
Six of them in every color

264
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,535
It's a must-have for any radio lover

265
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,583

00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:02,335
Before we go I want to tell you about the body genius

270
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:05,919
Series from Bellow radio TV show the truth

271
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:12,063
The body genius is a Dark comic mystery that whines through a treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

272
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,599
We're looking the part

273
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,135
Might cost you your life

274
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:21,535
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

275
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:27,935
Lose a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like

276
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,215
Like a dad

277
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:33,567
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

278
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:37,919
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that kind of

279
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:45,343
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

280
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:48,671
Was found dead in my private gym

281
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:51,999
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

282
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:56,351
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

283
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:59,679
Now I need to clear my name

284
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:05,055
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes

285
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,079
To find them

286
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:14,271
Final episode of the body genius drops on May 30th Bend all 5 Parts on the truth podcast
