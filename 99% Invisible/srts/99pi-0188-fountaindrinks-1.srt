I'm Roman Mars

28
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:15,008
In 2012 by Design Group in New York City called pilot project

29
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:18,080
Rolled out a strip of red carpet in Union Square

30

Public park in the middle of Manhattan

31
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,664
They hired a flautist

32
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,480
And a waiter in a tuxedo who wore white gloves

33
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:27,296
I have a small towel draped over his forearm

34
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:29,088
And one by one

35
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,624
They serve people drinks

36
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,160
Drinks of water

37
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,952
In the public drinking fountain

38
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:35,744
That's our own Katie Mingle

39
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:42,400
This Design Group pilot projects how does event to promote their plan to install a hundred new drinking

40
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,936
Fountains in New York City

41
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:47,776
But not just run-of-the-mill drinking fountains

42
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,312
We're talking about drinking

43
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,592
Fountains that

44
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,640
Kobe designed by artists and

45
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:54,176
Designers and architects

46
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:57,504
That's Scott Francisco from pilot projects

47
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:00,064
We really want to drink time to be something that

48
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,368
People love to use and

49
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,160
Share with each other and

50
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,744
There's a sense of pride in the fountains 2

51
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:12,096
Pilot projects was hoping to put some Prestige back on the drinking fountain

52
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,376
Make it cool again

53
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:14,912
I know you're thinking

54
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:17,216
Drinking fountains have never been cool

55
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,752
No one has ever been like

56
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:19,520
Yo

57
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:21,824
See you at the drinking fountain later

58
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,848
But you're wrong

59
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:28,736
There was a time when everyone was like yo see what the drinking fountain later

60
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:36,160
All the 21st of April 1859 the Streets of London

61
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:42,304
What's wrong with crowds of people who came to witness the opening of the first

62
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,584
Free

63
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,376
Fresh drinking fountain

64
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:49,984
That's Philip Davies heat wrote a book about historic drinking fountains in London

65
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:56,128
And he's talking about the day that the public drinking fountain was the coolest thing in town

66
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,784
The scene was recorded in the London Illustrated news so we actually have a pretty good idea of what it was like

67
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,136
Woman's hand out in that that's finery the men have their top hats on

68
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:11,744
Children with clambering over the ratings everyone was so pumped

69
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,512
I like

70
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:13,536
Water is the

71
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,304
Bats

72
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:15,840
People

73
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:19,936
Lawson couldn't believe that they were blessed with something that was

74
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:22,240
So important to them

75
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:30,432
And if you look at the picture in the London Illustrated news you can see above the fountain engraved in the Stonewall

76
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,968
The first

77
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,992
Drinking fountain

78
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:37,344
It probably wasn't the first drinking fountain in the history of the world

79
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:43,744
But it was the first one in London people a day

80
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,888
And understand its Mass Appeal you have to understand some things about London before this Fountain was installed

81
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:58,336
City Life in the 19th century in London

82
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:00,128
The poorer classes

83
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:04,224
Part of that nightmare was the drinking water

84
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:08,064
Most people did not have access to water in their homes

85
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:14,464
Instead many got water from the nasty Cesspool known as the River Thames

86
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,232
Great sewer

87
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,791
It was full of feces and chemicals

88
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:21,119
It was not uncommon to see dead animals floating down the river

89
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:27,775
The Thames was so nasty that London has the distinction of having a. In their history called

90
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:30,847
The great stink when the smell from the

91
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,895
Thames was so bad

92
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:36,735
They had to evacuate the House of Commons in Westminster father though

93
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:42,367
So some people in London got their water directly from the stinky tens

94
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:47,743
And other people got it from Wells that were also dirty and contaminated with disease

95
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,303
Cholera was rampant

96
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:56,703
Outbreaks of the disease in 1847 and 1854 kills 58,000 people in

97
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:01,311
An accepted Theory at the time was diseases including cholera

98
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,871
We're spread through bad-smelling air

99
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:08,991
But some people were skeptical of this including a scientist named Jon Snow

100
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:12,063
Jon Snow thought that disease might be spread

101
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,087
2 water

102
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,367
And everyone was on like

103
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,671
You Know Nothing Jon Snow

104
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:20,767
I'm he was like actually I know that the water is killing you

105
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,047
And I'm going to prove it

106
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,631
He went to work

107
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:31,007
Are you sick or members of your family sick and he actually marked down on a map

108
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,543
Everyone who was sick

109
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:37,663
That Peter Glick and expert on water related issues at the Pacific Institute

110
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,711
He identified

111
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,503
In the center of this

112
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,271
Outbreak

113
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,319
Particular water well

114
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:47,391
He went he removed the pump handle

115
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:50,207
So that nobody could pump water from that water well

116
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:53,535
And the cholera epidemic in this neighborhood ended

117
00:05:55,071 --> 00:06:01,215
No one had ever really mouth disease patterns like this before which is why Jon Snow is known as the father of modern

118
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,239
Epidemiology

119
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:07,871
Jon Snow made the discovery that Colorado was a link to water in 1854

120
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:18,623
Shortly after that group was formed called The Metropolitan free drinking fountain Association they'll

121
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:25,023
Change their name to the Metropolitan free drinking fountain & Cattle trough Association

122
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,303
Because it was just catchier

123
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,583
No

124
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:32,959
And providing clean water for Animals also became a central tenet of their mission

125
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:38,591
Baby drinking fountains all over London

126
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:41,151
Very soon off to it's within

127
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:46,527
Five or six years / AC Fountain Seminole Towne Center erected across London

128
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,599
By 1879 the Metropolitan

129
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:52,671
Free drinking fountain & Cattle trough Association

130
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:53,951
I built almost

131
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:56,511
800 drinking fountains in London

132
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:01,631
The association was made up of wealthy mostly Christian philanthropist

133
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:05,471
And they had a couple different agendas and building me fountains

134
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:09,055
One was clean Safe Drinking Water for poor people

135
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,847
And the other was temperance

136
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:15,711
The temperance movement a social movement that opposed the consumption of alcohol

137
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:20,063
Was an early supporter of this new beverage called water

138
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:26,719
There was a terrible epidemic of alcoholism in London at the time but not just inland

139
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,767
And a lot of other places too

140
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:33,631
Including the United States where the temperance movement was also taking hold

141
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:36,703
And really the reason that temperance

142
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:42,847
Is invented is because alcohol is what people drink that's historian an architect Marta Gutman

143
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:45,151
Water is dirty water is

144
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:49,503
Not understood to be a suitable beverage milk is unheard of

145
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:53,343
Except for babies and coffee and tea are expensive

146
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,111
So that's it

147
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:59,999
Men women and even children were drinking alcohol all day long

148
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:04,351
Alcoholism is destroying families

149
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,911
Life in order to fight against alcohol

150
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:13,311
And one of the Alternatives that at this time

151
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:16,895
Once we figured out how to provide Safe Water was water

152
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,735
Temperance fountains were built in public parks at churches

153
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:23,551
An option right outside the local bar

154
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:27,903
Hoping to snag those few people that weren't going in because they wanted to get drunk

155
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,439
But just because

156
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,463
They were thirsty

157
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:36,095
The architectural style of these fountains vary greatly depending on who commissioned them

158
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,911
But they weren't like the drinking fountains you grew up with

159
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:41,727
They were generally made of stone for granite

160
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:45,311
That first fountain in London was fairly simple

161
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:48,639
But they became quite rapidly much more elaborate

162
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,735
Racine nice opposes

163
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:54,783
Symbols

164
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,319
Philanthropy

165
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:59,903
Somewhere ornate Victorian Gothic structures

Clay Coleman

167
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:06,303
Architectural detail here with us Alliance headed spouse

168
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,607
I came out of the mouth

169
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:15,519
Lionshead the ones built by Christian organizations often included a Biblical inscription like

170
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,567
Fear of the Lord is a Fountain of Life

171
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:22,175
You can still find Temperance fountains all over Europe in the US

172
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,247
There's one in New York City's Tompkins Square Park

173
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:31,391
In Oregon a lumber Tycoon / Tito learning Simon Benson built fountains all over Portland

174
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:35,743
They came to be known as Benson bubblers in Portland OR is love them

175
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,535
Prefer to drinking from them as

176
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,327
Having a Benson highball

177
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,655
There's a fountain in Petaluma California with the inscription

178
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:45,983
Total abstinence is the way to handle the alcohol problem

179
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,543
Ultimately drinking fountains in

180
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,847
Handle our problems with alcohol

181
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:55,455
But they quickly became part of the public landscape what comes out of it

182
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:58,015
Is an idea that there should be drinking fountains in cities

183
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:04,415
That sounds should not be ornamental that there should be water available in public for people to drink

184
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:07,487
Developed people started to require

185
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,535
A certain number of water fountains

186
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,303
In

187
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:13,119
For example Stadium Sports Stadium

188
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,167
Poor in Music Hall

189
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:19,263
I think that became an important part of our Municipal design

190
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:23,615
But it took awhile to refine certain aspects

191
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,639
At the design

192
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:28,479
Four years drinking fountains were sort of like a public faucet

193
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:32,063
You'd set your cup under a spigot and turn off the water

194
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:36,671
And this cop it was a common cop that hung from a chain and was meant to be used by all

195
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,719
Gonadal sinuses please

196
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,999
Please replace the cop

197
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:44,607
It was actually a pretty big battle to get rid of the common cup

198
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:51,007
Public Health officials knew it was spreading disease but people weren't in the habit of carrying their own cup around

199
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:53,567
In 1912 the very first

200
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:56,639
Federal Regulation on our drinking water with past

201
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,943
To abolish the common cup

202
00:10:59,199 --> 00:10:59,967
A drinking fountain

203
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:04,575
Meanwhile a drinking fountain was designed that did not require a cup

204
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:10,975
It was similar to the drinking fountains we use now the difference being that the water came out in a vertical jet

205
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,511
Got that shot straight up

206
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,815
Which is exactly like a bidet

207
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,351
But for your mouth

208
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,911
And all of your backwash would just

209
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:21,215
Ripped straight down onto the spouse

210
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,239
Or

211
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:25,055
People just put their lips on to the spout

212
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:28,127
This vertical jet style drinking fountain was called

213
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,407
Ironically

214
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,199
A sanitary drinking fountain

215
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:37,855
And in 1920 the American Water Works Association issued a sternly worded report

216
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,135
That begins

217
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:43,743
The war against the common drinking cup has been won

218
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,047
This Victory however

219
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,351
Must not be allowed to Blind us to

220
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,375
The dangers lurking

221
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,167
In the sanitary drain

222
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:57,055
The report goes on to detail a study of one of these so-called sanitary drinking fountain

223
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,103
Of the 47 people who

224
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,127
Use the fountains

225
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,175
In almost every instance

226
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,455
Ellipse replaced

227
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:07,295
Sweetly around a metal ball from which the water spurted

228
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:11,647
And One Small boy acted as though he were trying to swallow the

229
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,415
Machinery

230
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:13,951
It goes on

231
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:20,351
Of the 47 people 3 looked as though they were unmistakably victims of tuberculosis and

232
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,143
Three had eruptions

233
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,423
On their faces

234
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,775
They advised putting cages around the spouts

235
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:30,847
So that we couldn't wrap our mouths around them

236
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:34,943
And finally they advised switching to a slanted or Arctic

237
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,223
Jet of water

238
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:39,039
This along with the guard around the spout

239
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,831
Proved to be the design that's.

240
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:44,415
Finally a drinking fountain we could all get behind

241
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:45,951
Sort of

242
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,607
And I say segregation now

243
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,287
For a lot of Americans

244
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:05,407
The public drinking fountain conjures and image that has nothing to do with the slanted jet

245
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,223
Are the common cup or with temperance

246
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:15,135
It's an image of segregation the segregated drinking fountain during the Jim Crow era in the South End is one of us

247
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,671
Images of Sprite

248
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:20,511
Sharing water made racist America uncomfortable

249
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:23,583
Whether it was drinking fountains for swimming pools

250
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,351
There is

251
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,911
Acute anxiety about the contact

252
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,959
Black and white bodies

253
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:35,615
The Civil Rights Act of 1964 ended segregated public facilities including drinking fountain

254
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:39,199
Although a handful hung on in the South for a few more years

255
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,039
Even with that darkest

256
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,831
Period the drinking fountains

257
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:45,855
History over

258
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:52,511
It's never really been as beloved as it was when they open that first one in London and 18th

259
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,279
59

260
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:57,631
Recently public drinking fountains have met their most formidable opponent

261
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:59,423
So in the United States

262
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:03,519
We consume 9 or 10 billion gallons a year

263
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,311
Expensive bottled water

264
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,103
And it's growing

265
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,895
5 to 10%

266
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:09,919
A year

267
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:16,319
That's Peter Glick again of the Pacific Institute he also wrote a book called bottled and sold

268
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:19,647
The story behind our obsession with bottled water

269
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,951
The consequence of that is

270
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:24,767
Billions and billions of plastic bottles

271
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,535
What's that

272
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,559
Have to be

273
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,607
Thrown away or recycled

274
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,399
Another consequence

275
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:34,495
Drinking fountains are starting to disappear from the public landscape

276
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:38,847
Despite the fact that many people believe public war is sort of a standard

277
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,151
Part of any Urban Design

278
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,455
We have seen

279
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:45,247
Movement away from water fountain

280
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:48,319
The University of Central Florida

281
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:51,135
In 2007 opened

282
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:55,743
A brand new football stadium they had built the stadium with no public water fountain

283
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:01,375
And on opening day 45,000 people showed up to watch the UCF Knights

284
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,911
Play the Texas Longhorns

285
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:09,311
It was an incredibly hot day almost a hundred degrees so everyone was thirsty

286
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,615
House for sale Force but it cost $3

287
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,919
And then the bottled water sold out

288
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:20,575
18 people were taken to hospitals and 60 more were treated by local campus Personnel for heat-related

289
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,343
Illnesses

290
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:24,159
At first the University was Unapologetic

291
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:27,487
And then some angry students organized into a group called

292
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,279
Knights for free water

293
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:32,095
They demanded drinking fountains be installed in the stadium

294
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:35,679
We're going out for blood we just want water they said

295
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,239
The local press came up with a name for this candle

296
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,823
Yes it was Watergate

297
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,383
And finally the University was forced to concede

298
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,199
They installed 50 drinking fountains in their Stadium

299
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:53,599
The nights for free water probably didn't know anything about there for mothers and fathers in the metropolitan

300
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:56,159
Free drinking fountain & Cattle trough

301
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,183
Association

302
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:02,047
But it's because of them and their teetotaling brethren in the United States

303
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,607
That we've come to expect access

304
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,375
Clean

305
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,399
Free water

306
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,679
In public places

307
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:10,239
If Watergate proved anything

308
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,287
You know besides Nixon was a liar and a cheat

309
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,847
It's a drinking fountain still matter

310
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,383
And when they're gone

311
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,663
We notice

312
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:23,295
Because even though we as a society have mostly rejected the idea of temperance

313
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:27,391
And embrace the idea that we love booze forever

314
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,183
Sometimes water

315
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,719
Is still the best

316
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:48,895
Special things to Marta Gutman. She gave on her book City for children women architecture and the charitable

317
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,943
Landscapes of Oakland inspired the story

318
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:51,967
Bonus Pack

319
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:57,087
The Metropolitan free drinking fountain and cattle trough Association still exists

320
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,647
But they change their name again now their jaws

321
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,695
The drinking fountain Association

322
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:04,511
They still maintain Linden's historic fountains

323
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,047
And build new ones

324
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,071
In developing countries

325
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:15,007
The Design Group we mentioned at the beginning of the piece pilot projects is trying to build 100 new drinking fountains in New York

326
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:19,103
They're still trying to make it happen but they need the city to partner with them

327
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,639
If you really into this

328
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:23,199
Write a note to the mayor's office and

329
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,735
Ask for better Drake

330
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:27,295
Fountains and mention 100000

331
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,343
Project as part of the solution

332
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:37,279
99percentinvisible was produced this week by Katie mingle with Sam Greenspan Avery Troutman Kolstad and the

333
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,047
Roman Mars

334
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:43,935
We are project of 91.7 kalw San Francisco and produced out of the offices of Arkansas

335
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,727
In architecture and Interiors firm

336
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,495
Beautiful

337
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,543
Downtown Oakland California

338
00:17:55,455 --> 00:18:01,599
Wall Katie was working on the space we collectively couldn't get the Tune-Yards song water fountain out of our heads and

339
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:05,695
Which is what happens at richy at song Exploder Dead episode about that song which

340
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,231
One of our absolute favorite

341
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,279
So we thought we'd out of here

342
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,071
Enjoy

343
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:16,191
I want my music to be a product of the world that I am growing up

344
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,471
And growing old

345
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:21,055
So if this song is going to exist as a two-year-old song

346
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,079
It has to have

347
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,359
Some dirty nasty

348
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,639
52 it

349
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:30,783
My name is Merrill Garbus and I make music

350
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,063
Sick under the name Tune-Yards

351
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:35,391
Nate Brenner is a co-writer on most of the songs now

352
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,183
Skreets

353
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:39,743
It was January 2013 and I was like

354
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:42,559
Okay it's the new year and I'm going to start to make a new album

355
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:44,095
What kind of force myself in

356
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:46,399
Into this routine where I go into my little

357
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:52,799
Studio which was a shipping container that had been made into a little rehearsal studios I was there in this like

358
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:54,591
Super hot metal box

359
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:57,663
Sitting at a computer and trying to make

360
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:58,943
All these damn

361
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,063
Stipend

362
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,367
Taking a lot of walks around Oakland and I was walking

363
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,391
Around

364
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,415
Lake Merritt

365
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,183
Which is

366
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,719
Down the street from where we live

367
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:13,279
And I'll just walk around that like a whole lot and

368
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:14,815
Passing water fountain

369
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,375
Some of them working some of them now and

370
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:24,031
You know at that time I was hearing stuff about conservatives not wanting to pay taxes and I just kind of let my green Wonder

371
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:26,079
They're like we know what if no one ever pay tax

372
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,871
Doesn't what if no one ever

373
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,407
Decided that it was worth it

374
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:31,199
To put money into our greater

375
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:34,015
Good seeing that three of my imagination that

376
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,807
In on the roads no sidewalks

377
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:36,575
Snow

378
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,343
No one

379
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:40,159
I don't know there's something about the rhythm of my walking

380
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,695
And the rhythm of that

381
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:44,255
Prays that no other than water fountain that just like

382
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,279
I came out of that

383
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:47,839
The lyric and the melody and

384
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,655
Sing song Inus of it and the

385
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,679
Topic of it

386
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:52,703
I think I'll came

387
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:53,727
Bundled up

388
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:01,407
When tuners begin I was really interested

389
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:03,199
In-rhythm being

390
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:03,967
Abuse

391
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:04,735
Part of that

392
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,783
I just super obsessed with the

393
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,367
The interplay between rhythms and this creation of a greater rhythmic

394
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:12,671
Call when you have these multiple

395
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,463
Rhythmic voice is going on at the same time

396
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:16,255
X to the 3/2

397
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,607
And the other

398
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,375
Two three

399
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:27,775
And that was me and you know in the hot box

400
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:34,687
Just Larry loves over one over another and just saying okay that's a start to something and then

401
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:35,711
I kind of would just

402
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,247
Hear what was missing

403
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,015
Like we're can

404
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,807
Can I fill an even more gaps

405
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,087
Between those two clapping

406
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:45,951
And when it came up with was this cut.... Bye. Bye.

407
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,791
So it's really those three rhythms

408
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:51,839
Slate over each other

409
00:20:55,935 --> 00:21:02,079
I love when things are human and not machine like obviously as anyone listening stupid music would know

410
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,127
It is not perfect by any means

411
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:04,895
But

412
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:11,039
There's a tipping point at which I go nope I was a little bit too op the beat there

413
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:13,599
For using a song that I really wanted to be a dance

414
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:22,048
The story of the song is basically that I almost threw it away because I thought it was

415
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:22,816
Dumb

416
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:27,936
It just sounded like really simple I mean think about me spending hours trying to workout Lane

417
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,984
Mike laps over one another and then

418
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:34,336
Coming up with the words like no wood in the Woodstock

419
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,128
What the hell does that mean

420
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,920
And I was like this is so annoying

421
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:39,968
And I'm annoying and everything

422
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:40,736
Pink sucks

423
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:43,808
And neat had a hot dogs across from mine

424
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:46,880
And he would walk over every opportunity

425
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:47,648
Ruby Lake

426
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:49,696
A sanity check and I be like this sucks

427
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:51,488
And he like no no it's cool and he

428
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,536
She came in and he played the first base line.

429
00:21:57,632 --> 00:22:01,728
And I thought rhythmically is Baseline was awesome

430
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:08,128
But I thought no it sounds to rights like if you play in that kind of major key then it's going to sound too

431
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:08,896
Rate

432
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:10,944
A little bit more wrong

433
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:15,296
We kind of thought about it a little bit

434
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,576
In our peaceful way

435
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:19,904
And then he came up with if he's playing in minor

436
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:26,048
And all the sudden the color of the song

437
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:28,352
Completely changes and that was really important

438
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,400
To me that the things that the song was

439
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:36,288
Talking about to me or really heavy and so it didn't make sense to just keep the whole sun in major it was like

440
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,056
This is

441
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,336
Disturbing

442
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,616
That's kind of weird

443
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:40,640
Do you like

444
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:43,200
How about this and I was like how did that in the world like okay both

445
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:45,504
I saved up for my pants

446
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:49,856
Then I gave them to the special guy

447
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:02,400
In the store

448
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:05,216
Pretty simple major Melody but then you just make

449
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:06,752
The bassline minor

450
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,032
And all the sudden it's like

451
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,568
Stomach-churning

452
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:11,616
Part of the song where all is on you know that

453
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:12,896
Something's going to go down

454
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:32,352
You know now there a lot of people involved into yards the record label in our manager and they're like

455
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:34,656
Men's the single this the catchy one

456
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:37,984
Can you please just make it less dissonant and I was like

457
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,264
No

458
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,056
I really can't

459
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:44,128
I mean tuner it started when I was listening to us

460
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:46,688
Ton of dancehall reggae

461
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:49,760
And there's something about the tradition

462
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:51,296
Reggae that

463
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,576
For so many reasons

464
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,344
Stairs

465
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,112
Dissonance

466
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:54,880
And

467
00:23:55,392 --> 00:24:01,536
Kind of dub sensibility where there things that feel wrong or don't link up exactly but there's so much

468
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,816
Much implied in that

469
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:04,352
Disagreement between Ellen

470
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:06,400
There's some Reggae albums where you feel like

471
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:08,704
Singer came in and saying and couldn't

472
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,728
Hear the track

473
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:13,056
And then the check that they end up putting underneath the singer is like

474
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,080
I totally different

475
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:20,736
Song with a different key

476
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:27,136
So I love

477
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:28,160
That sensitive

478
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:32,768
Wrong parts put together but then when it comes back together as a whole it has is holding

479
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:33,536
Conversation

480
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:35,328
Wrongness

481
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:38,144
Bino no water in the water fountain is

482
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,680
It's like a horrible concept

483
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:44,288
Even more so now in California but in 2013 to we were talking about the drought and it was

484
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:48,640
Terrifying to me to allow my imagination to go that far and think

485
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:51,200
Of life without water coming out of your toe

486
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:55,040
You know even just talking about these things now it's like this

487
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,832
Really uncomfortable

488
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:58,112
Tension in my

489
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:59,392
Stomach and I think that's

490
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:04,000
That feeling that I love to evoke in songs where I'm not writing pretty songs

491
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:06,048
For people to fall in love to Nessa

492
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:08,864
Literally I'm writing songs that sound more

493
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,936
Like the truth of the world to me and that has to mean that

494
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:15,008
That's literally built into the song that's literally built

495
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,312
Come to the harmonies or the friction or that

496
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,848
Reading sense of the song

497
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,384
And that's kind of why

498
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:27,040
I don't know what's listen to that drum machine stem and that first got the cute little cow bell sound

499
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:30,112
And then throughout the song as he gets the end of the song it's like this

500
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:36,512
Crazy distorted meth of a drum machine

501
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:43,424
I found this awesome water bottle of the thrift store and

502
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:44,960
It's just like these things like

503
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:46,496
Fit into the world of the

504
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:47,776
Spare parts

505
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:50,080
Like a water bottle

506
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:53,920
Evokes water somehow even if you're not saying though the water bottle

507
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:55,200
There's just something about it that

508
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,224
Buffets in

509
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,112
So this is where

510
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:02,880
The brilliant

511
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:04,160
John Hill comes in

512
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:04,928
Because

513
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,976
He introduced the lasers

514
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:11,840
Now we were so nervous working with other producers and I'm very possessive of the

515
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:13,632
Turn producer because I feel like

516
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,400
You know I am

517
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,680
My own producer

518
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:16,448
But

519
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,216
WeChat

520
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:17,984
The song in

521
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,056
Of some of our label people

522
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:22,080
And played it for

523
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:22,848
John Hill who's

524
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:23,872
Worked on a lot of

525
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:25,920
Rihanna and

526
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,712
Am I a an

527
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:29,248
And so he had those lasers

528
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,272
For us and I

529
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,808
Played those lasers

530
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:32,832
On honest

531
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,112
Add with a stick

532
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:36,416
So we all agree that that was

533
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,184
Again another

534
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,208
Dancehall Elliman

535
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:39,744
Amps up the song

536
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,792
When it's like another losers come in

537
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:50,496
You know what it is

538
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,336
Oh my God

539
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:58,176
Me and my voice

540
00:26:58,944 --> 00:26:59,456
Tongue making fun

541
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:00,736
Crazy roll in there

542
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,392
But then

543
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:08,160
Sample

544
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,184
Implead

545
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:12,256
Keyboard that we did with Dunhill as well as we

546
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,536
