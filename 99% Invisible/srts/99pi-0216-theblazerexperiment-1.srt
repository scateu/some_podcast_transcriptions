I'm Roman Mars

28
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:36,000
In 1968 the police department in Menlo Park California hired a new police chief

29
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:38,304
His name was Victor so thank

30
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:42,912
And she still think is his main goal was to reform the police departments in it

31
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,960
Which wasn't great at the time

32
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:48,800
That's our own Delaney Hall this was the 1960s

33
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:50,592
And even in Menlo Park

34
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:54,432
A small City with manicured Lawns and wide Suburban streets

35
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,736
It has been a turbulent decade

36
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:03,392
There were big student-led anti-war demonstrations at Stanford University which is right here by Joan Baez

37
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:07,744
Folk singer created a communist called struggle mountain in the Foothills above the city

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,120
And leaders in the African-American Community organizing protests to demand better treatment and services

39
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:16,192
The Menlo Park police had clashed with these Pro

40
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,984
Sometimes violently

41
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,288
And after years and years of this

42
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,360
The department had a pretty rough reputation

43
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:28,480
Had a reputation for being a very tough Police Department very aggressive Police Department

44
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,528
And somewhat of a very

45
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,064
Anti race

46
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,344
Kind of a police

47
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,184
That's Dominick peluso he was hired in 1970

48
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,208
Buy Chiefs is Anchor

49
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,512
The guy who wanted to change this

50
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:45,632
He just he's one of these type of guys that would come into a room and we just fill in the room

51
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,168
You know and everybody kinda

52
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:47,936
This back in

53
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,984
I think we better listen and go along

54
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:57,152
Chiefs has anchors had hired Dominic right out of the Jesuit Seminary

55
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,456
Where Dominic had been studying to be a priest

56
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:01,760
Does angus like hiring officers

57
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:04,064
Words from non-traditional law enforcement background

58
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,344
Saint with higher level

59
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,112
Education

60
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:09,696
It was just one of the strategies for reforming the

61
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,768
He also let his officers grow their hair out

62
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,816
And have beards and mustaches

63
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:19,168
He changed all the pseudo military titles to more corporate

64
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,728
Sergeant's became manager

65
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:22,496
For example

66
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,800
And lieutenants became Direct

67
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:29,408
Officers in the department had mixed feelings about all these changes

68
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,456
Is but one with more controversial

69
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,480
Then the others

70
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:39,392
Berlin time officers in Menlo Park had worn a variation of the tradition

71
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,696
Dark blue police uniform

72
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:44,256
But she still thinks about that style was

73
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,280
Too intimidating

74
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,304
An aggressive

75
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,704
To the Chief came up with something totally different was really a nice kind of a dark green blazer with

76
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,984
What's the black thread in it

77
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:00,384
We wore pastel colored solid shirts with a tie and slacks instead of

78
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,456
Silver metal badge the Blazer exported in embroidered patch

79
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:05,504
That sort of look like a coat of arms

80
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,320
Guns and handcuffs remained hidden under the jacket

81
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,856
All in all the officers

82
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:16,256
What kind of like grown-up Rhett school students but with guns they even had pocket protectors with the Menlo

83
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,536
Oak Park police logo on it

84
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,863
I would slide into the pocket of their dress shirts

85
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:24,447
It seems like the the total effect is he was trying to

86
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,727
Demilitarized

87
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,007
The looking at it

88
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,031
The department

89
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:30,335
Yeah I think that would be a correct

90
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,103
A statement

91
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,919
A lot of the guys who join Police Department

92
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:36,479
Funny military and because of the nature of the work

93
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,783
It can be very militaristic

94
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,319
Dick shall we say an organization

95
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,599
And training and all those guys

96
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,879
He was trying to

97
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,415
Calm it down

98
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:50,303
But you think this was also messing with a tradition that would prove extremely hard to change

99
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:56,447
Because the blue military-style uniform had a history that went back more than a hundred years

100
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:02,847
What we've asked police officers to wear over the years says a lot about what we've expected.

101
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,383
And how we feel about them

102
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:07,455
Even says a lot about how they feel about themselves

103
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:11,551
Back in America's colonial days law enforcement

104
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,319
Really differ

105
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,343
Print then it does now

106
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,415
In New England there were these informal group

107
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,463
Generally known as The Watch

108
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:21,023
The patrol neighborhoods looking for crime

109
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,839
No uniforms no sort of

110
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:28,447
Organizational policies that they had a follow is basically every able man

111
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:34,079
Chad pozek teaches in the Department of Criminal Justice and criminology at Georgia Southern University

112
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,895
If they saw somebody that needed help a fire

113
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:41,247
Crime on the corner it would just be an informal group to exert a respond to that

114
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,039
So that was in the North

115
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,575
In southern community

116
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,367
Leading up to the Civil War

117
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,159
There were roving Patrol

118
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,695
That were responsible for

119
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:53,279
Suppressing slave revolts and tracking down runaway slaves

120
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,839
They worked for large Plantation owner

121
00:05:56,607 --> 00:06:00,191
So very much in the South Early policing was tied to us

122
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:03,263
Slavery were in the north it was more police and crime

123
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,287
Chinese large urban area

124
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:09,151
These unofficial patrols were how early law enforcement work for decades

125
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:13,247
It wasn't until the 1820s that modern policing began to take shape

126
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:16,575
Thanks to a British Statesman named Sir Robert peel

127
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:22,719
Before people came along and London looked a lot like it did in colonial America

128
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:25,279
Informal and Loosely organized

129
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:28,863
And Peele recognize that there were problems with the

130
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:35,263
This model people not taking it seriously being drunk on the job not showing up falling asleep and so he what he wanted

131
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,287
To do is

132
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,079
Korea police department

133
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,615
FaceTime answered

134
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,383
Principles

135
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:43,711
In after years of pushing for a form peel succeeded

136
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:47,551
In 1829 he helped found the London Metropolitan Police

137
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:50,879
The first modern full-time city-wide Police Department

138
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,695
British officers are still known as Bobby

139
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,999
In honor of Robert Bobby.

140
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,047
In Ireland they call them peelers

141
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,583
With a little less

142
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:04,703
Fuel required his officers to wear uniforms that would distinguish them

143
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:08,031
Citizens they were meant to serve but peel was also sense

144
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:11,359
Stuff to help British people might perceive this new please

145
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,407
Yes that was a huge concern

146
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,247
Because for so many years the people were ruled by

147
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,295
The military in it in military

148
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:22,367
Tri-State peel wanted the new police uniforms to

149
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,391
To stand apart

150
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,671
From the red cow

151
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:25,951
Did the British military

152
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:29,791
Now sort of we forget our first blue uniform that is it was

153
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,327
Very professional-looking

154
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,399
When was actually stood in stark contrast to the red

155
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,167
That you saw

156
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,191
With the military

157
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,335
Gradually peels ideas and his blue uniform

158
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,871
Made their way to the United

159
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:44,639
It states

160
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:48,479
By the early nineteen hundreds police departments across the country

161
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,551
Adopted aspects of the style and approach

162
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,087
Pioneered by the London method

163
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,111
Alton Police

164
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,695
This included a quasi-military structure

165
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,743
And the goal of crime prevention

166
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,815
But there were still some problem

167
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,655
Most early police departments in the US Allied themselves

168
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,191
The rich and the powerful

169
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:10,239
Local politicians in business

170
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,031
And you might be thinking

171
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,567
Still like that now

172
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,103
And you might be right

173
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,383
But it was worse than

174
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,759
Like a new mayor would get elected and then would appoint a hand-picked police chief

175
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,039
Chief with higher

176
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,831
Their family their friends

177
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,111
Come the officers

178
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,647
I'll dad Department

179
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,951
So very political in and obviously

180
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:33,791
True the police chief you sort of work for the mayor local politician

181
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,583
You're going to serve there

182
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,863
Purposes first

183
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,399
And the community Maybe

184
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,679
Secondarily

185
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,215
It was a patronage

186
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:45,823
And in most departments recruits didn't receive any special training

187
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,615
They were just handed a badge

188
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,639
Animated stick

189
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,175
And sent out on patrol

190
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:56,575
Despite the spiffy new uniforms and their newly organized approach

191
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,367
Public trust in the police

192
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,135
Was

193
00:08:59,391 --> 00:08:59,903
Dismal

194
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,975
So a reform movement begins to grow a

195
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,255
Across America

196
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:08,863
And then in 1929 President Herbert Hoover convenes a group

197
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,911
Called the Wickersham Commission

198
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:14,495
They conducted the first national study of the American

199
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,263
Criminal justice

200
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,335
They look at the system from Top

201
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,103
Tabata

202
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:23,711
And they basically saw the infiltration of politics into

203
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,247
Huge profit

204
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,039
And they said that

205
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,319
We need to change

206
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,087
How We Do

207
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:33,951
The Wickersham report shocked the country by exposing widespread police abuse

208
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:39,583
It described police routinely beating suspects in holding them illegally for like they questioning

209
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,607
And you might be psychic

210
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,143
It's still like that now

211
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,679
And you might be right

212
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,215
But it was worse than

213
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:48,031
The report included some pretty disturbing a

214
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:53,151
Like a suspect who was held by the ankles from a third-story window

215
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:58,015
And another who was forced to stand in the morgue with his hands on the body of a murderer

216
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:01,855
This report the Wickersham report really was sort of

217
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:04,927
Is turning point and we need to do something different in

218
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,719
I think that's what led into this

219
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,487
Professional air

220
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:12,863
This new professional era which continued up into the 1960s and 70s

221
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:16,703
Was characterized by the emphasis on policing as a skilled profession

222
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:18,751
This old educational film

223
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,031
Called your police

224
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:20,799
Ways to Die

225
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:25,407
Police departments use modern science to protect you

226
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,735
Photography

227
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,015
Two way radio

228
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,879
Expert firearms training as standardized by the FBI National Academy

229
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,439
Accident prevention installation

230
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:43,839
Now police were trained to use modern tools and technology and one of the leading voices for this new me

231
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:50,239
Message was a guy named August Vollmer the first police chief of Berkeley California

232
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:53,311
And he helped her write the Wickersham report

233
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,871
Boomer got his officers to use motorcycle

234
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:56,895
Golden patrol cars

235
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:57,919
Instead of just

236
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,943
Walking around

237
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:02,527
That way they could cover bigger areas more efficiently

238
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:07,647
He was also one of the first Chiefs in the u.s. to insist his Department use

239
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,183
One blood

240
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:09,951
Fibrin

241
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:10,975
To help solve

242
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:11,743
Crimes

243
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:18,143
And under his influence California became a hotbed of police reform from the 1920s the 1960

244
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,679
Weeding of course

245
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:24,031
The stuff like cheeks as I kiss his Blazer uniform experiment in Menlo Park

246
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:28,895
Birth years it seems like Chiefs to think of his reforms might be working

247
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:31,455
In Blazers and ties and

248
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:36,319
Pocket protectors the Menlo Park police definitely looked less intimidate

249
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,879
Here's Dominick peluso again

250
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:42,207
Eventually became assistant chief under says thank

251
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:45,023
It wasn't like we slacked off

252
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,095
And became you don't like oh mercy and

253
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:48,863
Forgiveness

254
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:53,983
I love and peace and all that kind of stuff you know know but the way we did it and

255
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:54,751
The style that we

256
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:55,775
We gave two people ice

257
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,335
Made them feel a lot better about us

258
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,127
And he built up a lot of reading

259
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,407
Repore with

260
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:08,575
There was even an early studies suggesting that altercations between citizens and the police had to climb because of a Blazers

261
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:11,391
The study was later challenged but when it first came out

262
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,415
Where begin

263
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,719
Spread a few other departments across the country

264
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,255
Adopted the Blazer Style

265
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:19,839
But the uniform experiment also drew a line within the

266
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:22,911
On one side there were the guys like Dominic

267
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:25,215
Lights with the Blazer stood for

268
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:29,055
They embraced the to think is one of the department to have

269
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,591
A comme Amour

270
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,359
Professional image

271
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,919
There's a lot of guys who want to do this job

272
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:36,735
But don't want to go out there and knock heads or

273
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:39,039
People are you know whatever like that

274
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,063
Are they just want to

275
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,599
Do the best for the community

276
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,415
And I think with our uniform people

277
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,695
For applying

278
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:48,767
Got more the sense that we really work community

279
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:49,535
Minded

280
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,303
Helping

281
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:53,119
On the other side with the old school police officer

282
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,143
Who Miss

283
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,959
Stitches no uniform and all that it represented

284
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:57,983
The enjoy

285
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:00,031
The eagle stuff that goes with it

286
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:03,615
They also enjoy that sense of authority on that you show

287
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:08,991
The clearness of who they are with the Blazer it just wasn't always that clear

288
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,551
Do you like stop a personal safer violation

289
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,111
And I'd walk up and say can I see your license

290
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,415
They look against the wall

291
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,183
What's your life

292
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,463
How are you

293
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,255
Vineyard Point Village

294
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,279
Apache salon

295
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,607
This is retired Sergeant band Trask

296
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:28,703
He worked under Sancus internally he like the chief style and approach

297
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:31,775
But he admits that it caused some complications

298
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,567
You you didn't have that much

299
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,871
Recognition as a cop so you

300
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:36,895
Kind of

301
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,735
There's a tendency to get more

302
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,783
Who are you you know

303
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,551
Yunnan the place

304
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:47,391
Many officers got so frustrated that they quit

305
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,695
The numbers we've heard on this very

306
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,743
Ben said about half the department lab

307
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,791
Dominic thinks it was even higher

308
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,071
I would guess

309
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,863
That in his first

310
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:57,631
4 years

311
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,399
Police chief

312
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,423
We had about a 7

313
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,191
25%

314
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:01,983
People just

315
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:06,335
Left and went other departments couldn't take his his overall thinking

316
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,615
Out of the box thinking

317
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,431
Abandoned

318
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,479
And eventually says ink is low

319
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:16,831
Take over as the chief of a police department in Stamford

320
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:17,599
Connecticut

321
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:22,463
You know there's some talk that. He was actually kind of encouraged to leave

322
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,255
And not long after you left

323
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:27,327
Department switch back to the traditional uniform Style

324
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:30,143
Does angus passed away in 1980

325
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:34,239
The year that has anchors join the Menlo Park

326
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,007
Park Police

327
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,287
19 6

328
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,103
68 represented an important Turning Point

329
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,895
For law enforcement in the US

330
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,455
The community policing approach

331
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,479
Champion device

332
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:48,319
Would continue to gain traction through the 80s and 90s

333
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,879
Departments across the country tried to build

334
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:53,439
Better less combative relationship

335
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,719
What's with their local community

336
00:14:55,743 --> 00:15:00,607
But there had always been a tension between the more community-oriented side of policing

337
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,887
And the more military song

338
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,191
And that was about to intensify

339
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:11,871
In recent years crime in this country has grown nine times as fast as population

340
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:16,735
At the current rate the crimes of violence in America will double by 1972

341
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:19,807
We cannot accept that kind of future for Honor

342
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,343
In 1968

343
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:25,439
Richard Nixon ran for president on a promise of Law & Order

344
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:31,071
Captain to all the paranoia and unease that had grown during the turmoil of the 19th

345
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:35,167
The campaign ads were full of the scary images

346
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,191
Urban unrest

347
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,215
Myoden

348
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,007
Amended with his slogan

349
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,031
Written across the

350
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:40,799
The screen

351
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:43,615
Vote like your whole world depended on

352
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,151
I pledge to you

353
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:49,503
The wave of crime is not going to be the wave of the future in America

354
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:56,671
Shortly after taking office Nixon vowed to fight the war on crime

355
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:59,743
Which had been started by his predecessor Lyndon Johnson

356
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:02,559
He also declared a War on Drugs

357
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:05,631
Again criminal justice Professor Chad pozek

358
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:08,447
One I think the language is very important

359
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,215
Right

360
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,239
You don't have

361
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,775
Drug prevention

362
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,311
Or crime prevention

363
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,591
It's the war

364
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:15,871
War on Drugs

365
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:19,455
The war on crime so you do see an escalation during the

366
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,991
This time I'm how

367
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,527
Crimes responded to in

368
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,551
Just responded to

369
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,599
Like they're responding to war

370
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:29,695
Warrior course requires specialized

371
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:32,255
And around the same time

372
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,791
The government established

373
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,071
Law enforcement

374
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,607
Assistance Administration

375
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:40,703
A now-defunct federal agency that gave lots of money to local

376
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,727
Police Department

377
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,775
So they could buy a newfangled

378
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:44,543
Crime-fighting

379
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:47,103
UCS up ticket and it's

380
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,127
Support for

381
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:52,735
All sorts of policing but especially riot gear in SWAT team

382
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,807
Armoured vehicles and weapons

383
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,343
Bulletproof ass in those types

384
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:01,183
Something even small ruled Apartments were getting their hands on stuff

385
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,207
Like helicopters

386
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:04,255
Serious crowd control gear

387
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,535
Mike Shields and helmet

388
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:08,607
A new paramilitary divisions of the police

389
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:09,631
Like SWAT team

390
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,167
Begin using this

391
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:16,031
Some exchange the traditional blue uniform for camouflage outfit

392
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,055
Known as

393
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,079
The battle dress

394
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,639
Baby come to look normal

395
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,967
As it's kind of equipment and style spread

396
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,783
So did more militarized policing tok

397
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,831
Conducting raids

398
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,623
Crackdown

399
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:31,647
And

400
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:34,719
Partially enforcing laws and their behind the mask

401
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:36,511
But they wear in riot gear

402
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:40,351
How are the big huge vest that they wear in the SWAT team

403
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:44,447
This trend continued to the 80's and 90's and lots of police

404
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,727
Departments across the country

405
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:52,383
Accelerated in many places after 9/11 as police department's became closer with federal law enforcement

406
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,431
Agencies and started thinking of themselves

407
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,223
Part of the first line of defense

408
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,247
Get a new war

409
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,039
The war on terror

410
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:04,159
New federal programs emerge that sends Surplus military equipment from Iraq and Afghanistan

411
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:06,463
Two local police departments across the country

412
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,023
Which brings us to today

413
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:25,919
Across the country there been highly publicized protests

414
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:28,223
Against police shootings of unarmed

415
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:28,991
Black men

416
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:34,367
And these protests have spark bigger conversation

417
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,647
About police violence

418
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,695
And also how are police

419
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:44,351
For several nights this week this was Ferguson Missouri

420
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,119
Hey

421
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,679
Combat gear assault rifles

422
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,519
It look like a military operation

423
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:59,455
The current mistrust of police seems to me or what was going on in Menlo Park

424
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:01,503
Back in 1968

425
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,271
Pre Blazer

426
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,319
But on a more dramatic

427
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,087
Scale

428
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:10,975
Back in the 1960s it was big conversations about the role of police and the community

429
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:14,303
That led Chiefs to think is to make changes to the memo

430
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,071
Park uniform

431
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:19,423
Today at least so far no departments have taken steps

432
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,191
That drastic

433
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,471
But in Minneapolis

434
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,263
For taking a small step

435
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,543
In that general direction

436
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:28,895
Minneapolis

437
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:29,663
Appear less than

438
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,431
Imitating

439
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:32,223
February 26th

440
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,527
The Minneapolis Police Department

441
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,575
Change the color of their SWAT unit

442
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:41,439
From a military green to a more traditional navy blue

443
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:46,047
This happened about four months after the city saw widespread

444
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:46,815
Protest

445
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:50,399
After the police shot and killed an unarmed black man

446
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,679
Name Jamar Clark

447
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:55,775
The Minneapolis Police Department declined to talk with us about the uniform chain

448
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:59,103
But they made it clear in other interviews that this color change

449
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,639
Is about public perception

450
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,663
And rebranding

451
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,991
We are police we are not military we don't train with the military

452
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,783
We're not associated with military

453
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,343
Weather Minneapolis Police Department and

454
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,159
We want to be reflective of our own community on our own

455
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:12,927
Image

456
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:17,279
What's not totally clear is if the color of the uniform

457
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,303
Actually matters

458
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:21,631
And

459
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,655
Rubber bullets

460
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,679
And me

461
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,471
Brain teasers

462
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,751
And everything else

463
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,287
This is Candice Montgomery

464
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:33,151
She's an activist with black lives matter and she's taking part in protests in Minneapolis

465
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:39,039
A color is not going to change that Dynamic and entire overhaul of the policing

466
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:39,807
System

467
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:42,879
Is going to change that Dynamic and people's responses

468
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:51,839
Of course the problems we are facing today can't be solved by uniform change alone but a change in uniform

469
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:56,703
Can be an important symbol away from police departments to signal to their communities

470
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:58,751
But they want to have a better relationship

471
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:05,151
In the case of cheese does Angus in Menlo Park do uniform experiment did help lead to bigger

472
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,175
Changes

473
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:11,807
Requiring officers to wear Blazers a certain kind of officer was drawn to the police.

474
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:14,879
The kind who was willing to get on board

475
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:18,464
The more significant reforms that says Angus wanted to make

476
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:22,816
And even though the department eventually abandoned the Blazers

477
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,864
Many of the other changes.

478
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:27,168
Here's former Menlo Park

479
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:27,936
Assistant chief

480
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:28,960
Dominick peluso

481
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,776
Dick was definitely ahead of his time

482
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,312
And you know

483
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:35,616
With most people who are ahead of their time

484
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:39,968
You don't have a crowd of people that all kind of stand up and cheer for you

485
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:42,272
But it would be very interesting because

486
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:44,576
Within it 10 or 15 years

487
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,112
Almost every police

488
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:47,648
Department in our area

489
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:54,304
Even though they didn't change the uniform or the titles of the organizational chart we're taking on that real big

490
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,072
Community

491
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:55,840
Bellissima

492
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:59,680
It went ahead and did it take us that was a sign of the times

493

Oakland California

501

Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices

502
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:46,272
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

503
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,296
If

504
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:53,696
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife is

00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,432
Turn the living room lights on

511
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:15,968
Okay

512
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:18,016
Dim the living room lights to 50

80%

514
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:20,576
Okay

515
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:26,976
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

516
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:29,792
Makes for a much more natural experience

517
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,840
Turn the living room lights on

518
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:35,936
Dim the living room lights to 50%
