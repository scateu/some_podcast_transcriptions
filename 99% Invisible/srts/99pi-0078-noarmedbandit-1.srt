Each episode of Family ghosts takes a look at the story behind a different person's family lore

11
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:39,936
Digging into unanswered questions about their history

Every house is haunted

18
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,328
This is 99% invisible

19
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,352
I'm Roman Mars

20
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:14,752
Americans have always had an uneasy relationship

21
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:15,520
Gambling

22
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:18,080
Does circumvent anti-gambling laws in the US

23
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:24,480
Early slot machines masqueraded as vending machine for a trade machine

24
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:28,832
Machine Head to obscure its true intent

25
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,880
Cherries and lemons and oranges

26
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:35,744
On the reals and they would offer prizes like chewing gum or other treats

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,792
That you would then have to redeem for

28
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,328
Cache Lake tickets

29
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,096
Chuck-E-Cheese

30
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,912
So it was almost like laundering it back

31
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:43,680
Into money

32
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:48,288
Many slot machines have retained the fruit symbols to this day in the UK there actual

33
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:50,336
Call fruit machines because of this

34
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:55,200
What is a carryover from that era the new Universal bar symbol

35
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:59,040
What's I always thought represented stacks of bars of gold

36
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,320
Has a similar origin

37
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:06,208
The bar symbol is actually based on the logo of the Bell fruitgum company

38
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:09,280
I'm talking with the Tasha doll show

39
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:10,816
My name is no

40
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,096
Natasha. Shull

41
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:12,864
And I'm

42
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,912
Associate professor at MIT

43
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,704
And the title of my book

44
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,544
Is addiction by Design machine gambling in Las Vegas

45
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:23,360
You can probably picture of slot machine pretty easily

46
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,896
The image we have

47
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,432
That we carry around in our minds

48
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,456
The slot machine

49
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:30,784
It's pretty much the same machine that came out in 1895

50
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,064
3 reels

51
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,344
Mechanical reels

52
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,368
Spin

53
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,648
You

54
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,720
Are playing two light up symbols across one line

55
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:39,744
The one bar

56
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,536
And to get the machine

57
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,328
Play you're putting in coins

58
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:45,888
And then you're reaching up with your arm and

59
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:46,656
Pulling this

60
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,424
Lever

61
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,472
So it's a very mechanical interaction

62
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,496
This is the

63
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,032
The famous one-armed band

64
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:02,528
Today if you walk into a casino you may still see those levers

65
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,064
But they have a new name

66
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,088
Legacy

67
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,160
Is there basically just there

68
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,208
To invoke that bygone

69
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,744
Mission mechanical

70
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,768
Machine

71
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:15,584
Attract us over we recognize it

72
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:21,216
Pull the lever but we very quickly realize after sitting down at it's a lot faster and more efficient

73
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,776
Ultimately less fatigue

74
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,312
For sitting there for a while

75
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,080
Depressed

76
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:28,128
The buttons or in some cases to

77
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:30,944
To touch the screen a classic skeuomorph

78
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:34,272
The physical machine the hardware that you're interacting with

79
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,808
Has really shifted

80
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,160
Skill morphs are design elements that are retained as an ornament

81
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:43,744
Past the point where they serve any meaningful function

82
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,280
Slot machines

83
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,072
Yuan morphic

84
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:47,840
Champion

85
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:52,192
Is there lousy with design elements that make you feel like you're interacting

86
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:55,008
Play trustworthy mechanical objects

87
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,056
It's not just the Legacy love

88
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,872
It's also the screen you're looking at

89
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:00,896
So this is

90
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,944
Typically now a video screen

91
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,968
Rather than

92
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,248
Mechanical

93
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,528
3 wheel setup

94
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,344
Some of these video machines however

95
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,624
Try to

96
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,648
Make us

97
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,184
We're playing

98
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,976
Mechanical machine

99
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:19,071
Analog to Ching Ching to them

100
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,863
Military

101
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,143
A visual

102
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,935
Mapping technology is

103
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:27,775
Is used it's like this three-layer plasma screen

104
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:34,175
There are actual real spinning their blank and what's happening is there's a video projection onto them

105
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,967
So it's not like they're marked

106
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:37,247
Actual symbol

107
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:41,087
The symbol that appear can just be changed up there's lots of little tricks

108
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:44,159
Which designers try to get us to

109
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,207
Field we are still playing

110
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:49,023
An analog mechanical device

111
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:54,911
According to CBS News Americans now spend more money on slot machines than movies

112
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,703
Baseball and theme parks

113
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:57,983
Combine

114
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,287
But this wasn't always

115
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,055
Insta case

116
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,847
These were seen as

117
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,639
Really just

118
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,431
Frivolous little devices

119
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,223
That were there tok

120
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:08,991
Skip I

121
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,015
The wives

122
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:13,087
Of the real gamblers or occupied people in

123
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:13,855
Transitional

124
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,903
This is why they were waiting on line

125
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:18,463
Hallways are around the fringes of the main

126
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:19,743
Gambling

127
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:20,511
Pit

128
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:25,375
So they didn't tend to have stools much less the precise ergonomic seating that they have today

129
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,911
They weren't destination

130
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:27,679
They were really

131
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,703
Transitional device

132
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:29,983
But not anymore

133
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:33,055
And then there is this historical Association in this car

134
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,847
Between women

135
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,895
Particularly older women nowadays

136
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,431
Any slot

137
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:41,759
So in every way these machines are thought of as

138
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,807
Light a light for me

139
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:46,111
Gambling in the real irony there is that

140
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:51,999
These machines that anyone can a very approachable you don't have to know the rules you have to be wearing this

141
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:52,767
Suits

142
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,375
Or interact with other people and some intimidating way the irony is that

143
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,911
They are the most

144
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,191
Potent if you want to

145
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:00,959
Use that word

146
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,239
In terms of

147
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,031
How addicting they are

148
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,055
It's been shown that

149
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,103
You got problematically

150
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,639
Involved with these devices

151
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,919
Three to four times

152
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:10,687
Who's faster than

153
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:11,455
Then you would

154
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,735
At the racetrack

155
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,527
Playing card game

156
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:17,855
Problematically involved is my new favorite you

157
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:22,207
Despite the slot machines very familiar appearance

158
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:25,023
This is a device that has evolved dramatically

159
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,327
One goal in mind

160
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,911
The keep you playing that machine

161
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,959
Especially people who don't play these machines

162
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,239
Assumption

163
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,103
People must be playing these machines especially the people who play them a lot

164
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,383
Because they want to win

165
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,455
Caesar

166
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:45,759
Poor people who don't understand

167
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,039
How probability work

168
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,343
They're not rational if only they could

169
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,903
Educated they make these proper

170
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,183
Consumer decision

171
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:59,071
But in fact if you talk to a lot of these gamblers they are incredibly Savvy they're not dupes

172
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,863
They know they're not going to win

173
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,423
I know that they say doing a jackpot

174
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,727
That means they'll just sit there longer

175
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,751
Play it off

176
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,799
So it's not really about winning

177
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,591
It's about getting into

178
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,615
Vizio

179
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:17,247
Everything else Falls away a sense of

180
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:20,063
Monetary value X

181
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:20,831
Space

182
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:21,855
Even a sense of

183
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:22,623
Self

184
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,647
Is annihilated

185
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:24,671
Stream

186
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,951
Forum

187
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:32,095
That you enter there was one moment in trolls research for the whole concept of the Zone really sunk in for her

188
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,631
She was talking with a gambler

189
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,167
She said you know I

190
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,471
Sometimes I have to say that again

191
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:41,567
The sense of frustration irritation when I win a jack

192
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,847
Pot because it just

193
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:43,871
Freezes at my

194
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,919
Wow I just want to continue playing

195
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:51,295
I witness this in a casino in the player wins and as the credits are accruing Thing ending meaning

196
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,063
They're just

197
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,599
Continuing the

198
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,671
Phone that's been button they just can't wait to hit it again

199
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:59,743
So there's this design imperative to overcome the

200
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:00,767
Problem of interrupt

201
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,815
Can I design imperative to overcome

202
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:03,839
The players

203
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:04,607
Problem

204
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,143
With winning

205
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,447
And you know the gambling industry

206
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,983
How did own way of

207
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:10,751
Freezing moo

208
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,775
They're aware

209
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,055
Of this Zone

210
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,847
Sometimes they call it a Zone

211
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:18,431
They also have a term that they played when players

212
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,967
Spore jackpot players

213
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,247
And then there's

214
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,783
Play to win to play play

215
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:26,111
Otherwise known as time on device players

216
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,903
It shows book tracks this

217
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,439
Sea change in the gambling in this

218
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,975
Straight away from jackpot

219
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:32,511
And towards

220
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,047
Time on device play

221
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,631
So this is not play where you go in and you're excited

222
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,679
And you're out to get this

223
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,447
Forex

224
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,983
Thrill from Big Win

225
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:45,055
Or from the industry side you're not out

226
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:45,823
To certify

227
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:48,895
Fleece someone and take all their money right away and then

228
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,687
Get them off the machine so you can

229
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,967
Take someone else's money

230
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,759
This is more about profit

231
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,807
From volume ideas that

232
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:58,367
Gamblers want to sit there longer

233
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,415
And the industry has realized

234
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,951
Prophet really isn't about the

235
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:02,975
The price of play

236
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,255
It's about the volume

237
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,023
Play

238
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,303
Once you understand that

239
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:10,143
It begins to make a lot more sense why Penny machines machines played

240
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,167
With a denomination

241
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,191
$0.01

242
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,983
Are generating higher profit

243
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,543
Then any other machine today

244
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,847
It asked industry

245
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,383
A decade ago

246
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,711
What's going to become a penny machines they would have laughed

247
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,247
Is it that stage

248
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,527
Nickel machines

249
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,575
Considered they were really mock

250
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,879
Daz games you'd only find in

251
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:31,647
Grindr

252
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,183
But if we look

253
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,207
Closely at

254
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,999
Some technological advances

255
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,559
That certain makers

256
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,583
Hit upon

257
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,863
You started to realize

258
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:41,887
Aha

259
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:42,911
If we

260
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:43,935
Take the bet

261
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,727
And we break it down

262
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,007
Into pennies

263
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,287
Find ways with

264
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,567
Computer algorithm

265
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,103
Inside the machine

266
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:55,199
Stand betting over a longer period we can ultimately make

267
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,479
More money

268
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,575
To the lights in the soundtrack to you

269
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:03,647
The casino atmospherics draw you in

270
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,927
Hiragana exceed

271
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,207
Keep you comfortable

272
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,767
The max bet and spin buttons

273
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:14,143
Don't even require you to move your hand from its resting position

274
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,935
The reset screen

275
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:18,495
Pulls you into your own private world

276
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,031
And you enter

277
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,567
The zone

278
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,871
But what's going to keep you playing

279
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,151
Is the math

280
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,199
And that's really the revolution

281
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,991
Video slots

282
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,527
And the math

283
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:32,063
And that's the term industry uses

284
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,599
Has gotten very

285
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,367
Complicate

286
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,439
If you imagine

287
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,487
Our friend the old one arm bandit

288
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:40,767
You had these

289
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,815
3 reels with symbols on them

290
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,887
And you were betting on lining up

291
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,935
One single line

292
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,215
Symbols across

293
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,031
Now even on mechanical machines

294
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,567
Designers

295
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,103
Quickly found creative ways

296
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,383
Is to add another line

297
00:10:56,895 --> 00:11:03,039
Play so usually when you see the real you can serve see the line above in the line.

298
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:07,647
The Genius of showing extra lines above and below the winning line

299
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,183
Is that it introduces

300
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,975
The near-miss phenomenon

301
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,023
It's that feeling that you

302
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,559
Almost one

303
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,607
When you see that winning symbol

304
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:19,679
So close on that adjacent line

305
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:24,031
But the extra lines are also available for placing extra bets

306
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,567
So the idea was

307
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:29,151
Let's let people bet on three lines

308
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,455
Instead of

309
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,247
Yeah1 token they can buy

310
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,063
M-43

311
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:39,135
So you did see these early multicoin game

312
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:43,999
There was limits to them because there isn't there's really a limit when you're talking about

313
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,303
Mechanical reels to how many

314
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,839
Symbols you can fit

315
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:52,191
On the screen but then video technology came along and slot machines

316
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:54,239
Could do whatever the designer one

317
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,799
So you started seeing this progression

318
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:59,359
From not just lying

319
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,895
You had even your

320
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,199
Your two diagonals from the corners of the sea

321
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:03,967
Screen.

322
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,503
Then you started seeing

323
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:09,343
What's a Dexter Real let's add 5 6 7 reels

324
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,111
The cross

325
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,903
And let's add

326
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,439
Zig zags

327
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:17,279
You know weird directions

328
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:20,095
So it's difficult today to see

329
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,119
25th

330
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,911
100 line games

331
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:30,335
And it gets so complicated it begins to get really hard to tell if you even one or not the on-screen Graphics have to draw

332
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,359
All the lines for you

333
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:36,223
Some machines have even gone so far as to do away with lining up altogether

334
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:38,527
They have what's called scatter play

335
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:42,879
So it's really quite random you're no longer playing to line up that one

336
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,415
Line of symbols across

337
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,207
Which is insane

338
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:49,535
That's all going on what's going on here

339
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,839
What's significant about that

340
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,887
Is this you're playing on a penny machine

341
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,447
You decide that you're going to bet

342
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,239
Penny per line

343
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:01,055
So that's that would be 100 pennies

344
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,079
The dollar

345
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:02,847
In fact

346
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,895
You can Max it out and bat

347
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,175
3 pennies

348
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:06,943
Pro-Line

349
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:11,039
So in fact you're making $3 a bat that's quite

350
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:14,879
You know when quarter players started disappearing

351
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,159
1 videos

352
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:16,927
Came out

353
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,719
Researchers were sent on to

354
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:24,863
1600 floors to find out what quarter players going are they migrating $2 as we thought they would

355
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:28,703
No they were kind of regressing back to nickel machines

356
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,495
But in the end they were actually

357
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,823
They were betting more per hand

358
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:34,847
Then they had

359
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:35,615
Quarter machine

360
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:41,247
So the question is why would a gambler do that the slots are more appealing because they take more coins

361
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,527
Here's the real trick

362
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:45,343
When your bedding 300 pennies

363
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,879
100 line

364
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,183
You're going to win back

365
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,463
A portion of those

366
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:52,511
For the first time in history

367
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:56,607
You're not betting a token and then losing it all

368
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,399
Ore doubling at AAA

369
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,703
That's a really volatile set up

370
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:06,079
This is much less volatile you're spreading your bed across a hundred lines

371
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:09,407
It's really a lot safer if you want to see it that way

372
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:13,503
Because chances are you're going to win back something on some of those lines

373
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:17,087
And it just so happens that these machines are designed

374
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,623
When you win back

375
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,391
Something

376
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:23,743
To give you all the winning stimuli that comes along with a real win

377
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,071
One researcher has aptly called this

378
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,607
A false twin

379
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:33,983
Or losses disguised as wins

380
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,543
Quote-unquote winning 9

381
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,591
That's a pretty radical

382
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,615
Net loss

383
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,151
But yet

384
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,455
There's little videos that are being played

385
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:45,759
It's virtually no difference

386
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,039
Then when you really do

387
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,903
Another key factor in making Penny machines possible

388
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,695
And all their little micro bats

389
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:57,535
Are updates and how the player feeds money into the machine

390
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,327
Yeah this is a huge

391
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,095
Part of it

392
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:03,679
Alongside the ergonomics of the chairs and the

393
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,959
Changes in the

394
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:07,775
Responsibilities of the buttons and how they're placed

395
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,335
The financial access

396
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,103
Knology

397
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,919
If you think about the past

398
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:18,271
If you ran out of money and you wanted to continue to play at a machine

399
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:21,599
There was a lot of steps you had to you really had to work for it

400
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:24,927
You had to leave your machine maybe wouldn't be there when you got back

401
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,207
Someone to hold it

402
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:29,023
Search

403
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:33,119
Get some cash had to search out a cashier's cage or

404
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,911
A roving chained attendance

405
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:41,567
Buy these coins return to a machine open the coins and put them in one by one that was very low

406
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:42,335
Labor intense

407
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:45,151
And then imagine feeding in 300 pennies

408
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,247
What would take

409
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:53,087
22 credit play bill acceptors

410
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,903
Are you got these little digital monitors where

411
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:00,767
It wasn't exactly telling you how much money was in the machine it was telling you how many credit

412
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:05,375
So already there with Bill acceptors you saw it kind of turned toward

413
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,655
Credit play with

414
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:09,215
Really dematerialize the money

415
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:11,775
Made it less real somehow and allowed you to

416
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:14,847
Get in that zone disconnected you again from

417
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:19,711
The everyday world is a lot of machine gambling uses these player reward card

418
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:21,247
Mature essentially

419
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,271
Credit cards

420
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:25,087
The casino sets up for you where you store credit

421
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:29,183
Casino and see people that their seemingly

422
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:32,255
Connected to these machines almost like life support with

423
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,303
Plastic bungee cords

424
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:40,191
That are attached to their car so they won't forget them and lose them there so you look down a whole line and everyone

425
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:42,495
Attached

426
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:44,287
Rote

427
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:49,151
But ticket in ticket out technology where you're playing with these barcoded tickets

428
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:51,199
And player cards

429
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:55,039
We're really necessary piece of the technological puzzle

430
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,063
4 pennies

431
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,343
To come on the scene

432
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,391
With multi-line

433
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:07,327
And this design evolution is the reason why slot machines are the most profitable form of gambling even though there is no

434
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,095
What's going bald

435
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,375
And the player

436
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:13,215
Doesn't even know the odds of winning for any given machine

437
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:22,943
Machine technician understand more about the

438
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,735
Machine that I thought it would be

439
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:30,879
A good part of my recovery from the addiction because I thought if I understand how these machines work

440
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,927
The spell will be broken

441
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,975
And she said he don't even after I was

442
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:37,791
Putting machines together and designing

443
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,071
Work

444
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,607
On my lunch break

445
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,399
I would just go down the street

446
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,423
Play the exact

447
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:46,495
Because that is how addiction works

448
00:17:54,943 --> 00:18:01,087
99% invisible in Sam Greenspan and me Roman Mars where project of 91.7

449
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:04,415
Local public radio kalw in San Francisco

450
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:06,975
And the American Institute of Architects in San Francisco

451
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:12,607
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices

452
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:16,191
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man made sound

453
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,215
If

454
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:23,615
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife isn't

455
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:29,503
Technology talk to us

456
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,551
It is a creation of Sonic trash

457
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,623
That's Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

458
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:38,207
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

459
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:40,255
To make them more human

460
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:44,095
Turn the living room lights on

461
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:45,887
Okay

Dim the living room lights to 50%

463
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:50,495
Okay

464
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:56,639
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

465
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:59,711
Makes for a much more natural experience

466
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,503
Turn the living room lights on

467
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,855
Dim the living room lights to 50%

Before we go I want to tell you about the body genius a five-part series from fellow radiotopia show the truth

485
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,223
The body genius is a Dark comic mystery

486
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:39,551
That whines through a treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

490
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:52,351
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

491
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:56,703
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like a dad

492
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:01,055
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

493
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:05,407
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main guy to know how to do that kind

494
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:11,807
I think a few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action

00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:25,888
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it now I need to

498
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:27,168
To clear my name

499
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:33,568
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes to find them
