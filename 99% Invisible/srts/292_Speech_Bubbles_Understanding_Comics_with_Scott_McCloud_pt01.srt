I'm Roman Mars

26
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:30,624
And this is Scott McCloud

27
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:36,256
My name is Scott McCloud I'm a cartoonist and author and I've been making comics for a few decades now

28
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:40,608
Probably best known for non fiction Comics especially book called understanding comics

29
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:43,680
Where I explain how Comics work in comics form

30
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:49,568
Also done fiction work and I have a lot of different interests and I'm very easily

31
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:52,128
Scott's book understanding comics

32
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,920
Which is 25 years old this year

33
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:58,528
Is a seminal deconstruction of comics as an art form and mode of communication

34
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:04,928
A little cartoon Scott jumps between panels of the 215 page book explaining how pictures and words and

35
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:05,696
Combination

36
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:09,280
Create a new language for telling stories and describing the world

37
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:14,400
The book was the culmination of a bunch of ideas that have been swirling around Scott's head

38
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,168
4 years

39
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:21,568
Everybody knew or they thought they knew what Comics were and it was a very limiting idea and I see video

40
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:27,712
Go games and other media dealing with the same problem today maybe than podcast is that dead people have

41
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:29,760
Had this idea the comics were just

42
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,040
Four Color

43
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,320
Cheaply printed

44
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,600
Cheaply made

45
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:37,184
Comics Batman almost all superheroes are funny animals

46
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,232
But they were disposable entertainment

47
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:44,096
That night of the writing nor the art was anything that was going to last to be significant

48
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:46,912
I need to know I saw a lot of comics that

49
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,680
You know

50
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:51,264
Conform to that definition I mean there were certainly plenty of Bad Comics out there

51
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:57,664
To me it was just an art form it was an art form that was capable of so much more and I felt like

52
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,016
The first step was wiping the Slate clean and trying to

53
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,552
Approach it from

54
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:08,672
Almost there clinical value-neutral sort of standpoint where she's like what what are the essential elements

55
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:12,000
Any essential elements of comics or just putting one picture after another

56
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:18,144
And substituting space for time you just saying it as you move from one space to the next you're moving for one moment to the next

57
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:25,056
And that idea to me had just Limitless applications and it drew boundary around a continent

58
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:27,872
And two possibilities that as far as I was concerned we'd only just

59
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,408
Began to explore

60
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,456
When you wipe the Slate clean

61
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,992
Started with

62
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:37,344
Anew definition, or at least you know a refined definition of comics

63
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:43,744
Can you rattle it off the top of your head what the definition was from the book

64
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,512
You know

65
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:51,680
My mentor will Eisner head use the term sequential art night and I said you know for the most part most 90%

66
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,984
I have the time you can just say sequential art people get it

67
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,032
But then right away they'll say things

68
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:58,336
Well what about animation and sequential art

69
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:03,968
So I had to come up with the longer definition that erases many loopholes as possible and what I came up with Wiz

70
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:07,296
Juxtaposed pictorial in other images in deliberate sequence

71
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:12,416
Just for fun I got that you know like like

72
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,208
Really narrow it down

73
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:17,024
Just in case you didn't fully absorbed that definition it's

74
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,583
Juxtaposed pictorial and other images

75
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,863
In deliberate sequence

76
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,143
Some people thought that

77
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:28,799
You know we had to stop calling them comics and start calling them juxtaposed pictorial and other images in philibert Seacrest

78
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:33,663
That's it you just you do that once and then you go back to calling them comics

79
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,199
People put a lot of value on label

80
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:37,759
And and a lot of folks

81
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:40,831
You know they got all up in arms that although they're calling them graph

82
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:41,599
Novels

83
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,879
Kaiser putting on airs

84
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:45,183
No no no you can call it, except

85
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:45,951
If you want

86
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,487
I was just saying that

87
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:49,535
That you know comic Sweeney

88
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,351
To allow the words take on new meanings

89
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,399
And every art form has different modes of

90
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:58,751
The dress right you can read about something in film comment and then you can go to

91
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,311
To be Academy of Motion Pictures to

92
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,847
CD awards ceremony

93
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,919
And then you can go out and see a movie the next day

94
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:08,991
You're using these different words has different ways of

95
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,015
Illuminating

96
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,831
The different functions the different styles the different

97
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,111
Moods that

98
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,391
That come out of that art form

99
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,415
But

100
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:18,719
It's okay you can still call the movie 2

101
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,487
You can still call them

102
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,791
What term do you like

103
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:25,887
I Like Comics because actually I think it's fairly dry I think that

104
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,423
It's been a long time since

105
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:31,519
People thought that all Comics have to be funny when I was growing up there

106
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:36,895
Everybody assumed that all Comics were muscle-bound guys in skin-tight suits beating the crap out of each other

107
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:37,919
So

108
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:41,247
So we'd already lost the original meaning

109
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:44,831
And that that render to Justice try little bundle of sticks

110
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,391
Collection of phonemes

111
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,951
That you could pretty much stuff any mean

112
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,999
And also it's quick

113
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,535
It short two syllable

114
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:59,679
So if I were to pick up a comic book or turn to the comic section of the newspaper

115
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,215
Are there certain things

116
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:05,823
That you could teach me like how to decode comics in a certain way that

117
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:11,455
Like guy you tell me like all the artist is trying to do this when they do this what a little of take-home

118
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,991
Facts about

119
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,783
Decoding comic

120
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,343
Well the first thing of the universe

121
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,647
That is if you're looking at a comic strip

122
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,415
Comic book

123
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,439
Graphic novel

124
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,231
There few things everybody has

125
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:25,535
To do whether they want to or not these are the

126
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,559
Obligatory

127
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,375
Decisions that they all make

128
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,167
And where the first decisions they make

129
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,959
Is choosing their moment

130
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,495
No matter what

131
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,287
You're breaking the world into Moana

132
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:40,383
And it's a non-trivial problem as an engineer with

133
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,175
I'm not son of an engineer

134
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,455
And

135
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,735
Eat up because

136
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:47,551
If you think about it any kind of narrative that you want to tell

137
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,831
Can be broken down

138
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,367
In an infinite number of ways

139
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:53,439
You know I could do a 10000 panel graph

140
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,207
Novel

141
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:57,791
Of me taking a spoonful of cereal from a bowl

142
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,095
And just lifting up timeout

143
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:03,679
If you want I could just break it down by microseconds by nanosec

144
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:06,495
Or I could do you a 2 panel sequence

145
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,287
Of the entire history of the universe

146
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,079
Big Bang heat death

147
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,359
You're done

148
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:16,735
So that means that you you can slice up anyway you like and yet if I asked you

149
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,527
Hey what did you do yesterday

150
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,343
There's a part of your mind that immediately

151
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,879
Leverages this tremendous

152
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,159
Neural horsepower

153
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,463
2 deciding what matters

154
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:31,327
You know we have these wonderful saliency filters that choose the moments quite natural

155
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,119
And Mouse cartoons choose them

156
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:36,703
Pretty naturally they know once I have a story to tell they know what moments matter

157
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,519
But they have to make that decision even if they're not making it

158
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,287
Consciously

159
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,335
And then from that point

160
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,359
You have to choose the

161
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,127
The angles

162
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:44,895
What's the framing

163
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:48,735
How close are you going to get to that thing you want to show how far away are you going to

164
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,503
What angular

165
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,551
Is it going to be warm side view Eagles View

166
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:55,135
Are you going to have to establish the Same by plant way back

167
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,183
And then all those decisions about

168
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,207
How you draw the

169
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:01,791
How do you draw so it's recognizable how do you draw so it's a

170
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:04,095
Expressive how do you draw it so that

171
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,631
It's visually interest

172
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,447
How do you balance out Dynamics versus

173
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,471
It's Clarity Olive

174
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:14,847
And then of course the mixture of words and pictures and the way it flows and it's just

175
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,663
It's an endless series of decisions but these are decisions

176
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,431
We all

177
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,223
Make whether we do them cons

178
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:23,807
Through every medium has its strengths and weaknesses

179
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,367
And your mind we're the best kind of ideas that

180
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:29,695
Comics are best at conveying and it may be what are some ideas for

181
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,487
Hardest to convey in,

182
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:36,351
When it comes to visual explanations I found it, it's a really good at

183
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,119
The intro

184
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:42,495
When you getting time to a really granular level like for instance if you want to choose Comics to it

185
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,519
Explain the latest

186
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:44,543
Congressional

187
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,591
Budget bill or something like that

188
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:49,407
That can be a problem because they're time-intensive

189
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,687
So long time to

190
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:53,247
Put them together and something like that is better intact

191
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,295
But if you wanted to explain

192
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,831
In a particle physics

193
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,111
Swore

194
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,903
Some you know engineering

195
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,975
Principal or something like that something that's going to stick around

196
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,767
It's a Wonderful entry

197
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,047
Almost any subject

198
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,583
And I've done a bunch of things like that

199
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,863
That I recently did a

200
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,399
A comic explaining

201
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,935
Kubernetes which is

202
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,751
This was for Google it's it's a way of

203
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:18,335
Orchestrating containerized applications if that's something you're

204
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,615
Planning to do tomorrow

205
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:22,687
There's a comic going to explain how to do that

206
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:26,015
So what I'm able to do is I'm able to lay out the map

207
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,807
I'm able to give you a sense that

208
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:31,135
Yeah this is what the neighborhood looks like this is how everything is interrelated

209
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,927
This is the shape

210
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,207
Of the subject

211
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,255
Comics really good at that

212
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:40,095
But the flip side of what Comics are good at

213
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,631
It's tricky because

214
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,679
I'm always reluctant

215
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,447
2

216
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:49,311
To say that the medium is inherently good at something because that immediately Beggars the

217
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:52,895
Question as you've already asking what what's it maybe not so

218
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:57,247
And the thing is whenever I think Comics are not capable of something

219
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,783
Somebody always proves me

220
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,831
Wrong listen example of that

221
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:06,207
Would like hard math you know but some people have actually given it a running like where they use in comics to it

222
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:06,975
Explain

223
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:10,047
Mathematical Concepts something that I thought would probably

224
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,095
Dino Dan on starter

225
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,887
And it turns out.

226
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,703
You can give that a try

227
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:17,983
And

228
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,543
And of course when I began

229
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,847
It was all superheroes it was all suspect

230
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,151
Sensationalism

231
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:28,991
And there were many people who felt the comics were inherently good at that

232
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,551
But pretty soon into my

233
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,087
Career even before I became a

234
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,111
MyCareer formerly

235
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,647
I discovered Japanese comics

236
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:38,207
They were doing comics about everything they were fishing,

237
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,487
Thermage on comics

238
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,767
There were comics about Romance

239
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,047
Answer comics about ninjas

240
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:44,095
It didn't matter they could be about any

241
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:48,191
But if you grew up in America you might mistakenly think

242
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:51,007
The medium was somehow built somehow

243
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,823
Inherently constructed in such a way

244
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,103
That

245
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:57,151
The love affair between comics and superheroes

246
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:01,759
Somehow inevitable just like in in 1962 somebody could think that

247
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,295
The love affair between

248
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,831
Movies and

249
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:05,855
Mpix

250
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,391
Espectacular music

251
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,159
What's an F

252
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,463
Wasn't

253
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:14,047
There's nothing that said that movies had to go in that direction it's just that

254
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,583
Just the cul-de-sac

255
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:16,863
The bay window

256
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:21,727
But I love to look at when it comes to this roof everyday objects at people very familiar with

257
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,775
Is I like to look at that man and

258
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:28,639
To recognize that they represent choices and maybe their choices so long ago

259
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,919
That we

260
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,967
Forget that they're even choices so

261
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,759
For example I was

262
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,783
Thinking about

263
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,807
The speech bubble

264
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:36,831
In the comic books

265
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,111
And realizing

266
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:41,439
That is if you really think about it

267
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,207
And

268
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:45,791
Other things like that that aren't these little revolutionary

269
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,839
Visual representations of things

270
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:51,423
That you could ever walk us through maybe who did them

271
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,471
When did this change

272
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:57,311
When did it go from being in the Box to being in the bubble Lena lick words

273
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,335
Anything about

274
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,615
The evolution of

275
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,639
Comics that

276
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,943
Represent these revolutionary little punctuated

277
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:08,575
Equilibriums but are so built into the way we perceive the world that we don't even recognize him as choices

278
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,623
I'm going to pull up 180 here and say that

279
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,159
Actually this is a good example

280
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,439
What's something that maybe isn't

281
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,231
To the medium is kind of an epic

282
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:20,351
When when you do something I'm one of those usually the first evidence is that it happened early

283
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:24,959
And speech bubbles happen as early as certain European broadsheets

284
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,287
And they are speech bubbles

285
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:30,335
There's no question about it

286
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:33,663
You know I could show you something from 1600 1500

287
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:38,271
Where are there in the shape of Scrolls but they are dialogue coming out of people's mouth

288
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:43,391
So as soon as you start squaring off things into panelboards which they were also doing in those days

289
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,927
Rectangular paddle board

290
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,719
Yeah you start to have that

291
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,487
Restart an speech

292
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,559
You can even save sort of equivalent things in things like

293
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,327
Pre-columbian

294
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,095
Germanic script

295
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,911
Some of the stuff I think there's some dialogue in the bayou

296
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,191
Tapestries

297
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:59,263
So yeah this was going to happen no matter what

298
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,031
Because

299
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:02,591
Dialog speech it's part of life

300
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:03,871
And anything that

301
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:06,431
Purports to represent life in any kind of art

302
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,455
Citic narrative medium

303
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:10,783
It's going to have to account for that and in some way shape or

304
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,551
Perform

305
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,599
That's it I think it's it's what

306
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:16,671
It is kind of what will eyes are called a desperation device

307
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,695
Bison in a sentence

308
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,487
Because we have a soundless medium

309
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,023
For most of our history

310
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,559
We were kind of stuck

311
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:25,119
And it does feel a little bit like a hack

312
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,655
I think there's a little part of

313
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,471
Every cartoon has heart sinks a little that

314
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:30,751
That we have to use the

315
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:34,847
Shape with voiceover in in movies

316
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:35,871
Yeah yeah

317
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:36,895
Yeah it feels

318
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:39,455
Feel like a cheat like you should go to show it and not tell her

319
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:42,527
It does it feels like a cheat and I think that's that's why

320
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,063
I think what Comics are

321
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:46,623
Silent when you have the silent

322
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,927
Sequence of some cartoons do nothing but I like

323
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,207
Most of us will do them

324
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:53,023
Occasionally it feels more like pure

325
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,327
Comics you know there's that little purest

326
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,375
Gene in each of us.

327
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:03,007
Rebels a little when we can dispense with not good news for writers

328
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:06,335
I love this term silent comics

329
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:12,735
It's so strange the Absurd it but I totally totally makes sense that it's

330
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,783
It's strange that you have this

331
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,575
Unitymedia

332
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,855
Presentation

333
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:22,975
That still feel so multimedia that we think of it as having sound and time and

334
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:23,999
Adept

335
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,071
Exactly we it's very easy to forget the

336
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:27,839
The comics is

337
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:28,607
This is relegated

338
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:29,887
It's just one of the five

339
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:32,959
Traditionally Porsche that's beginning to change a little

340
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,287
With various mutations online and one

341
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,055
Not that

342
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:42,687
Yeah it's it's strange because it didn't really doesn't feel that way it does feel multimedia and that's of course that's partially because

343
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,223
Many feel that it's this

344
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,503
Agglomeration of

345
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:50,111
Abortion pictures even though that tends to be true I don't think that is the essential

346
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,135
Show character comic

347
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,183
I just think of that out that is one of

348
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:53,951
Comics auction

349
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:56,255
But you can if you get some other comics

350
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,535
Scholar in here

351
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,303
To argue with me

352
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,679
Wetlands are certainly the most visible but

353
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,959
The other ones

354
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:08,543
I do find very interesting I talk in understanding comics about

355
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:11,359
Things like Sweat Beads and how you can

356
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:14,431
See the evolution of written language even in the

357
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,711
Pictorial symbols

358
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:17,503
And the fact that a sweat bee

359
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,039
Toriel symbol

360
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:23,391
They gradually drifted so that rather than a little sweat beat on cheek

361
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,951
You would see a sweat bee drawing beside a face

362
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:28,255
So that it began to emanate

363
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,023
From the face

364
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:31,583
To the extent that it became a symbol that simply

365
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,655
Indicated the interstate and now you can find manga

366
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,215
Where robots will have sweat bees

367
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:40,031
On the mend it's simply a signifier

368
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,055
Of emotion

369
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,847
And in a lot of ways.

370
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,639
Drift this exact same drift

371
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,663
You had too many

372
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,199
Pictorial base written language

373
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,503
Especially in the Far East wear

374
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:54,111
Something would begin as simply a drawing of a chair or a drawing of a horse

375
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,647
And that over

376
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,207
Decades or even centuries

377
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,743
Of writing they would

378
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,023
Become more and more abstract

379
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:01,791
That's exactly what

380
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:05,119
So if you were give you no

381
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,655
25 year

382
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,447
Post understanding syllabus

383
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:09,983
2

384
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,031
The listeners of 9 p.m.

385
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,335
What are the essential

386
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:15,871
Comics

387
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:20,735
Maybe it'll that show a change in form or something and kind of like what they are and

388
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:22,271
Just a little description of like

389
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:25,343
What is this doing that is particularly remarkable

390
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,111
All to you

391
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:26,879
If I just had a

392
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:27,903
Fu

393
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,951
I probably start with Chris where's

394
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:30,975
Building Story

395
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,255
Witches

396
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,303
A giant box like a Milton

397
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,839
Bradley gamebar

398
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,655
Which has comics in a million different shapes

399
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:41,727
Because at that definitely sets the mind going

400
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:45,311
I would throw in a couple of crazy webcomic

401
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,127
Where you can go in any direction

402
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:49,919
I would

403
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,223
Had at least one silent,

404
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,503
Jim Woodring

405
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,295
I would include

406
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,575
Persepolis

407
00:16:56,831 --> 00:17:00,927
Because I think persepolis really was a tuning fork for a lot that came after

408
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,951
In what way

409
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:06,815
What do you mean it in terms of boys as one of the beautiful things about Comics is the way

410
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,607
The comics can offer you

411
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,959
A very intimate and credible voice from somebody who could just be making it up

412
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:14,495
But you know that they're not

413
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:18,079
This is something that Comics journalist Joe Sacco

414
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:20,639
Took advantage of he would do things like spend

415
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:24,223
Months or even years in a place like Palestine are the Balkans

416
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,247
And he would

417
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:29,343
Talk to people interview them and then he would do these painstaking drawings of the area

418
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,903
And you realize as journalism

419
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,743
You could doubt everything he's telling you but you don't

420
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:36,767
You know

421
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,815
That a human hand took the

422
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,095
The time to make this

423
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,399
And with that labor-intensive

424
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,423
Devotion

425
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,959
Came truth

426
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:47,263
If something very convincing about

427
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,543
Even though

428
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,127
It's a lot easier to fake something in a drawing that in the photograph

429
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,151
You know

430
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:55,711
That it's true and that that was true of persepolis

431
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:56,479
What's 2 is that

432
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:58,783
Marjane satrapi's experiences

433
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,599
In a round During the Revolution the war with Iraq

434
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,647
Coming to Europe to all of these things

435
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:06,207
They just feel so credible so personal

436
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,231
And

437
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,511
They open a door

438
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,047
To another experience

439
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,375
Movies can do that books can do that

440
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,399
But

441
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:16,191
The the contact with

442
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:18,751
The paper that the notion that human hand

443
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,823
It makes it more intimate

444
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:24,639
It makes it that it did their entire world

445
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,687
Is seen through their lines

446
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:27,711
And that's that's

447
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,479
It's really exciting

448
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,783
Anything else in the syllabus that weekend

449
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,599
Just throw in there though the arrival by Shaun tan

450
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:37,183
A wonderful book it looks a little sore like a kids story book

451
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:39,231
Set up like a Chris Van Allsburg

452
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:42,047
Beautifully Illustrated silent story

453
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,071
Witches

454
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,607
Kind of surrealistic

455
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:46,911
Meditation on what it's like

456
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:49,471
To be an immigrant in a strange new place

457
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:53,055
Shaun tan moved from Malaysia to

458
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,079
Australia

459
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,871
When he was just a kid and he

460
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,407
You really makes

461
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:00,735
You understand what it is to go to such a new

462
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,015
Alien place

463
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:02,783
He doesn't

464
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:03,551
Beautifully

465
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,831
But also

466
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:05,855
Really terrific

467
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,135
To approach comic

468
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,415
Without words

469
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,719
To pick something without words

470
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:12,255
For your first encounter

471
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,559
Because then you have to recognize

472
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,327
The degree to which

473
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,351
Pictures art

474
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:17,631
Pictures

475
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:18,399
AR meaning

476
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,935
They're not just illustrations

477
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,471
The pictures do the

478
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,311
You know it's still in popular culture because of all the

479
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:27,359
In the Marvel movies and such that

480
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:30,687
The superhero is a dominant form in comics

481
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,479
Is there something that

482
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:33,503
You

483
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:36,575
Find that you enjoying them like ways

484
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:39,135
Is it something that's lost to you at this point

485
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,415
What is your feeling about

486
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,439
Right now

487
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:45,535
I've lost some of the joy that I had when I was first reading superhero comics

488
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,327
But I still

489
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,887
I like the medium I think the medium has an important

490
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:52,191
Part to play in comics culture

491
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,471
But

492
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:56,799
Still I'm I'm kind of happy that we're becoming a little bit more like

493
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:59,103
Japan we're starting to see more genres

494
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,663
Come in one of the big revolutions Now isn't

495
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,687
Kids comics

496
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:07,039
The best-selling cartoonist in America now is Raina Telgemeier

497
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,319
Best comics for kids

498
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:11,647
And those Comics don't have any superheroes in them too

499
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,439
Her biggest one with smile which

500
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,719
Just about

501
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:18,047
When she was a kid and she lost her two front two of her front teeth and hat

502
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,911
But it's just fantastic stuff

503
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,471
You know we're seeing much more diversity

504
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,519
Just got a wonderful crowdfunded book called

505
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:28,799
Bingo love witches

506
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,615
Two women of color who

507
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,151
Who fall in love is

508
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:33,919
Kids

509
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:38,271
You know in a bingo parlor and both of their families

510
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:40,063
Just don't approve and they don't really

511
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,343
Until they're old

512
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,903
Far Cry from The Amazing Spider-Man

513
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,511
But some of the things we love the most about Spider-Man I got to say we're just the small moment

514
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,047
The everyday moments the real Moana

515
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,351
So there was maybe that was a seat of that

516
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,119
Even in those days

517
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:57,983
I know you're interested in graphic communication in the World At Large Beyond comic

518
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,519
How did

519
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,567
Understanding comics in Oliver thoughts

520
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,591
You put into

521
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:05,151
This as a study

522
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:10,527
Change the way you decode Graphics in the World At Large like what is something that

523
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:13,087
You could point to as an example of

524
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:15,647
That ties to this medium

525
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,928
That you could help

526
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:18,720
People like decode as they're walking

527
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:19,488
Diversity

528
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:20,768
Well

529
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:24,864
Let's look at fire safety signs oh my God

530
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,680
It drives me crazy

531
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,520
If there's there's a really classic little

532
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,360
Messed up fire safety graphic you'll see it

533
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,384
All around the

534
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,152
Country

535
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:39,200
Off and on the inside of hotel room doors

536
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:40,736
Which is

537
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:43,040
It's got two different little flames

538
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,320
It's got this

539
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:47,136
Little tiny elevator and then it's got this very big

540
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,416
Guy who's

541
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,440
Going

542
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:51,488
Right-to-left down the stairs towards

543
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,536
Flame in about to trip over the elevator

544
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:59,424
All they did was they found the symbols and they filled the available space

545
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,704
Buddha symbols

546
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,032
It didn't even occur to them that the way the guy was facing

547
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:08,640
Or the relative size of the guy in the Flames the guys much bigger than the Flames to Flame someone

548
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,200
And why are there two of them

549
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,992
You don't like all of these things

550
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,784
They didn't consider it at all

551
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:18,112
Because they weren't thinking that maybe

552
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,672
Every visual decision has

553
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:21,952
Every visual

554
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:23,744
Collateral meaning

555
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,840
Until I started remix in these things and turning the guy around and changing the size relay

556
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,120
Changing

557
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:32,192
The proximity and making sure that

558
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:35,520
Each individual element had its own space to breathe

559
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:39,872
And I was able to come up with like three different alternatives

560
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:40,896
I think

561
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:41,664
Work better

562
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:47,808
I'll probably go on a crusade to fire departments around the country

563
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:51,136
But now I see I see these things everywhere I mean like

564
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:52,416
Maps for example

565
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,184
You know

566
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:55,232
90 degree rotation is hard

567
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,512
Mental knife

568
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,280
2 degree rotation

569
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,048
It's very hard

570
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,840
Actually upsets me when I see

571
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:02,400
Before plants telling you how to get out of your burning building

572
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:06,752
And they're rotated they're not in the same orientation is the way that you're standing

573
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:07,776
Because they have one

574
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:11,616
Map orientation for the whole building right on the map they print right

575
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:14,688
But you know you are building is on fire

576
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,992
You're going to die any minute now

577
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:21,088
And you've got to stand there and kind of just sort of Imagine

578
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,464
If you were facing the other way any return this way and way which hallway is that in there this

579
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,280
I should be clear as day

580
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,560
Here's the thing

581
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:31,584
I think that

582
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:34,912
Good visual communication should speak

583
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:35,936
Imbecile

584
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,240
What I mean by that is that

585
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:40,288
There are many

586
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:41,824
Kinds of

587
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,104
Visual communication

588
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:43,872
That

589
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,408
They're clear enough

590
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,200
You can figure it out

591
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:49,760
You can piece it together

592
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:53,600
But they still kind of Mumble as they walk away

593
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:56,928
Like the bike path sign you know it's

594
00:23:57,184 --> 00:24:00,256
All it is the bike path signs are everywhere right it's just a

595
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,280
Picture of a bicycle

596
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:03,072
And then the word bike

597
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,608
Empath underneath

598
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:05,376
The bicycle

599
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:06,400
And

600
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,936
Oftentimes

601
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:10,240
Biking path are separated

602
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:12,032
And there's more space

603
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,056
Between bike

604
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:14,336
And pass

605
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:18,432
Then there is between the words biking path and the wheels of the Bison

606
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,016
Nobody will be confused by this

607
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,552
Everyone on Earth

608
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,344
Knows that if they can read English

609
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,904
Dino that says bike path they know what it means

610
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:30,208
But I say it's still up

611
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:31,744
Socks on every

612
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,024
Damn one of them

613
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,048
Because

614
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:36,096
Because what it does

615
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:38,656
Is it violates the rules of proximity

616
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:39,680
So that it's like

617
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:43,264
The word spike in path are married there are a couple

618
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,800
And that there is

619
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:48,640
There is infidelity going on there because they're flirting with the wheels

620
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:52,992
Right and they're creating this visual grouping of wheel and

621
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,016
And word

622
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:56,320
That's completely irrelevant to the message

623
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,136
Nobody will be confused by this

624
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:05,024
Ivy my wife just tells me Let it go let it go it's fine they needed from the state needed from for the little boat

625
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,864
To go and that's all it is they just they were just making room for the bolts Scott

626
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,888
Just

627
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,168
Just let it go

628
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,216
But but I am telling you

629
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:16,288
Instead of just saying bike path like it was supposed to

630
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,312
It's saying

631
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:20,896
Bike path and you're like

632
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:27,552
Wait what did you say and I said I said bike path that's like no no no after bike path what did you say I didn't say any

633
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,832
Anything I just said bike path

634
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,112
Mama

635
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:33,440
There you did it again he said no matter what the hell was that

636
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,720
It's like it's

637
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:36,000
It's killing off

638
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:37,024
Irrelevant

639
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,328
Visual information and I see it

640
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:41,888
Everywhere and it's driving me nuts

641
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:46,240
Is there an analog and comics where you feel like

642
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:50,336
There has to be a type of precision in the presentation of the narrative

643
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,640
Or do you allow for a little bit more mumbling

644
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:55,456
That's a good question because I think in comics

645
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:58,272
People embrace the mumbler

646
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:01,088
People embracing imperfections

647
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,672
In the cartoonist line they actually fall in love

648
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,232
With the things that make a cartoonist

649
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:08,768
A little clumsy

650
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,304
A little crowded

651
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:12,352
A little strange

652
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,632
Because

653
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,192
Those are the things that only they do

654
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:22,592
And there are certainly there are Craftsman in comics who know just how to make it singing

655
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,640
And compose it

656
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:28,736
With great precision and orchestrate the line so that

657
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:31,552
There is no mumbling so that there is no noise

658
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,344
And I love them too

659
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:35,648
The imperfections I think

660
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:37,184
Are part of what people

661
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,720
Are drawn to

662
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:40,256
In my medium

663
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:42,560
It is an imperfect medium because

664
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,328
It is

665
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,888
The creation of an imperfect species

666
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:48,704
And the idiosyncrasies

667
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:50,496
Of cartoonists like

668
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:51,264
And I'm saying

669
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,288
Robert Cromwell

670
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,312
Charles Schulz

671
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:56,128
These are the things that

672
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:58,432
I don't know I think people

673
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,456
Come to embrace

674
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:17,888
What is a person obsessed with the second the world of visual communication relate to close family members who are

675
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:18,656
Blind

676
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:21,984
Ask a question and get a really cool dancer from Scott McCloud

677
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,008
But after that

678
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,712
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices

679
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:35,296
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man made sound

680
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,320
If

681
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:42,720
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife isn't

682
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:46,816
All hearing that voice

683
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:48,608
Technology talk to us

684
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,656
It is a creation of Sonic trash

685
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:53,728
That's Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

686
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:57,312
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

687
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:59,360
To make them more human

688
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,200
Turn the living room lights on

689
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:04,992
Okay

690
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:07,552
Dim the living room lights to 50%

691
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,600
Okay

692
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:16,256
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound make

693
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:18,048
Makes for a much more natural

694
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:18,816
Experience

695
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,864
Turn the living room lights on

696
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:24,960
Dim the living room lights to 50%

697
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:32,384
We're presenting to special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

698
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,200
About how are soundscape is impacting our health

699
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:37,760
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

700
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:40,576
Look for them Fridays May 17th and May 24th

701
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:42,880
Right here on the 99 pi

702
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,232
We need to talk about something

703

Constipation abdominal pain and bloating yourself it's not that bad you take laxatives modify your diet

Flash podcast

709
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:18,720
You really taken the world with

710
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:20,512
A lot of attention to

711
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:22,304
Visual cues and in graphic

712
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:23,584
Interphase

713
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,168
And you happen to have a blind father Eva blind daughter

714
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:31,008
How is that affected the way you perceive the world

715
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,312
And even like

716
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:35,872
How you relate to them

717
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:37,408
The condition that that

718
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:41,248
Both my father who's been deceased for some time and my daughter have is

719
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,528
Is called stargardt's disease

720
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:47,392
It's an inherited condition in swarm of macular degeneration so they're their central vision is

721
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,672
Wasn't easy

722
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,232
And

723
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:54,560
My daughter being 24 living in Portland

724
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:56,864
Wearing Doc Marten boots and listening to

725
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,168
Aeroplane Over the Sea on vinyl is is

726
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:02,240
More than happy to tell me the ways in which I'm ableist and

727
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:08,896
And the different problems in my focus on visual communication because there are people for whom visual

728
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:09,920
Communication has

729
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:11,712
Increase of your limit

730
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:14,784
And we've had some wonderful discussions about

731
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,808
Accessibility

732
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,112
Just very recently actually

733
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:22,208
A bit of an epiphany when I was talking to her about this

734
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:25,024
Her name is Sky and sky and I were talking about

735
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:28,096
Accessibility and I had

736
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:30,656
Didn't complain Ivan B no bitching about

737
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,424
One of

738
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,472
Some bit of bad design that affects

739
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,288
It affects me and I realized that

740
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,080
We were talking about the same thing

741
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:40,384
Idea that there is

742
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,456
It is a human right information as a human right

743
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:44,480
And

744
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,528
Between the information

745
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,552
And

746
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:53,696
And the person you can use that information I think we're talking about fire Maps actually in the recent fires here in Southern California

747
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:57,280
And the limitations of the different displays that went out

748
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,840
Problems of typography problems

749
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:04,960
The size of the type Sky tried looking to see even though she wasn't in our area

750
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:09,568
She was up in Portland but she was looking to see where the old neighborhood do you know where the fires were

751
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:10,336
And she couldn't

752
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,616
She wasn't able to access it

753
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:17,504
And I realize that I come up on obstacles and trying to access that information and she had come upon Ops 2

754
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:20,064
Trying to access that information

755
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:23,904
And it really illuminated the fact that though they were different ops

756
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,184
Testicles that the principal was

757
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:25,952
The same

758
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:27,488
That

759
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,768
Bad design

760
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:30,304
Is

761
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,608
Committing the same mortal sin

762
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:33,888
As

763
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,168
A lack of access

764
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,960
For those with disabilities

765
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:37,984
In fact

766
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:38,752
Really

767
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:40,032
At the end of the day

768
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:42,336
We all have disabilities we all

769
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:43,872
Cognitive limits

770
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:46,176
We all have limits of our senses

771
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,712
And

772
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:51,296
In a failure to recognize the multiplicity of barrier

773
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:54,880
It's stand between us and what sometimes his life

774
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:55,648
Saving in

775
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:56,416
Information

776
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,208
Is an urgent

777
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:00,512
Public Works

778
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:01,536
It needs to take place

779
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:04,352
The other aspect I should mention

780
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,888
You know where sky is concerned is

781
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:07,168
People with stargardt's.

782
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:08,960
It's very interesting cuz I

783
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:10,752
I've run into others with stargardt's

784
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,288
In my travels

785
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,360
If you ever see somebody with sunglasses on

786
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:16,640
Maybe a dog

787
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:18,176
And a cane

788
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:19,968
And walking

789
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:20,992
Very fast

790
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,016
Cmake infuser

791
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:24,832
You may wonder why is this blind person walking very fast

792
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,184
Well as I've been studying visual cognition one of the things that's come up as often

793
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:29,952
Flow

794
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:31,744
And this notion of

795
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,792
Dewayne which we perceive depth

796
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:35,072
Not just by stereotypes

797
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,608
Two Snapchats by combining the

798
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:37,888
Images in our two eyes

799
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:42,240
But also in the way in which the entire visual field moves by as a

800
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,264
The different speeds

801
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:47,360
Nearest things like when you're on the road for example and you noticed it

802
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:52,736
The telephone poles are going by faster in your field of vision then say a distant house

803
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:54,528
Distant Mountain

804
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:56,320
Or even just the furniture in your

805
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:57,088
You're looking up

806
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,392
What what you're doing if you're building a deck

807
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,160
Map

808
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:03,232
Of the whole visual field the whole visual world

809
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:04,512
And you're doing it

810
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:05,792
With motion parallax

811
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:06,816
Fox rather than

812
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,096
Stereopsis

813
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,448
And this is this helps give you a sense of where you are

814
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:14,496
Lil Skies peripheral vision is fine

815
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:16,800
She sees the car coming around the corner

816
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:18,336
She just can read

817
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:19,360
She's lost percent

818
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:21,408
But the faster she moves

819
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,688
The faster she walks

820
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,712
The mark

821
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,480
Complete

822
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:25,248
Picture of

823
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,784
The world that she lives in is

824
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,904
And so you'll see that on it and a lot of people think that people with stargardt's

825
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,184
Sissies and other forms of maca

826
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:34,464
Degeneration

827
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:36,512
I think they're not blind at all

828
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,560
But now they're just

829
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:39,584
They're seen with

830
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:40,864
A different part of the

831
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:43,168
That's amazing

832
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:50,592

Before we go I want to tell you about the body genius a five-part series from Bello radiotopia show the truth

845
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:58,688
The body genius is a dark

846
00:34:58,944 --> 00:34:59,712
Comic mystery

847
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:03,296
That whines through a treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

848
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:04,576
We're looking the part

849
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:06,112
Might cost you your life

850
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:11,488
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

851
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:15,840
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

852
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:20,192
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like a dad

853
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:24,544
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

854
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,848
Actually if I'm being honest

855
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:33,248
I'm one of the main guy to know how to do that kind of thing a few days ago Wesley Stern

856
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:36,576
After that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

857
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:39,904
Was found dead in my private gym

858
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,232
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

859
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:47,584
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

860
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,608
Now

861
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:55,008
I need to clear my name somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do what

862
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:57,056
Whatever it takes to find them

863
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:03,968
