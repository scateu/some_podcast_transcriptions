36
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:54,688
The simple marking is called the load line

37
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,712

46
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,680
We consulted with something as simple

47
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,216
Has a circle with a line through it

Tristan also creates an outstanding blog called humans in design

55
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:38,720
The massive problem that needed solving in the 19th century that Tristan is referring to

56
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:43,072
Was the huge number of British ships sinking in the ocean

57
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:45,632
Because they were overloaded and in disrepair

58
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,168
Sending hundreds

59
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:53,568
Emergency mental watery grave the problem was so widespread that these vessels became known by another name

60
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,336
Coffin ships

61
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,104
Coughing

62
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:59,968
Now overloading ships has certainly happened since there have been ships to overload

63
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,272
It was the introduction of insurance

64
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,320
Decorated the coffin ship

65
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:09,952
That still collect real time for ships that are over insured so they worth more money to

66
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,256

Lara Floyd

68
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:17,120
Social boners would purposely overload older ships with cargo

69
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:19,680
Thinking that if the ships made it they hit the jackpot

70
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,472
British ships didn't make it

71
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:26,080
They still made a lot of money on the insurance claim

72
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,128
Insurance that people want quiet

73
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,920
Aware of the idea to buy

74
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,200
Sharing something you were going to

75
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,480
Changing affect people's

76
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:35,040
Behavior this is called a moral hazard

77
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:39,648
When people engage in Risky Behavior because they are not fully accountable for the consequences

78
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,952
Insurance is going to keep every

79
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,000
It doesn't

80
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,840
Ensure that changes your behavior become more risky or you haven't

81
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:48,608
Incentive

82
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:49,376
To do something

83
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,680
In the unintended consequence of insurance

84
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,984
Was that ship owners had an incentive

85
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,776
To sink their own ships

86
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:59,104
And send hundreds of souls to the bottom of the ocean

87

Things like that

95
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,583
Was in a meeting

96
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:20,863
Hundreds in

00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:22,911
Extol

98
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,447
I try to send back to what the port

99
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:28,031
This is where our hero British MP Samuel plimsoll

100
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,823
And the plimsoll line comes in

101
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,359
Dust off to that happen

102
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,663
Plimsoll

103
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,455
I said to the British Parliament

104
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,479
And he

105
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,759
Wanted to pause a bunch

106
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:41,343
New shipping safety laws based upon his knowledge of

107
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,111
This Disaster

108
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:47,743
But passing the safety laws was not easy for plimsoll because it just so happens that

109
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,023
Murderous

110
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:52,607

Solomon took his case to the people

117
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:14,623
Play Saul write a book called a salmon which it was really Champion the issue and that

118
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:21,791
Went really wide and eventually due to widespread public support the merchant shipping Act of 1876

119
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,559
Text was passed

120
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:28,959
It required the simple elegant graphic I described earlier a circle with a long horizontal line.

121
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:34,335
Be painted on the outside of the hall to show the maximum loading point of the ship

122
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:41,247
The mark let a third-party know plainly and clearly one of us was being overloaded and at risk of sinking in rough

00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:45,087
If you see that horizontal line above the water they're good

125
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,367
If you don't

126
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,391
Well

127
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,671
You could be song

128
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:52,767
It's just kind of really pretty you looking to look at that initially it's

129
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:53,535
Very

130
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,559
Geometric

131
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:59,167

These days

142
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,319

When it gets down to it the thing that is

Is most importantly keeping a boat afloat

149
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,863

It's just a bit of paint

152
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:36,031
There been numerous poems and songs sung about Samuel plimsoll

153
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:40,383
Overtime his name is faded even though his mark on the world lives on

154
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,175
It's fate actually less known as a

155
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:44,991
Twin Soul line now I'm over the line but at the time it was

156
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,015
Was definitely known as a

157
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:46,783
Plimsoll line

158
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:50,111

159
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,647
Only call it

160
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,927
A plimsoll line

161
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:53,951
Because

162
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:56,511
It seems like the right and honorable thing

163
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:57,791
And besides

164
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:00,351
If there's an opportunity to use an eponym

165
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,143
Use the eponym

166
