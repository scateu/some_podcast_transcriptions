Each episode of Family ghosts takes a look at the story behind a different person's family lore digging into

Unanswered questions about their history

The thing then yeah

20
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:21,920
We're in our backyard in Oakland making an indigo bat

21
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:26,528
Which is to say we are making a natural blue dye using powder from the indigo plant

22
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,320
Kind of complicated

23
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:31,136
This is actually our second time trying to make indigo

24
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:33,696
Because the first time we didn't get the ratio right

25
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:34,976
It's Tricky

26
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:36,768
YouTube

27
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,656
By stirring the Indigo powder and the other ingredients

28
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:49,056
Together in this bag of hot water very slowly because

29
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:52,896
It's a strict kind of lovingly and slowly

30
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:56,224
And then if you actually do it right and all goes according to plan

31
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,504
It's amazing

32
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:03,904
I want it to do the Indigo mixture seems to come alive in the

33
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:10,304
Water it starts listening

34
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,704
Shimmery bubbly chunks are swirling around and water it's like we were mixing a cauldron

35
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:19,008
Swirling purple potion

36
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,568
And then when we dumped in some white t-shirts

37
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,616
They came out deep green

38
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:26,176
And then if we let the shirts dry in the Sun

39
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:28,480
Patches of blue gradually emerge

40
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:31,296
And slowly spread over the cloth

41
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,832
Like we have conjured it

42
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,464
It's pretty cool you like a magical process

43
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:39,744
It's also just like

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,512
Make the real

Nobody

47
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,424
Nobody doesn't like indigo blue

48
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:49,984
Or at least I can't imagine anyone hating it

49
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,776
It's so ubiquitous

50
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:52,800
Have you like

51
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,848
Someone hating water

52
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,920
Indigo is everywhere

53
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,968
Because indigo

54
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,504
Is what put the blue

55
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,040
In blue jeans

What's great about blue jeans

64
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:34,528
We like to say that

65
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,296
We pioneered the

00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:38,112

The corporate historian at Levi Strauss & Company

69
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,464
They touch on

70
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,560
The roots of blue collar workers they became a

Self-expression

73
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,912
1960s so in many ways

74
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:51,680
They hit on

75
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,704
Key cultural moment

76
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,240
Across

77
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,264
Our society

78
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,568
This is a difference

79
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,848
Between denim

80
00:03:59,104 --> 00:03:59,616
And jeans

81
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:03,968
Denim is a fabric that can be used in jackets shirts dresses tablecloths

82
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:04,736
Upholstery

83
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:05,504
You name it

84
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,296
Blue jeans

85
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:09,088
Are a very specific

86
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:09,856
Kind of

87
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:10,624
Pants

88
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,160
And they have a couple Hallmark

89
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,696
For the most part

90
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:14,720
They are blue

91
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,256
And they are worn in

92
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,303
They basically look

93
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,071
Like this

94
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:19,839
This

95
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:23,935
But you're looking at is the oldest pair of blue jeans in the world

96
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:27,007
It dates to about 1879

97
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:27,775
And

98
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,567
This is

99
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,639
The blueprint for all blue jeans today

100
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:35,199
World's oldest pair of blue jeans

101
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,479
They looked

102
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,271
Classic

103
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:43,903
Meaning they really don't look very different from the kinds of genes you find in a thrift store today

104
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,951
They held up well

105
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:52,351
Yes they were patched in a little stained but if I wanted to I could have totally put them on right there and walked out of the

106
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,375
The archive wearing them

107
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:56,703
And the security guard would have even noticed because they're still

108
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,239
Jeans

109
00:04:59,007 --> 00:04:59,775
The differences

110
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:00,799
Are subtle

111
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,335
This one only has one pocket

112
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,103
In the back

113
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:09,503
We didn't add the second pocket onto the back until 1901 and here's a really cool thing about

114
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:14,879
But most of our clothes we try to keep them pretty pristine and avoid spills and rips and tears

115
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:21,535
Denim so hard wearing and hardworking I just kind of a mess as more and more signs of wear

116
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:24,863
You can just text a pair of old jeans like an archaeologist

117
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,679
You can actually see how someone walked

118
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:32,287
You'll see all of this where this honeycombing as we call it

119
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,591
That's simply wear and tear from

120
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,639
Keep all the men who were wearing it

121
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,919
And we think

122
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:42,271
That there were as many as three men who wore this

123
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,295
This particular

124
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:46,111
You can tell by looking at the Impressions on the knees

125
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,135
Anthony marks

126
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,415
Go up and down is several

127
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,183
Places

128
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,719
Because they are in several

129
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,487
Locations

130
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:52,511
We know the sea

131
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,559
People wore them and that was common with you

132
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:58,655
They get passed around they were sturdy enough that you could do that

133
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,703
Which is kind of romantic writer

134
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,239
Because this is

135
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:05,055
Oh how we like to think of our blue jeans today

136
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,615
Broken endurobol

137
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:10,943
Something to be worn and reward and passed around

138
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,759
Just like these original jeans

139
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:19,135
But the jeans you and I wear today may look like those original Levi's

140
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:21,439
How the maven say Levi's on them

141
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,767
They are not the same kind of pants

142
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,351
In between 1879 and today

143
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:32,191
Everything that makes blue jeans blue jeans

144
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:35,263
How they're made to what they're made of two where they end up

145
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,287
Change

146
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:37,823
Because

147
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,871
Blue jeans reveal our wear pattern

148
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,151
R-value

149
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,967
They show the movements we make

150
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:45,503
Over and over again

151
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,551
They show

152
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,575
Are true color

153
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,415
Sew denim with around

154
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,439
Levi Strauss

155
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:57,023
And blue denim trousers were around before Levi Strauss

156
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,839
But here is what Levi Strauss did

157
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,375
That made the blue jean

158
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,679
He patented the rivet

159
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,703
On the pocket

160
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:11,103
The innovation of the rivets is that you could take at a little tiny piece of metal atom to the pockets

161
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:14,943
And they became much stronger so if you're putting your hands in your pockets

162
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:15,967
They're not going to chair

163
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:18,015
The rivets were the big selling point

164
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,319
Not necessarily the denim

165
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:24,671
And when they use denim it wasn't always necessarily blue

166
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,463
It doesn't have to be

167
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,255
Blue is just tradition

168
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,047
Denim can be any color

169
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:34,655
Lynn Downey is a biographer of Levi Strauss and the former Levi's corporate historian

170
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,423
Before Tracy

171
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:38,751
Over the years the company did make blue and gold denim products

172
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,079
Red and white

173
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,359
But

174
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,639
It was indigo

175
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:45,919
Indigo blue

176
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,455
Dyed thread

177
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,991
That was

178
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,015
Easiest

179
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:53,855
That seems seem to last the longest and people just gravitate

180
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,463
It's hard to explain why humans are so attracted to Indigo

181
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:01,791
Historically the dye had massive power

182
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:05,119
Indigo used to be very rare and expensive

183
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:10,239
Especially since that process of dying is so special and magical

184
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:14,847
Blue was a symbol of status and or wealth all over the world

185
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:21,503
Indigo has its roots in India and its name and variance grow in Vietnam in West Africa

186
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,551
Anywhere where it's humid

187
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,343
Humidity

188
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,111
Humidity

189
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:28,159
The same conditions as rice

190
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,951
So Indigo was also able to

191
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:30,719
The drive

192
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,255
In South Carolina

193
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,303
Indigo had first been cultivated

194
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,607
In the United States and

195
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:40,447
1740s by a woman oh by the way Eliza Pinckney

196
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,983
Really a girl

197
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:44,543
She was 16 years old born in Antigua

198
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:48,895
And her family then had plantations in South Carolina and she and her family moved there

199
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,943
And her father has sent her some Indigo Seas

200
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,735
From the Caribbean and she thought

201
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:53,759
Let's try this

202
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:57,599
She was able to cultivate enough Indigo to make it a cash crop

203
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:02,207
American Indigo have kind of a cool feminist success story

204
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,487
But

205
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,279
When Indigo became a cash crop

206
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,559
If you can master

207
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,327
Produced

208
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:12,191
And so that labor-intensive magical process of making indigo

209
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,471
Scaled-up

210
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,263
With slave labor

211
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,079
And I can just imagine the slaves and

212
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:24,479
The women especially or are stirring these Indigo Vats they were processing this die

213
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:30,879
And their hands are blue before the American Revolution before cotton became king

214
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:35,487
Indigo was the second largest cash crop in the colonies after rice

215
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:41,887
Indigo plantations all across the South and some of them lasted well into the Civil War

216
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:48,287
Virginia South Carolina for sure the story takes place in Georgia this is an Mass Eye and she has this amazing

217
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,847
Using story about her grandfather's grandfather

218
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:57,247
Who was born as a slave on an Indigo Plantation his name is John John Henry

219
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:03,647
And it was very common for them to swaddle the babies in the blue cloth so when baby John was born

220
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,207
His parents decided to escape

221
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:10,303
Play wrapped baby John and indigo and headed north

222
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,095
They crept through the underbrush

223
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:15,167
Creeping their way up about an hour after they set out

224
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:21,823
Their dogs barking in the distance and the screaming of the voices if they recognized was the overseer so they ran

225
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:28,223
They found a place to hide the secret of themselves and baby John started to whipper and fuss

226
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:34,623
Somebody came over and it was investigating this noise was the overseer he

227
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,439
Look down just as the moon came out

228
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:44,351
And the baby John jump them screamed out and suddenly the overseer ran away like

229
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:50,751
Yankees are the union Army's uniforms

230
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,543
Girl get out the blues are here

231
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:56,383
He saw a baby John swaddled in the blue cloth

232
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,919
The Indigo cloth

233
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:02,271
And the overseer thought that that was a Yankee and his blue car

234
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,575
Hiding and they are going to be

235
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,855
Ambushing this

236
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,647
And they got out

237
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:13,535
This story that Anne has is a rare one passed from generation to generation

238
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:14,559
And

239
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:18,399
Hearing about an Indigo Plantation nestled in the Land of Cotton

240
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,167
Plantations

241
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,727
Centos add ready-made symbolism

242
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,543
Because cotton and indigo

243
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,591
Go really well together

244
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,615
Cotton gloves

245
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,663
The cotton reel

246
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,943
Loved soaking up

247
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,223
And this

248
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:35,295
According to Lynn Downey is part of why jeans are blue

249
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:39,903
Not only was Indigo a beautiful color that humans have always been attracted to

250
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:43,231
It was the color that could cling to fabric best

251
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:46,559
And it was a color that was very present in the United States

252
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,351
And it was relatively easy to

253
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:52,959
Procure the time

254
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,007
There was a system in place

255
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,335
For textile manufacturers to get their indigo

256
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:01,663
And this is where our idea of blue jean kind of got

257
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,943
Frozen in Time

258
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,735
Need to last forever

259
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,271
100% cotton

260
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,063
100% indigo

261
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,111
Are jeans still made with

262
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,903
Actual natural indigo

263
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,671
Not

264
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,207
Really big lines of them know

265
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:16,511
Indigo's magic concoction is

266
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:23,167
Too fickle and expensive and complicated for a massive industrial-scale most

267
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:28,543
Synthetic Indigo synthetic indigo is not without its own kind of Cruelty

268
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:33,151
It's often made with petroleum mixed with heavy metals and other chemicals

269
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,943
I got the chemicals that is used

270
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,503
Processing of this fabric

271
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,295
Positive

272
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,855
Too Human this is Aida Khan

273
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,671
The toxic manager at Greenpeace East Asia

274
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:50,303
She says the textile industry discharges the third most Wastewater in China

275
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:55,423
And it's runoff chemical water gets disposed of in the rivers and basically poisons them

276
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,983
The thing is that the waters might be Juiced

277
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,007
For the

278
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,311
Local farmers for irrigation

279
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,359
Play my problem growing their crops

280
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:05,919
Lots of dye colors have harmful chemicals

281
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,711
It's not just synthetic indigo

282
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,247
But

283
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:14,111
Here is the other thing that makes denim especially noteworthy in terms of production

284
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,415
GM fuse app

285
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,439
A lot

286
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,463
Of water

287
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:22,047
They're actually all washed in China map multiple times

288
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:25,375
And all this washing Wastewater discharge to

289
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,399
3 bus

290
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,423
Multiple times

291
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,983
That's the special thing about that

292
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,263
Yes

293
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,055
Speck jeans to be blue

294
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,871
We also expect jeans to come soft

295
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:36,895
And Warren in

296
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,175
No other

297
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,455
Textile on Mass

298
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:42,527
Is being purposefully broken down in this way

299
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,319
Before it even goes on a Shelf

300
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:48,927
This is Emma McClendon associate curator costume at the Fashion in

301
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,951
Attitude of Technology

302
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,511
And she says after the genes are died

303
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,535
They are washed

304
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,839
And maybe washed again

305
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,631
May be washed again

306
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,935
They are being broken down

307
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,239
Being made softer

308
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,543
And given that touch of white that emerges

309
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,847
The top layer of blue cotton is worn away

310
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,407
To get that worn in look

311
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,967
Manufacturers actually poor bags of Rock

312
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:15,807
Into industrial washing machines to Pamela jeans while they spin

313
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,087
This

314
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,623
Is Stone washing

315
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,415
Literally washing jeans

316
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:23,999
Several Cycles after the made into jeans

317
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,791
Washing them in

318
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,583
Giant industrial washers

319
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,631
With varying sizes of stone

320
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,191
Thomas you know this volcanic

321
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:32,959
Stone

322
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:33,983
Now I know

323
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,031
I know you might be thinking no no no

324
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,055
I don't

325
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,079
Pre distressed jeans

326
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:43,199
I just wear simple sturdy well made jeans and I hate all those artificial holes all over the place

327
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,479
Well

328
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,247
Here's the thing

329
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,063
You probably do every distress jeans

330
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:51,391
If you have bought genes within the last four decades

331
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,183
They've been processed

332
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:56,255
When people bring up Stone washing most people think it's a

333
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,303
Something very 80s

334
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:01,119
And it's just not the case every

335
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:05,215
Jean on the market today that is not

336
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:08,031
Raw denim jean husband Stonewall

337
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,311
Really

338
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:12,127
Denim raw denim is in

339
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:12,895
Ratably

340
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:13,663
Steph

341
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,687
Cute filters

342
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,735
It's really heavy

343
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,527
A hard heart

344
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,807
That's not

345
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,087
Necessarily something

346
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,367
Do you want to put on your body

347
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,415
This is old Simpson

348
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:30,303
A designer and owner of the small independent denim brand the end short for ubiquitous Industries

349
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:34,911
He is showing me the raw unprocessed denim fabric

350
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:40,287
Which is very thick and heavy and it's just a uniform dark dark dark

351
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,055
Navy blue

352
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:42,847
It has no stretch

353
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:43,615
What's the weather

354
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,151
No GIF

355
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:51,807
Jeans like that first pair of Levi's from 1879 started off as raw just like this

356
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,111
All old jeans did

357
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,391
The only got soft

358
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:59,231
Because the men or the three men who owns them wore them down

359
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:00,511
A lot of people don't

360
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,351
Today Ulrich is one of the few patient people

361
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,887
Who actually wear

362
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:06,655
Raw

363
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,935
Unprocessed

364
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:10,239
Datum I'm sure I've been chased

365
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:14,335
But this is just part of the

366
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,359
Just like anyone

367
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,663
Breaking in a pair of shoes

368
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:22,015
I don't know it kind of seems a little more extreme than that to me

369
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:25,855
Breaking in denim means you have to wear these thick

370
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,647
Heavy scratchy jeans

371
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:28,671
For like

372
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:29,951
6 months

373
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:36,607
Without washing them if you get something on it you maybe try to vacuum or brush it off

374
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,143
And after all

375
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:43,775
After all those many many weeks of chasing you finally wash those jeans

376
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,055
The first time

377
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,103
And that first wash

378
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,127
Oroville

379
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,407
All the marks you've made

380
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:52,223
I like wrinkles around your hips when you sit

381
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,527
The imprint of your iPhone in your back pocket

382
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,063
And then

383
00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:01,439
It will finally have that soft worn in feeling that we all associate with Dunham

384
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:04,255
But this is so much work

385
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:07,583
Only real denim has bothered a break in their own jeans

386
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,119
It's the baby

387
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:12,959
3% that will actually wait and go through that process

388
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:13,983
Get it

389
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,775
She didn't feel like this

390
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:19,615
And this is the one that's been artificially

391
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,407
Denim makers artificially

392
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,175
Processed cheese

393
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,711
To break them down for you

394
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,479
So that

395
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,503
Yeah you don't have to

396
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,271
Go through the

397
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,295
Breakdown

398
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,831
. could look like that

399
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:31,135
And stone washing is one method for

400
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:35,231
But they're also manufactures will break the jeans down by hand

401
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,535
Can you sand it down

402
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,327
Physically handsome

403
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,607
Val Hansen

404
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,887
All of this process

405
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:42,911
Define

406
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:43,935
Sandpaper

407
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:50,079
Workers will sandpaper each individual pair of jeans to make them look like they've been worn in

408
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,359
To create marks

409
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,663
Even flight ones

410
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,711
Denim has that authentic

411
00:17:55,967 --> 00:18:00,063
Worn in look and feel of those archetypal 1879 jeans

412
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:02,879
Morning by three different men over the course of decades

413
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,695
In Mass Pursuit

414
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,231
Comfort Inn

415
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,255
Authenticity

416
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:12,095
Blue jeans have become a completely different

417
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:12,863
Garment

418
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:15,423
Colors are different there

419
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,751
Synthetic and stretch elements in them with

420
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:21,311
What is this even mean what does it even mean to call

421
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:27,967
Denim the labor of breaking in and wearing down the genes have been transferred from the customer

422
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:29,503
To the manufacturer

423
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:32,063
The blue is not indigo

424
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,599
And the cotton

425
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,647
Is not exactly cotton

426
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,415
I mean

427
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,439
Denim

428
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:39,231
As stretch what do you think stretch

429
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,511
Denim

430
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,047
Increasingly

431
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:45,631
Synthetic fibers in it denim is not caught

432
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:49,471
Lycra nylon polyester

433
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,519
It goes by many names

434
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,823
But let's call it what it is

435
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,615
It's plastic

436
00:18:56,383 --> 00:19:00,479
This is as much applicable to Denim as any other part of the industry

437
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:03,039
McClendon says we are at an unprecedented

438
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:03,807
Enphase

439
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,575
Concluding hist

440
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:09,183
We've never had so many clothes available with so much

441
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:09,951
Plastic

442
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,999
And no one knows what

443
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,535
Leggings and sweater

444
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,559
Wicking jacket

445
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,375
Super stretchy jeans are going to look like

446
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,655
30 years from now

447
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,703
Plastic Stone Age well

448
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:24,287
And we don't see it because we throw it out before we see it at that

449
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:27,103
In the future our genes

450
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:31,711
Which is down to Such Great Lengths to make a Pierre loved and worn in

451
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:33,503
Probably not age

452
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,807
Like those jeans in the Levi's archive

453
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,879
This is what people need to realize plastic

454
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:43,231
Sometimes age in such a way that they are attempting to go back

455
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,255
To a gas

456
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:46,047
Or they want to go back to a liquid

457
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,143
So that means that if you feel your sneaker sold

458
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:53,727
Time for a really long time begins to stick to the floor

459
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,007
You should get

460
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:57,055
Rid of it because it is

461
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,383
What we would call

462
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:04,479
Weeping other terminology it's going back to its liquid state

463
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,783
It's toxic you don't want to touch it

464
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,831
Same with something if you keep

465
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:09,855
Aplastic

466
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,415
Barrette

467
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:15,487
Or a tupperware container you never know in

468
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:17,023
Airtight

469
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:19,839
Drawer so you don't open it for years

470
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,631
And then you open it and you find shark

471
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,679
It means it explode

472
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:27,007
It literally combusted at some point and you will smell it

473
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,311
These things are giving off noxious.

474
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:35,711
And again we don't tend to see this because we see plastic is disposable but that's what this stuff is doing in

475
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,735
These landfill

476
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:40,319
And the vast majority of clothes do end up in landfills

477
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:42,367
Even if you donate your clothes

478
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:45,183
You're mostly only delaying the inevitable

479
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:46,975
And again

480
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:48,511
This is not just

481
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,279
Jeans

482
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:54,399
There are Plastics and harmful dies and damaging process he's in a lot of our clothes

483
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:57,215
Denim isn't even the worst culprit

484
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:01,055
No I mean not more than necessary any other plate like leather

485
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,871
Industry with a whole lot of problems

486
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:07,711
Denims just one because you know you can isolate it so easily

487
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:10,271
Denim is easily isolated from the rest

488
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,295
Of the clothing industry

489
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:12,575
Because

490
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:13,343
It is

491
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,111
So

492
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:18,976
God damn popular on any given day over half the population is

493
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,512
Of the world is wearing

494
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,840
So when you have numbers

495
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:27,168
Consumption numbers like that coming from one faction of the industry

496
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,704
That's when this kind of

497
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,472
Environment

498
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:31,008
Impact starts to become so

499
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:34,592
The average American own 7 pairs of jeans

500
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:36,640
Wear these jeans are going to end up

501
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:37,664
What it took to

502
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,432
Create them

503
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:40,224
Is just staggering

504
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,016
I feel so dizzy and because

505
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,808
In examining genes

506
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,160
You realize that it's nearly impossible to create a morally perfect

507
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:48,928
Piece of clothing

508
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,512
At least one that's affordable

509
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,048
Redo

510
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,352
Let's take jeans for

511
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:57,376
Say okay

512
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:59,936
Will buying organic jeans and then you add

513
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:00,704
Petroleum-based

514
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,472
Indigo

515
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:04,544
Do denim makers have to pick and choose their priorities

516
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,384
What are those priorities are local labor some people are all about local

517
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,480
Are natural fibers not using pesticides or chemicals or comfort

518
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,504
Affordability

519
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,552
Or trendiness obviously did list

520
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:18,624
Sustainable that we're all buying organic local whatever but

521
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,928
The reality out there in the world

522
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:23,744
That's very difficult or nearly in

523
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,512
Impossible

524
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,816
So I think what people should do

525
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:28,608
Who are listening is that they should

526
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,400
Pick what's most important to them

527
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:32,704
And your dollar is the vote UK

528
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:37,824
Are contact Greenpeace says companies directly respond to our buying habits

529
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:41,408
Tim Riggins has the most actually have power on the brands

530
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:43,200
And the brands that have powers to in

531
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:45,248
When's the factory supplies in China

532
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,784
And this is what happened happening

533
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:51,392
Clothing manufacturers have been hearing a real consumer demand for sustainability

534
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,928
Well we're very excited

535
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:59,072
Tracy Panic at Levis says the company is working on this technology where the genes will be worn in with laser

536
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,352
Rather than

537
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:02,144
Stone washing and sanding

538
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,520
Using lasers to work on those finishes to cut down the time and all the chemicals that are used

539
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:13,408
We have been working on ways to reduce the amount of water needed to create a pair of blue jeans

540
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:19,808
And we've not only done that in our processing the weekly manufacturer saving water but also in share

541
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:20,832
The message

542
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:23,392
That you don't have to wash your blue jeans as much

543
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:26,464
And it's true you don't have to wash your jeans as much

544
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:29,792
Really you can wash them every fifth where or so

545
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:32,096
And you can catch them and stay in them

546
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:35,168
And wear them and tear them more than you can with other clothes

547
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,960
On the user end

548
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:38,496
Within our closet

549
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:41,056
High quality jeans are a very sad

550
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,080
Temple garment

551
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:44,128
As long as we don't

552
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:45,408
Throw them away

553
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,944
What everybody should

554
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,712
Just do is

555
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,992
Stop by

556
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:53,088
The Crux of the issue is that we should learn how to

557
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,112
T Bar clothing

558
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:56,928
Think of clothing as something to
