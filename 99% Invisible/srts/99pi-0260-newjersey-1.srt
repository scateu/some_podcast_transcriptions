What do Brazilian soccer player scores a goal

26
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:23,968
Start slow

27
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:30,368
And it builds until it reaches a glorious crescendo

28
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:38,304
They do this all over the world now

29
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,096
But it started in Brazil

30
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:43,424
And there's something particularly triumphant about today

31
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,216
That's producer Joe Sykes

32
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:48,288
That's what is soccer means so much

33
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,056
Brazil

34
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:55,456
How can I explain what soccer means to Brazilians without sounding corny but I think I'm going to have to sound corny okay

35
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:57,248
That's Fernando Duarte

36
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:00,576
A BBC journalist who wrote a book about Brazilian soccer

37
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:04,416
Soccer or football as I cool it being British

38
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:07,488
Arrived in Brazil in the late 19th century

39
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:10,560
At first it was a game played in Elite Circle

40
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,144
But poor and working-class Brazilians

41
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,936
Struggle to make the game that right

42
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:17,216
The only time

43
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,264
The elites were

44
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,568
Robbed while they were deprived of something

45
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,104
By the poor people by the

Israel football season

48
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:29,504
To be a game for the elite and it became a sport

49
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:36,672
Soccer eventually became so popular and beloved in Brazil that their national team soccer jersey has become as much

50
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:39,232
A national symbol as the country's flag

51
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,536

No matter if you were

55
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:49,216
You know peanuts

Soda cans on the street or if you were a millionaire

62
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,296
If I think the word is

63
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,320
Horoscopes

64
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:10,720
That's the soccer writer and historian David cobra

65
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:11,744
Eyes shut

66
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,632
The Brazilian soccer shirts are so iconic that non soccer fans all over the world can often picture them

67
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,168
For those of you who can

68
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,448
The shirt is a bright

69
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:23,520
Canary yellow with green trim around the collar and sleeves

70
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,312
They're worn with blue shorts

71
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:27,104
Pure primary blue

72
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,664
Compared with other soccer jerseys the uniform is

73
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,200
Joyful and bold

74
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:34,272
It seems to capture something essential about Brazil

75
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,808
But it wasn't always this

76
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:40,416
In fact Brazil used to play in plain unremarkable white shirt

77
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:44,768
The story of how the uniform change goes back 70 years

78
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,328
To an epic soccer game that Brazilian

79
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,608
Never forget

80
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:55,008
After years of lobbying the World Cup arrived in Brazil in 1950

81
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:59,104
At the time the country was culturally and internationally kind of unknown

82
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:03,200
This was Brazil's big moment to show the world what it was made of

83
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:09,344
The 1950 World Cup was understood by the Brazilian population as an opportunity

84
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,880
Site of the world

85
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:12,160
Brazil Fitzroy

86
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:15,744
They need this world cup was that chance to tell everyone

87
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,583
We have mold noise we have been transformed we moved from being

88
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,911
Agricultural plantation economy 2nu

89
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,727
Industrialized economy

90
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,775
And this is my wife showing it

91
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:31,615
The main symbol of that coming out apart from what was happening on the soccer field

92
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,151
Worcester Stadium

93
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,943
Name the Maracana

94
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,479
In Rio de Janeiro

95
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,783
It looks like the stadium from outer space

96
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,063
I mean it just fish

97
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,087
Fabulous

98
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,111
Flat

99
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:46,975
White concrete over with amazing flying buttresses

100
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:51,583
Just like this huge flying suicide that a drop down in the center of the city

101
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,655
The thumb with the Sleep Fred Wilson

102
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,983
Surprise Stadium Pilsen

103
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,591
Do they have the stadium

104
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,639
The people behind them

105
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:07,967
The government was pushing the tournament whenever possible

106
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:11,807
Now they needed was a successful team

107
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:15,391
The expectations were high because of this hope

108
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:18,719
Klimatyzacja atmosphere of optimism

109
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:25,887
In one of the earlier games Brazil strike competently onto the field and at what unit

110
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,703
And proceeded to demolish Sweden

111
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,727
7 to 1

112
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,031
Resume absolutely

113
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:38,687
Fantastic in the ivy rails I was slaughtering everybody that scoring goals over the play

114
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:40,223
Play Sleepy Spain

115
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,503
611

116
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,063
They used to be Mexico and Yugoslavia

117
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,367
The tournament was going exactly to

118
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:47,903
Ulysses home

119
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,951
Atmosphere of like

120
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,487
Sporting Bliss

121
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:55,583
I have to do is got to draw of Uruguay in the last match

122
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:58,399
Because of a court in the tournament structure

123
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:01,471
Uber CEO had to do to win the World Cup was

124
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:04,287
Tie against Uruguay in that final game

125
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:09,407
Uruguay historically had been a really strong team

126
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:13,503
Even though there are tiny country almost 50 times smaller than Brazil

127
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,319
But by the time this 1950 World Cup came along

128
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,879
Uruguay it was a waning power in soccer

129
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:21,695
So beating them or at least playing them

130
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,975
Seemed totally doable

131
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:23,999
Not a problem

132
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,815
Stihl Uruguay was no pressure

133
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,375
Especially when they were playing games Brazil

134
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:32,703
Uruguay actually used to be a Brazilian province

135
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,751
Do they have this chip on their shoulder

136
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,031
About that older

137
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,567
Big guy next door neighbor

138
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,847
The whole thing of

139
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,127
Uruguayan

140
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,663
Going against the odds

141
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,479
Fighting against a colonial power

142
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,503
Spread the Moon

143
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:50,111
Meanwhile the whole of Rio is now thinking about just one thing

144
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,647
The World Cup final

145
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,695
There really is

146
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:56,767
My sister about to everybody nice body

147
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,559
Everyone's engaged with it

148
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:02,143
Everyone wants to go knowing from Schuylkill think about anything else

149
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:08,799
In Brazil people like sedative everybody who claimed to have been in the stadium that afternoon was actually there

150
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:12,383
The stadium would have needed to be the size of the Moon

151
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,175
And it was a big crowd

152
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:19,807
Some estimate that there were 250000 screaming fans packed into this Flying Saucer Stadium

153
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:22,367
Which is something like 80000 people

154
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,391
Overcapacity

155
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,671
And the players

156
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:31,071
When they walked out with just head with this rule of noise

157
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,375
The place is noisy is Wilkinson

158
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:36,703
But in the first half neither team scores

159
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,751
So the crowd is getting nervous

160
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,055
Everybody was getting tense

161
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:46,175
Then finally Brazil scores a goal just off the halftime

162
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:52,575
Olosho across the goalkeeper into the bottom corner than that and it's just this relay

163
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,111
Delete that surges

164
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,647
Pool around the crowd

165
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:58,975
Even the journalist run on and embrace the Plaza

166
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:02,559
Because basically everyone there thinks the game is all over

167
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,607
That Brazil has won the World Cup

168
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:09,471
Then Uruguay stores

169
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,287
About halfway through the second half

170
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:15,871
The description by whoever was days I just ate and fell

171
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,687
Very very nervous and this nervousness

172
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:21,247
Went to the play It's almost like they were losing the game

173
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:23,039
And then comes the moments

174
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,831
Everybody we've always in the rain

175
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:31,231
Alcides jija one of the year ago and winners gets the pool and dribbles down the right side toward the go

176
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:35,071
I'm just as he's looking out to Boston boo he notices

177
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,095
That's a

178
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:39,167
The goalkeeper Barbosa was actually walking

179
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,959
To try to anticipate the cross

180
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:44,287
Which meant Barbosa was out of position

181
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:48,127
Instead of passing the ball shoots

182
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,855
Older pools talk about the most

183
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,391
Student silence

184
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,415
Stadium

185
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:07,071
LCD G1 setting in his book

186
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,887
Only three people in the history of the mannequin

187
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:10,911
Aleister Crowley

188
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,447
Frank Sinatra

189
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,983
Pope John Paul II

190
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:14,751
Me

191
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,031
It's almost like a gravy

192
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,847
Some of the plays don't even remember what happened

193
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,895
State of Catatonia something

194
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:27,039
As you probably guessed by now Brazil does not manage to get another goal to Die the game

195
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:27,807
And Uruguay

196
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:28,575
When's

197
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:32,415
If the game ends the fan stream out of the stadium in back

198
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,951
Onto the streets of Rio

199
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,231
He's almost like

200
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,535
Some kind of hopeless happening people just

201
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,559
Went somewhere else

202
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,095
There was a

203
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,375
City of Solitude

204
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,655
This feeling of a

205
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,703
Of numbness

206
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:47,519
And Rio de Janeiro wasn't a Party City on the night

207
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:50,079
On the night of July 16

208
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,103
1950

209
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:55,711
There was a lot of public crying that's a lot of heart Hubley

210
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,015
1 Brazilian playwright cools to defeat

211
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,551
Brazil's Russia

212
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,343
Alright well that's just ridiculous

213
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,623
Which I think is

214
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,903
Bison board price

215
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,439
An exaggeration

216
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,463
Boss

217
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,511
People were really flying away

218
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:12,863
The recriminations came thick and fast

219
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:16,191
And soon races accusation starts to fly

220
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:18,751
Barbarossa the guy who played goalkeeper for

221
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,287
The Brazilians was black

222
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:24,895
D and two other black players on the team was scapegoated in the popular press

223
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,967
I'm Baba she was even hassled on the street

224
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:32,319
His life was my difficult that's tragic story he tells lights are in life

225
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:35,903
Of hearing woman are whispering to a child

226
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,975
This is the matter you might order Brazil cry

227
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:43,583
Often. The Brazilian team didn't pick another black goalkeeper

228
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,119
To start in the World Cup

229
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,655
Iva 50 years

230
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,703
And this wasn't a coincidence

231
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:54,079
Off to that game black goalkeepers were regarded as less reliable than white ones

232
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,639
Which is disgusting

233
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:00,735
But Barbosa wasn't the only focus of Brazilian

234
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:03,039
Everything about Brazilian soccer

235
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,063
Was scrutinized

236
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,623
Down to the uniforms the players were wearing

237
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:11,487
Tell towards his father the white shirt was cursed and I think everybody else in Brazil did

238
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,023
Add a bubble that was a

239
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,047
It's time animation

240
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:14,815
Never

241
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,095
Plain white shirts

242
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:20,703
It was pretty unusual for a team to completely transform their uniform

243
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,263
Most countries have played in the same colors since the

244
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,823
The first World Cup back in the early 20th century

245
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:29,407
The Brazilians decided their uniform was a problem

246
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:33,503
So in 1953 the Brazilian soccer authorities set up a competition

247
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:37,599
And advertised it international newspaper that's distributed all over Brazil

248
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:41,183
They wanted people to write in with their designs for a new

249
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,511
The contest had only one stipulation

250
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:49,375
The color of the uniform had to include the colors of the Brazilian flag

251
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,935
Green blue white and yellow

252
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:54,495
I designed it would truly represent Brazil

253
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,799
Hundreds of people enter the

254
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,079
Including

255
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:58,847
This guy

256
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,895
Naomi shimada

257
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,967
Csuci name is OG Garcia

258
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:08,319
Then I'm found on the board with

259
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,903
Aldea Garcia Chile

260
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,719
He was just 19 when he entered the competition

261
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:18,815
A young man who had grown up in a little town right on the border

262
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,351
Between Brazil and Uruguay

263
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,911
Slay wasn't designer

264
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,471
He was working a local newspaper as an illest

265
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:29,055
He says when he first heard about the competition

266
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,847
Ethio it'll be too difficult

267
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,639
Female breast

268
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:37,759
Yeah the first impression I had was that Jesus was foolish

269
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:42,367
That was ridiculous because it's rare to have a team with 4 colors

270
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,463
Working for colors into just the shirt

271
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:52,607
Would have been hard but eventually slay realize he could use the whole uniform to spread out the colors

272
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:55,423
He tried blue shorts with a green shirt

273
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:58,495
A yellow and green striped shirt with white shorts

274
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:01,055
A green and yellow striped shirt with blue shirt

275
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,383
He came up with over 200 different designs

276
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,175
Until eventually

277
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,199
He had it

278
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:08,735
Blue shorts

279
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:09,759
White Sox

280
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:13,087
And a yellow shirt with green trim around the neck in the sleeves

281
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:18,975
He sent the design off and a few weeks later he look down at the newspaper and saw his design

282
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:19,999
Staring back at him

283
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,279
He had one

284
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,815
Has any size

285
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:25,631
Engines for sale

286
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:28,191
After that was just a party

287
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:32,543
My feet didn't touch the ground and I will celebrate in The Newsroom where they were

288
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:38,431
It was like something Impossibles had just happiness

289
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:43,551
Aa31 Schlegel to bask in the glory of it all

290
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,319
For a while

291
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,599
You went to Rio

292
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:48,415
Did an internship with the newspaper that expunged

293
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,487
Even live with the Brazilian Plaza

294
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,255
For a few months

295
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,535
But eventually

296
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,327
He returned to his Motown

297
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,119
I'm kind of forgot about the shop

298
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:57,887
For a while

299
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,703
But pretty soon the shot was

300
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,471
Brazil

301
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:04,287
In 1962 the Brazilians won the World Cup

302
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,055
In Chile

303
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,591
And they were wearing

304
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,359
Play

305
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,127
Uniform

306
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:14,527
Players like Pele wore the yellow shirt in dazzled the world with their extraordinary skill and beauty

307
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,063
Ben color TV comes along

308
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:19,135
In the whole world can watch Brazil in brand-new Technicolor

309
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,951
Like in the 1970 World Cup in Mexico

310
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:28,607
Going to 5 when the 1970 World Cup was played on ice or Brazil win the 70 World Cup

311
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,655
In shimmering yellow shirt

312
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:33,215
His soccer store in David dobrik

313
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:34,751
Mermaid

314
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:39,871
Skin advisor memories at I think most people had even if they didn't see it

315
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:42,687
A vassal of brilliance

316
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,479
Of amazing citic Glide

317
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,271
South sunshine

318
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,927
Leopard seal head

319
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,463
Failed in 1950

320
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:57,023
The following years to success

321
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,047
Office success

322
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,863
They won World Cup off the World Cup

323
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,143
Daniella Chavez

324
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,679
Becoming as much homework

325
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,215
Is that intricate footwork

326
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,495
Dazzling play

327
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:09,311
Slaves design became icon

328
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,359
A symbol of Brazil

329
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,663
Full of sun and life

330
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:19,039
But for sleigh life wasn't quite living up to the image of Brazil he had created

331
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,111
He started working as a writer and academic

332
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,647
In a 1964

333
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:26,207
A brutal us backed military dictatorship

334
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,231
Power

335
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:27,999
Youku

336
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,791
And It Go like demonstration

337
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:32,863
Miami Airport

338
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,655
The new military government

339
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:37,215
Crackdown on people that considered to be severe

340
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,007
Including academics

341
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:42,079
Like a lot of other professors and students

342
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,103
Today was arrested

343
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,407
Did for basically being on the political life

344
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,687
What do you call a

345
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:48,735
He was expelled from his teacher

346
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:51,295
And was banned from leaving the country

347
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,831
Is pussy a man

348
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,927
Yeah I was traumatized

349
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:59,743
My wife and my children will suffer a lot

350
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,535
Sophia was moving to

351
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:09,471
The dictatorship lasted for about 20 years but despite the difficulties of living under the watchful eye of them

352
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,239
Military police

353
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,543
Play became a successful writer

354
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,567
I need developed

355
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,847
And academic specialty

356
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:19,455
Play spent his life writing about the border between Brazil and Uruguay

357
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:24,319
It was so easy. Don't I am a citizen who has a heart

358
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:27,135
Antibody divided between Brazil and Uruguay

359
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,463
Slay one

360
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,999
Technically born in Brazil

361
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,815
But less than a mile from the border with Uruguay

362
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,863
Is that when he was a kid

363
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:39,423
His father helped build a bridge across the river.

364
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,703
Separates Uruguay

365
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,471
Brazil

366
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:42,495
Your soul

367
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,263
Bluetooth

368
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,823
I am from the era when the bridge was built

369
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,383
My father went to help do the breed

370
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,711
So I always been very connected to

371
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:57,599
