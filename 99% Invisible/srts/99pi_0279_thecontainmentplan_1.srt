I'm Roman Mars

30
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:32,672
It's hard to overstate the vest

31
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:34,976
Of the skid row neighborhood in LA

32
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:38,560
It spans roughly 50 blocks which is about 1/5

33
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:41,376
The entire downtown area of Los Angeles

34
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,424
In some ways the streets

35
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,472
Skid Row are built like other parts of LA

36
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,520
That's reporter Carla Greene

37
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:51,872
There corner stores in Street vendors selling everything from jewelry to loose cigarettes

38
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,408
The Old Brick

39
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:55,712
Townhouses filled with low income housing

40
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:58,272
Their parts were grown-ups gather to talk

41
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,064
Children gather to play

42
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:03,904
But it's also very clear When you entered Skid Row

43
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,952
The one thing there's the smell

44
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,048
Streets of skid row off Instinct of urine and other excrement

45
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:12,352
Baking under the hot Los Angeles Sun

46
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,888
The gutters are lined with

47
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:14,656
The trash

48
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:18,752
The sidewalks are mostly and on some blocks entirely

49
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,032
Occupied by

50
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:20,800
People's make sure

51
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:21,568
Shift homes

52
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:24,384
A dizzying array of tarps and Tents

53
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,176
Stretch out for blocks and blocks

54
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,480
One structured reading up against the next

55
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:29,504
Nginx

56
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:32,064
And there are lots of people on the street

57
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,624
Many of them pushing special red shopping carts

58
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:41,280
The carts are handed out by a local advocacy group because the police used to arrest people for having what they believed worst

59
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,304
Stolen shopping cart

60
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:45,888
It's all a person got to do is just be homeless and come here

61
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:48,704
You're standing at a register give you a shopping cart

62
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,240
People

63
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:53,824
Using music to put their property around and stuff like that in

64
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,360
Panda Pop Statham

65
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:58,944
That's General dogon walking around skid row with me

66
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:02,528
Is a community organizer and lifelong resident of the neighborhood

67
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:05,088
Has lived in both low-income housing and on the street

68
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,928
So this year so I'm born and raised on Skid Row my parents met

69
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:09,952
Joe Kenda 50

70
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,512
They both got a job at Bullock's department store

71
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:13,792
7th and Broadway

72
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,096
When I went to lunch

73
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:18,912
Fell in love I was born nine months later in general hosp

74
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,216
And I've been down ever since

75
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:27,360
Walking through skid row it's not hard to see when you reach the edge

76
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:30,432
The line that divides Skid Row from the rest of downtown

77
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:35,808
And if you stand right there you'll notice that you're at the intersection of two radically different neighborhood

78
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,368
So Main Street is a divider line

79
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,696
Mainstreeters / between 1/2 and 1/2.

80
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,488
Because you got homeless people

81
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:47,072
Does sleeping on one side of street in The Loft buildings on the other side of street

82
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:50,144
And some of the homeless people lay down and they can look up

83
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:56,032
End in Los Angeles

84
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:58,848
That dividing line between Haves and Have Nots

85
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:01,152
Skid Row in the rest of downtown

86
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,688
It wasn't drawn by Axel

87
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:05,504
Result of a very specific plan

88
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,552
Homeless people on one side

89
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,320
And development

90
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,088
On the other

91
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,136
Explain that someone surprisingly

92
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:13,440
Was written and fought for by advocates

93
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,976
Skid Row's resident population

94
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,791
Back in the early 20th century

95
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:20,351
The railroad went through downtown Los Angeles

96
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,655
Right around where Skid Row is now

97
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,215
And like many other cities around the country

98
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,519
A neighborhood formed around the train tracks

99
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:31,615
What what what do we have in front of us

100
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,943
The first thing Ryan Atkins a Los Angeles CA

101
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:39,551
A beautiful yeah it's enough for 1909

102
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:40,575
And the reason I

103
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:41,599
About the sound is

104
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,671
Pictorial hair 19 + 9 actually predate

105
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:48,767
Back on the area now known as Skid Row started to develop

106
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:54,143
There weren't any zoning laws in LA to say what types of developments were allowed in different areas

107
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:57,983
And so what about the time you can have the Confluence of

108
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,007
The real

109
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,031
And the Los Angeles

110
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,847
Produce in agricultural markets at the same point

111
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:06,175
Which brought a large transient population

112
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,711
The railroad workers

113
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:09,503
And agricultural workers

114
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,063
I've gone through the archives of the LA Times

115
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,855
Dimensions of skid row back

116
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,647
100 years ago

117
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,183
Around the turn of the century

118
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,231
Blasey of the UCLA emeritus

119
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:24,607
Professor was a housing and homeless advocate in and around Skid Row back in the 70s and 80s

120
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:27,935
So it grew up around the Rail Yards around downtown

121
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:33,823
And the people that were referred to in the LA times as for example bums

122
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,383
All the way up into the 70s

123
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,943
Most people in Skid Row live in cheap apartments

124
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,247
Single room occupancy hotels or

125
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,015
Sros

126
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,807
They're homeless people but

127
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,647
Fewer than there are now

128
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,415
Was

129
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,951
Homelessness was just

130
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:54,559
Again General dogon who's living in Skid Row in the south

131
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,095
So you had a

132
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:59,423
You had occasional rhinos inventory on with white males

133
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:02,751
Indominus you drink white board and all that kind of stuff

134
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:07,359
Skid-row was not yet the sprawling tent city that it would go on to become

135
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:11,455
But it was still considered a rough neighborhood where people went to seek out drugs

136
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:13,759
Or drink all day and sleep on benches

137
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,063
And homeless population was growing

138
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:21,951
A skid row grew the greater downtown area of La was also growing

139
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:22,719
Developing

140
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:23,999
Developers

141
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,303
Didn't like what was happening in Skid Row

142
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,607
Stop for example the Union Rescue Mission

143
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,399
I was on Main Street

144
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:37,055
And there were lots of people there and it was full all the time there were people lined up outside a lot of activity there

145
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:42,175
There was simply an open-air drug Market

146
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:44,479
Around the corner of 5th and Main Street

147
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:47,807
And so a plan emerged in 1972

148
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:52,159
A plan drafted by group of businesspeople and endorsed by many City officials

149
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,719
Remove Skid Row population out

150
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:57,279
Enveloped the area for new more money resume

151
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,583
It was known as the Silver Bullet

152
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,375
That was essentially

153
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,655
To raise Skid Row

154
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:03,935
Take everyone out

155
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,215
Bulldoze buildings

156
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:06,495
Start fresh

157
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:10,335
Of course residents of skid row and their Advocates didn't like this new plan

158
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:13,151
And they began thinking about how to fight it

159
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,711
One of those people was Charles elsasser

160
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,735
A young lawyer at the

161
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:19,039
Who remembers coming across some research

162
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:21,855
It showed that when you bulldoze a neighborhood like Skid Row

163
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:24,927
It just means more Skid Row like neighborhood pop-up Elsa

164
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:28,255
What I did when we weren't quite sure whether it was true and such

165
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:30,815
True or not

166
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:31,583
The theory

167
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,351
Was useful

168
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,655
But it was it was it was a very can

169
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,191
Useful

170
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,471
Theory

171
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:41,055
For purposes of saying this is a mistake

172
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:43,103
Did that whole idea was a mistake

173
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:47,455
The theory that Skid Row will just pop up somewhere else in Fresno

174
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,223
Smoove

175
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,319
Scared people who didn't want skedros residents to end up in their neighborhood

176
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:55,903
Some of these scared people join the skid row activist cause

177
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:56,927
And the activist

178
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:57,951
We're happy to have them

179
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,975
It really did

180
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,767
You know come up with this

181
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,303
Idea that

184
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,191
But also really really help

185
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,471
The Advocate

186
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,007
And so

187
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,799
Armed with their one study

188
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:17,151
Elsasser and other activists came up with an idea to replace the silver book plan

189
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:19,455
Which would bulldoze Skid Row

190
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,223
With another one

191
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,783
Here's Jeff Dietrich who helped write the new plan

192
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,087
We develop was called the Blue Book

193
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,135
Jeff Dietrich and his wife

194
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:27,903
Kathryn Morris

195
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,439
I've been longtime advocates for

196
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,207
The homeless

197
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:33,279
They run a well-known Soup Kitchen in Skid Row called the hippie

198
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,839
The Bluebook plan was this

199
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,631
To contain the spread

200
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,655
Skid Row

201
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:41,983
It's basically what's it called the containment plan

202
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:46,335
This new plan will call it the containment plan from here on out

203
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,639
Propose some pretty radical ideas

204
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,943
Including getting all the missions

205
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:53,247
Going to Charities and other homeless services

206
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,295
To physically move their offices

207
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,599
So they be within the newly drawn borders of

208
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,367
Skid Row

209
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,391
Again

210
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,159
Gary blasi

211
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,439
The deal was

212
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:04,511
All the services that tend to attract

213
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,815
Homeless people will be concentrated

214
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,375
To the east of Spring Street

215
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,655
And

216
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,447
Here in exchange for that

217
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:19,103
The Redevelopment agency will not only not bulldoze all of the sros but it will

218
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:23,455
Also find a separate nonprofit called the SRO housing

219
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:30,367
The SRO Housing Trust would be charged with protecting and maintaining a whole slew of low income housing in Skid Row

220
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,671
The actor who spent several months

221
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,719
Writing and developing the containment plan

222
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:38,559
Any work every angle trying to get the city to take it serious

223
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:39,839
So

224
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,375
Someone knew someone

225
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,911
In the city council

226
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,191
That's Kathryn Morris

227
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:48,543
Explaining that they got someone to distribute a draft of the plan to everyone on City Council

228
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:49,823
And so

229
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,103
They agreed

230
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:53,919
That while there was a lunch break

231
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,991
That they would bring these and put them at every

232
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,807
So the people came back in the council

233
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,087
Came back in

234
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,623
Shut down

235
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,903
Picked up first thing on there

236
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:07,999
Paging through this where this come from I don't know where it came from

237
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:11,839
The containment plan was enough of a compromise that somehow

238
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:12,863
Amazingly

239
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:13,631
It went out

240
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:16,191
It wasn't a legally binding agreement but

241
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,983
I want you to find the city's approach to

242
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:18,751
Skid Row

243
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:19,519
For decades

244
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,823
And it was a totally unique approach

245
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:25,151
Who said no one else was doing what they were doing

246
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,455
Nobody really seems to have done it sent

247
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:31,551
Elsasser says he's worked on lots of campaign

248
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,599
To save skid-row like neighborhoods

249
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,391
Housing projects in the 70s

250
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:38,463
But Skid Row was the only time he's used containment

251
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,231
Ed Estrada

252
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:43,327
The containment plan Mayberry suggestions on how to keep

253
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,399
Skid Row types within the new borders of the neighborhood

254
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:49,215
There's a section of the plan called inducements

255
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:49,983
That reads

256
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,031
Toilet public restrooms benches

257
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:55,359
Pleasant Open Spaces within the contained area of Skid Row

258
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:58,431
The residents might be inclined to confine their activities to

259
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,455
The immediate area

260
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:01,503
That section would serve as a magnet

261
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,551
Ahold undesirable population Alamo

262
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:04,575
In Skid Row

263
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:05,855
Not against their will

264
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,391
But of their own accord

265
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,719
And the plant talks about a buffer zone

266
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:14,303
Which would create a border between skid row and the rest of downtown

267
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,327
Strong Edge

268
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,607
Will act as buffers

269
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,143
Skid row and the rest

270
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:18,911
Central City

271
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,471
When the skid row resident enters the buffer

272
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,751
The psychological comfort

273
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,543
Familiar skid-row environment

274
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,311
Will be lost

275
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,847
You will feel for it

276
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:33,247
And will not be inclined to travel far from the area of containment

277
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:36,575
Payment policy was officially adopted in 1976

278
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,367
City started to implement it

279
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:45,023
Including many of the meticulous and uncomfortable suggestions of how exactly to contain Skid Row's population

280
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,559
Like the buffer zone

281
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:51,423
And I don't remember how I know this but I do remember learning app is bad

282
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,471
Graduate students from

283
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:58,847
USC you were hired basically to shadow people living in Skid Row

284
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:01,663
Answer keep track on a map of where they went

285
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,711
Answer the question was how

286
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:06,015
Bronner buffer zone did you need

287
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,831
How far do people Wander from Skid Row

288
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:13,439
And I think the determination was made that you need a buffer about 2 blocks

289
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:19,839
The city also began using unpleasant design like annoying bright lights on Skid Row's bordering Street

290
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:23,167
To keep homeless people from wanting to expand their territory

291
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:26,495
A Main Street always had the regular Fantasy Life

292
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,287
Directions to old metal

293
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,567
What's the best down

294
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,591
And that was it

295
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,127
General dogon

296
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,663
It's all when they start

297
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,199
Building The Lofts on Main

298
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:38,527
They came pacifically and they put these big ass

299
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,295
Prison life

300
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,343
I know they found no prison lights when I see you

301
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:45,439
All right about this big and a brown can go over there and look at it

302
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,487
Targeting

303
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:53,887
People who like me who come outside the SRO and smoke cigarettes hang out front of the building or

304
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:57,727
And then there was a more aggressive measures

305
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:01,311
If you stayed within the borders of skid row very lazy says

306
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,103
The cops might not bother you

307
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,127
But

308
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,663
Yeah if you crossed over

309
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:08,735
That border then if you

310
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:12,575
Looks like you might belong on skid-row the cops were going to stop

311
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:15,391
The containment Zone made some

312
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:18,207
Practical sense both for the city and the resident

313
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:18,975
Skid Row

314
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:22,815
But it's also an uncomfortable dehumanizing idea

315
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:23,839
Is Warehouse

316
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:24,863
Warehouse

317
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:25,887
Is what

318
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,679
Is where you store

319
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:28,959
Great

320
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:29,727
If so

321
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:34,335
You're the idea was to push all of the city of Los Angeles

322
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,615
Is unfavorable citizen

323
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,175
Right in one general area

324
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:42,015
Elsasser the lawyer who helped write the plan says

325
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:44,831
If the way it's written sound unempathetic or even

326
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:45,599
Defensive

327
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:46,623
That's because

328
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,671
They weren't trying to run a PR campaign

329
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:52,255
They weren't trying to change politicians Minds about Skid Row's residence

330
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:57,119
They were desperately frantically trying to save Skid Row from being paved over

331
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:59,679
And containment was better than doing nothing

332
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:08,639
He always spoken of it rather derisively maybe we could have thought of a better name

333
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:11,711
What is better than the Federation

334
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:17,599
Yeah I guess you didn't catch that would be better than in obliteration plan

335
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:23,999
For better or worse over the course of just a few years La Skid Row became the place to go

336
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:26,047
So if you are homeless in Los Angeles

337
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:30,655
Some hospitals would even discharge patients there if they didn't have a fixed address

338
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:34,239
God in south-central you know

339
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,775
Roundabout

340
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:38,847
You know there's very few service providers

341
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,639
They give 24-hour access

342
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,175
There's no place

343
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:45,247
You know out of South Central Community

344
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:50,111
Well home people can go to in everyday get three meals be able to go take a shower baby

345
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,391
Bathroom stuff like that

346
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,695
Car trade in one area

347
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:54,719
So

348
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:57,023
Out in South Central if you homeless

349
00:14:57,535 --> 00:15:00,351
If it draws you to Skid Row

350
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:04,703
La was fumbling all of its homeless people to Skid Row

351
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,519
And in the 1980s the homeless population of

352
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,543
Los Angeles begin

353
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,311
Explode

354
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:12,383
Crack was decimating black communities across the city

355
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,943
And many of these newly addicted people

356
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,223
We're going to Skid Row

357
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,527
Today there's a new epidemic

358
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,575
Smokable cocaine

359
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,367
Otherwise known as

360
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:29,023
Super addictive and deadly cocaine concentrate the crack problem has become a crack crisis and it's spreading Nationwide

361
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,607
What is an explosively destructive and often lethal substance

362
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,655
Which is crushing its users

363
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,215
In the midst of the crack epidemic

364
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,263
Back in the escalating War on Drugs

365
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,823
Reagan aggressively cut back the welfare state

366
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:44,127
Which drastically shrink the space

367
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,151
Between poverty

368
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,503
Skid Row I wasn't mostly white male alcoholic

369
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:52,575
One thing I became overwhelmingly black

370
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,623
You started seeing families in the street

371
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:58,463
People might have otherwise taken a room in single-occupancy hotels

372
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,743
Just enough for the money

373
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:03,071
3 days in a motel

374
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:05,119
In LA with three with with 200 dollars

375
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:09,215
Tell people like hell I'm not going to keep my $200 and get it

376
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,055
And save my money to eat on

377
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:16,639
Gary blasi was young Advocate at the legal aid Foundation

378
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,431
He remembers us

379
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,711
Skid-row was so crowded

380
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,735
I felt unsafe

381
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,271
I want from

382
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:26,367
You would see you know a few people in a block to you would see a hundred people

383
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,647
Autoblog

384
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,439
Meaning of basically

385
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:32,511
People wear shoulder to shoulder

386
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,071
And so the density was just

387
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,143
I mean it was like it was a completely insane

388
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:38,911
Price

389
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,191
Blasey remembers that

390
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:46,591
For Christmas of 1984 in an effort to get folk some shelter he and some other Advocate set up two big tents with a bunch of

391
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:49,919
Cots on an empty patch of land just opposite City Hall

392
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,711
Pretty soon there were

393
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:54,783
800 people sleeping on cots in those shots

394
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:03,487
The last couple of decades conditions on Skid Row have changed a bit there are fewer homeless people

395
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:06,559
They are no longer sleeping shoulder-to-shoulder on the street

396
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:11,167
But skid row has endured as a place for homeless people to live and find services

397
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,751
Even as other skid-row style neighborhoods around the country

398
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:19,871
We're eating up by gentrification and their residents were scattered around their respective cities

399
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,919
Over the years

400
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:24,991
The sense of community and skid row has only gotten stronger

401
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:28,063
Has become not just a hub for social services

402
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:28,831
But for activism

403
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,367
From poverty and homelessness

404
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,415
And we always seen it afternoon

405
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,463
Right

406
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:39,583
I get more a how you doing brother what's up how you doing

407
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,375
Skid Row

408
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,167
Then I do when I walk on the

409
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,191
The Java file

410
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,615
This is a community

411
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:52,639
Dalian

412
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,175
We work

413
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,711
To make this a community

414
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:05,183
Apart from the containment plan there's another major reason why skid row has not been taken over by new apartment buildings

415
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,207
And that's

416
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,231
Zoning

417
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:13,119
Aside from the single room occupancy hotels in a bit of other low-income housing that was grandfathered in

418
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:16,959
Most of skid row is zoned industrial other than commercial

419
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:17,983
Or residential

420
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,775
Again city planner Brian

421
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:23,615
In the eastern half of skid row where it is zoned Industrial

422
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,383
That has

423
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:27,967
Precluded the expansion or the ability to create a new housing

424
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,783
But all of that could soon change

425
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,879
Los Angeles is currently undertaking a Total Recall of its zoning code

426
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,415
Starting with downtown

427
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:39,487
And a lot of skid row that was formerly zoned Industrial

428
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:42,303
Will probably be rezoned as mixed use

429
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:45,119
There are a lot of vacant buildings in Skid Row

430
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:48,959
And the city would like to make some of that real estate available for housing

431
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:52,031
Many residents of skid row would love to have new housing

432
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,823
They've been asking for it for years

433
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:57,663
Having more housing has been been something that they have

434
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,199
Expresses is something that

435
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,479
Critical for the neighborhood

436
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:05,087
Having grocery stores with Vino healthy and accessible and cheap food

437
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:07,903
The city is basically saying in order to give you housing

438
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:08,927
We have to rezone

439
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:12,511
Let's get real residents want new housing in the neighborhood to be affordable

440
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:15,327
And that isn't something that can be dealt with through zoning

441
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:19,167
Zoning can say whether an area is industrial or residential or mix

442
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,983
I can't say if housing will be affordable

443
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,543
That would have to be done legislatively

444
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,615
Some residents believe

445
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:31,199
Political leaders could find a way to build affordable housing in the neighborhood

446
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,223
But instead

447
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,783
No use the rezoning process as an excuse

448
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,343
Open up the real estate market and get them out

449
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,135
Like Craig r

450
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,927
Do you want to give me his last name but

451
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,975
He's a longtime resident of Skid Row

452
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:45,535
And he says zoning is just a tool

453
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,815
The tool they want to use

454
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,351
Get rid of homeless people

455
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,399
And create this new

456
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,191
Location program uses only

457
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:54,751
They've they're planning on making billions of dollars

458
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,823
By pushing us out squeezing us out or kicking us out

459
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:00,639
Meaning of support People to disadvantaged People

460
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,431
Butler homeless and n+

461
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:04,479
The residents of the neighborhood

462
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,039
Even without zoning change

463
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,575
Skid Row is getting smaller

464
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:14,207
Containment was never a legally binding agreement in the city seems to be increasingly less Guided by

465
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,743
Is a whole neighborhood

466
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:19,839
Actually that juts up again skid row that used to essentially be a part of it

467
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:23,423
The new hip neighborhood filled with art galleries in sheet Cafe

468
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,447
It's called

469
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,215
The artist

470
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:29,055
Tennessee areas around Skid Row have continued to identify

471
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,335
Taking bites out of the edges

472
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,103
The neighborhood

473
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:33,151
Skid Row itself has changed

474
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,199
Including General.

475
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,223
Police car

476
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,015
In 2006

477
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:40,319
Citylife they call us a precisionist

478
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:42,879
Which brought a Huntington extra police Skid Row

479
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:45,439
But I containment zone is being broken up

480
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,975
Busted up by the police

481
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:49,023
The police come in

482
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,559
Swinging billy club people

483
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,327
To spread out

484
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,655
And so that's why you got the chance all by the freeway all over here

485
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:56,191
Because people say

486
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:59,519
You'll be over here on 43rd Street in my tent

487
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:03,359
Play chill out on San Julian Street

488
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:05,919
Against the wall being jacked up three or four times

489
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:11,295
Back in 1976

490
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:16,416
Swen elsasser and Morris and other activists came up with the containment plan they included a map

491
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:19,744
That laid out exactly what the borders of skid row would be

492
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:22,560
They were trying to make a deal. Kind of compromise

493
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,608
We'll stay over here

494
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:27,424
Just don't try to push us out with new development

495
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:32,544
Animals that contain

496
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:41,504
Just a couple weeks ago is Skipper residence and activist we're out on the street fighting for those same borders

497
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,296
The ones from the 1970s

498
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,320
Containment plan

499
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:46,112
But with a different attitude

500
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:48,672
But I'm trying to contain Skid Row

501
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:49,952
They're trying to contain

502
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:50,720
Develop

503
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:51,744
Or at least

504
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,280
The luxury housing development that

505
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,560
Currently being considered

506
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,584
Right at the edge of the sky

507
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:59,168
It's a 33-story high-rise apartment building

508
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:01,472
Just need approval from the local councilman

509
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:02,240
Move forward

510
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:04,800
About two dozen people at the protest

511
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,592
Including General dogon

512
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,128
This is ours

513
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:09,664
Don't build here

514
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,432
They're saying

515
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:11,968
Or else

516
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,656
La Skid Row was not the first

517
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:34,496
Skid Row Avery Chapman has a story of what is rumored to be the first use

518
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,264
Of the phrase

519
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:36,288
After this

520
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,104
Between the beats

521
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,408
Bongs and chatter of our devices

522
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,176
We're immersed

523
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:44,992
In a cluttered World a man-made sound

524
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,016
If

525
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:50,368
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexa

526
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:56,256
Is talking to me and my wife is in another room in a kid is another word for all hearing that voice

527
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,280
Technology

528
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,048
You talk to us

529
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,352
It is a creation of Sonic trash

530
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:03,424
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

531
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:07,008
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

532
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,800
To make them more human

533
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,896
Turn the living room lights on

534
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:14,688
Okay

535
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,224
Dim the living room lights

536
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,248
50%

537
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,040
Okay

538
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:25,440
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

539
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,744
Makes for a much more natural

540
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,512
Experience

541
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,304
Turn the living room lights on

542
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:34,400
Dim the living room lights to 50%

543
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:43,104
We're presenting two special episodes from 99percentinvisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation about how are sound

544
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,896
Landscape is impacting our health

545
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:47,456
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

546
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:50,272
Look for them Friday is May 17th and May 24th

547
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,040
Right here

548
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,576
Npip

549
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,928
We need to talk about something

550
00:23:57,184 --> 00:24:03,328
Constipation abdominal pain and bloating yourself it's not that bad you take laxatives you modify your diet

551
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:06,144
But thinking about it all the time is frustrating

552
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:12,544
It doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again and you don't know why

553
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,848

Oh my God

557
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,464
Some of this video with a rich Hoffman and Quintanilla you were doing a story in Seattle

558
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,488
Where

559
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:33,536
You ended up on another Skid Row

560
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:34,816
And not just

561
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:39,168
Any skid row it was maybe where the name Skid Row comes from

562
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:41,472
And if you go to Seattle

563
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:42,752
And you go downtown

564
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:45,312
Yuan counter place called Pioneer Square

565
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:50,176
Should actually a triangle and it is the tourist area and

566
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,200
Seattle

567
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,736
Used to be a really big logging town

568
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:56,320
And the mill used to be right downtown so

569
00:24:56,576 --> 00:25:00,672
Loggers will go up into the hills and chop down these massive huge

570
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:03,232
Trees and they lubricate them with fish oil

571
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,768
And hook the logs up to

572
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:06,560
The teams of oxen and mules

573
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:12,960
And then would run the logs down this road over the mountain that would be called dragon or skidding

574
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:13,728
The Lox

575
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:14,752
Skating the logs

576
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,544
Makes this road the skid

577
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:19,360
Wrote it was called skid Road

578
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,384
With a D

579
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,432
According to my guide Dina Jerian

580
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:29,088
And that street is now called yesler way because Henry yesler was the owner of the mill at the end of the street where the logs are being

581
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,112
Get it down to

582
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,648
And the smell

583
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:33,440
Is also very close to the seaport

584
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:35,488
And so here in this part of town

585
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,256
You got

586
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,280
The sailors

587
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:41,120
Who are taking their Shore leave and then these loggers or like

588
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,912
A lot of guys around

589
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,960
And they got these hard jobs

590
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:47,008
With long periods of downtime

591
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:49,824
They are looking for action and fun luckily

592
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:53,152
Seattle in this area in the skid row was here provide

593
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,944
Before there was Vegas

594
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,736
Sin City was right here

595
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:58,528
M bars lot of brothels

596
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,576
So this is the original Skid Row

597
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:06,976
Maybe maybe

598
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,536
Term of the logging industry in other parts of the world

599
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:15,680
I don't know if those other skid roads also developed like bars and red light districts in Reno

600
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:17,216
Rough attitudes but

601
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:18,752
That's definitely what happened in Seattle

602
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,800
More about that in the future story

Might cost you your life

639
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:13,952
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

640
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:18,304
Or lose a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

641
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,632
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like

642
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:22,656
A dad

643
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:27,008
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

644
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:31,360
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that kind

645
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:38,784
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

646
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:42,112
Was found dead in my private gym

647
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:45,440
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

648
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:49,792
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

649
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,072
Now

650
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:53,120
I need to clear my name

651
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:59,520
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes to find them
