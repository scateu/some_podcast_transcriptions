This is 99% invisible

19
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,376
I'm Roman Mars

20
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:18,592
If you live in an American city and you walk outside to a major intersection and look into this

21
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:19,616
Streets

22
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:26,016
You know what you'll say you'll see cars and trucks and buses you might see a few bicycles trying to sneak

23
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:32,416
Either way through the traffic but you won't see our people not on the street anyway maybe on the sidewalk waiting for their turn to cross

24
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:34,208
And I'm crossing quickly

25
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:38,048
Hurrying to get out of the way so that the cars can get going again

26
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,840
In recent times

27
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:43,168
Some of us are coming to think the city streets shouldn't just be for cars

28
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:45,472
And trucks the cars take up too much space

29
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:46,752
Lewis too much carbon

30
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,312
Just to move a couple of people a short distance

31
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,616
But even those anti-car haters

32
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:52,640
And I am one

33
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,944
We know the streets belong to our enemy

34
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:57,248
We look both ways before Crossing

35
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:59,040
We don't let her children play in the streets

36
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,576
We might sometimes jaywalk

37
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,624
Across the street at the wrong place or time

38
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,184
But we know in our heart of hearts were in the wrong

39
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,208
Scofflaws

40
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,072
That's a reporter Jesse Dukes

41
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:15,424
This is a story about jaywalking where that word jaywalking came from

42
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,288
And how it was a weapon in a turf war between the people who Wanted cars in the streets

43
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,336
And everybody else

44
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,152
You can

45
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,176
Probably guess who won

46
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:34,624
All right there's a wonderful cartoon in the St Louis Post Dispatch from 1923

47
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:37,440
It's called the modern moloch

48
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:39,488
And moloch was

49
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,024
A daddy

50
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,096
Of the ammonites

51
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:47,424
A historian at the University of Virginia who studies cities

52
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,960
Moloch was a daddy too

53
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:49,984
To whom the ammonites

54
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,776
Sacrifice their own children

55
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:54,080
In return for prosperity

56
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:56,384
What an image for what the car was

57
00:02:57,152 --> 00:03:02,784
Because the ideas that you were sacrificing our children in the name of modern technology

58
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,832
According to Peter Norton

59
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:09,952
There was a time in the 1920s when it look like

60
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,512
In this particular cartoon

61
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:16,608
You see a driver kneeling at an altar

62
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,376
Which is

63
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,912
The front grill of a

64
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:19,680
Car

65
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:20,960
With a huge

66
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:22,240
Full of

67
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,776
The corpses of children

68
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,336
Offering it up to the mouth of this

69
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,872
Machine Beast

70
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,920
As a sacrifice

71
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,736
It's it's a very striking cards

72
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,296
And it may seem a little

73
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:39,136
Bizarre to us today until you recognize that this thing was

74
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:41,184
Killing thousands of children every year

75
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:45,536
So that was 1923 90 years ago

76
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:49,888
But understand why cars were being compared to a child eating God

77
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,448
We've got to go back a few more years

78
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,752
And so she went back a hundred

79
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,032
110 years

80
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,336
I think you'd be amazed to see

81
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,360
People just

82
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,152
Strolling right into the street

83
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,200
Anyplace anytime

84
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,224
Sure they'll look

85
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,760
But not very carefully

86
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,296
At the turn of the century

87
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:10,624
There is nothing moving faster than about 5 or 10 miles an hour

88
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:14,976
Responsible parents would say their children go outside and play in the streets

89
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,000
All day

90
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:19,839
Even after the first cars appeared in the cities right around 1900

91
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:23,167
They had to conform to the customs of the day

92
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:25,215
Which meant that traffic

93
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:27,775
Slowly

94
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:30,079
There's wonderful video

95
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:32,383
Like 1905 people walking down mark

96
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,151
Street

97
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,967
And San Francisco before the earthquake

98
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,247
And people are just

99
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,551
Striding right in wherever they want to go

100
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,087
Children

101
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:43,135
People carrying

102
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,927
You know Boards of wood

103
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,975
Are people going about their business

104
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,255
It's not to say that the

105
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,279
The street

106
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,815
Off of the sidewalks

107
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:53,887
For everybody because people prefer the sidewalk

108
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:56,703
It's dryer it's cleaners got less horse manure

109
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,519
There weren't even really many rules about what you could do or not do

110
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:02,591
People are solving problems the way they solve problems

111
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,407
When you're walking in a crowded hallway like

112
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,687
You know I love in a car

113
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,735
High School building between classes and you have

114
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,527
Huge crowd of kids or something

115
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,807
Trying to find a way

116
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,415
And they start to figure stuff out like you know usually keep right while you're walking

117
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,695
It's not like the law

118
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:23,327
You know but there's no understanding you go that way I'll go this way I'll keep that right I'll get that guys are going to go to the right or to the left

119
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,119
Free from England and I think

120
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:28,191
The closest thing we have to that now is a city park

121
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,727
Or maybe a pedestrian Mall

122
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,263
You go to a city park

123
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,335
And you you're mostly Guided by

124
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:38,687
Understanding understanding psych you can use the park for whatever you want

125
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:40,991
Provided you don't endanger other people

126
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,783
You don't break the law

127
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,831
And you don't make a nuisance out of yourself

128
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,903
And then you pretty much okay and it's a lot like that in Street

129
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,975
Bubba 1922 things changed

130
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:51,743
For once

131
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,303
Cities in America where filling up with people

132
00:05:54,815 --> 00:06:00,959
This is right in the midst of the Industrial Revolution when Americans were leaving Farms to move to cities to work in Factory

133
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,239
Or maybe

134
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,031
In the middle class if they're lucky

135
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,567
So the streets

136
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,615
We're starting to get more crowded

137
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,919
You probably heard of the other Big Chain

138
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,711
The Model T Ford

139
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:13,759
The first affordable automobile

140
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,551
Introduced in 1908

141
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,599
Mass produced in 1913

142
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,623
Price is just

143
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,903
Is falling every year

144
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:24,767
Buy 1920 a new model T without any extras

145
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,815
You could get for $300

146
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:33,727
And this is really now in the reach of the working-class the people who make the Ford Model T can afford to buy it at

147
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,519
Principal dear to the heart

148
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,055
Henry Ford

149
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,335
By the 1920s

150
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,615
Cities are crowding with

151
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,663
Any people are buying cars

152
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,455
Driving cars in the street

153
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:45,503
Drivers don't want to drive 5 or

154
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:46,783
18 miles an hour

155
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,063
Speedway Street traffic

156
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,343
For decades

157
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,367
They want to drive

158
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,135
Faster

159
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:54,719
And the pedestrians in children still linger in the street

160
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,511
Walking casually

161
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,815
Like it's 1906

162
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:02,399
And every year more people are killed in automobile a

163
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,751
Fatalities are rising and you can watch the Curve

164
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:07,519
You know it's like

165
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,799
Climbing a mountain you just

166
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,847
Going uphill the whole way

167
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,383
Buy 1920s

168
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:18,015
3 you've got about 17 18 thousand people a year being killed

169
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,807
Buy Motor Vehicles

170
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:22,367
Three-quarters of those people are possessed

171
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:26,207
Half of the pedestrians killed in the cities are chilled

172
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,231
Under the age of

173
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:27,999
16

174
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:31,327
As far as the public is concerned it's almost like they died in a war

175
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,631
Parades are held in dozens of cities to

176
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,911
Commemorate the dead children

177
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,191
Monuments are built

178
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:38,495
Mothers of children killed in the streets are giving us

179
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,519
Special White

180
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,287
Start

181
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,311
To honor their loss

182
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,871
And that's why in 1923

183
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:46,687
We see a cartoon comparing the automobile

184
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,711
Kamala

185
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:52,319
A God who demands the sacrifice of children for prosperity

186
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,879
And we get lots of newspaper article

187
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:58,207
Editorial saying this bloodbath has to end

188
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:00,255
And almost all of them blame the deaths

189
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,535
On the automobile

190
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,583
Like this from The New York Times

191
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,119
The horrors of

192
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,143
War

193
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:06,911
Les Paul

194
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,191
The horrors of

195
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:08,959
Peace

196
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,983
The automobile

197
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,007
Thumbs up

198
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,543
Far more destructive machina

199
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:13,823
The machine gun

200
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,615
The Reckless motorist

201
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,895
Deals Moore death

202
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:17,919
Artilleryman

203
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,455
The man in the streets

204
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,479
Seems less safe

205
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,759
The man in the trench

206
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,551
The greatest single leaf

207
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,087
The automobile

208
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,623
Elect shambles

209
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:30,975
Near X

210
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,887
In cities begin to think seriously about restricting the use of cars in the cities

211
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,959
City managers bukit outlawing curb parking

212
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:44,031
Are forcing cars to make right-angle turns

213
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:46,591
Around obstacles and intersections

214
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,639
So they have to slow to a crawl

215
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:52,991
Dubai 1923 a whole cottage industry has grown up around the automobile

216
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,783
There are the manufacturers

217
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,319
But also the dealers

218
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:58,111
You've been making a lot of money in the last few years

219
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,647
And there are motor

220
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,975
Switch word for curses to AAA and make a lot of money selling members

221
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,023
According to Peter Norton

222
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,815
There's a moment when all of these in

223
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:07,839
Start to worry

224
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:11,167
The city laws are going to make it so nobody in the city would want to buy a car

225
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,959
And have a collective

226
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:13,727
Crap moment

227
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,775
Oh that's really clear

228
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:16,543
It's really sharp

229
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,079
The oh crap moment

230
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,871
Is November 1923

231
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:21,919
Love that

232
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,223
So what happened then

233
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,503
Alright so

234
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:29,599
Cincinnati residents got a referendum on the ballot

235
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,647
To be voted on in November

236
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:38,559
For a speed Governor device built into the engine that would require cars to be equipped with one that would limit them just

237
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,095
25 miles an hour

238
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:45,471
And once the speed governor was there at had a police seal on it if you tampered with it you were in violation of the law

239
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,519
This

240
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:52,639
We had lots of popular support we know 40,000 signatures on petitions

241
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,711
Cats weird that they were all

242
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:59,551
Real people or so on but they were 40 thousand signatures on the petitions

243
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,879
They had newspaper advertisements saying vote Yes on this

244
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,415
This

245
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:07,487
Really woke up people who wanted

246
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,255
A future for

247
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,023
Carson City

248
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,351
They were worried that if cities have laws that restricted the use of

249
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,119
Cars

250
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,399
The people would stop buying them

251
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,935
Not for public transportation

252
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:19,007
Cars would be relegated to the countryside

253
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,543
Fewer and fewer people lived ever

254
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,847
This group of Interest got organized

255
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,639
And even give themselves a name

256
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:28,735
They call themselves motordom

257
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:31,295
Actually that sounds pretty behind my ears

258
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,319
Anyway

259
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:38,463
And they start to make distinctions between what they want and what the other safety Advocates wanted

260
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:44,863
So you start to see like in need Cincinnati Enquirer which was sort of a mouthpiece for the Auto industry and since

261
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,143
Cincinnati and they ran

262
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:49,471
Huge amount of their advertising was from auto dealers

263
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:53,055
The Cincinnati Enquirer at one point

264
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:53,823
Says

265
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,615
The cause of accident

266
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,919
Is men not machines

267
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:58,943
In other words

268
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,735
Cars don't kill people

269
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,271
People killed

270
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,599
Which is reminiscent of an NRA motto has been around

271
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,367
Quite some time

272
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:07,903
Guns don't kill people

273
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,671
People people kill

274
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,207
People the same basic idea

275
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,255
You can exonerate

276
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,535
The machine

277
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,583
If you blame the driver

278
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,887
It wasn't so much about blaming the driver

279
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,959
Who's about promoting a subtle but super important

280
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:21,727
Distinction

281
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:22,751
The cause of Acts

282
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:23,775
Recent deaths

283
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,543
Can children die

284
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,311
Wasn't cars

285
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,591
Speed

286
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,615
Reckless

287
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,175
Cars can be perfectly safe in the sea

288
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,455
They belong on this

289
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,015
And the beauty of recklessness is

290
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:36,575
That you could also be a reckless podesta

291
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,623
This is really important

292
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,159
What modem did

293
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,695
By suggesting that pedestrians could

294
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,463
Could be Reckless

295
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,999
Be the cause of action

296
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,535
What's start

297
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,303
Turf War

298
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,327
A street fight

299
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,863
The oh crap moment

300
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,399
A1923

301
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:53,983
Creates a clear sense in motordom

302
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,799
Did they have to change the problem

303
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:57,567
From

304
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:00,383
How do we control cars and drivers

305
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,663
Into

306
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,455
How do we make

307
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:07,807
Streets places for cars belong and where pedestrians don't belong

308
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:11,903
Notre Dame needed to market the idea that accidents could be the result

309
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,695
A reckless pedestrian

310
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:18,047
And even that there was such a thing as Reckless pedestrians which people were

311
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,327
Ready to accept you

312
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:24,959
One judge in particular angrily denounced the idea they could ever have such a thing as a reckless pedestrian

313
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:28,031
So did sell the idea of Reckless pedestrians

314
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,335
Motordome invented a new word

315
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,127
Jaywalking

316
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,175
Actually they didn't invent

317
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:37,503
Repurposed a word that have been kicking around for a couple of deck

318
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:41,087
They transformed it from a slang insult to a legal term

319
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,903
In the 19 teens Jay Jay

320
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,439
What's a word for country bumpkin

321
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:47,231
There for a jaywalker

322
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:50,047
Is somebody who walks around the city like a Jay from the stick

323
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:53,119
Was it the first actually clear

324
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:58,495
Illustration of what the word means I found is from Kansas City 1911

325
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:02,847
And there it's describing an x-ray of a cartoon that shows a jaywalker

326
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:09,503
They're describing the jaywalker there as exactly that the person from the countryside who's in the big city

327
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:14,879
And it's so dazzled by the show Windows the lights that tall buildings

328
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,927
The salesman and so on

329
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:20,511
That as they're walking on the sidewalk they're constantly stopping

330
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,279
To look

331
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:25,119
Thereby obstructing other pedestrians

332
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:28,447
So their jaywalker is really a nuisance to other pedestrians

333
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:32,287
Somebody took this word that had been a kind of annoying protest

334
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,079
Give it a new meaning

335
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,615
A pedestrian who breaks

336
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,383
The traffic rules

337
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:39,199
Who enters the streets in the wrong place or at the wrong

338
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:43,039
They did this by publishing editorials about jaywalking

339
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:48,415
Auto clubs in auto dealers got Boy Scouts in a number of cities

340
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:50,207
The handout little cards

341
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,999
That would say something like

342
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,815
Did you know you were jaywalking and

343
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:58,143
We know that people don't know what the word meant because it was carefully

344
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,983
Explain on the card with diagrams and an information

345
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,263
Hit it first

346
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,847
The efforts to get people to stop doing something they had done for decades

347
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,383
Just didn't work

348
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,431
There was even an incident where

349
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:15,295
According to a newspaper women's struck police officers with their parasols

350
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:19,647
For trying to control how they cross the street the lesson promoter dim was

351
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,695
You can't do this by law

352
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,999
But finally motordom hit upon a winning scratch

353
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:27,583
Device by EB Lefferts Ed left

354
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:30,143
Enemy of jaywalkers everywhere

355
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:36,799
He was the head of the Automobile Club of Southern California and I think he was ahead of his time a real

356
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,103
Public relations genius

357
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:44,991
A guy who realized before most others did that you can't just change Behavior by

358
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:48,319
Punishing people and putting laws in up you have to

359
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:51,647
You have to reach them through psychology

360
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,975
Lefferts created a PR campaign in Los Angeles

361
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,023
Explaining what jaywalking was

362
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:59,583
He helped get an anti jaywalking ordinance pass

363
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,351
1920

364
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,119
4

365
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,911
But here's the really clever part

366
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,191
He told the police

367
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,215
Not to arrest

368
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:05,983
Jaywalkers

369
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,263
Lefferts

370
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,567
Wanted the police officer not

371
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,591
To arrest

372
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,359
The jaywalk

373
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,151
Which would only make the

374
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,687
Jaywalker indignant

375
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,991
But to attract ridicule

376
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,783
And he uses the word ridicule

377
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:25,439
That's a gap in the traffic. Just pop over to the drug is for some cannabis

378
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:31,839
Hey you out of the street don't you realize to jaywalking

379
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:38,239
What is a jaywalker

380
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,591
Lefferts wanted

381
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,639
The Pedestrian ridiculed

382
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:48,223
As a form of psychological control

383
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,527
Until efforts it was more important

384
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:57,695
That the onlookers see this person being ridiculed then that you actually sort of convert this individual to

385
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:58,719
Correct

386
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,743
Crossing Behavior

387
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:04,095
Date the onlookers are going to witness this ridicule and think

388
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,119
I don't want to

389
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,911
Get that kind of ridicule so I'm going to

390
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:07,935
Carefully

391
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:09,983
Yeah

392
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:13,823
The little hard to relate to now because Jay Walker is sort of a benign word

393
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,847
Like loitering

394
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,895
The 1920s America

395
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,687
It was a real term of abuse

396
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,015
And actually several judges in newspaper editors objected

397
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,551
You have such an insulting

398
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,575
Term for podesta

399
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,879
You carry the connotation of idiot

400
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:29,183
I think if you were trying to

401
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:29,951
Sort of

402
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:30,975
Have a

403
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:35,071
A public safety campaign that involves calling people idiots

404
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,887
You would find a similar kind of reaction today

405
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:38,911
Play-Doh people

406
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,447
Would really objected that

407
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,751
Or maybe something even more

408
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:43,775
Contemporary

409
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,079
Traffic

410
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:49,151
I just pop over to the drug is for some cannabis

411
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:55,551
Are you out of the street don't you realize your douchebag in

412
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,743
What me a douchebag

413
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,023
I think

414
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,839
The thing is

415
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,119
The ridicule work

416
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:14,239
Newspaper reports show that just after a few weeks pedestrians in La got the message

417
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,799
In the streets were cleared for cars

418
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:20,383
Peter Norton says motordom could declare victory

419
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,175
Find 1929

420
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,455
Coincidentally

421
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:25,759
Or maybe not so coincidentally

422
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,295
This is the year the first

423
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:30,367
Cloverleaf interchange was built in the United States

424
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,415
Cementing the country's future

425
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,695
With automobile

426
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:40,351
Incidentally that's around the time that you find it people stop objecting to the term jaywalker including jaywalkers them

427
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,887
Selves and

428
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:44,447
You know judges are no longer resisting that

429
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:47,263
A new city streets are built with cars in mind

430
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,823
The streets get wider to accommodate more cars

431
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,383
New businesses are required to provide parking lot

432
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:53,407
Crosswalk

433
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,431
Become compulsory

434
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:58,527
City start building Express ways to make it easier to get cars in and out of

435
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:02,623
It's worth taking a moment to reflect on how this story has been

436
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,391
Told

437
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:06,463
George Orwell explain that

438
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:10,047
History is written by the winners because in writing the history

439
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,583
You justify yourself

440
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,351
So

441
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:15,423
A history of the automobile has been written

442
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,471
Not by any single individual

443
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:19,775
But collectively overtime

444
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:24,127
That predominantly is a winners history of the automobile

445
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:26,687
And that's the history that says this was inevitable

446
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:30,783
And it has to do with America's love affair with the automobile

447
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:35,903
The automobile

448
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:52,031
In 1961 there was a TV program called the DuPont show of the week

449
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,055
Which

450
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:59,455
Represented itself as a documentary TV show at that time had a 1/3 interest

451
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:01,247
Just in General Motors are the two

452
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,783
Companies have a lot in common

453
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,087
And so they wrote

454
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,623
A episode

455
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,671
Called Merrily We Roll Along

456
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:11,743
Which was a history of the automobile in the United States

457
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,535
They got Groucho Marx

458
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,303
The Host

459
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,399
And in this show Groucho Marx introduced Americans

460
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:20,703
To the thesis we've all heard

461
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:24,287
Which is that there's an American love affair with the automobile

462
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,871
Together

463
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:31,199
Honeymoon with I know sweetheart

464
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:33,503
She had any form it was a

465
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,783
Like crankiness

466
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:41,183
So that's the love affair thesis and the genius of it is that

467
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:44,255
By saying we have a love affair with the car

468
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:49,119
We are saying that our relationship is irrational and not subject to logical

469
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:49,887
Judgement

470
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:04,223
Something like this

471
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,207
License plates

472
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,679
Merrily We Roll Along

473
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,823
And even critics

474
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,359
Including me

475
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:34,687
We bought into this idea of an American love affair

476
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,455
With the autumn

477
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:40,063
Because the critics of the automobile could say you know what this

478
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,599
This Love Affair this

479
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:44,927
This cultural attachment we have to be automobiles the problem

480
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,207
Which

481
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:49,279
Completely distracted them

482
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,303
From the fact

483
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,327
That

484
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:56,447
The actual story of the transformation of the 1920s was a lot more complicated

485
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:58,751
And in fact involve a lot of hate

486
00:20:59,007 --> 00:20:59,519
Car

487
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:04,639
When you see real demonization of the car the twenties that's been totally forgotten

488
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:08,735
Nobody remembers the memorials to the car nobody remembers The Monuments

489
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,783
Nobody remembers the parades with

490
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:13,855
Satan driving a Model T nobody

491
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:15,135
Remembers the

492
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:18,208
Cartoons in editorial cartoons

493
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,072
Routinely compared cars to the Grim Reaper and moloch and Juggernaut and all that

494
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:27,680
And it's true that Americans love cars

495
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:33,312
The part of the reason we love cars so much as our cities have been rebuilt with cars in mind

496
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,592
We have parking

497
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,128
We have Expressway

498
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:40,480
We don't have a lot of pedestrian getting in our way and so it is down

499
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,272
And it may be changing

500
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,808
But for the moment

501
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:46,112
We still seem to like it that
