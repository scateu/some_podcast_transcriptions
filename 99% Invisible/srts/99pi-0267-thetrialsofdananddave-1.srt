Norman Moore

24
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:37,280
This is the story of an ad campaign

25
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:40,608
Produce for the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona

26
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:43,936
Perennial runner-up in the sports shoe category Reebok

27
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,216
Just trying to make it tomorrow

28
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,752
And take down Nike

29
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:49,824
It was two athletes pluck them out of obscurity

30
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,104
Give them Reeboks to wear

31
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,408
And turn them into household names

32
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:56,480
Spending 25 million dollars in the process

33
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:00,320
That was more than Reeboks entire marketing budget the previous year

34
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:04,416
This ad campaign is pretty much remembered as a disaster for Reebok

35
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,440
Recreated

36
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,464
From nothing

37
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:11,072
Epic drama that pitted two world-class decathletes against each other

38
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,096
And it resulted

39
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:14,656
In so many strange twists and turns

40
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,472
All because someone thought it was a clever way to sell my shoes

41
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,752
I love this story

42
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,032
Is the first episode

43
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:24,384

44
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,176

45
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:31,296
Sports stories that I like that delve into their impact on culture politics and more

00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,088

Dan and Dave

50
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:44,096
Live at the Metrodome in the Twin Cities

51
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:49,728
Minneapolis and st. Paul Super Bowl number 26 so I had a party at my apartment

52
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,544
And I got the 6-foot Subway sub

53
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:56,128
That was that was the centerpiece was the 6-foot sub

54
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,432
And I already know

55
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:02,272
I had a little money and was like man I bought all the booze all the beer

56
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,832
Are quite a few people come over

57
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:05,856
And

58
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,392
It got a little while

59
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,440
Super Bowl 26

60
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:11,232
January 26th

61
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,512
1992

62
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,096
Almost 80 million people watching on television

63
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:19,680
Many of them from parties like the one at the end of Brian's house

64
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:22,240
Everybody was drinking beer

65
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:25,568
And then we got into the hard alcohol and

66
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:27,104
It was really fun

67
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:30,176
Dan is watching from Moscow Idaho

68
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,760
Dave Johnson is watching from Los Angeles California

69
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:34,784
I probably had

70
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:41,184
30 or 40 people at my house with multiple TV setup and everybody's there and I kind of kept a little bit of a secret

71
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,744
I just let him know wait till you see what's going to be on here

72
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,048
It's the first commercial comes on

73
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,096
It's super short

74
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,888
It's in third quarter

75
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:52,448
Just before Pepsi ad featuring Cindy Crawford

76
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:55,776
The first Dan and Dave commercial runs

77
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:59,360
Featuring old photographs and grainy videos of two toddlers

78
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,640
Daniel Bryan

79
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,664
And Dave Johnson

80
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:09,088
Dan can 110.3 seconds Dave can I jump 6 ft 10 in

81
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:15,488
Three-quarter inches this summer those battle it out in Barcelona for the title of world's greatest athlete

82
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,607
The voice-over expounds on the men's athletic

83
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:24,191
But the visuals are just the photos of the two toddler

84
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,239
Me and a bathtub

85
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,519
Dave on a bike

86
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,823
It was just little kids and that's it

87
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,615
And everybody kind of looks around like

88
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,383
That's it

89
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,663
What the heck was that

90
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:36,479
Then later in the same commercial break

91
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,271
Another short add run

92
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:42,879
Dan can throw a 16 lb shot put 53 ft 3 in

93
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,183
More pictures and home video

94
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:47,999
Only in this one the kids are a little older

95
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,535
Maybe five or six

96
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,863
The second that ends the same way as the first

97
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,655
Quick Reebok logo

98
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,423
And a promise

99
00:04:56,191 --> 00:05:00,543
Is Summerville battle it out in Barcelona for the title of world's greatest athlete

100
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:04,639
I don't know what to expect they didn't show us the commercials before

101
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,919
We saw them at the Super Bowl

102
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,223
Reebok Wrentham or commercial

103
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,759
Making four in total

104
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,551
All during the third quarter

105
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,623
And all of them just 15 seconds long

106
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:21,791
Jan won the decathlon at the world track and field championships Dave won the decathlon at the Goodwill

107
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:28,191
Games this summer they'll battle it out in Barcelona for the title of world's greatest athlete

108
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:33,567
I remember people really being confused at first and then eventually they

109
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,359
They're going man that is

110
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:39,711
Genius there to talk about how amazing that that Reebok thought of

111
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,271
Doing small little commercials all the way to where

112
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:45,343
There's a culmination of what they're really were talking about

113
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:50,463
Genesis 2 athletes that are going to go to the Olympics this year and can be settled in Barcelona

114
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,071
By the way the game

115
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:55,839
It's pretty lame

116
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:58,399
With Washington beating Buffalo 3720

117
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,471
The ads

118
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,495
Have made their input

119
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,871
When the Super Bowl was over in the party was over

120
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,175
And everybody got out of there and

121
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:14,271
It was a little bit shocking really it's like wow we're here to

122
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,039
Celebrate

123
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,831
Commercials that I was in

124
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,415
Remember

125
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,743
Sitting with a group of people that I had their and they're all coming and going

126
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:30,143
I can't believe I'm sitting that were here with Dave and I never really thought of myself that way that somebody would think it's cool to be with Dave

127
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:36,799
That was the first time I really sat there is going if you know people are going to know who I am now

128
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,591
Remember

129
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:41,663
Almost being scared you know what do you do with that

130
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:49,599
In 92

131
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:53,951
Reebok was known primarily as a shoe that your mom wore to take

132
00:06:54,207 --> 00:07:00,351
Aerobics classes in and they were desperate to increase their

133
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,143
Athletic credibility

134
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,703
In 1992 Rick City

135
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,239
Worked for shiet day

136
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:09,823
The Ad Agency hired to put together Reeboks latest campaign

137
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:17,759
The task was pretty daunting we've got two guys no one's ever heard of in a an event no one really

138
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:18,527
Cares about

139
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:23,391
All of the the best-known athletes wear Nike athletes

140
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:28,255
The Michael Jordan's of the world most famous professional athletes in the world

141
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:31,839
If you wanted to stand out we needed to do something else

142
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:38,239
Basic idea was in sports circles the winner of the decathlon is the world's greatest athlete

143
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,543
And so

144
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,591
It wasn't hard for

145
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:47,711
Reebok to get excited about a campaign that said who's the world's greatest athlete

146
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:50,527
This Reebok athlete you've never heard of

147
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:53,087
Or this other Reebok athlete you've never heard of

148
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,767
The decathlon by Nature

149
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,071
Is in my opinion the toughest

150
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,375
Of all the track and field event

151
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,447
The decathlon is so tough

152
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:10,239
Because it combines so much

153
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:13,567
10 events contested over the course of 2 days

154
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:16,127
Each one adding to the competitors overall point

155
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:19,967
They won is a hundred meter dash long jump shot

156
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:22,015
High jump and the 400 meter run

157
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,575
D2 is 110 m

158
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,879
Fiscus pause Javelin and last

159
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,671
The 1500 meter run

160
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:32,255
They need to track some really interesting

161
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,535
Individuals

162
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:38,143
We don't say that athletes find the decathlon we saved at the decathlon

163
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,679
We'll find those athlete

164
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:43,263
That's what happened to me I think that's what happened to Dave

165
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,311
Born in 1963

166
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,615
Dave Johnson grew up in Montana in order

167
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:51,199
By his own admission he was hardly the model young man

168
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:56,063
I was one of those kids that was in a lot of trouble growing up I was

169
00:08:56,319 --> 00:09:02,463
I was actually throwing snowballs at cars and and I think I did definitely learn how to throw

170
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:08,351
So well because I was able to stand farther back than anybody else and throw that apple or throw that snowball

171
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,887
Prophetic Rock

172
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:13,471
I remember the first time I've coach told me

173
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:16,031
What the decathlon was said

174
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,847
You should do the decathlon I thought he said Marathon

175
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:22,175
I coach know I'm the hurdler I don't run distance

176
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:25,247
You're no naughty of the decathlon he said you know Bruce Jenner

177
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:31,647
And I go well Bruce Jenner that's a guy on chips remember watching television there's Jenner was on a

178
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:35,231
A show called chips at the time he was doing a cameo with Evan

179
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,791
If I just knew him as a Hollywood TV Guide

180
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:41,631
He said no you know he was an Olympic medalist

181
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:44,191
Dave Johnson was hook

182
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,751
Dan O'Brien Auto Group in Oregon

183
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,031
Just a few hours south of

184
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,335
In a small town of Klamath Falls

185
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:54,175
And he also had his ups and downs before finding his sport

186
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,479
Growing up in southern Oregon

187
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,759
Tumi

188
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,039
Always felt

189
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,319
Like I was at a place

190
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:03,647
You know we have six adopted kids in the family

191
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:07,487
I have a sister who's biracial like myself a little brother who's Hispanic

192
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,535
I have a Native American sister

193
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,327
And then to Korean sister

194
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,679
Well when you're the only kid of color or

195
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:19,263
Kids of color in your entire town witch

196
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:25,663
The O'Brien family was it's it's interesting because all you want to do when you're young

197
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,687
Is fit in

198
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,223
Blend in

199
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:32,831
Go along get along and there we are

200
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,159
Looking like the Rainbow Coalition

201
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,975
Every time we get out of the car and go to church

202
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:39,999
The movies

203
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,535
It's a very

204
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:44,607
Weird feeling when everybody's watching you

205
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,679
I can just remember thinking

206
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:51,263
You know why are people staring at me why are people staring at us

207
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,055
This is just our regular family in

208
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,407
It wasn't until I got into sports that I really felt like

209
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,455
I belong

210
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,759
I always thought that

211
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,039
Sports was The Equalizer

212
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:03,807
There for me

213
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:07,135
Didn't matter what you look like or where you came from

214
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,415
If you were good at sports

215
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,207
You were good

216
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,511
And then was good

217
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,815
He became a star athlete in high school

218
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:17,375
Landed a scholarship at the University of Idaho

219
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,143
And there

220
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,679
Started to compete in the decathlon

221
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,727
And in his senior year

222
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:22,751
1988

223
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:25,055
The first cross paths with Dave Johnson

224
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:28,383
A few years older and already well-established on the scene

225
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:32,223
You know Dave was the best American up until that point

226
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,783
But then star was Rising quickly

227
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:38,367
And others in a tight-knit track Community we're starting to know

228
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:42,463
I'm Jackie Joyner-Kersee the world's greatest female athlete

229
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,023
Jackie Joyner-Kersee can say that

230
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,047
Even now

231
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:51,423
Thanks to her six Olympic medals and the heptathlon World Record She set in 1988

232
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,959
It still stands today

233
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,263
When you see this young Talent

234
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,799
It's just a matter of time

235
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,335
They don't have this big breakthrough

236
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:03,199
Well it's interesting Jackie Joyner-Kersee made the comment that I could be the next Bruce Jenner

237
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:06,783
And that was what I was striving to do

238
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:13,439
You know most of my career he he was the hero that we all needed in 1976 and he was the gold

239
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:17,791
Golden Boy and Dam was that very explosive

240
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,559
Athlete

241
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,631
I mean he was just this young kid very raw

242
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,935
You know very talkative and

243
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:26,495
He had a personalities at

244
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,287
Kapoor people to him

245
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,871
We're a perfect combination I think he and I were

246
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:36,735
A great Duo that was meant to be where we were going to push each other to the level that we ended up going to

247
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:42,111
And by the time the 1992 Barcelona Olympics have come into view

248
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:45,695
Dan and Dave pushed each other to the top of the global stage

249
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:51,071
Dan won the decathlon at the world track and field championships

250
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:56,447
You know usually the multi events are dominated by

251
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,471
The Europeans

252
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,007
And finally

253
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,543
In America

254
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:03,871
The Breakthrough in and I all of a sudden it's like wow

255
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:06,175
He still I seen this young Talent

256
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,455
Put it out

257
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,223
Together

258
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:12,319
And Among The Observers who took notice or the executives at Reebok

259
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:15,903
Your mom's apparel company was on the hunt for athletes

260
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:16,927
Get into business

261
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,719
Dan and Dave

262
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:21,535
Two dominant competitors but unknown personality

263
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:22,559
With a perfect

264
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,655
Here to Ashley's put not sport

265
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,935
You know in the Limelight

266
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,727
To have that

267
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:33,055
Commercial showing doing the Super Bowl was

268
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,079
Wow

269
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:40,991
And we kind of looked at each other like wow you know he's too young little decathletes were getting a lot of attention and it's about time

270
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,527
I'm track and field athletes got that

271
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,551
The decathlon

272
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,575
Really us

273
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,367
Unheard of

274
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:49,183
I can't believe they're asking us to do this this is what

275
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,975
Jordan does Michael Jordan own

276
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:54,303
Bo Jackson all the best basketball football guys doing

277
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,839
With Dan and Dave

278
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,631
Reebok was looking to promote

279
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,423
The new cross trainer to the masses

280
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,215
A shoe design for you

281
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,263
Across multiple Sports and workouts

282
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:06,079
The greatest athlete at the time was

283
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,103
Bo Jackson

284
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,383
Eddie played two sports

285
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:11,711
All new everything Nikes campaign went

286
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,247
But the truth was

287
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:16,319
Dan and Dave were more equipped to back up that claim

288
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:20,927
So when I look at Bo Jackson he's a great baseball player he's a great football player but you know what

289
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:24,511
I thought I was a girl greatest athlete because I could do 10 events

290
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:28,863
And that thought played right into the case Reebok was trying to make

291
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,167
As they rolled out more and more ads

292
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,447
After the Superbowl

293
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:39,103
World's greatest athlete here to talk to you about Reeboks you running cross-trainer world's greatest athlete

294
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:45,503
Here to talk to you

295
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,039
Does baldness

296
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:49,343
Of Reebok to come out with two people

297
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,135
Was really incredible

298
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,327
My name is Steve Miller

299
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,119
And at the time of Dan and Dave

300
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:04,447
I was the head of a US Sports Marketing

301
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,215
For Nike

302
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,519
And we became very aware of the fact

303
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,567
The Reebok was onto something very special

304
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:13,663
What you're looking for is a consumer is somebody who does something

305
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,943
That you can't do

306
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:17,503
Or something you aspire to do

307
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,295
Or somebody who inspires you

308
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,831
And Dan and Dave

309
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,647
Caught the eye and the ear of consumers

310
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,951
Throughout the Country Inn in globally as well

311
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,559
Each time the Reebok

312
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,583
Rand commercial

313
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,887
And revised it and upgraded it

314
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:36,191
You you became more

315
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,983
Affectionate towards the two athletes

316
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:44,383
And so people pick their favorites or Dave Dance Mom

317
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,407
Dave's mom

318
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:51,551
Dave dance dentist damn Dave's mailman dance girlfriend

319
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:55,135
Stan's ex-girlfriend definitely

320
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,159
Dave

321
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,975
To be settled

322
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:01,279
In Barcelona

323
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,839
Reebok had a hit on their head

324
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:12,287
I remember being in meetings and Reebok was just talking we're going to compete with Nike

325
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,823
We're finally

326
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,591
Getting there

327
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,407
Reebok hitfilm the dozens of commercials

328
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,431
The air during the Super

329
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,759
Emerald and Dave had already known each other as rivals

330
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:24,319
The filming brought them closer together as friends

331
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,623
We were competing against each other to

332
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,903
To be better actors

333
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:28,927
But we're both not

334
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,487
And I think we both kind of knew that

335
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:35,071
And there was plenty of downtime to bond on the 2nd

336
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,351
I couldn't believe for a

337
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,655
30 second commercial

338
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:44,031
Setting up cameras and all kinds of stuff it would take two days of 12-hour day shooting

339
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,311
You just sit around

340
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:47,103
Deschutes 30 seconds

341
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:50,687
Finally they called for you and you do an hour's worth of work

342
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:54,783
And Dave and I looked at each other couple times and I was just we said

343
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:59,391
I can't believe we're wasting time

344
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:04,255
By late February Dan and Dave were on talk show Danny they were giving joint press conf

345
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:07,839
Dave and Ava being profiled on local morning TV

346
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:10,911
Dave and I got to shoot a commercial with Sinbad the comedian

347
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,799
He was the most incredible guy because he was so chill off camera but then when the lights are on he went crazy

348
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:20,895
Hey everybody I'm sitting down here with Dan today and we're playing basketball today

349
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:26,271
Ionic at the end of the day my stomach hurt because I was laughing so hard and Sinbad

350
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:29,087
Was maybe the worst athlete I had ever seen

351
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:34,207
Are I was one of the top five sports celebrity figures in the US

352
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:36,255
Everybody knew who Dan and Dave was

353
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,023
Remember

354
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,071
Dad and I were just going to what we do with this

355
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,959
Will an athlete's life is pretty simple

356
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:47,263
You get up your train eat

357
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:51,359
You go to bed and you just repeat that cycle each and every day

358
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:54,687
When the Dan and Dave campaign was going on

359
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,735
You know my life got complicated

360
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,807
I couldn't go anywhere

361
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:05,183
I mean there is nothing that I couldn't I'd go to that an outhouse and come out near the camera

362
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,207
There there

363
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:12,607
See if I wash my hands I guess that's what I wasn't prepared for its is to understand that you know what

364
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:18,239
I just wasn't another face in the crowd we got to a point where I told the matter is we can't do this anymore

365
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,775
We just stopped appearances

366
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:21,311
We've got to get this thing going

367
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,615
I mean I got like four months

368
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:26,431
Pick up until the trial

369
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:27,967
The trial

370
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,831
The first Dan and Dave ads are.

371
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:33,599
At the Super Bowl

372
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,623
January

373
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,391
Of 1990

374
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,207
The Olympics were in Barcelona

375
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:38,975
In July

376
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,375
When Reebok approached

377
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,399
Dave and I

378
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,447
The first thing both of us Ed

379
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,471
Was

380
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:52,287
You know neither one of us around this team yet

381
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,615
We still have to go through the Olympic trials

382
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:08,927
In 1992 the United States Olympic track and field trials

383
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:09,695
Where held

384
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,719
Attack Gormley

385
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,999
Stadium in New Orleans

386
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:13,023
The last week

387
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:16,095
I arrived in New Orleans and I think the

388
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,375
First thing

389
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:20,447
That I noticed as soon as I got off the plane was

390
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,471
It was hot

391
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,263
The heat was blistering

392
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:26,591
Upper 90s with 99% humidity or something

393
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,871
Proof like

394
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,663
Nothing I've ever experienced

395
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,431
Before

396
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,735
Everywhere you went

397
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:35,551
Dan and de-dan and a Dan and Dave

398
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:38,111
All eyes are on

399
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:40,159
Who is going to represent

400
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:43,231
The United States and who will go on and when the go map

401
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:47,327
Do you have the pressure a little bit for me with Reebok and

402
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:51,167
The money they'd spend the night I better make this Olympic team was in my mind

403
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:54,751
Because everybody's wanting to know who's better

404
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,311
We got to see who wins in Barcelona that's the commercial

405
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:02,943
Meanwhile the trials were Reeboks last Big Marketing events before Barcelona

406
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,991
And the company took full advantage

407
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,831
I noticed everybody was wearing these white t-shirts

408
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:10,111
And hats

409
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,903
That either had an or Dave on

410
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,743
They either had a red Dan and blue Dave's

411
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:18,303
And when you get into the stadium

412
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:20,095
Everybody's wearing the t-shirts

413
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:23,679
It was almost like somebody dropped them from a helicopter

414
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:28,543
To all the people in the stands at least half the people in the stands were wearing these white t-shirts

415
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:33,407
The top three finishers in the New Orleans decathlon would qualify for the Olympic

416
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,455
And the first day of events

417
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:37,247
Saturday went according to scratch

418
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:40,319
With Dan and Dave both racking up tons of fun

419
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:44,927
Dave as usual with solid or Dan the reigning world champion

420
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,463
Shot in the first place

421
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:51,839
Somebody was telling me that I was ahead of world record pace so that made me feel pretty good

422
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,119
Dan was on fire

423
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:58,239
If there were any concerns for either of them it was a lingering foot injury for Dave

424
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,031
But he was the best

425
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,055
2nd Ada caffe

426
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,079
Of all time

427
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:05,919
And the headlines leading at the Sunday we're all about whether or not he could catch

428
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,199
Who is arch rival

429
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:14,623
They've dominated the airwaves now their final really begins Dan O'Brien and Dave Johnson

430
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:16,416
Who will win the decathlon

431
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:18,464
What were the first two events of the second day

432
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,744
Hurdles and discus

433
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,536
Dave started to close the gap

434
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:23,584
And then

435
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,888
Sure enough we got to the pole vault

436
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:27,424
The polo

437
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,752
The most stressful time I think

438
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:31,520
4

439
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,568
A decathlete or the coaches

440
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,128
Is the start of the pole vault decathlon

441
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:37,920
Any coach will tell you

442
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,968
That's where they're the most

443
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,504
In the pole vault

444
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,320
Competitors aim to clear increasing Heights one by one

445
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:46,880
The higher the bar the more points receipt

446
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:49,952
Each vaulter gets three attempts on a given height

447
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,768
And each can choose whatever height they like to start at

448
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,072
But if they fail to clear the bar at

449
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,120
They get no points

450
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,704
To start learning relatively High Point

451
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,472
Immediately

452
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:04,032
Dan and Dave made the same aggressive choice

453
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:05,824
To begin their fault

454
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,104
15 ft

455
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:07,872
9 in

456
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:16,320
Qdoba hire vaulters it takes a while to get to your turn to vault at your starting height so you warm up and

457
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:18,880
They might give you a few other warm us but it's never enough

458
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,416
It's the eighth of an

459
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,464
You're feeling your legs a little bit

460
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,512
And the Sun

461
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:26,816
It was really starting to get hot

462
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:28,096
While we're sitting around the

463
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:30,912
Cameras are in our faces they're following us wherever we go

464
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:31,936
And

465
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:35,264
I remember just thinking how distracting that was

466
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:38,592
Well by the time the warm-ups ended

467
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,408
It was almost two solid hours

468
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:43,200
Till I took my first jump

469
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:45,504
I bought it for sure I remember that

470
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,552
And so I made my first height

471
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:49,856
And had no problem with it

472
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:52,416
Other than my foot was still getting more and more sore

473
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:53,952
Chat Downing

474
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:57,792
He was battling the heat again and I remember seeing his first attempt at that same height

475
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:59,584
You know once they call my name

476
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,608
I cannot

477
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,728
Look down the runway kind of assess the wind look over at the code she gives me a thumbs up

478
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:10,080
All I remember is putting my hands up way too late

479
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:14,688
And so literally I just went straight up and straight down with hardly any band in the pole

480
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:18,784
He looks like you've never voted before he's just something

481
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,344
Way wrong then thing I've ever seen him have

482
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:25,696
And so on my next attempt I make all the adjustments

483
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:29,280
Come down the runway good takeoff good plant

484
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:32,096
I feel like I'm way over the bar

485
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:34,912
And I come down on it slightly

486
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:37,216
And the bar falls off

487
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:44,640
And then I start to thanks like no

488
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,432
I'm on the third attempt

489
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:48,992
You don't want to be my third attempt

490
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,528
Add an opening bar

491
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,832
Add an Olympic trials

492
00:23:54,624 --> 00:24:00,768
Has a lost maybe I'll chance he had been on the world record pace and now risking not even close

493
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,584
That's when I sat up and I'll go

494
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:06,400
What is going on here in it and it was kind of a

495
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:10,752
There was kind of a quiet in the stands there wasn't as much

496
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:16,128
You kind of see the crowd

497
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:17,664
Begin to stir a little bit

498
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,224
Other athletes sit up

499
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,760
And it look over your direction

500
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,552
LeBron got to mrs.

501
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:27,648
Is opening bars as opener or did you make with no I thought I saw you make one

502
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:30,208
Let me hear the people talking in the crowd as well as

503
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:32,768
No no he made one I saw him make one about an hour ago

504
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:34,816
No I was a warm up

505
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,400
This third attempt

506
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,680
He might have taken a

507
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,984
A little run and then stopped and went back

508
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:48,896
Final attempt and it goes down the runway in stock that was not as soon as I start my run on the 3rd at 10

509
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:50,432
I get a big gust of wind

510
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:52,736
Coming from the right so I stopped

511
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,272
He just didn't look confident

512
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:59,136
He's not on the team if he doesn't make his height and he knows it and it's going through his mind

513
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:06,560
I just tell myself settled down just relax just relax and so I get back there and I take off and down the road

514
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:07,840
One way I go

515
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,632
Look on his face like

516
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:13,472
I'm just going to go and I'll make sure I make it

517
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:14,752
And I feel pretty good

518
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:21,408
I plant the pole the next thing you know I'm stalled out on the top

519
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:27,808
And I'm looking at the bar and I think get over it somehow

520
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:33,696
And I can't and it's not even close

521
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:36,000
I'll come crashing down to the pit

522
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,304
And I'm just in a daze

523
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:49,056
What happened what what up what up what happened in the end in at that moment you just I wanted to turn to somebody and say

524
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,592
Help me

525
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,432
It was almost as if

526
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:56,224
The Sun

527
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,760
All that heat

528
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,552
That it became

529
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,320
Cloudy

530
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,368
And it became dark

531
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,928
Because you knew

532
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:05,696
Something

533
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,000
Bad habit

534
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:10,304
I

535
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,352
Blew a chance to go to the Olympic Games

536
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,656
I'm not on this Olympic team

537
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,192
It was

538
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,728
It was devastating

539
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,520
I was devastated

540
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:22,080
I just tried to get away from people

541
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:28,736
But there's guys with cameras there's people and so I tried that I didn't make the team

542
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:32,576
I cried that I let everybody down I was kind of in a daze just

543
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:34,880
Yeah I kind of freaked out by all of it

544
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,928
Stop never ever

545
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:39,232
Cross my mind that

546
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,768
Dan aude

547
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,560
We're not make that Olympic team

548
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:45,120
I like that just wasn't

549
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:46,656
I thought

550
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:49,216
My main goal is to win an Olympic gold medal hair

551
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:52,544
And that was what my coaches and I thought all along

552
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,080
And we were so

553
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:56,128
Not ready for it

554
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:59,200
We're not we were not ready to

555
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:00,480
Fail

556
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:04,064
Did not make this team to not win this meet

557
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,648
It was hard it was everybody was still in disbelief there's

558
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:09,952
You could hear the buzz in the stands

559
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:13,024
Oh my gosh I can't believe it

560
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:16,608
You are the best athlete in the world

561
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,632
And I knew

562
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:18,912
It was

563
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,448
Hard to deal with

564
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:23,520
Dealing with all the commercials and all the hype

565
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:25,824
And everything that went into it

566
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:29,920
It it was too much it was a lot to have to deal with all at once

567
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,992
And the first thing I thought about is

568
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:36,576
Got to get to him and tell me it's going to be okay

569
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:39,136
Because I cared about him as a person

570
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:42,976
You know we were Dan and Dave singular

571
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:46,304
And everywhere we went we had to be that that that person

572
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:48,864
It's one of those things where

573
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,912
Dang the perfect situation

574
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:51,680
Wasn't happy

575
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:55,008
Happening the exact same that would have been what

576
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,080
Everybody wanted to see wasn't going to happen

577
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:00,384
Suddenly I was alone

578
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,808
Yeah I was able to become Dave again

579
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:09,856
The real Dave not today Reebok

580
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:15,488
Johnson and the javelin competition knows he's thrown a beauty right here it turns out to be

581
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:18,816
An American record of 244 ft

582
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:25,216
Date places first in the overall competition in wild and fails to qualify

583
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,008
When it was over

584
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:31,360
Dave came over and said I love you man

585
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:33,408
I love you man you're going to be alright

586
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:34,944
Decided

587
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,736
He needed a hug

588
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:39,552
Give him a big hug and just said I'm so sorry

589
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:40,832
That that happened

590
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:41,856
And I just

591
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,904
I couldn't even hug him back

592
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:48,768
You know I was just kind of hands on my side it's just like what the heck just happened

593
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,448
For the next 48 hours I walked around in a daze and

594
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,496
I didn't think much about Dan and Dave

595
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:02,848
Some people asked me will what's Reebok going to do and at the time I thought

596
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:03,872
I don't care

597
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:05,920
But I

598
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,968
Got the real stance that

599
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:10,784
You know somebody was getting yelled at somewhere

600
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:14,624
There was probably some yelling going on at the attic NZ

601
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,416
Rick sittig

602
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:20,000
Was watching the event that afternoon on television from New York

603
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:23,072
It's a bad situation

604
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:26,144
The mood at the agency is just dark crap

605
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:30,240
Reebok has made a huge investment in these athletes to

606
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:36,128
To puff up their credibility in the athletic world and they've got media to

607
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:38,688
To fill and

608
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:42,272
The future of the company is kind of resting on the outcome of this

609
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:44,832
And and it's now just

610
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:45,856
Going to hell

611
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,672
And in my head I'm going on now

612
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:50,208
We were planning to

613
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:53,024
To be on Johnny Carson we were planning to be

614
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,608
Hosting Saturday Night Live all those commercials station Corky

615
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,888
Made

616
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:00,192
They've made 10 or 15 commercial set

617
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:01,984
We're going to play

618
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:05,056
During the Olympic Games with Dan and Dave there

619
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,592
Steve Miller

620
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:07,360
From Nike

621
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,640
Was in New Orleans

622
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:11,200
With a few of his colleagues in a small section of seat

623
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,480
In the middle of the stand

624
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:14,272
Watching the drama play out

625
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:17,856
Sitting in the stands and watching it was

626
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:19,904
You know was like a dream come true

627
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,672
4 months

628
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:24,256
Steve and Nike have been secretly fantasizing this exact

629
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,024
Scenario

630
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:31,936
Yeah we're actively don't make that something bad would happen. I don't know I don't know how else to put it I I'd like the Lions

631
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:34,240
Say no it didn't make a difference but it made a difference of course

632
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:39,616
The truth is we were just being happy and you would have what

633
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,920
It was one of those moments

634
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:44,736
Where you feel so good you get a little lightheaded

635
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:52,672
Is the first moment in time that I can ever remember taking pleasure

636
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:54,464
In somebody else's pain

637
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:58,304
Reebok

638
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:03,424
The creator of those Dan and Dave commercial says that it's cute

639
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,984
It just needs a slight Readjustment

640
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:07,520
The Readjustment

641
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:09,824
Came in the form of a new series of ads

642
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:12,896
Embracing the change in the Dan and Dave story

643
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:15,456
Reebok rebooted its campaign on the Fly

644
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:17,760
They have new ads out within 48 hours

645
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:21,600
In the coming weeks there was an ad with Dan coaching Dave

646
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:25,952
I've got some free time I'm helping Dave drink yesterday

647
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:26,720
Porsche

648
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:28,768
When was Dave consoling Dan

649
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:35,424
You should be happy you're going to represent your country you're going for the gold

650
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,960
I just wish you were going down

651
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:39,776
And that's saying that all to announce the new role

652
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:41,824
For Dan O'Brien in Barcelona

653
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:48,480
I am going huh I'll be up in the broadcast Booth you mean the coffee in Barcelona

654
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:51,040
Together again

655
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:57,440
You wanna hug we already did that

656
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:12,032
Okay the decathlon resume this morning at Olympic Stadium American Dave Johnson expected to contend for the gold medal

657
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:14,848
When you're the broadcast Booth it's really hard knot

658
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:15,616
2

659
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:18,688
Put yourself out there on the track or Dwight stones

660
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:22,016
And the guy who might have been Johnson's toughest competition at the Olympics

661
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:22,784
Stan O'Brien

662
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,160
It was a little strange now looking down there at guys who I thought

663
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:30,720
I could be for the Olympic gold medal

664
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:36,096
Yeah it's just really too bad he always hate for it to come down to your third at sampton and maybe

665
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:42,496
There were moments when I wasn't horribly complimentary today what do I looks to me like Dave is just lack enthusiasm

666
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,264
All day long

667
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:49,152
And I just saw him struggling and I was and I kept thinking this isn't the Dave Johnson that I saw spring

668
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:51,456
This isn't the Dave Johnson that I saw

669
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,736
At the Olympic trials

670
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,272
And I thought

671
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:57,344
Izzy Izzy crumbling under the pressure

672
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,880
Dave was underperformed

673
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,672
But not because of the pressure

674
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,000
His foot injury from the trials and only gotten worse

675
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,304
The public didn't know about it

676
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,840
But a few weeks before the games

677
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:09,120
David met with a doctor

678
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:09,888
About his

679
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:14,752
The doctor said you she can't go we shouldn't go to the Olympics

680
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,824
Cuz it's going to break in half

681
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:21,408
Wait a minute I'm the Dave guy from the Reebok commercial

682
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:24,480
Dad didn't make the team didn't you see somebody's got to go

683
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:28,320
In Barcelona on a broken foot

684
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:30,112
Starting Day 2 in 9th

685
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:30,880
Place

686
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:32,160
Dave toughed it out

687
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:33,184
And finished third

688
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:39,072
Dave Johnson becomes the first u.s. medalist in the event since Bruce Jenner back in 1976

689
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,888
You know he did his absolute best

690
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:43,424
Which was phenomenal

691
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,472
Take walk away with a bronze medal

692
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:47,520
Even as a stepped up in

693
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,312
Received the bronze medal

694
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:52,896
Yeah we saw the American flag go up I was thinking man

695
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:53,920
And overcome

696
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:56,480
He noticed this Dan and David

697
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:57,504
Campaigning

698
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:04,160
Does a broken foot tendon and just the career of 14 15 years of training and out of so

699
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:06,208
So fortunate to be able to step down from that

700
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:06,976
Metals

701
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:11,840
Ceremony and go to the people that really knew me my family of my coaching

702
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,888
And the people that really work

703
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:16,448
They're in my life to get me to that moment

704
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:18,496
Dave

705
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:20,032
When's the bronze medal

706
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:21,824
Robert smell like

707
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,408
Comes home with the gold from the Czech Republic

708
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,736
Neither Dave nor I

709
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,576
Claim the title of the world's greatest athlete in Barcelona

710
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:36,160
And I think it was

711
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,952
Two or three days later

712
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:39,488
In USA Today

713
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,512
Reebok

714
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:44,096
Has a big ad that says congratulations to Dave Johnson

715
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:47,680
For winning the Olympic bronze medal thank you Dan and Dave

716
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:48,960
For a great year

717
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:53,056
And I think for me at that particular moment Dan and Dave ended

718
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:57,408
Dan and Dave was over as an ad campaign

719
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:59,712
With Dave coming off of major injury

720
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:02,784
Dan and Dave looked to be over as a major rivalry 2

721
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:07,136
But Dan O'Brien was already thinking about what was that

722
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:15,328
All I could do was really think about what was down the road for me

723
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:20,960
And the great thing about track and field is you don't have to wait every four years for a big event

724
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:25,056
I knew I was going to get another shot the following year at a world championship

725
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:31,456
Starting in the fall of 1992 just a few weeks after the Barcelona games and for the next few years

726
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:35,296
Dan O'Brien went on the best hair of his life

727
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:41,696
September that same year I break the world record the winter of 1993

728
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:48,096
I win the first heptathlon World indoor championships I break the world record I win a u.s. outdoor tile

729
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:54,496
Title in Eugene Oregon score over 8800 go on to defend my world title in Stuttgart Germany

730
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:59,104
When a third world outdoor title in Gothenburg Sweden

731
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:00,640
But no one

732
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:05,248
I remember eating lunch with Bruce Jenner and Bruce

733
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,272
Kept telling me

734
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:10,880
Only thing people are going to remember is the Olympic Games and I thought to myself

735
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:12,672
Man this got crazy

736
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:17,536
He doesn't know what he's talking about he didn't have World Championships when he was a competing act like I get

737
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:20,096
To compete at World Championships every two years

738
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,936
But it wasn't until later that I realized man Bruce was right

739
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:26,752
So Daniel Bryan set his sights on the next

740
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:27,520
Olympics

741
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:30,080
And the chance to win a medal people would care if

742
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:33,664
But even as he was winning meat after meat

743
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:35,456
Dan felt he needed help

744
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:38,272
Because he was still struggling with the mental side

745
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,040
The decathlon

746
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:42,624
I used to get so nervous before I compete it

747
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:44,672
That I would question why I do this

748
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,464
Almost throwing up

749
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:47,744
Wanting to quit

750
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:54,144
My name is dr. Jim Reardon I'm a sports psychologist from Columbus Ohio

751
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:56,960
Dan who comes to dr. Riordan

752
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:58,496
Talk about that anxiety

753
00:36:59,008 --> 00:36:59,776
Facebook for every comp

754
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,824
Dr. Reardon

755
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,616
Suspected there was a deeper element

756
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:04,384
At play

757
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:05,920
The Fallout

758
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:07,200
The Mist pole vault

759
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:07,968
In the world

760
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:11,552
What can happen is

761
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,880
People come in for for treatment from trauma

762
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:17,952
And the first thing the therapist wants to talk about is the trauma

763
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:21,792
And the last thing the person wants to talk about is the trauma

764
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:25,632
I just made the decision pretty early on

765
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:28,704
If he brings it up and wants to talk about it we'll talk about it

766
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:30,496
But if he doesn't

767
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:32,288
Then we want because

768
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:34,336
He'll know when the time will be right

769
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,664
And so we didn't

770
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:40,992
For almost

771
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:41,760
3

772
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:42,528
Years

773
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:44,064
The poll mountainous didn't come

774
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:46,880
They talked about other parts of the decathlon

775
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:47,904
Their personal

776
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:48,928
The real real

777
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,208
But never

778
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:50,976
New Orleans

779
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:54,048
Until one day in August 1995

780
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:57,120
311 days until the next alarm

781
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:57,888
Trials

782
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:01,216
We were having this conversation and

783
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:03,520
He kind of started it out by

784
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:04,800
By saying

785
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:06,080
You know what

786
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:08,384
Last night was weird

787
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:10,688
I had a dream about

788
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:11,456
Pole vault

789
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:13,248
From 1992

790
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:17,856
He said I haven't thought about that in years

791
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,160
And I'm thinking to myself

792
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:22,720
Okay I guess this is this is the moment

793
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,512
Over the coming months

794
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:27,840
Reardon decided that he had to take a big aggressive

795
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:30,400
Dan had to watch footage

796
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,424
Of his failure

797
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,192
In New Orleans

798
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:33,984
Somebody got me

799
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:34,752
Copy of

800
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,848
And I had a couple of back in those days DVDs made

801
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,152
I kind of

802
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:42,432
Caught him off guard

803
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,760
And I said I got something I want you to look at

804
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:49,344
And we watched

805
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:52,672
How hot it was oh my gosh it was hot

806
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,560
And I remember thinking to myself holy mackerel

807
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,400
I relive the horror

808
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:04,704
Of missing on a third attempt

809
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:11,872
And coming down landing on the pit

810
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:15,968
And just being in a complete days and it was absolutely ghastly

811
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:18,528
To go through those emotions again

812
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:28,000
The video continue to roll at show Dave come over to hug me

813
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:31,328
I couldn't I couldn't I didn't even know what to say afterwards

814
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:34,144
And I said

815
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:36,448
What do you think he said I don't want to look at

816
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:39,264
And I said okay

817
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,544
And I replied it

818
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:45,408
What do you think he said

819
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:46,688
Should I feel like

820
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:47,968
Feel like throwing up

821
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:50,272
And I said

822
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:51,552
I said you know what

823
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:57,184
I would much rather have you feel like that in a hotel room in Chula Vista in December

824
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:59,488
Dad on the runway

825
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,768
In Atlanta

826
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:01,536
Tianjin

827
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:04,608
I wanted him to get to the point

828
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:07,936
Where he would have seen that video so many times

829
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:10,496
That he would just get pissed off when he would think about

830
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,592
And develop the mindset that

831
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:17,408
Pressure is nothing pressure is going to bring out the best in

832
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:24,832
It's a double header today both slow and bypasses you have competition from brackenfield here at the Olympic stadium in Atlanta

833
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:28,928
Impremedia trials for the 1996 Olympics were held in Atlanta

834
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,232
Which would be the site of the games themselves

835
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:32,000
Later that summer

836
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:35,072
And once again the decathlon competition

837
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:36,864
Titian feature to familiar faces

838
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,912
Dan O'Brien and Dave Johnson

839
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:43,520
But no one was talking about Dan and Dave in 1996

840
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:47,104
No Reebok campaign in fact Danville the Nike ad

841
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:47,872
By this point

842
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,152
And Dave

843
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:51,200
Was living the typical Battle of the injured ass

844
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:53,248
One problem piling up on top

845
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:58,368
These trials were not about who would be the world's greatest athlete Dan or Dave

846
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:01,184
The storyline was all Dan O'Brien

847
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:08,096
I would say that the 1992 Olympic trials debacle by Dan O'Brien is a part of track and field lore and Legend at this point

848
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:12,192
I was nervous going into the 96 trials I'll be honest with you

849
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:13,472
I can remember

850
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:16,800
Waking up the morning that the decathlon started

851
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:20,640
I put my head in my wife's lap and just sobbed

852
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:23,200
Because I was nervous and I was scared

853
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:29,600
You know but I needed to get that out the Kathy who compete now is affected by his no hide in the pole vault

854
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:33,696
4 years ago I would submit that this will be the hardest track meet the dental Bramble Everett

855
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:36,256
Even if Dan had felt like you

856
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:38,048
Put 1992 behind him

857
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:40,352
The organizers in Atlanta

858
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,888
Wouldn't let him shake it so

859
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:44,192
I'll never forget

860
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,728
As I walked

861
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:52,895
To run 200m the start of the very first day at the Atlanta Olympic trials

862
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:54,687
I look up at the big screen

863
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:56,479
On the North End

864
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:59,039
Other side of the field and they're showing

865
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:01,087
My failure in the pole vault

866
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:04,415
When I saw that footage I was pissed off

867
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:08,255
I don't even know to this day whose idea it was

868
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:12,351
It really didn't upset me that I saw the video I kind of almost chuckle

869
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:17,215
I laughed it off because of the training the Danna done it

870
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:18,495
Became just not

871
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:20,543
I was ready

872
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:27,967
Proving he was ready Dan got off to a great start going in today to he was in second place

873
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:31,807
And he remained there through the hurdles and The discus

874
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:38,463
And with seven of the ten events complete next the dreaded pole vault what must be gone

875
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:39,743
Going through his mind

876
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:43,327
I get a little nervous and

877
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:49,727
You know just I'm tired of sitting around 20 minutes has gone by and maybe a half hours since I took my last warm-up jump

878
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:51,775
Dan was cooling off

879
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:55,359
And just like in 1992 he was losing his rhythm

880
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:58,431
So he made a last-minute decision to change history

881
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:03,039
2 bars before I'm supposed to come in

882
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,831
I get a little antsy

883
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:08,159
And I walked over to my Coach Rick Sloan and I said

884
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:14,303
What do you think about me coming into the next bar the it was a scheduled Bar lower than I was supposed to come in and he's just like

885
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:17,887
You feel good go for it do it

886
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:20,703
I didn't tell anybody else

887
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:27,103
Look at my coach and all of a sudden I took my sweats off and I step up to the runway and they sell Brian up

888
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:33,503
And I think that surprised even my competitors at the time decision

889
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:39,903
The height one foot below what Dan started at 4 years ago and everyone in the stadium

890
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:43,231
Holding their Collective breath

891
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:46,815
I'm on the runway I got my starter poll

892
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:54,751
Don't even think about missing just think you know what I'm here to bolt head down the runway

893
00:43:55,007 --> 00:44:01,151
And think to myself look I'm probably not as warmed up as I should be I push a little harder than

894
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:07,551
Then I normally would on a first attempt jump as I take off the ground my top hand slips

895
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:13,951
About an inch and I regrip real quick swing up go over the bar

896
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:20,351
Can I get a first attempt made and by virtue

897
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:22,911
Do that first attempt make I'm on the team

898
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:24,959
You are so sweet irony

899
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:26,751
Pearl Bryan it looks like

900
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:30,079
Daniel Bryan is going to gain the lead in the decathlon

901
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:36,479
Because of his performance here in the pole vault the event that was his undoing 4 years ago now also

902
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:39,295
Later finished first in the trials decathlon

903
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:41,855
A stark contrast to four years earlier

904
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:45,951
In 1992 it had been Dave Johnson watching damn struggle

905
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:49,535
This time the roles were reversed

906
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:51,583
Find a place at 6

907
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:57,727
And pretty much knew that was my retirement after that event after that Olympic trials and

908
00:44:57,983 --> 00:45:04,127
You know I just remember just being able to encourage Dan to go on in Atlanta and represent the United States

909
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:10,527
And here comes dad O'Brien just left the crowd carrying home here he is finally going to be

910
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:16,927
US Olympic team

911
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:23,327
Daniel Bryan was world champion record holder exercise the Demons of New Orleans

912
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:27,935
Now the only job left to do was to win the gold 6 weeks later

913
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:35,359
The trouble is when you want everything except for the Olympic gold medal

914
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:39,455
And you feel like it's the last thing on your list

915
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:43,551
It's not as exciting as it could be

916
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:47,903
It was stressful I was trying to just not make mistakes

917
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:55,327
Atlanta Olympic Stadium where the decathlon competition continue today and fall report on date

918
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:57,375
Decathlon let's go to Whitestone

919
00:45:59,167 --> 00:45:59,935
In Atlanta

920
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:02,239
In his quest to finally settle that question

921
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:04,287
Who is the world's greatest athlete

922
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:06,847
Elif first been asked for years earlier

923
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,407
Daniel Bryan's first day of competition

924
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:11,199
Went off without a hitch

925
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:15,551
As prepared as I was for the Olympic Games

926
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:19,903
Sometimes what you're not prepared for is what other people are going to do

927
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:26,047
This crazy young guy from Germany Frank Guzman this young kid he had

928
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:28,351
Personal best after personal best

929
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:30,143
He was going crazy

930
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:34,751
So on this new stage Dan suddenly had a new rifle

931
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:37,823
Huisman the German was right on his heels

932
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,359
True day 1

933
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:42,687
To the pole vault and right up to the decathlon spinal to event

934
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:45,247
Javelin in the 1500

935
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:47,807
Erase that has never been damn strongest

936
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:50,879
I need a big lead before the 1500 m

937
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:55,487
And when I got to the job and I didn't have as big a lead as I would have liked

938
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:57,791
He was a little too close for comfort

939
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:59,071
Let's head back to the track

940
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:01,631
The two-day decathlon concluding tonight with a report on

941
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:06,239
And so as I got into the javelin it was the Twilight of the night

942
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:09,823
Olympic stadium was packed

943
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:12,895
With Hometown American fans rooting on Dan

944
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:15,967
Anna noisy contingent of Germans rooting on Boost

945
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:22,111
Each of the competitors selected a javelin

946
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:23,647
And took their first throw

947
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:26,719
Dan's first attempt was

948
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:29,023
We tried to stay calm

949
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:30,047
Scanning the crowd

950
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:31,071
As he waited his neck

951
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:34,143
I look over and see a guy in a

952
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:37,471
Red white and blue jersey USA Jersey

953
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:38,751
Anastasia Johnson

954
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:43,615
He's got his Oakleys on the back of his head backwards like you always used to wear them

955
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:45,407
Bonifas down in the front row

956
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:47,199
You know just kind of hanging

957
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:49,503
David been standing with the US coaches

958
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:51,807
Quietly watching the drama play out

959
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:54,623
But now he was noticing something

960
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:57,183
Christian through his first throw I think

961
00:47:57,695 --> 00:48:01,023
Yeah I could tell her the job and he was throwing wasn't flying exactly

962
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:04,607
As well as it should be for his type of throwing

963
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:07,679
After the second throw another disappointment

964
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:10,239
Then came over to consult with his coaches on the side

965
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:12,031
With Dave

966
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:13,311
Standing right nearby

967
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:15,871
We had that eye contact

968
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:17,919
And I say to Dave

969
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:19,967
Which Javelin should I use

970
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:22,271
You got a hundred to choose from out there

971
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:25,343
I had him pick out the javelin that I knew

972
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:27,903
Would work really well because I

973
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:29,951
Jalen is just my best event

974
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:33,279
Dave Dave said the 90 M or Nemeth

975
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:36,351
And I knew exactly which Javelin he was talking about

976
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:37,887
And I said all right

977
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:42,239
Something about him being there

978
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:44,543
Put me at ease

979
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:45,823
It was

980
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:50,431
Just refreshing to my soul I just felt good

981
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:52,735
That he was going to be there

982
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:55,039
To witness my greatest moment

983
00:48:55,551 --> 00:49:01,695
Denim stepped up to the line for his third row needs a question for the 1500

984
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:08,095
The unreleased a five-and-a-half personal best

985
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:10,655
Maybe

986
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:15,007
In my mind I might have stepped out of myself and went out into his body a little bit

987
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:21,663
And I got to be Dan for for about 20 seconds in and help him throw that thing

988
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:29,087
Smoking

989
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:30,111
Daniel Bryan

990
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:37,279
I threw farther than Frank boost men so I didn't give up any points I didn't give up any ground this is

991
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:43,679
Is what it's all about

992
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:50,079
Olympic gold medal

993
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:56,479
When Dan won a gold medal in 96 I was just glad that it came for

994
00:49:56,735 --> 00:50:02,879
Being able to go through but stick through and not give up on the sport

995
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:09,279
And it was great to see him finally being Olympic champion

996
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:22,079
I think it would be tough to talk about Dan and Dave if I hadn't come back in 96 and won the gold but I

997
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:28,479
I think failing in 1992 gave me an opportunity to rewrite the narrative I had to change

998
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:34,879
People's minds every time I stepped out onto the track people when they think of Dan and Dave the room

999
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:41,279
Remember something went wrong Reebok they had this big campaign that we both were going to be at the Olympics and the

1000
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:47,679
Then only one of us went so it was a failure because of that but that the reality of that situation is the campaign was

1001
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:54,079
Huge success they sold more shoes of that particular running Cross Trainer shoe than any other shoe

1002
00:50:54,335 --> 00:51:00,479
Two of the year-and-a-half that they're promoting it that whole year was such a such a

1003
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:06,879
Great experience except for 2 hours on the second day in the eighth of a of the decathlon

1004
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:13,279
I meet people who say I remember where I was when you didn't make that

1005
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:19,679
Third attempt in the pole vault they have they have where were they stories when Dan O'Brien didn't make the Olympic team and I think

1006
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:26,079
That's just in our human nature we are just programmed to remember the bad times a little bit better than the

1007
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:32,479
Good times people remember the field goal that was missed people remember the free throws that

1008
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:38,879
The guy didn't make nothing prepares you for you know really having your dream

1009
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:45,279
I'm just kind of slip out from underneath you but a personality a great performance

1010
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:48,607
Can change an athlete's life

1011
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:52,703

That whines through a treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

1064
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:26,975

Might cost you your life

1066
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:33,887
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

1067
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:38,239
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

1068
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:42,591
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like a dad

1069
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:46,943
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:49,247
Actually if I'm being honest

1071

Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

1075
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:09,983
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

1076
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:11,007
Now

1077
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:17,407

1078
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:19,455
Whatever it takes to find them
