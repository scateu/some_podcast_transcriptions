I'm Roman Mars

35
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:33,440
Anyone who has had kids knows that they go through obsessive phases

36
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:35,744
I can last anywhere from a few days

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,024
To several years

38
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:40,096
I went through a lot of phases growing up

39
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,144
Best producer Emmett Fitzgerald

40
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:48,032
There was a brief train phase then in preschool I was obsessed with farming equipment

41
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:52,640
I could list obscure European tractor Brands off the top of my head like an old

42
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:53,920
Italian wheat farmer

43
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:56,480
But I think my most intense obsession

44
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,504
Like many kids

45
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:58,528
Was dinosaur

46
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,208
As all the certain that I Would One Day become a paleontologist

47
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:10,304
I don't know exactly where this dinosaur Obsession came from but I think

48
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,120
Part of it was just a dinosaur

49
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:16,192
I had all these books still with Incredible drawing

50
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:20,544
Colorful dinosaurs leaving around roaring and tearing into one another

51
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:23,104
I fell in love with the artwork in those books

52
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:27,712
At least for the time being part is the only way we experience dinosaur

53
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,016
We can study bones and fossils

54
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:35,136
The barn the invention of time travel were some Jurassic Park Resurrection scenario

55
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:37,696
We will never see these animals with our own eyes

56
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,744
There no photos or video

57
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,024
Which means that we want to

58
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,048
Picture how they look

59
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,840
Someone has to drama

60
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,120
Hello

61
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,656
I'm Doctor Robert Butler

62
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,448
Known to the folks

63
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:51,008
North Texas as Jurassic Bob

64
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,800
I dig bones

65
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,080
Dinosaur bones

66
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:57,664
Bob Barker is one of the most famous living paleontologist

67
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:01,248
He also happens to be a very skilled paleo artist

68
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,040
He thinks the two go hand in

69
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,064
Aren't

70
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:08,160
Is very important in teaching Natural History signs maybe all signs

71
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,696
Teach everyone art

72
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,000
And everyone music to patterns

73
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,816
I like Bob a lot

74
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:19,936
When I interviewed him in a studio in Boulder Colorado you show our orally

75
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,984
He brought his own snacks

76
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,520
He's got snacks

77
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,800
He's got coffee and simatai

78
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:28,128
Free range apple pie this is so River of this place

79
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,408
Just so well

80
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,176
Boulder

81
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,224
Cage-free apple pie

82
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,576
Once we got started with our interview Bob said that like me he got obsessed

83
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,368
Two dinosaurs in dinosaur art

84
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,904
Pretty early on

85
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,696
How I got a hook

86
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,000
What's a piece of Journalism

87
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,048
From 1950

88
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:48,608
3 Life Magazine cover story called

89
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,656
The world we live in

90
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,960
Annie's pictures of dinosaurs and whatnot

91
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:57,056
The cover image was the head of a long neck dinosaur sitting in a swamp

92
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,336
Munching on grass

93
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:00,640
What is stegosaurus in the background

94
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,408
Staring off

95
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,176
In the space

96
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:05,248
It was this article about evolution

97
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,272
After

98
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:08,320
2 hours without Life Magazine

99
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:10,624
Announce to my startled parents

100
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,416
Mom and Dad I want to grow up in

101
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,208
Invertebrate paleontology

102
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,024
And dad had no expression

103
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,839
And Mom smiled and said that's nice dear

104
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,887
It's a stage alive grow

105
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:25,471
But unlike me dinosaurs weren't just a childhood

106
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,495
Good face for grass

107
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,263
Bob

108
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,055
By the time he headed off to college

109
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,615
A career in vertebrate paleontology was

110
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,151
Still The Game Plan

111
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:35,711
But it was kind of a strange time to be entering the field

112
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:39,807
In the mid-twentieth century American dinosaur science was in a bit of a rut

113
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,111
Dinosaurs were considered big

114
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:42,879
Dumb

115
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,415
Cold-blooded

116
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,719
Evolutionary failures

117
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,487
Dustin

118
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,511
Extinction

119
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:53,119
And that stores affected how they were painted and drawn

120
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,935
Most of the paintings of dinosaurs

121
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,215
They're not

122
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,495
Losing

123
00:04:59,007 --> 00:04:59,519
They're not

124
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:00,799
Interacting

125
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,079
But each other

126
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:06,431
There's no spark of intelligence social life

127
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,223
And their bodies were like

128
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,271
Poking masses of Flesh

129
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,831
The white brontosaurus and Diplodocus

130
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:16,415
The biggest dinosaurs Illustrated they were like Giant

131
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,439
Gray

132
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,463
Vacuum cleaners

133
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:23,327
With very very short legs and they were slowly

134
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,863
Pulling themselves

135
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,911
Across the landscape or

136
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,703
Sitting neck-deep

137
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,727
Ineffective

138
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:30,495
Swamped

139
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:35,615
Dinosaurs were often drawn sitting in swamps like on that Life magazine cover

140
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,919
The thinking was they were so large they couldn't

141
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,711
Possibly hold up your own body weight

142
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:45,087
And if they were drawn on land they usually drag their fat tail behind them

143
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:45,855
As they walked

144
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,647
That's where we were

145
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,439
In the early 1960

146
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,999
Dinosaurs were sad

147
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:55,071
Cold blooded dead-ends in the history of life

148
00:05:56,607 --> 00:06:01,727
But paleontology was about to go through a spectacular and

149
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,031
Unanticipated u-turn

150
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,079
And a young Bob Barker

151
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,103
Just off to college

152
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,407
Would find himself right in the thick of the app

153
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,455
Freshman year

154
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:14,527
The Yale geology Department took me

155
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,551
Bunch of other freshmen

156
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,575
Today

157
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:20,671
The trip out west was led by one of Bob's professors at Yale

158
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,719
A paleontologist named John AUST

159
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:24,767
And among other things we dug up

160
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:25,791
4 wraps

161
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,095
They were a new species of raptor

162
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:30,399
That Professor Austin named Deinonychus

163
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,447
Terrible claw

164
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:35,007
And the bones were found really close together

165
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,031
Assimilate

166
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:39,359
They live together that were pack maybe intelligent

167
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:43,711
But what really got Professor awesome excited was the anatomy of the skeleton

168
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:50,367
After studying the fossil remains back at Yale also concluded that

169
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,135
Swamp creature

170
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,927
Nippon fleet-footed

171
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:55,231
Agile and extremely active

172
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:58,047
Ocean began to argue that if you really looked

173
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,839
Did the anatomy of many dinosaurs

174
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:02,399
They look less like Mom brain lizards

175
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,703
And more like super atleta

176
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,471
Like birds

177
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:09,055
And his student Bob Bakker found this idea really compelling

178
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:13,407
Members looking at a skeleton of a different dinosaur called

179
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,991
Ready to look like a roadrunner with a long ponytail

180
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,527
But wow

181
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:19,551
Just spoke

182
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:20,831
Sylheti

183
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,903
But then you read the text books and I'm supposed to believe that

184
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:27,231
As an undergraduate Bakker dissected modern animal

185
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,791
In an effort to better understand dinosaur musculature

186
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:33,119
He concluded that the old stereotypes about

187
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,167
Stupid sluggish dinosaurs

188
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,703
Didn't hold up

189
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,239
They weren't slowing

190
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,007
Sloppy

191
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,103
Now this idea wasn't totally new

192
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:47,711
Packer says that for decades going back as early as the mid-nineteenth century

193
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,783
There have been people saying that dinosaurs were

194
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,063
Smart active

195
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,087
And bird like

196
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,111
But

197
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:54,879
These

198
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:55,647
Facts

199
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,207
We're forgotten about really sweet

200
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,743
Dropped out of textbooks

201
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:02,815
So Bakker decided to publish a paper in a Yale Journal

202
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,095
And his editor says

203
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,375
I know what you should call

204
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,911
The study and I said what

205
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,447
She said you should call it

206
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,727
The superiority

207
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,751
Dinosaurs

208
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,775
Yeah

209
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,871
They weren't The evolutionary hasbeens

210
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,663
They weren't dead ends in the

211
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,431
Flow

212
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,967
Of darwinian process

213
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:22,271
Top-of-the-line big beat everybody

214
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:29,695
But convincing people that dinosaurs were actually totally different than they had been depicted the past 60 years

215
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:32,767
It's going to require more than a few good academic papers

216
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,071
The really change people's minds

217
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,863
Sometimes you gotta show

218
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,887
Instead of tell

219
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,983
And remember Bakker was a skilled illustrator as well as a scientist

220
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,287
And so when John Ostrom wrote his

221
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,335
Definitive paper on Deinonychus

222
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,639
Deus Bakr to do the illustration

223
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:51,711
And I positioned the bones as if

224
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,503
Kids Raptor

225
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,271
What's running

226
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:57,599
In the picture of the Raptor is nearly parallel with the ground

227
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:00,415
Is left leg springing forward it's right leg curl

228
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,951
Highly against its torso

229
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,487
Preparing for the next drawing

230
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,535
Potato is high in the air

231
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,559
It's beautiful

232
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,095
And kind of terrifying

233
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:11,167
Ostrom put the picture right on the front of his paper

234
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:13,727
And it quickly became an iconic drawing

235
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,031
No one has ever seen anything quite like it

236
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,591
DACA is like a renegade

237
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,127
This is Darren Naish

238
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:22,431
Paleontologist based in the UK

239
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:26,015
He's got like a flamboyant

240
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,295
John Bushey bed

241
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:31,391
Android from the late sixties when he's in a stocking stuffer this stuff

242
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:34,207
He's he's drawing these agile active

243
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:34,975
Dinosaurs

244
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:38,047
Docker finish up at Yale and went off to graduate school

245
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,839
Where he continued to speak truth

246
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:42,399
The Slowdown dinosaur establishment

247
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:47,263
Hero academic and popular articles about how impressive dinosaurs have been

248
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,567
Any Illustrated them all himself

249
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:52,127
He drew dinosaurs bounding across

250
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,663
The prehistoric landscape like

251
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,943
Track and field stars

252
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,991
With live muscular bodies

253
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:03,903
Safe from the storm would have been drawn as like a Godzilla type animal dragon

254
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:06,463
Style on the ground

255
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,791
On the back of you got this thing shown with massive

256
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,815
Bulging muscle

257
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:15,679
And Packers athletic dinosaurs became a model for other paleo artist

258
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,727
So when my Deinonychus

259
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,007
Drawing appeared

260
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,287
Some

261
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,823
Artist younger than I

262
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,359
Okay

263
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,127
And we can do it

264
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:29,247
Artists like Gregory Paul Embrace this new exciting vision of dinosaurs

265
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,551
They started giving their dinosaurs vibrant colors

266
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,087
Occasionally feather

267
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,879
Really emphasize their bird nests

268
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,183
Images of

269
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:39,487
Colorful dinosaurs were everywhere

270
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:44,095
And they helped fuel the revolution that was taking place in paleontology

271
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:53,567
Throughout the 70s more and more paleontologists got on board with Ostrum and baugher's theories

272
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:58,943
They found new fossils and footprint evidence suggesting that dinosaurs have been warm-blooded intelligence

273
00:10:59,199 --> 00:10:59,967
And birth like

274
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:03,039
This. Has become known as the dinosaur Renaissance

275
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:08,671
A moment when we totally rethought all of our assumptions about these incredible prehistoric animal

276
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,207
Indi Rene

277
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,231
Thanks art

278
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,279
Was a huge part of its success

279
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,559
I think that

280
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,583
Part of the

281
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:16,607
The reason

282
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,399
That was on soles of Darkness overnight

283
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,447
Baca

284
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:25,055
Drew in so many scientists in the 1670s boss because it was accompanied

285
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,847
But brilliant visuals

286
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:31,711
If anyone missed out on this Scientific Revolution and still thought that dinosaurs were

287
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,991
For slow and stupid

288
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:35,551
That ended in 1993

289
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,975
The dinosaurs in Jurassic Park are very

290
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,679
The dinosaurs of Jurassic Park 1990

291
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,727
Dial the dinosaur

292
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:54,751
Dinosaurs

293
00:11:55,775 --> 00:12:01,151
And when that movie came out the whole world got to see these Fierce athletic creatures

294
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,687
Running through kitchens in

295
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,967
Eating lawyer's office

296
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,039
The toilets

297
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,903
And once you've seen the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park

298
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,927
You can't

299
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:17,279
I think it's cemented the notion of athletic

300
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,047
Dinosaur

301
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,839
This is John Conway

302
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,887
He draws dinosaurs for a living

303
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,935
I'm a title artist which means that

304
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:24,703
I

305
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,727
Door and paint

306
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,519
Prehistoric animals

307
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:32,383
Conway got interested in paleoart after reading Bob Barker

308
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:38,271
And in the early part of his career

309
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,063
Super lean muscle

310
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:43,647
But after a while he started to feel kind of funny about it

311
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:46,719
He says all the dinosaurs look like they had been

312
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,279
United suction

313
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,583
Pack your pack your clothes and you put the

314
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,143
Vacuum cleaner on it and you suck all the air out

315
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,935
Shrinks it down

316
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:58,495
That's what about dinosaurs

317
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:01,055
Putting skin on them and then vacuuming a

318
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,079
Anything

319
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,103
There was in between that

320
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:03,871
Skin on the muscle

321
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,735
No paleoartist weren't just doing that to make their dinosaurs look all cool and buff

322
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,271
They were trying to be accurate

323
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,807
I am Poppy

324
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,855
The generation

325
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,879
Ohio law office

326
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,415
The crew up

327
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,463
Young age when we first start

328
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,023
To think that it really mattered

329
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,047
Set things right

330
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:26,655
And to get things right you want your art to be rooted in real scientific evidence

331
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,471
And the piece of evidence resolved in the skeleton

332
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:33,823
Paleo artist wood base the shape of their dinosaurs on an accurate skeleton

333
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:38,687
The bones give you a pretty good idea where the muscle should go but soft tissues likes

334
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:41,503
Fat are much harder

335
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:45,087
That usually doesn't survive for millions of years and fossils

336
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,647
So without any evidence of it

337
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:51,999
Paleoartist tended to be pretty conservative about how much fat they gave their dinosaurs

338
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:52,767
Which makes

339
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:55,839
Total since you're not going to add something that you don't have evidence

340
00:13:56,607 --> 00:14:00,703
But the result was that all these dinosaurs look like they went to the gym three times a day

341
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,751
And drink protein shakes for every meal

342
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,287
Done, it says

343
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:08,895
It began to feel as though paleo artist had replaced one Orthodoxy with another

344
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,175
At some point

345
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,199
I thought

346
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,271
We can't just keep doing this

347
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,039
This is

348
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:15,807
No

349
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,855
Interesting in many ways

350
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:18,879
And

351
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,415
Is it even right

352
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,231
Is this conservative approach really getting people

353
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:23,999
The right

354
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,791
Notion about what dinosaurs looked like

355
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,607
Just because fat didn't survive for Millions

356
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:31,167
Beerus doesn't mean that a dinosaur didn't have it

357
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,471
They are animals After All

358
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,751
I don't have time

359
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,287
And I have it all over the place

360
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,103
And some places I have really big fat Reserve

361
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,919
Which changes shape Valley dressed

362
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:46,527
Thunder score this point Conway asked me to consider a thought experiment

363
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,319
If we reconstructed

364
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,087
Magnanimous

365
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,623
Slightly reconstruct dinosaurs

366
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,903
What would they look like

367
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,439
In other words

368
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:58,047
If some alien paleontologist from millions of years in the future

369
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,351
What's the try and draw a modern animal

370
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,887
Isaiah well

371
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,911
Or a camel

372
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:05,471
Just from there fossilized skeleton

373
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:06,495
How would it look

374
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,031
Well if you actually do it

375
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,823
The month animals look

376
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,359
If you drop a

377
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:14,175
Bowhead whale for example just from the skeleton

378
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,223
Without a lot of fat or blubber

379
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,527
It looks kind of like a giant

380
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,551
Tadpole

381
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,343
Bulbous head

382
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,367
Along

383
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,159
Snake like tail I mean

384
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:27,231
You take away all that stuff and you not left with much Leo

385
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:30,559
Because why else that shape is defined by fat

386
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,863
Dinosaurs also had fat

387
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:36,191
And John argues that it would have changed their shape pretty dramatically

388
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:38,751
Who knows somebody even had humps

389
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:39,775
Like animals

390
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:42,079
You could take one of my cement dinosaurs

391
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,871
That dinosaur could have camel humps

392
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,407
And we wouldn't know

393
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:46,687
Right

394
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,735
Cuz you can't tell from a camel

395
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,015
Back to the house

396
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:50,783
Pumps

397
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,319
There's not really anything that

398
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:54,879
Brontosaurus could Adam sweet

399
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:02,047
Mount scientist do sometimes find dinosaur fossils with the sauce

400
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,327
Pocket tissues intact

401
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,863
And when they do

402
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:07,935
They can completely change our image of the animal

403
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:11,007
Dinosaur Apatosaurus for example

404
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,287
Used to be depicted in a

405
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,591
Standard shrink wraps kind of way

406
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:17,407
Colleges found this amazing

407
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:19,711
Full body fossil wear lots of a

408
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,479
Fat and

409
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:24,063
And the different soft tissues have been perfectly preserved

410
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,343
Turns out

411
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:28,415
Fleshy outlawed around the body was

412
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:30,719
Coextensive it was quite chubby creature

413
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:33,535
Is striping light up ice all over the body

414
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:37,375
Drawing of the top of the tire without a hundred long curving

415
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:40,447
Quills the good kind of like fluffy porcupine

416
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,775
You out a lot together that's that's a creature this

417
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,055
We we just

418
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,079
Would not protect

419
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,359
Based on

420
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,895
Just finding buttons align

421
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:51,455
In recent years fossils have been found with

422
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,223
Fat and

423
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,527
Frills and thick coats of feathers

424
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,063
Way more than anyone have predicted

425
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,623
Every time we discover something likes

426
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,671
It's weird

427
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,463
And I caught me thinking

428
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:05,791
So if all the ones we've discovered so far

429
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,583
I've turned out to be pretty weird

430
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,375
What does that tell us about the rest of them

431
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:10,655
There are

432
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:11,679
Bizarre

433
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,495
Possibilities out there that no one's looking

434
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:15,775
And

435
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,311
I thought well I'm going to

436
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,847
Stop drinking

437
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,407
So John began to try something new with hazard

438
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:22,943
He started

439
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,967
To speculate

440
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:29,087
He started drawing pudgy dinosaurs and dinosaurs with humps

441
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,111
Quills

442
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,647
Weird skin flaps

443
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:32,927
And that was my rule

444
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:33,695
It was

445
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:35,743
How far can we go what's the

446
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:39,071
Most outrageous thing I can do

447
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:41,375
That we know we don't know isn't true right

448
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,911
It's still within the Realms of

449
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,191
Possibility of snow.

450
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:47,775
John wasn't just making stuff up out of thin air

451
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:52,639
It was like there was a standard conservative dinosaur at the center of his drawings

452
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,919
Linn County

453
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,967
Cover it with more speculative Elliman

454
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:58,527
Wasn't claiming that every drawing

455
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,063
He did was perfectly accurate

456
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:03,647
But you wanted to show people that dinosaurs as a group

457
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:07,231
Probably had a lot more weird variety than we think

458
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:10,559
I'm sorry to get the overall picture dinosaurs ride

459
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,095
I think you need

460
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:14,655
A healthy dose of speculation in there

461
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,703
Conway says that dinosaur art

462
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:20,543
Should always reflect the latest science what we know for sure

463
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,591
Who will never know everything

464
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,151
And I think the speculation

465
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:25,919
Isabel

466
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,455
What extra

467
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:28,991
All of

468
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,783
We is beautiful in the world

469
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,551
Back then

470
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,343
The wheel just never know about

471
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,623
Urolithiasis

472
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,415
Took us to bring back some of that real

473
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:39,999
Magic as a prehistoric whale that was suddenly there

474
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:45,375
John eventually decided to give the world some of that magic in the form of a book

475
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:49,471
Teamed up with Darren Naish and another paleo artist named memo kozma

476
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:51,775
In Publix a slim little paperback

477
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:52,543
Call

478
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,567
All yesterday

479
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,359
All yesterday's is

480
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:58,943
Still with dinosaurs that look very different from what you're used to

481
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,479
There's a triceratops

482
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:01,759
What's covered in spines

483
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,295
How much is Soros with

484
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:05,087
Skin that camouflage that against

485
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,367
Forest floor

486
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:11,231
And if there is unisaurus that is so covered in feathers that looks like a haystack

487
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:15,327
Next to each image the artist describes why they drew it that way

488
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:18,143
The camouflage dinosaur is drawn that way because

489
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:22,495
The artist reason that It's oddly proportioned body might have made it vulnerable

490
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:23,263
The Predators

491
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:25,567
And in need of some kind of defense strategy

492
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,615
All yesterday's was a big hit

493
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:28,895
And it helped Spark

494
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:31,967
A little movement for more speculative paleoart

495
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:36,063
We talked about the old yesterday's movement as like it's the new frontier

496
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,599
All the way we should depict

497
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,879
Prehistoric animals

498
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:44,255
Darren Naish says it's more acceptable now to draw a dinosaur based on a hypothesis

499
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:47,583
For example horned dinosaurs like Triceratops have these

500
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,863
Surly large nausea

501
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:51,423
Confuse paleontologist for years

502
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,471
There been a few different hypotheses but

503
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,495
Bored by scientist

504
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,799
And one of them is that the dinosaurs

505
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,591
May have had inflatable

506
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,615
Nos balloons

507
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:02,687
Cuddly elephant seal hooded seal inflatable

508
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,455
Couches

509
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,479
But just

510
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:07,295
Would have looked weird and grotesque in Australia

511
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,087
Expressive very real possibility

512
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:13,439
No 20 years ago if someone were to draw Triceratops with nose balloons

513
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,975
They would have been laughed at

514
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,511
But I would say that

515
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,559
What we called you yesterday smooth

516
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:20,607
That means that it is now quite

517
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,423
Reasonable for an autistic

518
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,215
I've shown my Triceratops

519
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,007
Rejoin excitable nosebleed

520
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,543
Does this reason

521
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:30,335
And you could say

522
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,871
Nikon S2 specs

523
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:34,175
Justifiable

524
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,455
Site

525
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:37,247
Set the time being.

526
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,295
That doesn't mean Triceratops

527
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:41,087
Definitely had nose balloon

528
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:45,951
But by drawing it that way it's like the artist is asking us to keep an open mind

529
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:50,047
Because even though we know a lot about the prehistoric world

530
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,839
More and more everyday

531
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,375
The science is always changing

532
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:56,447
The past is always a moving Target

533
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,223
Tell me what is not just about drawing dinosaurs with

534
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,759
Stripes and nos balloons

535
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:12,575
Illustrators also depict dinosaur Behavior

536
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:17,184
Which may have even a greater impact on how we imagine extinct animals

537
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,720
Moron

538
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:19,744
After this

539
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:27,680
Between the beats

540
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:29,984
Bongs and chatter of our devices

541
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,568
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man made sound

542
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,592
If

543
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:40,992
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife isn't

544
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:44,832
Another word for all hearing

545
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:45,856
Technology

546
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:46,624
She talked to us

547
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,928
It is a creation of Sonic trash

548
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,000
That's Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

549
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:55,328
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

550
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,376
To make them more human

551
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:01,472
Turn the living room lights on

552
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,264
Okay

553
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:05,312
Dim the living room lights to 50

554
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,080
2%

555
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:07,872
Okay

556
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:14,016
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

557
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:16,320
Makes for a much more natural

558
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,088
Experience

559
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,880
Turn the living room lights on

560
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:22,208
Dim the living room lights

561
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:23,232
50%

562
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,560
We're presenting to

563
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:30,656
Special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

564
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:33,472
About how are soundscape is impacting our health

565
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:36,032
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

566
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,848
Look for them Fridays May 17th and May 24th

567
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:39,616
Right here

568
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:45,504
We need to talk about something

569
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,808
Constipation abdominal pain and bloating

570
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:52,672
You tell yourself it's not that bad you take laxatives modify your diet and exercise routine

571
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:54,720
Thinking about it all the time is frustrating

572
00:22:54,976 --> 00:23:00,096
It doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again

573
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:03,424
And you don't know why and it may be time to seek help

574
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,752
Go to oh my God. Info podcast

575
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:11,616
We can learn more about your symptoms that's oh my God. Info / podcast

576
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:12,640
Oh my God

577
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:17,248
Hello this is Emmett

578
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,016
Back

579
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,552
With ramen in the studio to talk

580
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:22,112
A little bit more about Taylor White

581
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:26,976
Dinosaur

582
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,512
Kieran's like the look

583
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:31,072
Of their physical bodies right there

584
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,352
Another

585
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,376
Pretty important

586
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,144
Issue with us

587
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,680
Is dinosaur Behavior like

588
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:37,216
If you're going to draw a dinosaur

589
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:40,544
Try doing something

590
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,384
And feel like when you think of what are the dinosaurs usually

591
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,152
Doing

592
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:47,456
Usually the T-Rex is

593
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,736
Tearing someone apart

594
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:50,528
Usually the

595
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:52,320
Brontosaurus

596
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,600
As we mentioned was

597
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:55,648
Stanija swamp with leaves

598
00:23:56,416 --> 00:24:01,024
Car hanging out of its mouth or it's probably

599
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:05,632
Eating another dinosaur attacking another dinosaur eating dinosaur is probably

600
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:11,520
Being attacked or like a running away and some kind of way eating a plant

601
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:12,800
Whatever you

602
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:19,456
8 of the dinosaur is what you should be depicted doing at any moment of

603
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:24,320
Which like you know I mean in some ways it's not just a dinosaur thing like if you think about

604
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:26,880
Nature Documentaries we'd like to depict

605
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:27,648
Action

606
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:28,416
Totally

607
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:30,464
The last time you saw a cheetah

608
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,256
Doing anything other than

609
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:38,656
Running down a gazelle and like biting its throat but like she does do a lot of other

610
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:42,496
Thanks a complex life

611
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:45,312
End in the back like a real a real point that way through with

612
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:49,408
Art fair for people like Darren and John who who are in our our pieces like

613
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,432
They think

614
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,200
Alive

615
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,480
Of a lot of animals

616
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:54,784
Including dinosaurs are a lot less

617
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,320
Action-packed

618
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:59,904
Hit it feels like when you are just looking at the yard

619
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,464
Opening their mouths involving

620
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,536
The camera all the time to not just kidding and farting

621
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:06,816
State doing

622
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,352
Things living animals

623
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:11,680
Do that like United moving around and sleeping and

624
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:13,984
And finding food and being boring office

625
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:14,752
The time

626
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:18,336
Why didn't you mention this earlier

627
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:22,176
Of all the dinosaurs that we don't associate with that kind of like

628
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:26,528
Boring activity like Tyrannosaurus Rex total ranks like

629
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:27,552
Free high

630
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:29,344
Like it up all the ones you said you would

631
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,112
Action

632
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:30,880
Violence

633
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:32,928
Absolutely

634
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:35,744
It's always chomping at something that's its role

635
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,864
Even the end of Jurassic Park is role of two in the movie by chomping a dinosaur

636
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,400
Right right

637
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:44,704
And so when

638
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,520
The book all yesterday's they've obviously wanted to put

639
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:48,800
Tyrannosaurus in there

640
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:51,360
And John based his T-Rex painting

641
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:55,712
On this one skeleton is kind of famous skeleton and scientists have nicknames

642
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:56,480
Stan

643
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:59,808
Stan is quite an aggressive looking Tyrannosaurus in a waistcoat

644
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:00,832
Quite a large

645
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:01,600
Long

646
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:02,880
Scary looking head

647
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:07,744
I'm so sad is traditionally depicted doing very nasty things to other animals

648
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:13,120
But John is also like pretty adamant like that's not the whole truth if I was like who this creature was

649
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,656
They probably going to kill something

650
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,448
Once every two weeks

651
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:19,776
You know they spent the vast majority of their life

652
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,056
Asleep

653
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:21,824
Probably

654
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:24,896
With a great big full belly just sleeping on the ground

655
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:26,688
And say that's how I painted it

656
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:30,016
City of that picture in the book

657
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:31,296
The buck

658
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,648
It's almost like a

659
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:36,416
Cute

660
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,440
It's very cute

661
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:44,864
It's like slightly curled up with its little tiny T-Rex arms up by its chin this is like one of John's like favorite pieces

662
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,400
From all yesterday's in

663
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,936
And he and he called it

664
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:49,472
Sleepy Stan

665
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:52,032
What an infected mean this picture

666
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,568
It doesn't even show his teeth

667
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:58,176
When sleeping which I don't think I've ever seen a T-rex picture

668
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:04,576
Without it burying its teeth right which is a stunning to think about that I've never and I've been now I as I see it

669
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:07,136
I know it's true I've never seen one without his teeth being

670
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,416
Peanut Bean

671
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,720
Chao and how long they are

672
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,256
Probably ripping into Flash

673
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,560
But yeah we just we don't show

674
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:16,352
Tyrannosaurus Jess

675
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:18,912
Relaxing and that's what they did most of the time

676
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,192
Bright

677
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:20,960
Pretty good life

678
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:22,240
Sleepy Stan

679
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,312
That's awesome

680
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:27,360
So if you flip run into

681
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:30,688
Like the back of the book just one more thing that I want to show you some

682
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:31,456
This back

683
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,480
Section

684
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,784
Of the book is actually called

685
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,320
All today's

686
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,624
The idea behind

687
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,648
This part of the book

688
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,696
It's sort of the actualization

689
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:44,768
Thought experiment that John Conway asked

690
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:46,304
Stuff to do right where

691
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,584
You know you're imagining up

692
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,120
An alien paleontologist

693
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,424
In the future who is trying to piece together what the

694
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,472
The Contemporary world the animals of the

695
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:54,496
Contemporary world

696
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:56,288
Look like based on fossil evidence

697
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:57,824
Right so this

698
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,872
This picture I'm looking at now is that

699
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:01,408
Is a manatee

700
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:04,480
But it's a land of grazing land herbivore

701
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:07,040
Fred read the can you read the description they have there

702
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:10,880
Says a solitary Manatee is shown grazing and it's Mountain Home

703
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:13,696
We only know the skull of this enigmatic herbivore

704
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:19,584
Basically like in this case they're saying like you saw it with this animal maybe we only the only thing we ever got was

705
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,192
From that you're trying to make you like all this looks a little bit like a cow skull

706
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:30,336
And it's totally common and dinosaurs that the only find one for the section it's very rare that we find full of skeletons to tell you everything about

707
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:34,176
Pic of a manatee skull intro enough you would think

708
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:34,944
That's a

709
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,016
That's a cow and even if you do find a full skeleton

710
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:39,296
And there are other things

711
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:46,208
You wouldn't have a trunk so as evidence of this elevator just the snub-nosed

712
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,512
Weezer such a thing

713
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:54,912
Oh my God that's so true right there like a camel the same way that we don't message me when necessarily know that a camel

714
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:55,936
What had humps Yuan

715
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,472
Know that an elephant had drunk

716
00:28:57,728 --> 00:29:03,872
Which is like such an iconic weird piece of anatomy in the world

717
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:05,408
Open bar but it's not it's not

718
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:08,480
It's not there and therefore it doesn't look at all like an elephant and it just looks

719
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:12,832
I'm and I really like it really sells especially with these

720
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:16,928
A speculative imaginings of modern animals really sells the idea of it a lot

721
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:17,952
All right

722
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:21,280
Baby go I like I like their texts on some of these still like

723
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:26,912
If you breed the swans it like in a two swans or seams are long site like four limbs

724
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:29,728
Which they must have used a spear small prey items

725
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:33,568
One of them has just caught a tadpole one of the mysterious fish of the past

726
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:41,760
Oh it's so perfect really they really embody this like this like you know this is futuristic

727
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:48,416
He's trying to piece together the world that we currently live in now is making these kind of conception

728
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:50,464
Will leads from evidence to

729
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,256
The obtaining a real picture of what

730
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,560
The world actually look like

731
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:58,912
But they're still have wings doing their best it's not like making fun of them

732
00:29:59,168 --> 00:29:59,936
It just has to

733
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:01,728
With limited information we have

734
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,544
This is what we create right and really shows

735
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,592
The limits of that information

736
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:07,616
That's so cool

737
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,920
It's such a good idea to think the

738
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,712
This way it dislodges

739
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,528
The iconography from your mind to be free

740
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:17,856
I got something about him and lots of ways and that's that's really

741
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:20,160
And it really sells it when you see

742
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,696
The modern animal

743
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:23,488
Defected in the house for traditional
