Every house is haunted

21
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:08,864
This is 99% invisible I'm Roman Mars

22
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:11,424
I want to start with a letter

23
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,984
And this is reporter Matthew kielty

24
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,008
This is the letter that got

25
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:18,336
Send out to a couple hundred people back in 1990 so

26
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,616
Roman View

27
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:21,664
You had a letter

28
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,224
Dear so-and-so

29
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:30,368
Be safe disposal of nuclear waste is one of the most pressing issues facing the United States today

30
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:36,256
Total skip down past that I mean that's just about how

31
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:40,352
We're planning on burying a bunch of waste out in New Mexico desert

32
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,632
At this place called d

33
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:45,984
Waste isolation pilot plant but if you go to another paragraph

34
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,384
You have been nominated to participate in a study sponsored by Sandia National Laboratories

35
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,784
Kinds of marker should be placed as witb sites

36
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,672
Philip a marker system that will remain operational during the performance. Of the site

37
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,000
10000 years

38
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:09,536
There it is

39
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,328
That is that is the part

40
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,864
That I love

41
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:17,216
I had a moment of wondering if it was a joke this is John Lambert

42
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,496
He received one of these

43
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,288
Which makes sense

44
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,312
Giving his line of work

45
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,336
I'm an artist

46
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:26,944
And I work on projects involving unusual communication

47
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,320
Do spent time in 70s working with Carl Sagan and Ann druyan on the Voyager golden record

48
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:38,720
One of NASA's attempts at communicating with aliens

49
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:43,584
No usually you don't get asked to design something that's going to last 10000 years

50
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:47,424
That's twice the span of recorded human history

51
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,448
The federal government

52
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,984
Really was calling on him

53
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,520
To help protect people

54
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,056
10000 years in the future

55
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:58,176
The waste isolation pilot plant wipp or whip

56
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:58,944
Pursue art

57
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,528
Which ordered into existence by Congress in 1979

58
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,064
The thinking was

59
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:10,464
The US ought to have a safe place to put radioactive byproducts from nuclear weapons manufacturing and

60
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,488
Nuclear Power Plant

61
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:14,560
And a quick refresher even though you don't see radiation

62
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:16,608
And you might not feel its effects right away

63
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,912
Exposure to radioactive materials

64
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:23,264
Can destroy your body at a molecular level it can leave Burns

65
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,800
Can cause cancer

66
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,592
It can even mutate your DNA

67
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,640
You think about radioactivity

68
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,432
Is that it is very spreadable

69
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,968
Say you've got a tool that

70
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:35,040
Text a piece of plutonium now that tool is radioactive

71
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:38,880
And say a worker was wearing protective gloves while using that tool

72
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:41,440
Chances are those clubs are radioactive to

73
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:44,768
The waste isolation pilot plant was designed to store all this stuff

74
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,560
And keep us all safe from it

75
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,608
The website is in New Mexico

76
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,144
Deep in the desert

77
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,192
About 26 miles east of

78
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:52,960
Carlsbad

79
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:53,984
It's

80
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:00,384
It's a really cool place and it reminded me of kind of the headquarters of Spectre or doctor know and it's

81
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,408
James Bond

82
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,432
Novel

83
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:08,832
Cuz it's it's it's a big underground facility filled with no technicians and income

84
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:15,232
Coveralls in a color-coded depending on what they did in person when he accept

85
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,024
Imitation from Sandia labs

86
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,375
Go be a part of the big group thing on designing a 10,000 your warning for the place

87
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:27,519
Happy you turn it down this was in 1991 so took John into An Elevator Shaft

88
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:31,615
And they go down about a half a mile beneath the surface

89
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,431
Bissonnet where John saw these enormous

90
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,455
Caverns

91
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:39,295
They've carved out this repository in basically assault

92
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,319
Deposit

93
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,599
Salt deposit

94
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,391
200 million years old

95
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,415
And

96
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,463
And we think of Saul as white

97
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:52,607
But this salt for reasons I don't understand was kind of a salmony pink color

98
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:56,191
So the walls of this place we're all crystalline

99
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,983
With this

100
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:03,103
Sort of shot through with the excuse of of salmon and

101
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,639
And pink and orange

102
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,431
So we actually quite beautiful

103
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,711
All this Radioactive

104
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,479
Stuff

105
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:11,039
I'll be loaded in the thousands of oil drums

106
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:11,807
Pact

107
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:12,831
Entities Cavern

108
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,623
And then

109
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,903
Underground chamber

110
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,183
Will be sealed up

111
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,463
Left alone

112
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:21,279
Years will pass in those years will become deck

113
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,839
Those decades will become centuries

114
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,399
Centuries will roll in the millenia

115
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,215
The people above ground will come and go

116
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,751
Cultures will rise and fall

117
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,287
And all the while

118
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,567
Below the surface

119
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,359
The salt will do what salt does

120
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,639
It's with the right temperature and pressure

121
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,175
Will slowly

122
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:38,943
Creep

123
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,223
Wiki Nick Cave

124
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,247
Old ways

125
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,295
Smaller and smaller

126
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,319
Smaller

127
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:47,135
Until the salt swallows up all those oil drums

128
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,159
Crushing it

129
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,279
Solidified in the Earth

130
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:58,143
Clubs in little bits from

131
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,191
All-Star Radioactive

132
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,215
Poisonous

133
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,495
More than

134
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,775
200000 years

135
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:05,823
Basically

136
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:06,847
Forever

137
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:14,527
Storing something dangerous Safeway forever is a huge design problem in fact the jury still out

138
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:17,855
On whether they sell the basics of the story's problem at all

139
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:24,255
In February of 2014 a leak was detected that expose several workers to low levels of radio

140
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,303
Malaysian and whip has been closed

141
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,071
Incense

142
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:32,703
The department of energy now predicts that it could be up to three years before whip is fully operational again

143
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:34,239
We know these facts

144
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,775
Because we can look it up

145
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:38,335
And read the news in a shared language

146
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:42,175
The problem that Jon lomberg was brought out to New Mexico to solve

147
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:46,271
Was not about communicating the danger of whip to people today

148
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:50,367
He wanted to figure out how to tell people Millennia from now

149
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,671
That this place is dangerous

150
00:06:55,231 --> 00:07:00,095
When Jon lomberg arrived in New Mexico he met the teammates he be collaborating with

151
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:02,143
There were geologist language

152
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,167
Astrophysicist

153
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,983
There was science fiction writer Gregory Benford

154
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,031
The archaeologist

155
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,079
This is Maureen Maureen Kaplan

156
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:13,151
An archaeologist with a consulting firm ERG

157
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,431
Do you remember what you thought

158
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:16,991
Of the people that got together like me first song

159
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:18,527
There's like

160
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,063
Oh my goodness

161
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:20,831
She was

162
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:21,855
Kind of starstruck

163
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,391
Lumberg

164
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,183
Wait a moment Orange

165
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,207
The one who

166
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:31,327
Did the picture of that went off into space in terms of trying to communicate with whoever might

167
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:34,399
So I was impressed

168
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:38,495
Happy Hollows and whatnot the same to you folks split all these Smarties into

169
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,263
Two different groups

170
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,079
So they'd have kind of two separate thinking process

171
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:46,175
John was in Kirby Marine Group and then

172
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,455
Delete down the ground rules

173
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,247
They told us to assume

174
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,551
That we're designing a warning marker

175
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,319
For humans

176
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,367
Not aliens not cyborg

177
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:57,951
But for a human being biologically identical to us

178
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:03,071
But who's alive 500 or 5000 or 10000 years from now

179
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,119
How can you make a message

180
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:08,191
That not human will understand

181
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,471
And why

182
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,239
Why

183
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,263
10000 years

184
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:17,663
As far as I can determine the the logic seem to be well if we told him to design a marker to last two

185
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,503
150000 years is that clearly or ridiculous and absurd proposition

186
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:24,319
2000 years doesn't sound quite so crazy

187
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:27,135
It was it was just pulled out of the air

188
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:32,767
In other words even though this site is going to be radioactive for hundreds of thousands of years

189
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:37,631
This panel is only responsible for keeping this place efficiently labeled for humans

190
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,423
The next ten thousand years

191
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,703
Let's get some perspective

192
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,519
Think about where Humanity was 10000 years ago

193
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:47,359
Back then there was a hot new technology taking the World by storm

194
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,151
It was called

195
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,175
Farming

196
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:54,527
Before the Agricultural Revolution humans existed as gatherer Hunters

197
00:08:54,783 --> 00:09:00,927
Biologically we are the same people we were 10000 years ago going back over 40

198
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:01,695
A Thousand Years

199
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:05,279
But culturally we share almost nothing with these people

200
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,815
Definitely not language

201
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:09,119
Well no cuz the linguist

202
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,399
Tell us that language

203
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:12,703
Changes language has a half-life

204
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,751
Just like radioactive materials

205
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,031
Have a half life

206
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,055
And it's half life

207
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,079
Isn't very long

208
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,639
Think about Shakespeare

209
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,431
Cousin Westmoreland

210
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,967
Name I fat cousin

211
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,247
Alack what

212
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,015
Poverty

213
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,879
Call General Zaroff clothes.

214
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:31,647
Some of the words

215
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:34,207
Flash

216
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,231
Pink one

217
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:44,703
But you know high schoolers to get to read Shakespeare was only four hundred years ago 4% of 10

218
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,471
And out in ears

219
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:49,567
What's go back to Beowulf Old English

220
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,359
Failed cooning at 3

221
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,383
Doolin Dalton

222
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,919
Basically incomprehensible

223
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,711
Ln fremington

224
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,991
Offshoot

225
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:57,759
Shaving

226
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,551
Yeah

227
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,831
It's like a different language

228
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:03,135
And I know you can't see this because this is

229
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,671
Radio but trust me

230
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,975
It's just as confusing on the written page

231
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:08,767
You can recognize most of the letters

232
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:11,327
Just being part of the English alphabet but they

233
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,887
Barely correspond with how we use those letters today

234
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,983
And that's from your 1,000 10% of 10000 years

235
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,799
There are some languages that are very resistant

236
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,567
The change

237
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,431
That is languages to get in Shrine in biblical texts in religious texts

238
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,735
Latin Hebrew Arabic

239
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,271
Those aren't sure bets either

240
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:33,087
The oldest written text go back to ancient Sumeria

241
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:35,135
About 4600 years ago

242
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:38,719
And those languages are long since dead

243
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:41,535
And that's not even the halfway mark of our time frame

244
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,863
Both team a and Team B at the whip

245
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,399
Brainstorming session

246
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,191
Realize pretty quickly that

247
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:50,239
Every language on the planet today

248
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,775
Could be gone

249
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,823
Well before 10000 years

250
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:54,847
And

251
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:59,199
How can you start a conversation with somebody that you have no common language with

252
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,479
Both group swing

253
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,247
Sure about this

254
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,831
Got to be something

255
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:05,855
Belgian language

256
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:06,879
Symbols

257
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,415
Simple pictures

258
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:12,511
There are some facial expressions with your pretty Universal

259
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,791
:-)

260
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,583
Two dots rise hats

261
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,351
Mouth

262
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:20,447
Puppy and take another one for like

263
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:26,847
Symbol for mystery Yak if you were alive in the 80s you know this one

264
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,735
Teriyaki

265
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,783
Mystery

266
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,855
Is

267
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:42,719
It's a logo of a green face with squinty eyes and a stuck out tongue

268
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:44,767
The face looks like it's about to be sick

269
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:53,727
It was designed to be put on cleaning products and other household poisons to let kids know at whatever's inside

270
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,031
Is going to be horrible for you

271
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,335
And so thinking along those lines

272
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,383
They considered another logo

273
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,431
Which they thought might be Universal

274
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,479
Actually Carl Sagan proposal

275
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,759
Seguin couldn't make it

276
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:09,599
But you sent him a letter saying this pole marker problem was easy

277
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,391
You just need the right symbol

278
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,415
And

279
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,951
Can you just the one

280
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,487
Skull and crossbones

281
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:17,791
The Jolly Roger

282
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,839
Death incarnate

283
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,143
Well

284
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:25,215
You know where the skull and crossbones came from

285
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,775
No no I don't leave earliest

286
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,311
Uses of it

287
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,847
Orin

288
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,151
Religious paintings and sculptures

289
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,431
From

290
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,199
Middle-aged

291
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:39,295
We're at the foot of the cross where Jesus is crucified

292
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:40,831
There's a skull

293
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,903
With two bones in the shape of a cross not an ex

294
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,183
The shape of a cross

295
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,231
Huh at Adams School

296
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,791
And the bones are the symbol of the Resurrection

297
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:52,607
So instead of it being a symbol of death

298
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,911
It was a symbol of resurrection and rebirth

299
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,983
But fast forward a couple of centuries

300
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:04,127
There's a lot of trade going on Merchant ships traveling to and fro and in the ship's log

301
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,663
If a sailor died

302
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:10,015
The captain would put a little skull and crossbones next to his name

303
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:14,367
And a lot of the sailors came to associate that symbol

304
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:20,767
With death the rebirth part of it was kind of lost fast forward another Century you got time

305
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:27,167
Without marauding on the high seas they plundered other boats and stole their cargo and along the way some Pirates realize

306
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:31,519
We could use a symbol to let their targets know who they were

307
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:37,919
A branding campaign to terrify they're targets into compliance clear

308
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:40,991
Pirates and if you don't surrender

309
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:45,087
We're going to kill you if your guess

310
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:48,159
But there are actually several different icon

311
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,439
That pirates used

312
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,231
For example a heart

313
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:53,279
With blood dripping out of it

314
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:57,887
That was a popular pirate flag and an even more popular symbol with an hourglass

315
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:59,935
An hourglass an hourglass

316
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:00,703
Matt

317
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,263
If you don't surrender in a certain amount of time

318
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:08,895
We're going to kill you all so The Hourglass for a while was the was the most feared

319
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,175
Pirate symbol

320
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:16,831
But then one of the Calico Jack Rackham

321
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,623
Was captured and put on trial

322
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,159
In the legal proceedings

323
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,975
It came out that two of the Pirates and Calico Jack's

324
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:23,743
True

325
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,511
We're women

326
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,047
And that one of them was

327
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,839
Pregnant with Calico Jack's child

328
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,119
This was

329
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,911
D tablets game of the day

330
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:34,495
Everyone in England was reading about this trial

331
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,287
Anyway it just so happened that

332
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,567
Calico Jack symbol

333
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,359
Was the Jolly Roger

334
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:42,431
Though in his case the bones were replaced with a pair of

335
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,455
Crossword

336
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,735
Quick aside

337
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:48,575
The name Jolly Roger is probably an English Corruption of the French

338
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,855
Joli Rouge

339
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:50,623
Work

340
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,647
Pretty red

341
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,439
Because the original pirate flag

342
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,463
Or red

343
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,487
Not black

344
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,767
After that trial

345
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,583
Installing crossbones started showing up on book covers

346
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:05,215
Treasure Island kind of novels and crossbones with permeating culture as a symbol of danger

347
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,263
Jump Ahead to the late 1800s

348
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:11,871
Dye factories in Germany started using the skull and crossbones with the symbol for poison

349
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:18,015
Half a century later than Nazis adopted it as the symbol for their SS death head

350
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,039
Division

351
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,575
Skull and crossbones

352
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,879
Came to be associated with danger and death

353
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,903
Around the world

354
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,183
But

355
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,463
Did it become Universal

356
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,487
Not really

357
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,279
Think about what's happened with

358
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,047
Discount crossbow

359
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,583
Last 20-30 years

360
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,119
Gone mainstream

361
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:36,703
Now you'll see it on kids book bags on onesies for infants

362
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,751
You can even buy water bottle

363
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,031
With the skull and crossed

364
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,079
So much for the whole

365
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:42,847
Play something

366
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:49,247
In the original meaning as it pertained to Adam and the resurrection is long gone

367
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,271
We took from this

368
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,039
Is that

369
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,319
Symbols

370
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,343
Can change

371
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,879
Iconographic adrift

372
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:55,647
Haven't

373
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:58,719
And we haven't even touched on cultural interpretation

374
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:00,767
Like there's a candy company in Mex

375
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,047
Call la Catrina

376
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:05,887
And their logo the logo that goes on the packaging for their sweet

377
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:06,911
Is a

378
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:07,679
Call

379
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:12,287
And so to bring us back to the website in New Mexico

380
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:15,871
Realize that symbols couldn't be trusted to mean the same things over.

381
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:19,455
Next idea we could tell a little story

382
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,479
Using sticks

383
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:22,271
Visual storytelling

384
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:25,855
Let's stick together like any five-year-old can draw

385
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:26,879
A circle on top

386
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,927
Trunk two arms and two legs

387
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:29,951
Why

388
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,743
Well there are two things

389
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,791
It seemed to be Universal

390
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,071
Inhuman or

391
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,863
What is a stick figure

392
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:43,519
And you find them or drawing on the walls of the caves in the cave paintings that are 25000 years old

393
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:49,919
Which by the way maybe the only piece of graphic art survive in for more than 10,000 years

394
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,455
Art food we can draw meaning

395
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:54,527
And John says there's another convention that is universal

396
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,319
A sequence of events

397
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,879
First this happened then this happened then this house

398
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,183
So like a narrative

399
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:03,999
A story storyboard a comic strip

400
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,047
You just find it everywhere

401
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,327
And in fact

402
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,887
You can even Define a symbol

403
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,167
Using stick figure

404
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,447
Check it out

405
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,239
Let's do a simple comic strip

406
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,031
First brain

407
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,823
You put the small child

408
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,639
And the child is in front of a small plant a sapling

409
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:21,663
Second brain

410
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,271
That child is a little bit bigger now and the sapling behind him has grown a little bit

411
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:28,063
Next to the child is

412
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,927
A barrel and on that Barrel is the symbol for radiation the trefoil symbol

413
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,463
And the child is touching

414
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,231
That Barrel

415
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:39,839
Go to 3rd frame you got a full grown big old tree you got a child that is now

416
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,887
An adult human being except

417
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:45,471
The person is lying

418
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,751
On the ground

419
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:47,775
Presumably dead

420
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:50,847
X's over their eyes frowny mouth

421
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,383
And the barrel now with

422
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,175
The Triple L symbol is open

423
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:56,223
It's clearly the idea is

424
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,503
Don't touch

425
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:00,575
Anything with the trefoils symbol or at least not a barrel

426
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:06,975
Of course you read it from right to left and it's a totally different story the old guy who is sick discovers the Fountain of Youth

427
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,279
He's reborn okay

428
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,071
All is not lost

429
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,351
Maybe you could use

430
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,119
Arrows

431
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:18,495
Bears RB Universal or maybe you can situate the various comic strips in a sequence

432
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,799
That you can only see sequentially

433
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,591
Based on how they are arranged in space

434
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:25,663
So I don't know maybe it's possible.

435
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,223
Create a universally recognizable warning sign

436
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,247
That way

437
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:34,111
Regardless of whatever symbol were trying to come up with or whatever story that we're trying to tell

438
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:37,183
You can we actually build something

439
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:37,951
Make some

440
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:38,975
Metaphysical

441
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:40,511
Tangible things that can last

442
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:41,791
10000 years

443
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:45,887
The brainstormers that whip thought about building something from solid gold

444
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:48,447
What what's going to happen they're going to get stolen

445
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:50,495
Marine Kaplan the archaeologist

446
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:51,775
Purple eyes

447
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:54,591
Same thing middles we're going to get recycled

448
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:57,663
Took no Bronson aluminum that basically leaves you with rock

449
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,455
Androx can Road

450
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:01,503
And who knows the chine monolith

451
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,831
Could be useful to some future desert person

452
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:05,599
You could get on

453
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:07,647
Tip it over on its side and then you have

454
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:08,671
Foundation

455
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,951
For your house

456
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:16,095
Here's the critical moment where all the obvious choices have been exhausted

457
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,119
Language

458
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,143
Symbols

459
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,167
In storyboards

460
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,447
Weren't going to cut it

461
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:23,519
And here's my plan for the website start getting

462
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,055
Really wacky

463
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:27,103
There was this one guy in Marines group

464
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:30,175
Name micro

465
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,199
Architect

466
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,223
And an artist

467
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,247
Realist

468
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,271
Send passed away

469
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,807
But Marie remembers

470
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:36,575
Intergroup

471
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,367
Girl have this revelation

472
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:42,207
You don't actually need to transmit information into the future

473
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:44,767
All you need to do is make somebody

474
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:47,327
Scared of being in that place

475
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,119
He was

476
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,423
Trying to

477
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,703
Don't

478
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:59,103
The landscape such that it in itself gave away

479
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:05,503
Morning to people who are coming there he was thinking on a massive scale

480
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:11,903
Scale greater than I'd ever imagined like one drawing which might called the

481
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:18,303
The landscape of thorns the drawing of needles sharp pointed

482
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:24,703
Angular up from the ground the Earth itself became

483
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:28,799
The land itself hominids and impossible but

484
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:30,847
The last thing you want to do is

485
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,127
Draw people to

486
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,919
To see this incredible work of art

487
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,967
You gotta see this thing it's all

488
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,503
A half-mile of these

489
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,527
Giant Spike

490
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,551
What the hell is it so

491
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,111
It's already built a hotel for them

492
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,391
Stay in and they decide

493
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:46,463
How to dig a well for water and there you are you just cause exact

494
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:47,999
How to avoid

495
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:54,655
When all was said and done both groups submitted their proposals but Sandia Labs found most of the ideas a little too pie-in-the-sky

496
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:59,775
Gears Rodger Nelson the chief scientist at the department of energy Carlsbad field office

497
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,823
Which owns and operates whip

498
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:08,223
If we build any markers that need to be constructed at a reasonable cost because it's just not right to

499
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,247
Ask

500
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:12,575
Real current generations of real people today

501
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:16,672
Comcast to sacrifice through their tax dollars or whatever

502
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:23,328
To invest in protecting a hypothetical Intruder into some very far future from a risk

503
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:25,120
So which there's likely no

504
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,912
Palm Coast

505
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:34,592
In fact the panel that met to figure out the whip marker system was actually not the first instance of thinkers being brats

506
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:38,688
Together to consider how to communicate the dangers of nuclear waste over time

507
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:42,528
There was one such meeting in 1981 for the Yucca Mountain project

508
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,808
Which was eventually scrapped

509
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,112
Mountainproject had

510
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:50,720
Probably the craziest idea proposed an even though it was never suggested for whip

511
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,024
It's become the 99 pi

512
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,048
In house

513
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:59,936
Favorite method of communicating with people 10,000 years in the future by probably reason why we're doing the story at all

514
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:00,960
Call it

515
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:02,752
The Ray cat solution

516
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,544
My hands-down favorite approach

517
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,848
Came from these two European philosophers

518
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,384
Francois bastide

519
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,408
Palo Verde

520
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:10,688
It goes like this

521
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:14,528
The two of them got thinking that the most durable thing that Humanity has

522
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,296
Ever made

523
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:16,320
Is culture

524
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,880
Religion folklore belief system

525
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,672
Sure they morph over time but

526
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:23,232
Essential message can get pulled through

527
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,560
And so it's speed in free said you were going to do

528
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,608
We're going to genetically engineer

529
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:29,632
Species of cat

530
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:31,424
It changes color

531
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,704
In the presence of radiation

532
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:35,776
Then release them out into the wild

533
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,056
Become

534
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,080
Feline Geiger

535
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:40,384
Let's just step number one

536
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,664
September 2

537
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:45,248
We will create an entire system of folklore about these cat

538
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:49,856
So we will sing songs about them we will drop pictures of them we will tell stories

539
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:50,624
About them

540
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,672
And like any good story there's more

541
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,232
That when you see the cats turn color

542
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,256
Run

543
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,280
Bar

544
00:22:57,536 --> 00:23:03,680
Far away

545
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:10,080
Radiation

546
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,720
What's the Stray Cat folklore

547
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:27,744
Competitive

548
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,768
Into our culture

549
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,048
The knowledge it contains

550
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:32,352
Can evolve with us even if their language

551
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:35,168
10000 years from now these songs

552
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:37,472
Cindy stories may sound in comprehensible

553
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,264
But as long as they communicate

554
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,288
This idea

555
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,568
But it's not safe

556
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,336
Beware the cats

557
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,360
Colors

558
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,408
We will have done our job

559
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:46,944
Met the right cats

560
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:47,968
Keep us safe

561
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:50,016
The plan that Sandia labs

562
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,552
Decided to move forward with

563
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:53,344
Does not involve breakouts

564
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,112
Sadly

565
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,904
Or a landscape of thorns

566
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,464
It doesn't even involve the skull and crossbones

567
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,792
Conceptual design includes a big berm

568
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:03,840
30 feet high

569
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,120
Construction

570
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:11,776
Round the supremely repository that's Rodger Nelson again the chief scientist overseen whip at the end of the day

571
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:16,384
The powers-that-be decided to go with solutions to the Pamela said pretty much cast aside

572
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,992
They're marking the area with large Granite monuments large Granite Monument

573
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:23,296
Chili's Corner in the Meadowlands

574
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,576
Buried

575
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:30,976
Libraries they will be information in seven languages the six languages of the UN Arabic Chinese ink

576
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,512
English French Russian Spanish

577
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:34,048
And also Navajo

578
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,584
Because it's the

579
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,120
Most prevalent

580
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,144
Indigenous

581
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,936
Language of the area

582
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,520
The plan is still being finalized but keep in mind

583
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:49,408
We're talking about protecting people that are great great great great great great great great great great grandkids

584
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,944
Will never know

585
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:54,784
We have a duty to warn them we have a responsibility

586
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,064
Cinemark

587
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:56,832
Area

588
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:58,624
After a certain point

589
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,416
Yeah I started wondering like

590
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,976
A bit ridiculous

591
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,536
What was researching the story

592
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:07,328
I read about this town called Taliban

593
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,888
Small family African American

594
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,680
About our

595
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:12,960
I want to have south of Tampa

596
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:13,728
Florida

597
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:14,752
The

598
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,032
The brilliant process

599
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,568
Was set up in the middle of

600
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:20,896
Plant manufactured components for nuclear bomb

601
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,432
And also Bill pieces

602
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,200
Is the Hubble Space

603
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,064
Anyway it turned out that this plant was never very good about dealing with it

604
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:31,648
Beryllium dust and other toxins made their way

605
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:33,184
Into the town's groundwater

606
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,720
Alabaster

607
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:37,024
Always got that water from the shallow well

608
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:39,584
Resident started noticing that a lot

609
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,864
People were he diagnosed

610
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:41,888
Cancer

611
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,424
And other diseases

612
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,704
Including berylliosis

613
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:45,984
Which you get from

614
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,520
Exposure to beryllium

615
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:51,104
Tell dust filed a lawsuit against the company that owns

616
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:52,896
Lockheed Martin

617
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,176
And lucky Spencer

618
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:54,944
Years

619
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,224
Dragging out the lawsuit

620
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:58,528
The reason I bring this up

621
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:00,832
It's because Lockheed Martin happens to be the

622
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,880
Parent company of Sandia National Lab

623
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:06,208
The corporation that runs the website over in New Mexico

624
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:08,000
And this piece of Taliban

625
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,536
Is hardly unique

626
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:12,864
There are literally thousands of towns across United

627
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:13,888
Many of them

628
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,680
Low income or communities

629
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:17,984
Color that have become contaminated

630
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,008
It in similar ways

631
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:25,664
And so the 10000 year with marker system

632
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:27,712
But maybe a little misguided

633
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:31,808
I am all for taking care of people 10000 years in the future

634
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:34,112
Play the best way to do that

635
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:37,184
Is to start taking care of people that are alive

636
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:37,952
Today

637
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:41,536
That way there might be humans in 10000 years

638
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:43,072
And cats

639
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:50,240
Keep your color

640
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,456
Keep their color

641
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:16,352

Of arcsin an Architecture Firm in beautiful Downtown Oakland California

653
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:07,296
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices

654
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:10,880
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

655
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:16,512
If I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexis

656
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:22,400
Is talking to me and my wife is in another room and a kid is another remembrall hearing that voice

657
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:24,192
Technology talk to us

658
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:26,496
It is a creation of Sonic trash

659
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:29,312
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:32,896

661
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:34,944
To make them more human

662
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:39,040
Turn the living room lights on

663
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:40,576
Okay

664
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,624
Dim the living room lights to 50

665
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,392
80%

666
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,184
Okay

667
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:51,584
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

668
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,400
Makes for a much more natural experience

669
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:56,448
Turn the living room lights on

670
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:00,032

681
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:37,408

Before we go I want to tell you about the body genius

726
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:23,552
Five-part series from Bello radiotopia show the truth

727
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:26,112
The body genius is a Dark comic mystery

728
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,648
That whines through a

729
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,440
Treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

730
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:30,976

00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,512
Might cost you your life

You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

733
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:42,240
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

734
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:46,592
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like a dad

735
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:50,944
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

736
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,248
Actually if I'm being honest

737
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,296
I'm one of the main guy to know how to do that

A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

739
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:06,304
Was found dead in my private gym

740
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,632
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

741
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:13,984
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

742
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,008
Now

743
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:17,312
I need to clear my name

744
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:23,456
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes to find them
