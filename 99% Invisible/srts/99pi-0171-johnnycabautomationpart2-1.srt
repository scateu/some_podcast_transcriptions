This is 99% invisible

29
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:08,864
I'm Roman Mars

30
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:15,008
In 1956 General Motors hosted a car Expo called Motorama

31
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,056
As with all car Expo

32
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:23,456
Motorama with a chance to show off concept cars and other kinds of Longshot projects that they hope would revolutionize

33
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:24,480
The Auto industry

34
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:28,576
One of the most forward-looking things on display was in a car

35
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:29,344
The movie

36
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,160
That's forward-looking producer Sam Greenspan

37
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,464
The film was called e to the Future

38
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:41,120
In it we see a family of four cruising along a desert highway in a beautiful futuristic GM Firebird

39
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:47,776
It's got aerodynamic fins gas turbine engines and All Glass passenger cabin it looks like a car

40
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:50,336
The Jetsons only it's not flying its driving

41
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,104
On a highway

42
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:53,920
But his car is actually just the set dress

43
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,712
What GM really want

44
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,480
Show us

45
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,040
Their vision for a self-driving

46
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,344
Firebird tattoo

47
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,392
04

48
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,184
We're heading for Chicago

49
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,464
Please route us through

50
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,232
Over

51
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,512
Rodger Firebird

52
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,304
You're now under automatic

53
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:11,840
Hands off

54
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:16,448
After being put on automatic control the dad who's driving the car

55
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,984
Pushes the steering wheel

56
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,264
Out of the way

57
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,080
Faith School

58
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:22,848
Comfortable

59
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,384
Mind if I smoke a cigar

60
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:27,712
No longer Tethered to the steering wheel

61
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:30,528
Dad uses both hands to light his cigar

62
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,320
The car zooms along

63
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:38,976
For nearly as long as there's been an auto industry there have been dreams of a car that drives on its own

64
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:45,632
The car where people can enjoy all the freedom that cars offer but without the annoyances or the dangerous I'm driving

65
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:51,520
I can't speak to What specifically inspired GM to dream up that self-driving car we

66
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,800
Seeing this film

67
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:55,872
But it's very possible that it had to do with safety

68
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,176
The film is only 9 minutes long

69
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,224
But I can't stop commenting on her

70
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,248
Oh darn safe

71
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,528
It's automatic driving

72
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,808
Safe

73
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:04,576
Easy way to make

74
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,672
Peter this film was shown at Motorama 1956

75
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,976
That you're alone there are nearly

76
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:11,744
38

77
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,536
1000 vehicle related deaths

78
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:14,816
In the United States

79
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,120
Ever since the 1950s

80
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,168
There has never been a year with

81
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:23,008
Fewer than 30000 people killed in car

82
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:30,432
Vehicle related accidents are the number one cause of death in the United States for people between the ages of

83
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,712
5 + 34

84
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:32,992
And

85
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:35,552
More than 90% of all automobile

86
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,856
Students are attributable to one thing

87
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,136
Human error

88
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,184
So for some industry people

89
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,720
A fully automated car

90
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,000
Is a kind of Holy Grail

91
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:48,352
The thing about automation though is that as it solves problems

92
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,376
It inevitably

93
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,400
Create new one

94
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:56,544
As automation makes our lives easier and safer

95
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:01,408
It also creates more complex systems and fewer humans who understand those

96
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:02,688
Which means

97
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,224
What problems do arise

98
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,528
People can be left ill equipped to deal with

99
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,832
Human factors engineer is called as

100
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,368
The automation parody

101
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:17,536
Last week in our story about Automation in aviation we heard about various ways people are trying to deal with the

102
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,071
Paradox in that industry

103
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:24,703
One Pilots are being encouraged to practice manually find their plane to keep their skills polished

104
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:30,079
And Engineers are also trying to make smarter more collaborative automation that doesn't strip

105
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:33,919
Skills from Pilot but instead works with them to complete tasks

106
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:38,527
The position I would have dropped is one that has been termed a human centered automation

107
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:41,599
Where we see what you need to do in Disney animation

108
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,623
The team player

109
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:46,463
That's an alien starter a human factors engineer who believes

110
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:52,095
Human Pilots still have a crucial role to play in flight

111
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,887
Let's just get rid of the human

112
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,679
And it's fully automated vehicle

113
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,751
You know I I do feel

114
00:04:59,007 --> 00:04:59,775
Comforted by the fact that

115
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:00,543
Is a pilot up there

116
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:01,567
And that

117
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,335
Is Chris

118
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:05,919
I'm Christmas and I lead the self-driving car project here Google

119
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:08,735
Chris may be glad there are pilots and planes

120
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:11,295
But he's got a very different vision for cars

121
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:14,623
He believes the way to solve the automation Paradox for cars

122
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,927
Is to take humans out of the operation

123
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:17,695
Entirely

124
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:20,255
If you have a steering wheel there there's kind of a name

125
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,023
Explicit

126
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,815
Expectation

127
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,863
That you're going to do something with it

128
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:28,703
We're needing starter thinks that allowing for human intervention is best

129
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,263
Yes you still think me to driver who is

130
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:35,871
In the vehicle and who has the opportunity at least to intervene when necessary

131
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,943
Chris is to make a car that is safe

132
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,735
Because no human is driving

133
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,271
You get to sidestep

134
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:46,367
All of these kind of control confusion confidential challenges

135
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,159
By taking that out of the way

136
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:51,743
You get to to remove a part of the system that you can't

137
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:52,767
Designed

138
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,559
No human drivers

139
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,839
Just human path

140
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:59,935
We are about to enter Uncharted Territory

141
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:09,407
Automation has been appearing in cars almost since they hit the market anti-lock brakes automatic transmission powers

142
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,455
Steering cruise control DPS

143
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:13,759
Cars that can parallel park themselves

144
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:16,319
The fully autonomous self-driving car

145
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,855
It's been a long time coming

146
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:21,439
There's been a few players developing self-driving car technology

147
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,231
The most visible among them

148
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:23,999
Being Google

149
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,535
In 2009

150
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:29,631
Google began retrofitting Toyota and Lexus cars with new technologies

151
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,935
Allowing the car to drive on its own

152
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:39,103
The cars can accelerate stop at traffic signals make turns merge onto freeways and avoid pedestrians cyclists another

153
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:43,455
All with little or no intervention from anyone inside the car

154
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,991
And then in 2014

155
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,527
Google started Manufacturing

156
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,551
Their own

157
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,343
Cute little two-seaters

158
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,135
With no Gas Pedal brake or

159
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:51,903
Steering wheel

160
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:55,999
They're designed for the user to input a destination and just sit back and laugh

161
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,023
Car do every

162
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:04,703
Google has videos that show blind people and children sitting in what we normally think of as the driver seat

163
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,983
As the car scoots

164
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,263
Around a test track

165
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,799
Pulling Santa's sleigh

166
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,591
You shouldn't have to have any training

167
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:13,663
You should be able to get in them tell them where you want to go

168
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,735
Tell them you changed your mind do you want to go somewhere else and then get out

169
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,015
Google wouldn't show me the

170
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:19,551
But Chris

171
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,343
Did show them to Planet money's

172
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,111
Steve head

173
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,671
So I you want to open it up and show me the inside

174
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:30,047
So this is one of our early prototypes will actually start our 5th generation prototype

175
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:36,191
This vehicle is one of the ones that will start to be testing on the roads in Mountain View in the next over the summer

176
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:38,495
We talked to Steve about what it was like after

177
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:39,775
When you get inside

178
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,567
There's no dashboard there's no

179
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,359
Steering column so I'm about to

180
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:44,895
Tall and

181
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,431
The seat is all the way again

182
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,199
What's the back window

183
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:47,967
Of the car and I can

184
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:48,991
Take my legs

185
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,527
Straight out in front of me

186
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,063
Because there's nothing there

187
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:55,903
Well almost nothing what you can see in the center here so this is

188
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,975
The steering wheel brake and gas pedals and lessor for our test drivers

189
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:03,839
But their removable California law allows autonomous cars on the roadways but

190
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:04,863
Only if they

191
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,655
Can be driven by a human

192
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,959
But the design of this car is to have none of them

193
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:11,519
Right into their very very few

194
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,311
User controls in

195
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,079
Inside

196
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:17,151
There are buttons to lower the windows

197
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,687
There's a button

198
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,503
To pull over to the side of the road and stop

199
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,623
You know if you suddenly see a yard sale if you want to check out our friend do you want to pull over and talk to

200
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:31,487
But is also an emergency stop button a button that halts the car and its track

201
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:37,887
Skellige on an elevator you know how they say it the big red button while they're still you know I really need to get out now there's some

202
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:38,911
Something very wrong here

203
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:42,751
I've never press the red button elevator but it's kind of comforting notes there

204
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,287
The cars look kind of endearing

205
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:48,383
Goofy the small and round Steve versus them as bubble cars

206
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,431
Not that they would let him ride in one

207
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,711
Yeah so they didn't

208
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:55,295
Let me ride around in the bubble car and in fact the bubble car hadn't hit

209
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,063
The streets of man

210
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:58,623
But he was able to get inside one of their older mod

211
00:08:59,135 --> 00:08:59,903
With a retrofitted

212
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,671
Lexus SC

213
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,695
TV okay

214
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,487
Should I jump in the front or the back

215
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:07,071
You should yeah probably this back

216
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,119
Corner right here

217
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:12,191
I think the most remarkable thing for me

218
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:14,239
Was how quickly the

219
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,007
Experience

220
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:15,775
Became

221
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:21,663
Just kind of boring it came to a full and complete stop at the

222
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:28,063
Stop sign definitely soda car follows the law very closely

223
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:31,903
Passenger the car is driving with more or less indistinguishable from a human driver

224
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:37,023
Well a human driver that always follows the rules of the road we were driving

225
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,047
True residential

226
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,327
In Mountain View

227
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,655
Including through streets that were under

228
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:45,983
Construction so it was navigating

229
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,799
Streetscapes that were changing

230
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:51,359
You know lanes were blocked off Lanes

231
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,127
Foreclosed

232
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:56,223
And at one point on their drive a construction worker was directing traffic

233
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:59,295
And Steve was chatting with the other person in the car

234
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,319
We were both sort of

235
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,087
Distracted

236
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:07,487
And suddenly all on its own wow

237
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:13,119
Car slammed on the brakes it was startling

238
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,423
Steven the Google employees hadn't seen it

239
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:20,287
But the construction worker had flipped his handheld sign from slow to stop

240
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:22,847
The machine had noticed that handheld stops

241
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:23,871
When all of a sudden

242
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,407
That actually kind of

243
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,175
Scared

244
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,967
Because we didn't see it

245
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,783
Even the Google employees hadn't seen that before

246
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:34,367
The autonomous car was working better than they had expected

247
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,927
Maybe these things can react faster than

248
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:42,047
But sensors will fail navigation will get screwy onboard computers

249
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:42,815
Will break

250
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:46,911
Car owners barely know how to fix their own Vehicles as it is now so

251
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:52,031
Will people be able to fix the kinds of complicated problems that come with a self-driving car

252
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:54,079
Payday really depends on

253
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,383
How they end up being using a mark

254
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,151
Right

255
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:00,735
Chris imagines that if a self-driving car breaks while it's on the road

256
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,759
It'll pull over

257
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,807
Another car will come fetch the passengers

258
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,855
Leaving the broken one for technicians.

259
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,135
Which means

260
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:10,719
Google doesn't want to just change how we relate to our cars

261
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,279
Google wants to change how cars

262
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,815
Relate to society

263
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:17,119
If you look at the car that you own today

264
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,143
You know it's

265
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,495
South Park Somewhere 95% of the time and that's kind of poorly using

266
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:25,311
Now both your kind of financial resources that went into it

267
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:31,711
But also the environmental resources that the material and energy we put into making that vehicle so we can use that more efficiently by sharing at that sounds

268
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,479
Fantastic

269
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:33,759
Maybe

270
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,783
Eventually

271
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:38,111
Instead of owning these cars you would hail them from off the street

272
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,951
I'm going to get out the car would drive off and pick up someone else

273
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:48,351
In other words it's possible that these cars could enable a world in which no one owns a car and all of us just

274
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,399
Get Around by robot Taxi

275
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,167
Well

276
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,959
What's the great thing about predict

277
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:54,751
Always wrong

278
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,031
My name is

279
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:57,823
Professor

280
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,103
In a civil Environmental

281
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,151
Carnegie Mellon

282
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:07,039
Kostas Samaras has thought a lot about how self-driving cars will change society

283
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:12,415
He is the co-author of a report called autonomous vehicle technology a guide for policy

284
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:18,047
Jocasta like Chris urmson and pretty much everyone else I meant working on autonomous vehicles

285
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:22,399
He thinks that these things hold a lot of Promise so reducing crashes

286
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,935
The first wave that automation

287
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,215
Help Society

288
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,007
But that's really only the starting point

289
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,615
After all the vast majority of American cities are built around cars

290
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:35,967
And so transforming the car means transforming the city

291
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,503
Starting with parking lot

292
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,783
We can

293
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:45,183
Get rid of a lot of the parking garage space and put in housing or commercial development because if all or most cars are

294
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:45,951
Taxis

295
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:51,071
We don't need to clear out spaces and congested downtown's just so cars can have a place to sit idle

296
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:54,655
Get out of the robot taxi and it's off to give a ride to someone else

297
00:12:54,911 --> 00:13:00,799
Urban core downtown

298
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:05,663
All the things we learned in driver's ed staying a certain amount of seconds behind a speeding car

299
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:08,223
Those things will now be taking over

300
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,759
I'm by self-driving vehicle

301
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,807
They will make the

302
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,343
Determination of how far its

303
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,879
Be from the car in front of us

304
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,183
And 10 order for everybody to be safe

305
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,743
This would allow cars to get closer together

306
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,791
And not just bumper to bumper

307
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,071
Side to side

308
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:26,655
The Department of Transportation requires that Highway Lanes be at least

309
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,679
12 feet wide

310
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,727
That's about twice as wide as the average

311
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:33,311
Car so suddenly a 3-lane highway can accommodate 6 Lanes

312
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,591
Without any new

313
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:39,199
Less space between cars means more cars can get where they're going faster

314
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:43,295
But these cars could also we organize cities for the worse

315
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,575
Right now I have a cost

316
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:46,367
I'm driving and that cost is

317
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,647
Running my vehicle

318
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,439
And also the time that I'm in it

319
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:55,839
Anyone could read or sleep or write emails in a robot car people might feel just fine about living far

320
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:59,167
Or outside the city and commuting a long way in

321
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:03,775
And that type of scenario we would see lots more vehicle-miles-traveled lots more

322
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,823
Sprawl into the deep excerpts and into

323
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:10,943
And of course the inside of the car could become another place for advertising

324
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:13,247
Your route data could be for sale

325
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,039
Maybe it knows I hadn't had coffee

326
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:18,367
Because it's connected to my refrigerator and my coffee maker at home in

327
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:22,463
He hasn't had coffee yet let's make the slow route next to the coffee place

328
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:27,583
Or the route data could even become a matter of National Security

329
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,887
Take control of your car or

330
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:30,911
Fleet of cars

331
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:33,727
Stop every car that's on the Bay Bridge at one time

332
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:34,751
For malicious

333
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:35,519
Intent

334
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,383
Clearly there are still a lot of details to work out

335
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:44,991
But I wonder once the science is done and the policy is carefully considered

336
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,551
Will people even want these things

337
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:50,111
Is America ready to give up the steering wheel

338
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:54,463
I mean will people still go on road trips and tailgate in the stadium parking lot

339
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:59,071
Will you still be able to get in your car and go on a nameless contemplative Drive

340
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:02,911
I guess we hadn't really thought about that that's Chris urmson from Google

341
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:07,775
Assumption is he would give it a destination and say where you want to go but you'll always be able to change it

342
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,799
Right so

343
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,079
I don't do a whole lot of

344
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:14,687
Contemplative driving but when I do you know you start heading somewhere and then you like out maybe I'll go

345
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,455
Afterwards

346
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,479
But you know

347
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:19,807
Sometimes you're really just need to get in your car and go

348
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:26,207
Like say if you're getting chased by gun-toting corporate goons trying to stop you from eating Martian colonists Rebel

349
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,255
Arnold Schwarzenegger did

350
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,023
In Total Recall

351
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,047
Hello

352
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,583
I'm Johnny Cash

353
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,351
Where can I take

354
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,703
Would you please

355
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:48,223
At which point Arnold rips the robot driver out of the car

356
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,759
And Pilots it himself

357
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:53,855
It's funny because as Fantastical as the Sci-Fi world is

358
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,927
We can recognize the same kind of user annoyances

359
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,207
As we have here in the presence

360
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:03,071
And we can see Arnold as heroic because he can do the things the machines can

361
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:07,167
I think about Star Wars when Luke Skywalker is on his way to blow up the Death Star

362
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,983
The one his robot co-pilot that supplied

363
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:15,871
And he turns off his onboard automation

364
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:24,575
Because automation is not as good as what Luke can do on his own

365
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:25,599
Used

366
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:43,519
As much as we love building things that make our lives easier

367
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:47,615
It seems like we never get tired of seeing someone cast the robots of side

368
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:50,431
We love seeing people do things by

369
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,735
Anxiety about

370
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:55,807
If we lose the ability to do something ourselves

371
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,367
Are we losing a piece of ourselves

372
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,391
Or something

373
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:02,975
We are going to have to answer these existential questions

374
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:03,999
Battle cars

375
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,535
Kind of salmon

376
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:11,679
Chris urmson has said that his personal goal is to get the Google self-driving car done by 2020

377
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,703
What is Tucson

378
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,495
The oldest of whom is 11

379
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,775
Will never need

380
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,799
To get a driver's license

381
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:19,871
Definitely think that when is sunrise

382
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,895
Sakura 17

383
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,687
You would have to get a driver's license

384
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,247
Raj Rajkumar is friends with Chris

385
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:28,063
They used to work together at Carnegie Mellon University

386
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,855
Before Chris went over to Google

387
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:34,719
Raj is co-director of cmu's autonomous driving collaborative research lab

388
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:37,023
The university has been working on automatic

389
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:42,143
The Cars Since the 1980s about six months back we lived three celebrated

390
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,679
The 30th birthday

391
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,215
Actually working on

392
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:52,639
Raj is also the CEO of a company called automatica which has a prototype vehicle that is already driven itself

393
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,431
From San Francisco to New York

394
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:58,271
Mirage doesn't plan on taking the steering wheel out just yet

395
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:05,183
In fact his car actually monitors the person in the driver seat and beeps at him or her if the driver's eyes Wonder

396
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:11,583
From the road hey you guys on the road Rogers not in a rush to have us 100%

397
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,887
Dependent on his autonomous technology

398
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:17,983
The way he sees it unfolding is with incremental advances over time

399
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:23,103
Just like right now pretty much all cars have cruise control and some cars have adaptive cruise control

400
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:26,943
Calibrate speed the next generation of this technology against

401
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:29,759
Would be you do not have to control the steering wheel either

402
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,295
You get onto the highway

403
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,319
Pickling

404
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:34,879
And then engage this so super cruise control

405
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,927
An unlikely Str8 self

406
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,207
Brachycephalic

407
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:43,071
Also imagines and automatic mode for when you're stuck in a traffic jam

408
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:47,423
And in the number of scenarios dekhtyar automatable will increase over time

409
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,959
And one fine day

410
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:54,079
Reckless able to control itself completely but it lasted literally minor

411
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:57,151
Nicki Minaj stab and one would badly noticed at 8

412
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:07,903
Sowell Raj does see humans as having an important role to play as we transition toward fully automated vehicles

413
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,951
Is go like Chris urmson

414
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:13,791
Is to eventually get human drivers out of the process entirely

415
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:16,607
But even when that day finally comes

416
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:20,191
We don't need steering wheels and don't even notice that they're gone

417
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,727
There will still be active

418
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:24,031
Stelvio lease be submerged cases

419
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,055
Google

420
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,591
Beyond beyond anybody's control

421
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:30,175
This is going to be nightmare scenario for all of us researchers

422
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:33,503
If our somebody deploys something prematurely

423
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:36,063
And then it turns out that they didn't stop.

424
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:38,111
Hacking a child of God for bed

425
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:41,183
If and when people do get hurt in autonomous cars

426
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:47,327
There may be circumstances in which the passengers wouldn't have been injured have there been a human at the wheel

427
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:50,399
These cases will be hard to reckon with

428
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:55,519
But we'll have to keep in mind that there were 30000 Americans dying every year

429
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,799
Inhuman driven cars

430
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:00,127
If autonomous vehicles lead to fewer Car Act

431
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:01,407
Then

432
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,687
As with planes

433
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:09,087
We're going to need to accept edge cases and periodic failures is the cost of living in this safer world

434
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:09,855
But

435
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,391
I don't want to be an edge

436
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:17,279
Case I don't want to give up total control of something when being in control might save my life

437
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:20,351
And yet while I was reporting the story

438
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:23,167
I almost caused a terrible car accident

439
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:29,311
It was early the sun was in my eyes and I wasn't really paying attention as I made a left through a crosswalk

440
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,359
And I nearly struck a pedestrian

441
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:35,455
I got so close that the guy could have reached out and slammed his fist

442
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,735
Imma go to my car

443
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,015
Which he didn't do

444
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,807
So I wouldn't have blamed him if he had

445
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,343
Ennis terrifies me

446
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:44,415
I want automation to save me and everyone else

447
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,439
From myself

448
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:48,767
And I want automations protect me from everyone else

449
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,839
And so when the time finally comes

450
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,911
I will probably roll the dice on autonomous cars

451
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,959
I think we all will eventually

452
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:01,823
Maybe one day I will be in old man bouncing grandkids on my knees saying

453
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:04,127
You know when I was a young man

454
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,919
We drove cars ourselves

455
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,711
You move them around with foot pedals

456
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:08,991
And I think all the steering wheel

457
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:10,527
And they'll say

458
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,319
What sounds amazing

459
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:14,111
And I'll say

460
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:15,903
It was all right

461
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:27,680

That's Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

481

Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

482

483
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,832

Okay

488
00:22:55,744 --> 00:23:01,376
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

489
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:03,424
Makes for a much more natural

Actually if I'm being honest

534
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,888
I'm one of the main guy to know how to do that

535
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:14,240
A few days ago Wesley Stern

536
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:17,568
After that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

539
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,576
