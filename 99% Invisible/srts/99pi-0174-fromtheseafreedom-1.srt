I'm Roman Mars

29
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:37,792
In 1933 several Nation States including the US got together in Montevideo Uruguay to defy

30
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,840
Define what it means to be a state

31
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:43,168
The treaty that came up with include 16 articles

32
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:46,496
Each of which lays out different rights and duties of statehood

33
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:48,288
That's producer Julia DeWitt

34
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,104
But the most famous article is number one

35
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:54,176
Which set out the four basic criteria of Satan

36
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,224
Basically what it takes

37
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:56,992
Country

38
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,272
The state

39
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,808
Person of international law

40
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,600
Chip possess the following quality

41
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,648
Undefined

42
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,184
Permanent Poppy

43
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:05,952
Chelation

44
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:06,720
State government

45
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,000
Add capacity

46
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,280
Enter into relation

47
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,704
I think a good flag is crucial to but that's just me to flag the criteria for because

48
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:20,288
Seem to some people surprisingly simple

49
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,592
So simple that a lot of people thought

50
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:27,712
And sorry for a lot of people that just

51
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:32,320
Triggered I suppose an idea that that meant that they could just

52
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:34,624
Culverhouse an independent country

53
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,904
That's John Ryan

54
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,672
Disa

55
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,208
Countries that might even just be

56
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:38,976
Be somebody's

57
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:39,744
Backyard

58
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:43,840
It could be an area that climbing for one reason or another

59
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:44,864
To be

60
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,984
An independent country John Ryan is the co-author of the guidebook micronations

61
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,544
The Lonely Planet guide to homemade Nations

62
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:57,664
And yeah this is the same Lonely Planet that publishes Taurus guys to places like Mexico

63
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,432
Citgo in France

64
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:02,528
John says most of these micronations are just kind of for fun

65
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,600
They aren't expecting anyone to take them seriously

66
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:10,720
And they don't usually mean all four criteria laid out by the Montevideo convention

67
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,256
Places like

68
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,280
Molossia

69
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:16,096
Witches in Nevada 15

70
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:16,864
1 guys

71
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:19,424
House is such a lovely guy president

72
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,960
Kevin bow and

73
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,776
He runs this great little micronation

74
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,312
He gets about

75
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:27,872
In military regalia

76
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,152
Reflective sunglasses

77
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,944
He looks totally like that

78
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,504
In a Central American dictator from the

79
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,528
70's or 80's

80
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:38,368
Is currency is pegged to the price of Pillsbury cookie dough

81
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,672
So don't go up and down in value

82
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,696
Adidas

83
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:48,352
Few years ago malossi was present bow started the micro National Olympics were micronations compete

84
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:54,752
Against each other in events like Checkers and the boomerang throw

85
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,544
Crazy project

86
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,080
But then

87
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,616
There Are Places

88
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,640
Like Sealand

89
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,432
Probably.

90
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,200
The welds

91
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:05,248
Most interesting and

92
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,064
Fascinating micronation is Ceylon

93
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,600
MC LAN

94
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,648
Cannot be dismissed so easily

95
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,464
The state as a person of international law

96
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,232
Chip possessed

97
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,256
The following qualifications

98
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:17,791
A defined

99
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,423
If you search for the principality of Sealand on Google Maps

100
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:27,263
It comes up as a little red dot off the east coast of England

101
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,823
Zoom in for some photographs of the place

102
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,127
And you'll see a metal platform

103
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:34,687
Sitting atop two concrete pillars

104
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,479
A stilted structure

105
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,295
Surrounded on all sides

106
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,319
Weather NYC

107
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:43,391
The platform is about the size of a football field

108
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,415
So

109
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,719
Pretty small territory as countries go

110
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,559
So how did this platform in the sea you become a micronation

111
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:56,959
It all started with rock and roll

112
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:03,871
Full scale out that but I

113
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,783
In the 1960s the British government wasn't giving out enough licenses to accommodate all the music that the kids were

114
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,063
Suddenly demanding

115
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:16,671
So a bunch of DJ's decided to take matters into their own hands

116
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:23,583
They set up pirate radio stations on ships in on abandoned British forts in the North Sea to broadcast rock music

117
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,607
Back to England

118
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:31,263
This week from the Spencer Davis Group it's still keep on running keep on

119
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:45,855
Wushiland itself physically isn't open photos built in

120
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:48,415
1943

121
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:52,767
It was built in an old safe defend the United Kingdom against

122
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,047
Gemini across the world

123
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,863
Floating the River Thames at the London bombing London

124
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,911
That's Michael Bates

125
00:05:59,423 --> 00:05:59,935
Prince

126
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:00,959
Sealand

127
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:07,871
Back in 1967 Michael said Roy was one of the DJs trying to turn these old abandoned forts in the sea

128
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,919
Inter radio stations

129
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:15,551
But don't be fooled Roy wasn't just a rock and roll love and hippie he was a free-market capitalist

130
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:18,879
He is being interviewed about his Pirate Radio Ventures

131
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,351
Every song about the time

132
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:35,519
In any case Bates and the other DJs kept getting slapped with big fines when the British government

133
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,823
So Michaels adroit change course

134
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:42,687
Describe the idea of a pirate radio station and decided to go for something even

135
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,455
Bigger

136
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:47,039
The challenge

137
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:50,111
I was talking to his lawyer friend Monday

138
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:53,183
My father system

139
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:56,511
Roy Bates wanted to start his own country

140
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:01,375
And learn with his principal no you can't do that

141
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,679
My father went ahead and did it

142
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:09,311
Roy's at the Fort was uniquely suited for Independence because of its location

143
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,871
Is 6 miles off the coast of England

144
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:16,735
I'm at the time England territorial Waters only reach 2 3 miles offshore

145
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:22,879
3 miles because that is how far a cannonball can fly and break through a foot of Oak

146
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,927
So it's sort of a date at law

147
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,231
It's been since change to 12 miles

148
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,255
Yeah we got

149
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,535
Better cannons now

150
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,095
But back then with the three mile rule

151
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,375
Consider the fort

152
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:37,471
Which again was just a platform perched onto concrete hours out in the ocean

153
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:40,287
Reconsider this claimable territory

154
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,847
Hidden by the platform cuneiform missions

155
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:45,407
Just gathered up his family and move them there

156
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:48,223
The government might call is squatting

157
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,759
The Bates family

158
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,039
With nation building

159
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:55,903
And sew on a Blustery Day in 1967 a nation was built

160
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:58,207
Sealand has a national anthem

161
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:11,263
And they have a flag it's actually a pretty good flag it follows all the principles of good design it simple as 3 color

162
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,543
Where is red white and black

163
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,079
Were the ratings for Roy

164
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:17,151
The Black History station part radio

165
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:19,455
On the white line down the middle of it is

166
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,223
The pasta

167
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:20,991
Purity

168
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,527
But he travels today

169
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,343
I think he was slightly tongue-in-cheek on that

170
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,647
The country's motto is

171
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,927
From the sea

172
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:29,951
Freedom

173
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:32,767
The state of the

174
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,303
International law

175
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,095
I possess the following qualities

176
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,143
Define parity

177
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,935
Permanent population

178
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:45,055
The population of Sealand consisted for many years of four people

179
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,079
Roy Bates

180
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:46,847
Founder

181
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,383
What's his wife Joan

182
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,919
His daughter Penelope

183
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,455
And his son Michael

184
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:53,759
My name is Saint Michael Prince

185
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,551
And his daughter princess

186
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:59,647
He didn't call himself King now

187
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,719
Before Michael was a prince

188
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,255
He was just a kid from England

189
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:08,863
He was 14 and importing school when his dad move them all out to sea land

190
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:14,239
I envisage six months like a bit of an Adventure Pass

191
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:16,799
That would be the end

192
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:19,871
Michael and his dad ended up living on sea land

193
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,151
For about 25 years

194
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:26,271
For the most part it was just Michael and his dad mom and sister out on the platform

195
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,807
About the house

196
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:32,415
Set up water Gathering system and filled some of the rooms in the towers with canned food

197
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:35,231
Nowadays the rooms are fully furnished

198
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,279
There's a non-denominational Chapel

199
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,863
Generators for power there's even a gym where you can work out

200
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:44,447
But back when they first started the place was pretty bare-bones

201
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:49,055
Sometimes when the weather got bad and their resupply boat didn't show up

202
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,847
They get a little hungry

203
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:53,407
On those days they would eat fish that they caught

204
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,199
And biscuits from a box

205
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:59,551
When Michael would get sick of being on a metal platform out in the middle of the ocean

206
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:02,367
Cute hitch a ride on a boat back to the mainland

207
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,647
Divine Kids Zone age

208
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,183
When I came back up here

209
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,999
Retinol night club or something like that have a good time

210
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:11,839
The same as do when they want to hit Pole.

211
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:16,703
And sometimes he would even bring friends back to Sealand

212
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,007
Nicest muggle women out there

213
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:26,687
Translate Illuminati

214
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:29,759
The state of a

215
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,295
International law

216
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,087
Possess the following koala

217
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,135
Define Doterra

218
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,671
Eminent popular

219
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,463
Government

220
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:42,815
Sealand of various government posts apart from the monarchy

221
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:45,887
Where is their Minister of Foreign Affairs

222
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:50,239
And the caretaker that stays up there when there is head of Homeland Security

223
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,287
He's the one that issues visas

224
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,079
And stamps your passport if you visit

225
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:58,431
Their legal code is pretty simple they basically have all the same laws as England

226
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,991
Install the same laws

227
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:03,807
Unlike England seal and allows guns

228
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,599
Prince Michael loves gun

229
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,159
But I never really had to use them

230
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:09,951
Except once

231
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:17,375
There are a lot of ways to make money on seal and which meant the family was always trying to come up with money making scheme

232
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:20,447
And sometimes a scheme that got a little weird

233
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,775
In 1978 Merle Michaels.

234
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:27,359
Started talking to some businessmen from Germany Austria and Belgium

235
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:32,223
They wanted to build a Leisure Island around sea land and put a casino on it

236
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:35,551
I'm one day Roy and his wife went to Austria

237
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,855
Talk with some funders about this deal

238
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:41,951
That conceal and Michael who is 25 the time

239
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:45,023
Was figuratively holding down the literal for

240
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,631
When a helicopter showed up in a group of men lowered themselves to the platform

241
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:55,519
First Montana recognize

242
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:59,359
One of them was tired of stealing government its Minister of Foreign Affairs

243
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:02,175
A guy by the name of Alexander awesome box

244
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:07,295
But according to Michael auchenbach was trying to shut Michael's family out of the casino deal

245
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,599
He was allegedly staging a coup

246
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:12,415
And so he says to Michael

247
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,463
Find C land over to me

248
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,231
It's mine

249
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,535
Am I going to head it feels like

250
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,303
No way

251
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:26,239
Apache helicopter

252
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,519
Drinks and as he's doing this

253
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:31,615
Michael says auchenbach and his goons slammed the front door and barricaded

254
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,663
Tribbing Michael in his own home

255
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,247
Close lights out

256
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:41,855
After four long days Michael captors put him on a boat to Holland

257
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:44,927
Exiled in Holland Michael gets in touch with his dad

258
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:48,511
To confirm that of course he hadn't signed Zealand over the awesome box

259
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,583
They made a plan to take their country back

260
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:55,167
The call of a friend who has a helicopter company

261
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,959
Explain the situation

262
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:59,007
Is it okay I'll take you out

263
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:04,895
Before they take off they remove the doors from the helicopter and tie ropes to the runner so that when they get to Sealand

264
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,711
They can slide down the ropes Navy SEAL Style

265
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,247
And still on the platform

266
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,551
They take off in the middle of the night

267
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:15,647
Play flying out of the note C with no doors in this helicopter

268
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,671
In the dark

269
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,743
They slid down the Rope onto the platform of Sealand

270
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:26,143
Loosely down ropes in The Hobbit the first one down the building

271
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,751
Shouting in German and running around Michael climbed up onto the roof of the building

272
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:33,823
With a shotgun

273
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,687
In case you didn't catch that he said he had a sawed-off

274
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,455
Shotgun

275
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:43,039
And then I jumped off the roof is that true or false

276
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:48,415
He jumped off the roof and according to Michael the gun accidentally went off

277
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,463
Boom it went off

278
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,999
Every times what happened here

279
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:55,839
That one shot was enough to scare the Invaders into surrendering

280
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:58,911
Roy and Michael let all the non-citizens a seal and go

281
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:02,239
But the Minister of Foreign Affairs Alexander Rockenbach

282
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,263
Did not get off

283
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,031
So easily

284
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,591
Achenbach had betrayed the crown

285
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:09,407
They charged him with treason and brought him to trial

286
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:14,527
My father was presiding judge

287
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:20,671
They held Offenbach prisoner until the German ambassador actually came out to sea land

288
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,207
Negotiate press release

289
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:24,255
Eventually they let him go

290
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,303
Was that all hostilities

291
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,071
Brandon

292
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:32,191
When the German government sent their Ambassador out to negotiate the release of one of their citizens

293
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:32,959
This

294
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:33,983
Says Michael

295
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:37,055
Has been entering into formal relations with Sealand

296
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:40,127
Which fulfills the fourth and final Criterion

297
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,407
For being a state

298
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:43,711
State of the

299
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,247
International law

300
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,039
I possess the following qualities

301
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:50,879
Population

302
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,415
State government

303
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,047
The tickle of the box

304
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,095
This very little

305
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,887
That you can say

306
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,191
Swiping from

307
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:06,495
Legitimacy really

308
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,543
We decided not to come

309
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,151
Who wrote The Lonely Planet guide to micronations

310
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:18,527
Well he might concede that seal and fulfills the criteria for being a real estate

311
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,807
Most experts

312
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,575
Do not

313
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,879
Oh definitely no it's not

314
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,439
That is your a vidmar

315
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:29,279
Your aunt is a fellow at Oxford and an expert in international law

316
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:31,583
He thought a lot about what makes a statement

317
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,887
Sealand is Justin

318
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:40,287
Abandoned platform it is not really a viable place to live and buy

319
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,591
Explaining that incident us

320
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,895
Relations with another state

321
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:45,663
I mean

322
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,199
They're trying to fit

323
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:53,599
Their case was in the convention but I mean it's the joke that was that was taken actually quite

324
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:57,439
But far doesn't mean that the Monday vidao convention is worthless

325
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,231
It's just not complete

326
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,791
What really matter is Siri says

327
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,815
Is recognition

328
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,119
The end of the day

329
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,655
It is political

330
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:07,679
If

331
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:08,959
Say

332
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:12,799
Country Tonite Estates of this world recognized

333
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,359
Sealant is being an independent state

334
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:18,943
I think there would be no doubt that it was Independence Day

335
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,247
But this would of course never happen

336
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:28,927
There are a lot of places that meet the Montevideo criteria that rightly or wrongly the US does not consider naysh

337
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:29,695
Patience

338
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,231
Palestine for example

339
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:35,071
Is recognized by 135 other countries

340
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,863
But not bother you ask

341
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,655
And then there's Taiwan

342
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:41,215
Tywanna meet all the criteria

343
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,775
It has a permanent population a government

344
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:48,895
Define territory and they're able to enter in the diplomatic relations with other countries

345
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:52,479
Taiwan is currently recognized by 22 countries

346
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:55,807
Mostly small countries like tuvalu and Burkina Faso

347
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:59,903
The China still considers Taiwan to be a Chinese province

348
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:05,023
And because we don't want to piss off China we also don't recognize Taiwan

349
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:05,791
Estate

350
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:10,143
Although the US government does send ambassadors to Taiwan

351
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:16,543
We just technically make the ambassadors resign when we send them and then we reinstate them when they're transferred

352
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,311
To another post

353
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:20,895
So if China says anything about it we can be like ambassador

354
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:21,919
What am I asking

355
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:24,479
So many state has more a matter of degrees

356
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:28,831
Some states are recognized by 120 legitimate countries

357
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:32,415
Or the others are only recognized by 5 or 10 country

358
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:37,279
As of this moment no one formally recognizes Sealand

359
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,303
As a state

360
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:41,375
Not even tuvalu or Burkina Faso

361
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:46,239
As for the population of Sealand

362
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,799
As Roy Bates the founder got older

363
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:51,103
He found it easier to live on the mainland

364
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:54,175
He died in Essex in England in 2012

365
00:17:54,687 --> 00:18:00,831
Can't blame her didn't like life out on the platform so he moves to Mainland England

366
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:01,599
