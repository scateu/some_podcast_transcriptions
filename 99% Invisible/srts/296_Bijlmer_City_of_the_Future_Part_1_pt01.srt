I'm Roman Mars

31
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:31,392
In 1933

32
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:35,232
A group of Architects boarded a ship called the SS Patrice 2

33
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:38,816
Set sail from Marseille France toward Athens Greece

34
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:41,632
On board were several of the world's most famous

35
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:43,424
Modernist Architects and artists

36
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,704

Alvar aalto in dozens of others representing more than 15 countries

39
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:56,736
There was a silent film made the voyage that shows grainy shots of The Architects on deck of the ship

40
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,296
In short sleeve white shirts and sunglasses

41
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:03,392
Cigarettes in their mouths their hair blowing gently in the breeze

42
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,928
Listen to lectures

43
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,232
One of the Architects wrote in his journal

44
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,768
We eat and drink copious

45
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,304
Demerol half naked

46
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:14,400
The Architects were on the ship for the international Congress of Modern Art

47
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:17,472
Commonly known by its French acronym

48
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,240
Cm

49
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,776
Bet senior producer Katie Mingle

50
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,568
And I'm going to hand the story over to her now

51
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,128
So yeah The Architects were on this

52
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:24,896
Boat Trip

53
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,432
Oracia meat

54
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:31,296
More specifically they were there to talk about how to plan a better City

55
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:35,136
The members of CM thought that cities were too congested

56
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:38,208
Too noisy in polluted and chaotic

57
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,792
And they thought that some of these problems could be solved by separating out the

58
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:42,560
The functions of

59
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:44,608
The city into distinct zones

60
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:51,520
So as separate everything everything housing working Recreation

61
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,288
The traffic

62
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:58,944
Separate all the kinds of traffic so pedestrians the cyclists cars

63
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,224
The trains

64
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:03,296
It would mean the end of congestion

65
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:05,600
That's deaf

66
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,184
Planner

67
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,584
Hey must been a bunch of years working for the city of Amsterdam as the head of the urban planning department and now he's

68
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,120
Teaches at the University events

69
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:20,192
I love cities

70
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,496
The idea of separation of

71
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,288
Functions wasn't brand new

72
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,640
Bahama says The Architects from CM wanted to take it really far

73
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:31,456
The Living Spaces would be in high-rise apartment

74
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,272
So that the ground level was open for recreation

75
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:35,552
Collective spaces

76
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,368
Live in the sky play on the ground

77
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,392
In fact

78
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:44,512
Cars with drive on elevated roads so that pedestrians could have the ground all to themselves

79
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,608
There would also be separate zones for industry and shopping

80
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:52,704
We're old European cities for winding cluttered and polluted

81
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,240
These new cities

82
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,544
It would be linear open and clean

83
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,824
Everything in it

84
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,592
Proper place

85
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,152
It should be kind of smooth

86
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,016
Lies machine where you're very comfortable

87
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,392
Modernist also saw this new kind of city as more egalitarian

88
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,184
They wanted to get rid of slums

89
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,256
Create beautiful housing that everyone could afford

90
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,791
It was a beautiful image

91
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:18,815
I knew it

92
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,375
I knew alternative for living in cities

93
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:27,775
That's the American city planner Oscar Newman in a BBC documentary called the writing on the wall

94
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,055
What's a people

95
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,335
Give him a few

96
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,895
If you happen to be the other buildings but

97
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,175
Get them of you

98
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:37,503
Give him space down below free the bra

99
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,527
Socrative

100
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,831
But in the 1930s

101
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:41,855
That's all it was

102
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,135
A great image

103
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,951
Because the world was in an economic depression

104
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:49,279
There was not much to do in the 1930s

105
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:53,375
Because it was the crisis there was no no building anymore

106
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,935
I never got the second World War

107
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:58,495
It sounds cynical but

108
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,519
In effect

109
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:06,175
They were rather lucky that so many cities were destroyed in the Second World War

110
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:10,271
Sounds documents that they day almost celebrated

111
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,831
Destruction

112
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:17,695
So that was a lot of work to do in 1945

113
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,767
And they were really excited

114
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,863
But it wasn't just that the Architects had a lot of work

115
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,935
It was an opportunity to start over

116
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:30,239
To build cities the right way

117
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,775
From the ground up

118
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:38,175
And that was all that was their idea from the start

119
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:41,503
So dear everything down

120
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:44,063
Let's start again

121
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:48,671
The CM architect cease to this opportunity

122
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:53,535
The famous Swiss architect and CM member liquor Boosie a published a book

123
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,303
Called

124
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,095
Leila shot Dothan

125
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,119
English

126
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,399
The Athens Charter

127
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:02,239
The book outlined exactly how to build new cities in the way vrchat

128
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,031
MCM had talked about

129
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:06,847
On the boat and became a best-seller

130
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:10,431
Le corbusier traveled the world talking about these modern ideas for

131
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,199
City building

132
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,503
And governments liked what they saw

133
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,039
Mostly because of the price

134
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,599
CM proposed

135
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:20,927
Affect very cheap building

136
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:25,279
Concrete the modernist Building Material of choice with inexpensive

137
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,607
I'm building identical apartments in high-rises was

138
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:32,447
Cheaper and required less land than building stand-alone home

139
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,775
Ross what all the

140
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:39,615
The government's need it after the second world war because

141
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:42,175
Oh you are + poor

142
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,967
And so after World War II

143
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,759
In cities all over Europe

144
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:50,879
Buildings and housing developments were rebuilt with CM principles in mind

145
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,671
Almost everything

146
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,463
Are in Europe

147
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:57,023
Almost everything

148
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:01,119
We built a lot of modernist style apartment buildings

149
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,143
Here in the US

150
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:02,911
2

151
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,447
Northeast building project

152
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:06,751
Post-war Europe in the United States

153
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,823
Weren't usually pure encapsulations of

154
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,127
CNN Le corbusier plan

155
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,455
Most places took some ideas and left others

156
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:20,063
But the city planners of Amsterdam in the Netherlands wanted to go further

157
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,111
They wanted to build a new area

158
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,647
Right outside of Amsterdam

159
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,951
It would be a CM blueprint

160
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:29,791
Perfect encapsulation of these modernist principles

161
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,583
They would call this place

162
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,863
The belmermere

163
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:37,215
Show from the center of Amsterdam I think you could

164
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,519
Take a bike and within a half

165
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,567
How are you are in the balamir

166
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:48,223
That's Touch Radio producer Chris Byam reported the story with me and like a proper Dutchman

167
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,295
He rode his bike out to do interviews many times

168
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,319
That's a bummer mirror

169
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,599
I always take my bike

170
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,903
So you'll hear him asking questions and

171
00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:00,511
Occasionally speaking in Dutch

172
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:03,583
The Builder Muir area covers about 6

173
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,375
Square kilometers or

174
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,167
2.3 square miles

175
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,471
I think you can walk around for a day

176
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,495
Is really big

177
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,799
Today the belmermeer is also in

178
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,335
Extremely diverse area

179
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:18,175
There's something like a hundred and fifty nationalities represented there

180
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:21,503
All your car goes in Ghana says on the

181
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:26,367
The area has changed a lot from the original design

182
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:29,439
And it's had a bunch of different chapters over the years

183
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:32,255
Including some really tragic one

184
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,815
So let's start at the beginning

185
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,887
First can you introduce yourself

186
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,215
My name is Peter brand I'm an architect

187
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,495
Amsterdam

188
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:49,151
And I've been alone for a while I've been educated in delft University

189
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:49,919
How much in debt

190
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,455
Functionalist

191
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,223
Modernist

192
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,247
Addition

193
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:54,783
That means

194
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,319
That is you know gif

195
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,599
Thick concrete

196
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:00,159
Blocks the that was our

197
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,183
Paradise

198
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:03,231
When he was a young man to Brown was hired

199
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,023
To help plan the belmermere

200
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:10,143
It would be a brand new area right outside of Amsterdam 400,000 middle-class resume

201
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:13,471
And it would technically be part of Amsterdam

202
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:18,335
But it would be built from scratch and designed to function almost as its own City

203
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,127
A city of the future

204
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,175
True to the tenants of modern

205
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,967
The Belmont

206
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:28,063
HDI ptosis of old modernist

207
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:34,463
Thinking it's a dream come true for you oh definitely yes I was not even 30 years old

208
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,487
Jordan 25

209
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:38,303
We are going to present the world

210
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,583
Who is the new

211
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,679
Far-reaching

212
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,727
I did

213
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:46,751
YouTube

214
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,311
I started to understand

215
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:52,895
This is going far on this is really

216
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,175
Unusual

217
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:58,527
It was like a fever everyday every moment

218
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,551
In.

219
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:00,575
Directions

220
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:03,647
The brown worked on a team with a bunch of other planners

221
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:07,487
And the head of the team was an architect named Siegfried Nassif

222
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:10,559
Yeah you a secret nothing was a lot of really idealistic

223
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:11,839
Personality

224
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,119
Believe that

225
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:17,215
How we built in the 19th to 18th centuries was good enough

226
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,495
Let's do it

227
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,567
All over again a new and bigger and NM better

228
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,103
This is Dan Decker

229
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,151
I'm a writer and I wrote a book about

230
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,175
That developer

231
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,455
The Bell Marissa

232
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:30,015
A shorter way of saying the belmermere

233
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,551
You hear people use it a lot

234
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:34,367
Anyway Dan says there was never any

235
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:36,415
Question that the Ballmer would be made up of

236
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,463
Tall concrete housing Towers

237
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:43,071
But the planners did choose to arrange them in a sort of unique shape

238
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:46,911
Which was shaved off of owning

239
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,191
How do you say yeah

240
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,263
Adwords

241
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,895
Honey,

242
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,455
If the buildings were laid out in the

243
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,991
Hexagonal grid of a honeycomb

244
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,271
It would allow each

245
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,063
Department to get a good amount of

246
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,343
Sun per day

247
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:08,159
The modernists were crazy about sunlight

248
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:11,999
That was a huge part of their Doctrine

249
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,559
Better than your predecessors

250
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:17,887
If you could bring more sun to all these dwellings

251
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:20,447
The apartments at the bilmar Were Meant For The Middle

252
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:24,287
A new apartment was designed to be better than another

253
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,591
Image of Man Behind

254
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,151
Belvidere bus

255
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,199
Egalitarian

256
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:34,527
The basic idea behind it

257
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,295
Was

258
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,319
That

259
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,343
Everyman

260
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,647
Is equal to his neighbor

261
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,695
The modernist idea to

262
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:46,303
Keep all of the functions of the city's separate was also strictly follow.

263
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,071
Dahmer

264
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:53,727
Housing would be up in the sky and Towers while the ground would be kept open for the people to congregate in green

265
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:56,287
Green spaces and endure Collective areas

266
00:11:57,055 --> 00:12:00,127
The idea being discussed

267
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,943
Philosophy help each other grow in life

268
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:08,319
Make better people proposed Apartments be built on the ground level up

269
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,087
The building

270
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,391
An acid was completely

271
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,695
Horrified and appalled saying

272
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,743
The ground is for everyone

273
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,071
Should not be inhabited

274
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:19,839
Bye

275
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:20,607
Private people

276
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:26,239
The Browns has any suggestion to stray from the original principles of modernism was

277
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,543
Completely shut down by NASA

278
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,079
No

279
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,383
Stop we're not going this direction

280
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,943
We'll stay in the party line

281
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:37,247
Boss like a religion

282
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:41,087
Any any subversive

283
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:41,855
Alamo

284
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:42,879
Lost

285
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,927
But potentially big danger

286
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,975
To the house of cards

287
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,839
What we call in the Netherlands

288
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,655
Actually moved

289
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,423
Do it flat

290
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,215
69

291
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,495
I was so much

292
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,031
Involved

293
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,079
In the modern movement

294
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,103
Modernism

295
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,895
Advise No Doubt

296
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,663
That I would

297
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,687
Like to live

298
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,455
In the middle of

299
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:13,343
The brown was not the only person who wanted to live in the middle of it

300
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:15,135
Advertisement stupid

301
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,159
Take me to paradise

302
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:20,767
Modern apartment Towers surrounded by lush green grass and trees

303
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:23,839
Hey it's comparable with this but living in Central Park

304
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,631
Even going to be better than Central

305
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,655
The park

306
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,703
Of course people wanted in

307
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:32,031
Each building was managed by a different Housing Association

308
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,311
Underwear waiting list

309
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,615
An interview to be accepted as a tenant

310
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,687
The Brandon is spice moved in in 1969

311
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,479
I left on the 9th

312
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,015
Florida three bedrooms

313
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,295
Living room

314
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,063
On kitchen

315
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,599
Beautiful bathroom

316
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,135
I had a balcony

317
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:47,903
Off

318
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,695
Substitute white

319
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,255
12 meters long

320
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,047
Advisor

321
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,607
Paradise off a balcony

322
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:59,423
Surrounded always lived in small apartment

323
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,703
Noisy cities

324
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,751
Now he was on the 9th floor

325
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:05,055
Up in the clouds tons of light

326
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,079
And he loved it

327
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:09,407
He talks about his first year at the Belle Mer like it was a religious

328
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,175
Experience

329
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,455
Very much

330
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,991
An everyday

331
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:15,807
Shankly feeling you you.

332
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,111
You know all the old days

333
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,647
Daily

334
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,207
Hostility of a city

335
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:26,047
Wasn't it cool

336
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,583
And silence

337
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,631
Aaron life

338
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:32,703
That brought you deeper into

339
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,983
Yourself maybe

340
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,287
But there were also

341
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,311
Pretty immediate

342
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,079
Problems

343
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:41,407
A Metro was supposed to connect the bilmar with Amsterdam

344
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,199
The construction was delayed

345
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:45,759
For a while there was only one road out

346
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,295
The area and it was dirty

347
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,855
The designers have also plan for shops

348
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,135
To come to the belmermere

349
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,695
Those didn't come right away either

350
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,743
There was no where to buy groceries

351
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:58,815
If you didn't have a car or didn't want to ride your bike 30 minutes

352
00:14:59,071 --> 00:14:59,583
The Amsterdam

353
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:02,911
That came a kind of driving van

354
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,447
Every Friday or

355
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,983
Maybe twice in the week

356
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,519
To sell

357
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,823
A bottle of milk

358
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,615
Very very primitive

359
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,919
Eventually the roads did come

360
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:17,503
And true to the modernist idea of separation of functions

361
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,807
They were elevated above the ground

362
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,343
Sort of weaving in and out of the

363
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,111
High-rises

364
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,415
I remembered you could drive

365
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,183
With your car

366
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:27,487
And then have this specs

367
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,023
That she loves you

368
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,119
Of the Ballmer is seeing all those high rises around you

369
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:36,959
And then driving 70 80 km

370
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:37,727
Is an hour

371
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:40,031
Judas cityscape

372
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,823
Wow

373
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,847
It was amazing

374
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:48,735
That's decimal again who you heard at the beginning and he says yeah it was amazing

375
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,551
But it was all so disorienting

376
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,855
Is always problematic to find a way

377
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:54,879
Where am I

378
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:55,647
Which

379
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,927
What's that building is this

380
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:59,999
Where am I going you could not find Center

381
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:03,583
You couldn't find the center because there was no City Center

382
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,119
No Town Square

383
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:09,471
Just identical concrete buildings one after another after another

384
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:12,031
Visitors were constantly getting lost

385
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:15,359
And they can just pull over and ask for directions

386
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,895
No one would walk

387
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,431
On that level

388
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,991
So you would never encounter someone

389
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,295
That was no way to ask

390
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,343
How can I

391
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,879
Today Show this address

392
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:31,231
And on the ground level the promised greenspace didn't come right away either

393
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,255
Green takes

394
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:36,351
Time to grow underground says in the beginning the landscape was like a desert

395
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,655
Blow in the desert

396
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,959
You would also not anchored

397
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:42,239
Uncle to someone

398
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,007
Because

399
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,031
Hoot book

400
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,055
Through the desert

401
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,591
But I liked it

402
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,615
My wife liked it

403
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,383
Because

404
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,919
Did she wants with me

405
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,455
Andre Burrell Young

406
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:54,015
And that is a state of pioneering.

407
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,039
Many people

408
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,063
Like

409
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:59,647
What we are saying to the designing team because you live there I would

410
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,415
Hell

411
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,463
My superiors

412
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,999
These planets like nothing

413
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,303
It isn't working

414
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,327
And he would say

415
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,095
This is

416
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,375
You have to wait

417
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,655
This is because it

418
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,423
Snap Fitness

419
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,191
Jet

420
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,727
And soda Brown waited

421
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,519
Other residents were not as

422
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,311
I remember

423
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,079
This kind of

424
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,871
Old elderly couple

425
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:26,015
Okay now we going to this paradise that has been promised to us

426
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,063
Anywhere

427
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,343
After 1 year

428
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,879
Completely

429
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,927
Disillusioned

430
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,975
The waiting list disappeared really fast

431
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:39,071
Desperate people that starts with the Shelf

432
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:45,983
By the early 1970s the Belle Mer was being built much of the world was already turning against the massive

433
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:50,591
Concrete apartment towers that modernist had pushed for in the thirties and forties

434
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:51,871
Nobody builds

435
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,663
These kind of structures

436
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,687
Set a timer anymore

437
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:59,039
It America in St Louis stay with you were tearing them down

438
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:05,439
Today is demolition day at pruitt-igoe door Wrecking Company looks blowed the supporting columns from and

439
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:09,791
11 story vacant high-rise

440
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:16,447
Who died Co in St Louis had also been an experiment in the modernist principles of cm

441
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:19,519
It was different than the Belle Mer in that it was never meant to

442
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,823
To function as a city unto itself

443
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,871
But it was similar to

444
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:28,223
Made up of 33 high-rise Towers surrounded by lots of Green Space

445
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:32,831
The architect had envisioned rivers of trees running between the buildings

446
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:39,743
Lego was completed in 1954 and just 15 years later it was so overrun with big

447
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,791
Vacancies in drugs and violence

448
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,327
But the city chose to

449
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,351
To tear it down

450
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,655
The current Secretary of Housing

451
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:51,263
Has the side of the road I go west inspect a disastrous mistake

452
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:54,591
That's the city planner Oscar Newman again

453
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:57,151
Quisiera is that it was all the common spaces

454
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:59,455
The pruitt-igoe that led to its downfall

455
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:04,831
Rivers of trees the architect had envisioned

456
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:05,855
Garbage

457
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:12,255
Father and rivers of trees inside of the building the interior spaces were vandalized heating equipment torn apart

458
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:14,559
Harvest Road everywhere light smash

459
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,095
Windows broken

460
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:20,447
Newman believe that if there was a lot of space in or around a building

461
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:25,311
The residents couldn't literally see from their own windows and watch over

462
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,615
But that space was vulnerable

463
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,383
What's a crime

464
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,943
The net result of all this

465
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,735
Quality design

466
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:33,759
Bison facts

467
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:34,527
Production

468
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,319
David environment of fear

469
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:40,671
In 1972 Oscar Newman visited the belmermere

470
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,463
And he gave it essentially the

471
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,487
The same diagnosis

472
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:46,047
They can seize an empty comment space

473
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,583
This would become breeding grounds

474
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,351
For crime

475
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:49,887
Even members of

476
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,167
VMware turning against

477
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:51,935
The Belle Mer

478
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:58,335
The famous Dutch architect and CMM baraldo Van Dyke went on national TV in the Netherlands and cried live

479
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:02,687
Literal tears over what an awful concrete monstrosity the bilmar was

480
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:03,967
Yeah yeah I cried

481
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:05,759
Yeah

482
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,087
More buildings went up

483
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:13,951
Massive concrete structures around 400 apartments in each

484
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,255
First there were a couple of buildings

485
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,535
Then there were four

486
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,559
Then five

487
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:19,583
6

488
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,607
That was no

489
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,655
Brake no stop

490
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,423
7

491
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,191
Eat

492
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,215
9 building

493
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,519
You should have said stop

494
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:28,799
Building more

495
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:30,591
Units because they'll be

496
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:31,871
Standing empty

497
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:34,431
No one said that

498
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,455
Not even me

499
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:37,247
15 buildings

500
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,783
I'm going to start counting in fives

501
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,551
Because they're

502
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,319
Too many

503
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:41,599
20 building

504
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:42,367
25

505
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,135
5:30

506
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:45,439
Dish contractor's Pat contract

507
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,207
4

508
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,999
Years and years of

509
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,535
Continuous building

510
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,071
And they just did

511
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,607
And that was

512
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,375
Like

513
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,423
Oil on the Fire

514
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:57,727
31 buildings in all

515
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:01,311
13000 departments arranged in hexagonal block

516
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,847
Soda from above

517
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,663
The belmermeer looks like a massive

518
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,431
Concrete

519
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,455
Syfy

520
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:08,991
Honing rod

521
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:10,783
Honing

522
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,575
Grat

523
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:15,903
Pornographic

524
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:24,864
In addition to all the buildings there are also 13,000 storage spaces on the ground level

525
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:30,240
31 parking garage has hundreds of elevators and staircases and common spaces

526
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:32,288
And 110 km

527
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:36,384
Or 68 miles of indoor ground-level corridors

528
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,432
There was so much space

529
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,480
And not enough people to fill it up

530
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,760
OverWatch over it

531
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:46,368
But there were still people who needed housing in the Netherlands

532
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:50,208
In fact there were thousands of newly-arrived citizens

533
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:51,232
We traveled

534
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,768
Cross the Atlantic Ocean

535
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,584
I'm a tropical land in South America

536
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:57,888
And they needed a place to live

537
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:08,640
The story of the belmermeer took so many twists and turns that we have to continue it next

538
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,944
Why the preview of that episode

539
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,224
Right after this

540
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,296
Between the beats

541
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:17,600
Bongs and chatter of our devices

542
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:21,184
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man made sound

543
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,208
If

544
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:28,608
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife is

545
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:32,704
Another word for all hearing. Voice

546
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,472
Technology

547
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,240
She talked to us

548
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:36,544
It is a creation of Sonic trap

549
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:39,616
Mets Joel Beckerman he's a sound designer and composer

550
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:43,200
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

551
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,992
To make them more human

552
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:49,088
Turn the living room lights on

553
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:50,880
Okay

554
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:52,928
Dim the living room lights to 50

555
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:53,696
2%

556
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:55,488
Okay

557
00:22:56,256 --> 00:23:01,632
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

558
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,936
Makes for a much more natural

559
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:04,704
Experience

560
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:06,496
Turn the living room lights on

561
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,824
Dim the living room lights

562
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,848
50%

563
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:14,176
We're presenting to

564
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:18,272
Special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

565
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:21,088
About how are soundscape is impacting our health

566
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,648

Constipation abdominal pain and bloating you tell yourself it's not that bad you take laxatives modify your diet

572
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,336
Thinking about it all the time is frustrating

573
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:47,712
It doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again

574
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:51,040
You don't know why and it may be time to seek help

Next week on the show with the story of the belmermeer continues

580
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:08,704
So here's a bunch of

581
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:10,240
White guys

582
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:13,824
Decide to build this area

583
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:18,944
India people is the city of the future

584
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,736
Where

585
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:29,952
Spandex jackets

586
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:35,072
This was the idea when the idea of the belmermeer fails to live up to the reality

587
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:37,120
Thousands of apartments in MD

588
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:39,168
And new people take them over

589
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,960
He said we need houses

590
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:42,240
Let's go get the house

591
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:47,872
But the bilmar mirrors newcomers aren't welcomed with open arms by all the old residents

592
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,408
Besides it was

593
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:51,456
It was like

594
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,992
Inferno

595
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,016
Really

596
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,808
The lift didn't work

597
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:58,112
They threw that refuse over

598
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,488
Over the balcony either side of those blocks at Advance

599
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:07,840
Like a ghetto

600
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,376
And we make something

601
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:11,424
And a tragic accident

602
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,960
Strikes the belmermeer

603
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:15,776
Didn't let anybody go inside a gate

604
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:19,616
So you lost everything you lost everything

605
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,152
You lost everything

606
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,712
You lost everything

607
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:25,760

That whines through a

00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:56,384
Treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

We're looking the part

00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,456
Might cost you your life

638
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:04,832
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

639
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:09,184
Or lose a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

640
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,512
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like

641
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,536
A dad

642
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:17,888
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

643
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:22,240
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that kind

644
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:29,664
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

Even worse

648
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:40,672
The cops think that I had something to do with it

649
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,952
Now

650
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:44,000
I need to clear my name

651
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:50,400
