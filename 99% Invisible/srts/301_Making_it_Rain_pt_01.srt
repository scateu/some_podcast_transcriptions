This is 99% invisible

24
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:17,056
August 24th 1814 March 1st and only time Washington DC was occupied

25
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,080
By outside forces

26
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:21,920
United States with two years in the War of 1812

27
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:25,760
Be taken on Great Britain which was then the greatest naval power in the world

28
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:29,856
And things weren't looking great for the American troops defending DC

29
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:31,392
As producer Vivien Leigh

30
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:33,696
British forces / took the city

31
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:38,048
Set fire to Historic American landmarks including the treasury building

32
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:39,328
The Capitol building

33
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,864
And even the White House

34
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:44,448
The beach became known as the burning of Washington

35
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,080
But then a freak occurrence which in any other situation would have been a total disaster for DC

36
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,616
Saved the city

37
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,408
Dark clouds begin to form

38
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:55,456
Which turned into thunder and lightning

39
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:58,272
Which then turned into a full-blown tornado

40
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:01,856
Headed straight for the British who were setting fires around the capitol

41
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,160
A number of British soldiers

42
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,952
Chris were killed by Falling debris

43
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,256
And the fire is extinguished by the rain

44
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:12,608
The British retreated back to their ships which had been severely damaged by the storm

45
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,912
Thanks to a simple Act of weather

46
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:19,264
The occupation of our nation's capital was over within a little more than a day

47
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,944
The storm that saved Washington was just one of countless times that weather played a crucial factor in war

48
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:31,040
Napoleon's Army was interviewed by Russian forces but by a Russian winter

49
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,832
And during World War II

50
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,880
General Patton famously distributed

51
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:37,440
250000 prayer cards to the Army

52
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,488
Enlist as many men as possible

53
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,768
Pray for an end to the Rain

54
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,352
The battlefield has always been at the mercy of the climate

55
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46,912
But there was a time and US military history

56
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:50,496
When we did more than just pray for advantageous weather

57
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,032
We try to create it

58
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:58,688
Fighting communist guerrillas in South Vietnam continue

59
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,712
Videos of slug line

60
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:04,320
Pictures from the swampy Mekong Delta show government troops trying to ferret out the

61
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:11,744
Beginning in the 1950s and continuing into the 1960s and 70s

62
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,840
Do us became deeply entangled in a war between North and South Vietnam

63
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:20,960
North Vietnam was supported by the Soviet Union China and other communist allies

64
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:25,056
South Vietnam was supported by the Us and other anti-communist allies

65
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,592
And the Vietnam War

66
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,384
Or as the Vietnamese called

67
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,664
The American War

68
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,992
Was unlike any of the United States had ever engaged in

69
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:33,760
Or

70
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,576
Tradition and our heritage and our

71
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:42,464
Education in our history all prepared us for a different kind of War

72
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,512
Then we had to fight in the lake

73
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,280
60

74
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,072
This is General Merrill McPeak

75
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,120
Former Chief of Staff of the Air Force

76
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,168
There wasn't a Frontline

77
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:55,520
And we weren't facing a enemy at least of the beginning

78
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:59,104
That was equipped with tanks and flamethrowers and

79
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:02,944
High-speed you know computers and so forth

80
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:05,248
It was a total Miss mismatch

81
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:07,808
That's from that standpoint it was us against the

82
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:12,672
A guerrilla Army that showed up occasionally and then disappeared vanished

83
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:15,232
Spent the next day

84
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:19,839
No months looking for it and then it showed up Suddenly and then was gone again

85
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:22,143
That gorilla Army was the Viet Cong

86
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,423
Communist Sports

87
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:26,751
Allied with North Vietnam but fighting primarily in the south

88
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,055
One of the vietcong's greatest advantages

89
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,335
Was the Ho Chi Minh trail

90
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,895
Supply route that ran from North Vietnam

91
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:35,967
Two parts of Laos and Cambodia into South Vietnam

92
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,527
Hundreds of thousands of North Vietnamese troops

93
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,575
Used it to infiltrate the South

94
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,111
Weapons and supplies

95
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:46,463
Travel through an isolated region full of rugged mountains and dense jungle

96
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:50,047
The trail itself is made up of dirt paths in handmade tunnel

97
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,351
Along the way there were hidden bunkers

98
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,119
Barracks

99
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,935
Even hospitals cleverly camouflaged from above

100
00:04:56,447 --> 00:05:00,287
It was a engineering Marvel that wasn't a single Road

101
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:04,127
It was a network of Amazing Frog

102
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:09,759
The covert trail system dramatically shortened the journey from North to South Vietnam

103
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:13,087
Many more troops more weapons and more North Vietnamese

104
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:16,415
Pork be made available to Communist forces in the south

105
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:19,999
And the key thing was that's how all their supplies

106
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:23,583
Sa Supply both the Viet Cong and also

107
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,119
Their own forces

108
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,911
I had to come down that trail

109
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:29,471
This is Lieutenant General Ed's oyster

110
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:34,591
And in order to cut off the supplies with your course very important for military operation

111
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:37,663
We had to close this Trail by various means

112
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,735
The US military tried disrupting the trail with

113
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,759
Bombing campaign

114
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:44,319
Am I plowing the jungles to strip the land

115
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:47,903
They also use deadly chemical defoliants like Agent Orange

116
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,695
But none of these

117
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,463
It seemed to work

118
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,255
At least not for very long

119
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:55,327
So whenever we punched a hole in one part of it

120
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,887
They simply moved over to

121
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,167
I know a bypass

122
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,727
There was only one thing

123
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:06,335
Significantly slowed the flow of supplies and people on ho chi Minh trail

124
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,127
Rain

125
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,919
The reality was that

126
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,967
Because of the nature of the trail

127
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:14,271
It was affected by heavy rainfall

128
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,135
So they had the same problem of course as we did in terms of trails that were

129
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:19,903
Very very

130
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:20,671
Marty

131
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:21,951
What the rain

132
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:24,511
The mud would make the trails difficult to navigate

133
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,815
And so during one month since

134
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,351
In the middle of the war

135
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,375
Somebody

136
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,399
Certainly not me

137
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:33,983
Came up with the idea of let's see if we can increase the rainfall

138
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,775
Enough to stop vehicle

139
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:36,543
Qatar traffic

140
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,847
The Department of Defense design it

141
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,127
But they should try

142
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,663
Control the weather

143
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:46,783
This was the beginning of a top-secret military project called operation Popeye

144
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:50,367
The goal was to actually create more rain in Southeast Asia

145
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,719
They artificially extending and intensifying the naturally-occurring monsoon season

146
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:58,559
The monsoon season typically lasted from April to October

147
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:01,375
US military believe that if it could extend it

148
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,911
Buy a month on either side

149
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:07,007
It would create a huge strategic advantage

150
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:11,359
Humans especially military humans

151
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:14,175
Have wanted to control the weather for a long time

152
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,967
Because pets who up

153
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:19,295
Traditional out rainmaking ceremony

154
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,831
This is Jim Fleming

155
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:24,927
He studied the history of human attempts at weather and climate modification

156
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,743
He doesn't think very highly of our abilities

157
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:33,375
Turns out that if you do a rain dance for up to two weeks it'll probably rain and then you can take credit for that

158
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:40,799
And consistently enough it'll rain and you can claim responsibility

159
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:44,383
Funny says that in the 19th century after the Civil War

160
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,919
A theory begin to develop

161
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:51,039
That major military operations Were Somehow disrupting the clouds and causing big rain storms

162
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:55,135
We could shoot Cannon

163
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,207
Fireworks

164
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,511
We could sort of imitate battle

165
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:03,839
Imitate battle in order to create rain

166
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:07,423
The federal government actually attended this in Texas in the 1890s

167
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,471
Special

168
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,519
Department of Agriculture funded it

169
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,823
And they had a weather bureau Observer there

170
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:20,479
The locals love

171
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,831
It was during the monsoon season

172
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,647
It was a really good chance was going to rain anyway

173
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:34,559
This kind of experimentation continued from the 1890s into the early twentieth

174
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,327
Century

175
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,631
It only accelerated after 19

176
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,399
45

177
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,447
Weed enter the Cold War era

178
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,007
And we just invented the bomb

179
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:46,591
And that technology made people think they had power over nature

180
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:51,967
Those are heightened are paranoid that other countries were trying to develop their own nature controlling technology

181
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,247
Like the Russians

182
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,063
Before the space race with the Soviet Union

183
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:58,367
There was a kind of weather race

184
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,927
We thought they might get ahead of us

185
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:05,791
And if they had a nefarious purpose they might be able to change our weather and climate in

186
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,327
Possibly caused

187
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:11,167
Unlike another dust forward or drought or something if they really could do it

188
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:14,751
So there's a great rush to get into this field again

189
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,031
Driven by military

190
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:16,799
Concerns

191
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:20,639
There was a lot of money being poured into scientific research on whether

192
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,407
A control

193
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:24,991
And while many of these experiments didn't yield very promising results

194
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,271
One actually did

195
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,807
In 1946

196
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:36,511
The weather

197
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:45,727
This remarkable achievement happened in Schenectady New York

198
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,519
Are the offices of General Electric

199
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:48,543
Yep

200
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:52,383
The same company that made your dishwasher also invented weather control

201
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:58,783
GE was where scientist and Nobel Laureate and Irving Langer was working in collaboration with a colleague

202
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,807
Vincent Schaefer

203
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:05,439
Who developed a technique of dry ice put into a cloud that would make it super cool

204
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,743
And force it to be

205
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,791
Conditions to go below freezing

206
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,839
A little bit of ice in the cloud

207
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,655
Could cause a cloud to play shade or creates snow

208
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:18,495
In case you didn't quite get that here's a quick lesson in 8th grade cloudphysics

209
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:22,847
Clouds are essentially just tiny droplets of water

210
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,871
Suspended in the atmosphere

211
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,175
When the right conditions occur

212
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:30,015
Water molecules in these clouds will condense together and become heavy enough

213
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,807
The fall to Earth as rain or snow

214
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:34,623
And that's what Schaefer had figured out how to do

215
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:39,487
He figured out how to create the conditions in the clown such that it would produce rain or snow

216
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:44,607
In parallel with that breakthrough there was another guy doing instrumental work at GE

217
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:47,423
His name was Bernard or Bernie Vonnegut

218
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,959
The brother of author

219
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:52,799
Kurt Vonnegut who also worked at GE in the PR department

220
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,335
And it's interesting

221
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:58,687
You can actually see the ways that GE influence some of vonnegut's writing

222
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,735
Kurt was on staff at GE

223
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,271
Writing a history

224
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,343
Reports when he was also working on novels

225
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,135
Play Cat's Cradle

226
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,927
In which the

227
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:13,791
The mad scientist kind of like in Irving Langer person develops Ice Nine which

228
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,583
Messes up the environment

229
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:18,911
Ice Nine was kind of like cloud seeding on steroid

230
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,471
It's clear that Bernie and Kurt

231
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,495
These two brothers

232
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:24,543
Chris were uneasy about some of the brakes

233
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,823
If they were involved with

234
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:28,639
And I think you'll see some of Bernie's concerns

235
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,943
Reflected in Kurt vonnegut's novels

236
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,735
Which are pretty much

237
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,527
Against the militarization

238
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:35,807
Of nature

239
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:40,671
The Bernese work at GE actually helped lay the groundwork for that militarization

240
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,719
Along with linear and Schaefer

241
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,999
She made another credit

242
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:44,767
Call Discovery

243
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,631
He found a new weather-related use for a compound called Silver iodide

244
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,935
It had a hexagonal structure

245
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,959
Like a snowflake

246
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,519
And he found that if you sprayed it into a cloud

247
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:58,079
It would trick the cloud in the glaciated

248
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,103
And so

249
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:01,151
Armed with a Nobel Prize winner

250
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,711
A technique to super cool cloud

251
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,735
With dry ice

252
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:08,063
And a technique to trick a cloud with silver iodide

253
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,855
They really felt they had

254
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,903
The basis for chemical cloud seeding

255
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:16,511
GE was understandably very proud of their discovery

256
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,791
And so they

257
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:21,119
Officiate a great big press release it said we can control the weather

258
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:27,263
But shortly after claiming responsibility for a storm that caused 8 inches of snowfall in Upstate New York

259
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:31,615
GE suddenly realize that they might not want to be known for controlling the weather

260
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,431
Especially if that weather was destroying people's

261
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,199
Property

262
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:38,015
Munster lawyer says know you better

263
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:40,831
You better keep that quiet because there could be too many lawsuits

264
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:44,671
Given the risk of negative public reaction and liability

265
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:47,231
Weather modification research continued

266
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:47,999
Quietly

267
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:52,607
Scientist board how it could be applied to Hurricane intervention in drought relief

268
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,143
Course

269
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,423
Warfare

270
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,215
Langmuir himself

271
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:00,287
Was excited about the military applications of his research

272
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:06,687
And I think he wanted to have a kind of a gigantic militarized

273
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,759
Hurricane is multiple h-bombs

274
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,039
And credible

275
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,575
Destructive power if you could

276
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,599
Directed

277
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,367
Against an enemy

278
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,183
Sole me was making these kind of plants

279
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,999
And so were our political leaders

280
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,303
Was nuclear weapons now in play

281
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,071
The US was

282
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,095
Forward

283
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:27,423
Imagining how we could give ourselves an edge and future Wars

284
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:32,287
This is from a speech that vice President Lyndon Johnson gave in 1962

285
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,583
LBJ or Bond film

286
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:56,863
You decide

287
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:03,007
By the time rainmaking had made its way to the Ho Chi Minh trail in Southeast Asia

288
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,799
It wasn't a new technology

289
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,103
It was still a closely held Secret

290
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,919
Operation Popeye was a Navy program

291
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,455
Admissions were flown by air for

292
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,223
Force pilots

293
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:15,551
And as Pilots were given limited information about what they were doing

294
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,623
I never even imagined

295
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,439
That group was doing until

296
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,231
We got over there and

297
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:23,999
Showed up

298
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,071
For the briefing

299
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,351
They told us what

300
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:30,399
This project is about

301
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,983
This is Brian Heckman a former Air Force pilot

302
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,799
He belongs to the 54th weather reconnaissance Squad

303
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:42,943
They contributed to the 2602 cloud seeding missions flown during operation Popeye

304
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,015
Looking for clouds

305
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:46,783
2 seed

306
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,319
When they found the clouds of life

307
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:51,903
The flip switch to ignite silver or lead iodide flares

308
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,207
Anyway to see if the cloud produce rainfall

309
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,767
There were times when we left an area

310
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,303
That we have been working

311
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:01,119
And it was obvious that

312
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:03,423
There was a lot of rain storms going on

313
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:06,239
Operation Popeye at form an object

314
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,031
To turn the roads to mud

315
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,055
Cause landslides

316
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,079
Lights along roadways

317
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,615
To washout River Crossing

318
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,687
And to keep roads muddier for longer than usual

319
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:18,015
It seemed to Heckman that operation Popeye was working

320
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,063
But it's really hard to know for sure

321
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,879
Cloud seeding at the time and even today

322
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,927
Far from an exact science

323
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:27,231
At best a military could measure three things

324
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,791
What's the average rainfall for that area was

325
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,095
What's the estimated rainfall would have been

326
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,655
And what actually fell after receiving mission

327
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,935
But they couldn't collect

328
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,959
That much data

329
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:39,775
Like enough to really rigorously analyze the outcome

330
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,311
Hughes Plumbing again

331
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:44,127
The rain is completely a variable

332
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,663
You have tremendous

333
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,943
Temporal variability

334
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,735
Spatial variability

335
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:52,063
And that means that statistics are not robust about

336
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:55,135
Your particular intervention did to that

337
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:55,903
Particular

338
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:56,927
Rainfall

339
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:59,231
And even if they could make it rain

340
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:02,303
They couldn't precisely control where that rain landed

341
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:07,679
One official described accidentally dumping a ton of rain on the American Special Forces

342
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:12,799
Still the program was deemed effective enough to continue for 5 years

343
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,335
M1967

344
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,615
1972

345
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:22,527
But the biggest problem with operation Popeye wasn't so much the lack of quantifiable success

346
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,575
What's the many ethical concerns

347
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,111
Weather modification

348
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,647
Especially in the context of War

349
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,439
Resalat of thorny question

350
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:35,583
The military Justified the program by arguing that increasing rainfall to Grandma and wash out roads

351
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:36,863
Wood preferable

352
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,143
Baltimore bombing

353
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,679
But the reality is

354
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:45,311
The US military still dropped a lot of bombs on southeast Asia during the Vietnam war

355
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,103
Over 7 million

356
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:47,871
Tons of them

357
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,663
So many in fact

358
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,943
That to this day

359
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,479
The government of Laos is

360
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:56,831
Still trying to clean up all of the undetonated bomb scattered across the country

361
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,135
Here's General Merrill McPeak again

362
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:01,951
We dropped more bombs on Laos than

363
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:06,303
And we did on Germany and Japan all together in World War II

364
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,863
Show the tonnage of of

365
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,911
Bomb dropped was enormous

366
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,727
And the heavily-used

367
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:14,495
Parts

368
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,799
Of the Ho Chi Minh trail

369
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,591
Look like the face of the Moon

370
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:22,175
It was just a lunar landscape nothing but dust

371
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:27,551
But just as it's unclear how much rain was generated

372
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:28,831
Popeye

373
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:33,951
It's also unclear if Popeye actually prevented the military from dropping more bombs

374
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,487
Or if they die

375
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,255
Did both

376
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:39,583
And messing with another country's weather system

377
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:42,911
That has potentially bigen unpredictable consequences

378
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,983
You don't necessarily know what the long-term consequences

379
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,775
Is it going to be of rain make

380
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,311
This is Jacob Hamblin

381
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,615
Astorian at Oregon State University

382
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,151
Especially if you're doing it all night

383
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,431
A long-term basis

384
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,967
And there are documented

385
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:58,783
Cases in which weather modification may have caused

386
00:17:59,039 --> 00:17:59,551
Set alarm

387
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,343
Silver iodide sprayed into

388
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,623
The clouds can be toxic

389
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:04,671
Sick to humans in concentrated doses

390
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:07,487
But it hasn't been shown to have negative health of

391
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,255
Effects when you

392
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,023
McCloud CA

393
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,303
Nevertheless

394
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,607
Cloud seeding may have caused other prom

395
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,655
In 1947

396
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,447
Irving langmuir research

397
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,471
Estima GE

398
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:21,311
Tried to break up a hurricane by dumping a lot of dry ice into it

399
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,591
To see if it would collapse

400
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,151
But instead it changed the trajectory

401
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,431
Became stronger

402
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,711
Did you get the Georgia coast

403
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:30,271
One death was reported as result

404
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,039
Hurricane

405
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:36,671
And in 1952 the British royal Air Force was conducting cloud seeding test in lynmouth England

406
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:39,231
And may have accidentally caused a devastating flood that kill

407
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,255
35 people

408
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:47,679
It was this kind of ethical ambiguity that ultimately ended the US military's entire weather

409
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,703
Annotation program

410
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,495
In 1971

411
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:52,799
Jack Anderson reporter for the Washington Post

412
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:58,175
Published an article revealing that the US was engaged in covert weather Warfare in Vietnam

413
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:01,503
This report was corroborated by information leaked

414
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,527
Paper

415
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:06,111
The following year in July of 1972

416
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:09,951
Seymour Hersh reported in the New York Times about operation Popeye

417
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:12,767
Within two days of the story's publication

418
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:16,863
The entire program was officially ended and all cloud seeding missions

419
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:17,631
Stop

420
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:24,543
When the program was finally Declassified and it came out that the US had been secretly engaging in hostile weathermen

421
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,823
Population in Vietnam

422
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,103
It was dubbed

423
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,127
The Watergate

424
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,407
Weather Warfare

425
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:32,991
But they really should have called it weathergate

426
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:39,903
This led to a kind of an embarrassing the tremendously embarrassing moment for the for the US here's Tim Fleming

427
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,463
Just perceived as a big mistake

428
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:44,767
It's just an embarrassment

429
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,815
Try to

430
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,631
Intervene animations weather like that

431
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:52,703
Research money for weather control rapidly disappeared

432
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:59,359
And in 1977 the US signed an international agreement called the environmental modification convention treaty

433
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,639
Orin mod

434
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,407
For sure

435
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:03,967
How long did the Soviet Union and many other nations

436
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:06,783
They agreed to ban modification of the environment

437
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:07,807
Pravda purposes

438
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:10,879
The treaty outlawed causing earthquakes and tsunamis

439
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,951
Steering hurricanes or tampering with the ionosphere

440
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:18,815
It also banned any other widespread long-lasting and severe damage the environment

441
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:22,399
But there are questions about whether the end mod treaty was even that relevant

442
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,191
Missouri easy to ban

443
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,727
Environmental Warfare

444
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:29,567
The reason was easy to ban is because you're not giving up anything

445
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:33,919
Because those things no longer work considered to be

446
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,455
Important parts of the RC

447
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:37,247
They were developed during a Time

448
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,527
When

449
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,087
The US wanted to develop a lot of different weapons

450
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:43,135
But by the time you get to the

451
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:46,207
If there was going to be a war with the Soviet Union

452
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,231
It was going to be a noob

453
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:50,559
Clear war was going to be a war in which thermonuclear weapons were used

454
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:53,631
Intercontinental ballistic missiles were probably going to be used

455
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:57,215
And so Hamblin believes that giving up environment to Warfare

456
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:58,751
Was more a gesture

457
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:02,591
Of global cooperation rather than an actual step towards the storm

458
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:09,247
After all it's hard to find something that can cause more widespread long lasting or severe damage to the environment than nuclear

459
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:11,295
Their weapons are not banned

460
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:13,087
Real Madrid

461
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:15,903
You could argue yes sir it's progress but

462
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:19,488
I would encourage us all to take a more cynical view of that and

463
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:23,072
And see that it was signed for very political purposes and really gave

464
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,608
Virtually nothing

465
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,520
The military interest in weather control had run its course

466
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,824
The cloud seeding is something that still takes

467
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,384
Place all over the world for another reason

468
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:37,408
Money

469
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,992
Major percentage of the economy is weather sensitive

470
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:44,064
From agriculture to energy to insurance

471
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,344
To the travel industry

472
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:50,208
More than 50 countries openly have some form of weather modification program

473
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:54,560
China attempted to use cloud seeding to clear skies over the Beijing Olympics

474
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:59,424
There's even a company in the UK that offers a wedding package that includes cloud seeding

475
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,984
Can be used to burst rain clouds and make them

476
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:02,752
Disappear

477
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:06,592
Company claims they can guarantee a rain free wedding day

478
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:09,664
And that will only set you back about $150,000

479
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:14,784
As the conversation shifts away from the Cold War

480
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,832
To the present a threat of climate change

481
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:20,928
People are starting to talk about the use of geoengineering to fix the problem

482
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,976
Suggestions have been thrown around like

483
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:26,560
Brightening the clouds to reflect radiation back into space

484
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:30,912
Or spraying reflective particles into the stratosphere to cool down the planet

485
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:33,472
People propose giant space umbrella

486
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:36,288
We're even trying to change the orbit of the Earth

487
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,056
So that it's

488
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,848
Slightly farther from the Sun

489
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,408
Changing the weather is one thing

490
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:45,248
But changing the climate on a permanent scale is next level modeling

491
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:48,064
Many people are highly doubt

492
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,112
The geoengineering can be used effectively

493
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,904
Play to stop the warming of our planet

494
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:55,232
Anything we try would be extremely experimental

495
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,512
With unknown consequence

496
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,864
That's the main issue do we have a right to mess around with a right to Tinker with things

497
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,912
Anilao things just happen

498
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:07,008
What is the free market or some some go engineer who wants to

499
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,544
Try some new trick

500
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:11,872
Do we have the right to do that when we going to have global

501
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:14,944
Weather systems are so complex

502
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,784
It's pretty much hubris to think we can intervene in predictable ways

503
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:21,344
But as long as the stakes are high

504
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:22,624
Whether it's a war

505
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:23,648
Are you now

506
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,440
Fate of the planet

507
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,488
People will probably keep

508
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,256
Keep trying

509
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:43,616
Kirk Olson and I talked about the unintended reuse of bomb fragments in Southeast Asia

510
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:44,896
After this

511
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,552
Between the beats

512
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:53,856
Bongs and Charter of our devices

513
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:57,440
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

514
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,464
If

515
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:03,072
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexis

516
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:08,960
Is talking to me and my wife is in another room and a kid is another remedy for all hearing that voice

517
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:10,752
Technology talk to us

518
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,800
It is a creation of Sonic trap

519
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:15,872
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

520
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:19,456
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

521
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:21,504
To make them more human

522
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,344
Turn the living room lights on

523
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,136
Okay

524
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:29,184
Dim the living room lights to 50

525
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:29,952
80%

526
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:31,744
Okay

527
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:38,144
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

528
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,192
Makes for a much more natural

529
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:40,960
Experience

530
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:43,008
Turn the living room lights on

531
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,080
Dim the living room lights

532
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,104
50%

533
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:54,528
We're presenting to special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

534
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,064
About how are sounds gay

535
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,344
Is impacting our health

536
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:59,904
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

537
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,976
Look for them Fridays May 17th and May 24th

538
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:05,024
Right here on the 9th 9 p.m.

539
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:09,376
We need to talk about something

540
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:12,704
Constipation abdominal pain and bloating

541
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,544
It's not that bad you take laxatives modify your diet and exercise routine

542
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,592
Thinking about it all the time is frustrate

543
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:23,968
It doesn't have to Define constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again

544
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:27,296
And you don't know why and it may be time to seek help

545
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:30,624
Go to oh my God. Info podcast

546
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,744
We can learn more about your symptoms that's oh my God. Info / podcast

547
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,512
Oh my God

548
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,304
Black podcast

549
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:43,936
So as we mentioned in the story the US military has described their efforts at cloud seeding

550
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:45,472
In and around Vietnam

551
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,520
Has this alternative to bombing

552
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:51,104
A way to muddy up the trails with rain instead of dropping

553
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,384
Deadly explosion

554
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:53,920
But in reality

555
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:55,456
Us airplanes dump

556
00:25:55,712 --> 00:26:00,064
Tons and tons of bombs in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War era

557
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,088
Minions

558
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,112
Exploded on impact

559
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,904
Tactic requested is here to talk about

560
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,928
The ones that didn't

561
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:07,232
And the unexpected ways

562
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:10,560
They were reused and incorporated into the built landscape

563
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,608
In the 1960s and 70s

564
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,144
Is the US covertly dropped

565
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,680
Hundreds of millions of bombs

566
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,984
More bombs were dropped

567
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,520
In Europe during World War II

568
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:22,080
In the wake of this conflict which

569
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:25,408
Can be called The Secret War this small Asian Nation

570
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,688
The morbid

571
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:28,992
Distinction of being the most bombed country

572
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:30,272
Per capita in world

573
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:31,808
And it still

574
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:32,576
Holds that

575
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:35,392
It's hard to wrap my mind around the counter

576
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:38,464
Hundreds of millions a how is that even pause

577
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:41,536
Well a lot of the devices that got dropped work

578
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:42,304
Cluster bomb

579
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:46,912
Basically these consist of hollow metal shells that open up on the way down

580
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:49,728
And deploy hundreds of smaller explosive

581
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:50,496
Omelette

582
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:51,776
Which are about

583
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:52,800
The size of tennis ball

584
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:57,408
And the US flew over 500000 missions into Laos

585
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,688
To drop these and other types

586
00:26:59,200 --> 00:26:59,712
Explosives

587
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:03,808
So the larger sell the big bomb is released the casing and it's his little

588
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:06,368
Bomblet seen inside the bigger shell that would

589
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,136
Spread out

590
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:07,904
Explode when they

591
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:10,208
Well they were designed to at least

592
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:12,256
But they actually had a really high failure

593
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:14,560
Is many is 1/3 of those bombers

594
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:15,584
Didn't detonate

595
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,352
An impact

596
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,888
Leaving the country littered with

597
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:20,192
Close to a hundred million unexploded device

598
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:23,008
And when the bombing finally stopped and 19

599
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:23,776
33

600
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:26,080
Les oceans were left to deal with the aftermath

601
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:31,200
So the begin cleaning the landscape but they also started collecting the shells in the scraps

602
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:31,968
They found

603
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:33,504
And putting them to use another

604
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,296
And you mean the bigger

605
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:38,368
Outer shell casings or these little bum

606
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:45,280
Little bit of both and other types of bombs to but those big hollow metal shells in particular yet they turned out to

607
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,816
To be really useful at least

608
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:48,352
The ones that were relatively intact

609
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,912
Some of the larger ones have been turned into things like

610
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:51,680
Canoes

611
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:54,240
Other mid-sized ones have been lined up

612
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:57,568
Form the walls of buildings or used as spilled flick

613
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:58,848
Tap houses off the ground

614
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,896
Orchid pots

615
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:01,664
Plants

616
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:06,016
And even the really small scrap can be melted down for other purposes

617
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:09,344
Is like making jewelry or silverware or cowbells or

618
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,112
Other things

619
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,904
And overtime

620
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:16,768
Finding recycling the shells in Scotts is actually grown into this unlikely National Industry

621
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:21,120
So around the Laotian Countryside you can see tons of Bombshells baked into built

622
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,192
This story has this patina

623
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:25,984
Of this uplifting swords to

624
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,008
Usher story

625
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:28,032
Really

626
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:31,104
Horrifying Legacy

627
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,640
But they have to deal with

628
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:34,944
These deadly devices that we dropped on

629
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:36,736
Yeah it's

630
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,528
It's really very sad and

631
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:39,808
Aside from the people who

632
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:40,576
Who died

633
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:42,368
Initially even those bombs were dropped

634
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,928
Tens of thousands of people that actually died

635
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:46,976
Duda detonations in the decade since

636
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:50,560
And even now hundreds of people are injured or killed

637
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:51,328
Each year

638
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,096
Explosion

639
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,120
Sometimes

640
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:54,400
Gather up

641
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:58,752
So they've been cleaning up for Renewal since 1970

642
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:00,032
We three are they anywhere close

643
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:00,800
How to clean up on

644
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:01,824
Not really

645
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:05,408
Non-profit organizations that are working on this problem actively

646
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,688
Still have to make that it will

647
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:08,736
Will take decades or even a Century II

648
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:09,760
Clean up the rest

649
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,576
And it's this Legacy in Paris

650
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:13,600
That is caused

651
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:17,184
Over a hundred Nations to get on board with this convention of cluster munition

652
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:19,488
Which is an international agreement.

653
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:21,024
To make or use or

654
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,048
Transfer cluster

655
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:23,584
And I take it the United

656
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,120
Is not one of the countries

657
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:26,656
That signed on to the convention.

658
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:27,424
Cluster munition

659
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:31,264
Correct the US military clearly didn't take away

660
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,568
Is some of the same lessons that other countries did from

661
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,616
What happened in the Vietnam War

662
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:37,408
Well it's

663
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:39,456
Fastening to see how people in Lost

664
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:41,760
Managed to make something useful out of these devices

665
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,296
Still this

666
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:46,880
Really tangible through four basic reminder of the horrors of

667
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:47,648
War

668
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:53,024
A few years back photographer Mark Watson encountered this phenomenon

669
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,560

692

Series from fellow radiotopia show the truth

693
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,952
The body genius is a dark

Comic mystery

695
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:28,256
That whines through a

696
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,304
Treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

697
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:31,840
We're looking the part

698
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:33,376
Might cost you your life

699
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:38,752
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

700
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:43,104
Or lose a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

701
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,432
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like

702
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,456
A dad

703
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:51,808
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

704
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:56,160
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that kind

705
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:03,584
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

706
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:06,912
Was found dead in my private gym

707
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:10,240
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

708
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,520
Even worse

709
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:14,592
The cops think that I had something to do with it

710
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:15,872
Now

711
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:17,920
I need to clear my name

712
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:24,320
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes to find them
