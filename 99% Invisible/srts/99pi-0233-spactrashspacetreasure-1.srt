I'm Roman Mars

25
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:18,080
In 1957 a few months after the Soviet satellite Sputnik

26
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:20,640
Became the first human object in space

27
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:22,432
United States launch

28
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:23,712
Explore one

29
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,584
And with that

30
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,120
Space Race was underway

31
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:44,960
In the two world powers began launching more and more satellite

32
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:45,728
Every year

33
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,776
A lot of these early missions

34
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:48,544
Failed

35
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,824
Before they ever made

36
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:50,848
Into orbit

37
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,384
That's producer Emmett Fitzgerald

38
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:54,432
But there were two successes

39
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:57,248
Andrew my little space started to fill up

40
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,784
Which human made object

41
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,600
By the summer of 1961

42
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,904
There were 115 satellite

43
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,928
Circling the earth

44
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:11,584
It was during that summer that the US launched an unmanned rocket carrying the transit for a satellite

45
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,984
And about 2 hours after launch the rocket blew up it was the first

46
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:24,384
Known object to unintentionally explode in space and it created about 300 fragment

47
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,784
Of totally useless space junk some of these pieces got pulled into the atmosphere and burn

48
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,552
Burned up

49
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:34,880
But around 200 are still up there today

50
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:40,768
At the time most people weren't all that concerned about a few bits of metal floating around in the vastness

51
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:41,536
Space

52
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,560
Watching The General

53
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:44,352
Training was it space with big

54
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,144
I'm a tweaker

55
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,680
Object satellites

56
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:49,728
Open to space without Willie

57
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,264
Having any consequences to that

58
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:52,800
This is

59
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:53,568
Hugh Lewis

60
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,896
Space junk expert at the University of Southampton

61
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,200
Back in the early days of the Space Age

62
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:04,576
While the universe may be infinite orbital space

63
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:07,648
Raise the region where objects revolve around the Earth

64
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,672
Is finite

65
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:11,232
And the amount that we use regularly

66
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,768
Is even more limited

67
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:16,608
Most satellites end up in a few particular Orbitz

68
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,888
Almost like

69
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:20,960
Freeways on the traffic on most freeways is actually

70
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:23,776
Conscious and that's where the Problem Child 3 marriage

71
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,312
As the traffic increases

72
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:27,616
So does the chance of collision

73
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:30,944
One of the regions of space that got busy pretty quickly

74
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:33,504
Is the area called Low Earth orbit

75
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,856
Special region of space that extends up to an altitude of about 2000 km

76
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,904
Baby heavily congested

77
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:43,232
And my satellite stops working in low earth orbit

78
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:46,304
I can stay in that region for hundreds of years

79
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:48,096
By the mid-1960s

80
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:51,680
They were already lots of old into Funk satellite

81
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,704
Floating around

82
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,776
And nothing began to look into this

83
00:03:56,032 --> 00:04:00,640
Based on your reading think about the potential issues of space debris opal debris

84
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,432
Might pose in the future

85
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:07,552
That was an activity that was really loud by don't cash that it was that not sure of the time

86
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:12,672
My name is Don Kessler I started the orbital debris program at NASA

87
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:17,536
Kessler is retired now but when he got started at Nasa he was studying media

88
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:21,119
And specifically what happens when two meteoroids

89
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,655
Collide and break apart in

90
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,423
And a smaller piece

91
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:27,007
Eventually Doncaster started doing similar research

92
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:27,775
Unspaced

93
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,567
Orb

94
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,335
Orbital.

95
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,103
Debris

96
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:34,943
Cancer was studying what happens when one piece collides with another

97
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,223
This is what you

98
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,039
Every time you have a breakup you increase the

99
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,831
Probability of another Collision

100
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:46,463
And that eventually just causes the whole population to continue to increase exponentially with time

101
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,767
This idea that space junk multiply

102
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,839
Like as more and more objects Collide and break apart

103
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:54,143
Came to be known as The Kessler Center

104
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:57,215
Intestinal predicted that the growth in space junk

105
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,239
What eventually

106
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,007
Snowball

107
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:01,567
And that cascading phenomena after

108
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,847
100 years

109
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,127
Gets to be

110
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,407
Well out of control

111
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:07,199
There's not much you can do about it and give it

112
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,223
Created environment

113
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,783
Very hazardous to space

114
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,319
It's a growth

115
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,623
In space junk went totally unchecked

116
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,951
Tesla predicted that space could become so filled with the

117
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:18,719
Debris

118
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,999
It would be difficult to

119
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:22,303
The fly a spacecraft without getting hit

120
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,863
Kessler's findings were discussed

121
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,631
Throughout the speech

122
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:30,239
And in 1979 NASA started its orbital debris program

123
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,775
The study and monitor space

124
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,079
And they appointed him delete it

125
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:37,919
Around that same time people began to use face more and more

126
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:41,247
Countries all around the world were launching weather satellite

127
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,271
Military

128
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,063
Communication saddle

129
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,855
Amateur radio satellite

130
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:49,439
Because space isn't owned by anyone government in particular

131
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,975
Low earth orbit

132
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,535
Began to experience a tragedy of the commons

133
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:56,351
Lots of different countries were leaving trash

134
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,119
Everywhere

135
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,167
But no one was tidying up

136
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:03,519
The amount of junk in space continue to grow throughout the 20th

137
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,287
Mid-century

138
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,335
But it wasn't until 2009

139
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:08,127
Long after Donald Kessler ever

140
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,175
If people really started

141
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,199
Csuci

142
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:15,551
Communication satellites

143
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:18,111
800 kilometers

144
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:25,279
On February 10th 2009 the Iridium 33 + active us communication satellite

145
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:29,375
Struck a defunct Russian satellite called the Kosmos 2251

146
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:36,031
It was the first collision between two fully intact satellites and it created thousands of pieces of debris

147
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,591
Donald Kessler wasn't surprised

148
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:45,247
40 years prior get predicted the first major collision between whole satellites of the size

149
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,039
What happened around the new millennium

150
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:50,879
For most people the Collision May the problem of space junk

151
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,415
Feel much more urgent

152
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,231
Iridium Cosmos

153
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:55,999
Collision

154
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,047
Rudy was a wake-up call

155
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:02,655
Spark the new wave of research and funding even facts

156
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,423
Space debris

157
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,703
Matthew Lewis again

158
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:07,263
Lewis says that it's hard to estimate

159
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,311
The total amount of space debris out there

160
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:14,175
But scientists can track anything larger than 10 cm in diameter

161
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:17,503
You're talking about maybe a population of objects that are

162
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,295
Shuffle songs

163
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:23,647
About 30,000 objects in orbit at the moment everything from small fragments

164
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,927
What's 2 old rocket body

165
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:25,951
Two satellites

166
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:26,975
The size of a bus

167
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,791
And that's just the stuff that's large enough to track

168
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:32,095
There are potentially Millions

169
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,143
It's of millimeter size bits of

170
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:34,911
Debris

171
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:35,935
Shards of glass

172
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,959
Screws Flex

173
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,519
And even that tiny stuff

174
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,055
Can cause real problems

175
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,847
20 whipping around the Earth

176
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:45,407
Add up to 17 thousand miles

177
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,431
Per hour

178
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:50,527
Yeah the object does not need to be big in order to carry a lot of energy

179
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,879
Substantial amount of damage if it worth anything

180
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:58,975
The most vulnerable thing in orbital space is the International Space Station

181
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:05,119
Which routinely has to make Maneuvers to avoid collision with larger pieces of space debris

182
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:12,287
The International Space Station is also equipped with expensive heavy-duty shielding to protect it from smaller bits of space

183
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:17,919
Astronaut Tim Peake recently took a picture of a sizable divot in one of the space station windows

184
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:21,759
Repeats of debris penetrated several cm into the glass

185
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:26,879
Select the constant reminder for the astronauts on the space station every time I look at that window

186
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:29,439
Recognition of the

187
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,999
It is not just a threat to astronauts

188
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:36,351
So much about technology here on Earth is dependent on vulnerable satellites

189
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:40,703
Are pretty much everyone in the UK in the US

190
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:44,031
Smartphone with GPS

191
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,311
Capability on it

192
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,871
Master Services provided by spacecraft

193
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:51,199
My money think about navigation signals are they used for

194
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:54,271
Flying in the sky

195
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:59,903
Everywhere and I'll tell you lying I'm not just UNIF a convenience

196
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:03,743
International Telephone communication weather for

197
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,791
Keeping track of time

198
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,071
In different parts of the world

199
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,631
All of this it's dependent on satellite

200
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:14,495
Global banking systems full down if we lost signal from space

201
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:20,383
These risks are causing scientists around the world to look into how they can clean up this pace environment

202
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:24,991
Now when someone wants to put a new satellite into space there are viewing guide

203
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:27,295
If it say you have to come up with a plan

204
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:30,111
To dispose of that satellite within 25 years

205
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,439
There are a couple issues with these guidelines

206
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,463
1

207
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,511
You're not being followed by everyone

208
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:40,351
And two even if they were more closely here to

209
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,143
It might not be enough

210
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,423
To make space safe

211
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,263
Because there's already so much stuff up there and is Donald Kessler discovered

212
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,799
Space junk X

213
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:51,615
Even if we stop putting any more stuff up there

214
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:54,687
The number of pieces of junk will continue to grow

215
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:58,271
And then we start to think about okay how do we address the problem

216
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:01,855
Captcha bit more proactive we how do we deal with the stuff that's already up bad

217
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:06,975
All around the world Engineers are dreaming up ways to remove debris from space

218
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:11,327
In many cases by sending it down into Earth's atmosphere to burn up

219
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,375
Destroy objects

220
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,399
Harpoons

221
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:18,239
There are proposals for space-junk slingshot

222
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,775
Solar sails

223
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:20,799
Carry a piece

224
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,591
Junk out of a dangerous orbit

225
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:28,991
Robotic arms attaching a booty to the object to try and bring it down attaching solar blanket

226
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:34,879
No matter how you do it removing an object in space will be expensive and politically complicated

227
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:40,511
But right now the European Space Agency is planning a mission to remove one of its derelict satellites

228
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,815
And they're considering these kinds of ideas

229
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,839
That mission

230
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,375
Is scheduled to take place

231
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,655
In 2023

232
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,679
So we all

233
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:50,239
On the cusp of this type of activity

234
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,895
But even if we found the perfect technology to safely destroy all of the space junk in Earth orbit

235
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,943
Not everyone is on board

236
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,479
I completely agree with

237
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,527
This is a problem we need to do something about

238
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:05,599
I think the way that it's framed

239
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,391
Leave that a really vital

240
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:10,207
And that factor is human cultural heritage

241
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:14,047
That's Alice Gorman also known as Dr space junk

242
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,839
I'm a senior lecturer in the

243
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:16,863
Department of archaeology

244
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,399
When does University end

245
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,423
Baidu research

246
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,007
Particularly looking at space junk

247
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,287
In low earth orbit

248
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:27,871
For much of her career Alice Gorman Dr space junk

249
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:30,431
Researched Aboriginal culture in office

250
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,991
Australia professional archaeologists

251
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,015
How many years

252
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,551
And I was

253
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,111
Wishing on a consulting job in Queensland

254
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,391
And looked up at the

255
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,159
The sky

256
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,439
And

257
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,463
Realize

258
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,743
Just that some of those

259
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,023
Coin supplies

260
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,327
But not stars or planets

261
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,863
They were actually

262
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,167
Schubin manufactured spacecraft

263
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,959
And some of those bits

264
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,007
Was space junk

265
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,127
And that's kind of what I kill it just do we refocused on the stuff that people discovered the

266
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:02,943
Stuff that throw away the garbage of humanity

267
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:07,039
So while the rest of her colleagues continue digging in the dirt

268
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:09,087
Gorman turned her attention Skyward

269
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:12,159
And began to study the archaeology of space

270
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:18,047
Because I'm it's the scraps of floating debris are some really remarkable artifact

271
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:21,887
A lot of those things account Nicole space junk I actually caught

272
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,167
Stroller I object

273
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:25,983
I have so much to tell us about

274
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:28,031
The early history of the Space Age

275
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,311
I've got a lot of favorites

276
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,359
In low earth orbit Vanguard one

277
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,895
Is definitely one of the

278
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:35,967
Launch by the United States in 1958

279
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:39,295
Vanguard one is currently the oldest intact object

280
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,063
In space

281
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:43,391
Is little grapefruit-size

282
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,439
Aluminium sphere with

283
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,719
4 + 10

284
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,255
On the side

285
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,303
It's flooding around up there

286
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,351
Along with the most recent satellite

287
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,375
Along with

288
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:56,191
Yunnan technology that's so incredibly different

289
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:00,287
And there are objects in orbit that look nothing like a

290
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,311
Traditional saddle

291
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,103
Like the Westford needles

292
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:07,711
Which were these small copper antennas that were sent into space in the 1960s

293
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,735
I would really tiny

294
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,015
So they will only like

295
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,551
A centimeter

296
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,319
Big

297
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,367
May I do with styrofoam

298
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,135
I reflect

299
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,671
Did halo around the Earth

300
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,695
But radio signal

301
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:18,719
Could be bounced from

302
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:22,047
Using radio waves for Global Communication

303
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,071
Never really took off

304
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,119
But some of the needles

305
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:25,887
Are still up there

306
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:28,447
Bunched together in little clumps of

307
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:30,751
The copper I find them really

308
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,847
Probably a lot more as ice

309
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,127
Stories in Urdu

310
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:40,991
Tell a story of technology that could have gone in One Direction

311
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,783
But it paid off in another one in

312
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:45,343
Instead the Gordmans all-time favorite piece

313
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,135
Might be the track

314
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:51,487
Which the US Navy launch from Cape Canaveral in 19 6

315
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,023
And it was

316
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,047
The first

317
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,095
Satellite to have a poem

318
00:13:56,351 --> 00:14:00,703
Ennis written by professor of Italian literature at Yale named Thomas Bergen

319
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,495
And one stanza of the poem

320
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,287
Describe tile medallions

321
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,567
The panels inside

322
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,335
The satellite

323
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,127
So it's kind of already conceived

324
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,663
Give us a cultural object

325
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,967
And that cultural object

326
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:12,735
Is still up there

327
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:15,807
Orbiting the Earth about 1000 km

328
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,343
The poem reads

329
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,743
As we come to claim our promise place

330
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:33,215
All of these objects might seem far away

331
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:33,983
INXS

332
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,543
But the day will likely come

333
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,567
When we can go and visit

334
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,175
You can already get to the International Space Station for a cool 20 million dollars

335
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:44,479
Gorman says that one day we will be able to

336
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,759
Fly coach into space

337
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,039
It's quite likely that

338
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,063
You know what it's

339
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:52,671
Accessible and affordable things to do people will go into space and maybe set some fats

340
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,695
The Overton Hotel

341
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,743
And the two things we know

342
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,511
From

343
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:59,071
What's happened already that they will want to do

344
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,863
Is take a lot of photographs

345
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,399
And have sex

346
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:05,983
But after a while that's what's going to become old hat to

347
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:10,847
And what happens when zero g sex gets boring stores

348
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:11,871
That's what

349
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:12,639
You might have

350
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:18,783
Different kinds of toads as a satellite to you might say let's do the Cold War satellite

351
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,087
Or you might say

352
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:25,439
I'm not going to see all of the satellites it come from you. My nation space agency

353
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:27,743
So yeah I totally think this stuff

354
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,023
Is going to happen

355
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:32,607
It's going to be one of the things people to want

356
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,143
We actually have a space

357
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,935
Tourism industry

358
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,471
That people can afford

359
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:41,567
But the irony is in order to have viable space tourism

360
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,871
We need a safe orbital environment

361
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:48,991
And so if we don't find an effective way to clean up some of the junk in space

362
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,783
We might never be able

363
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:51,807
To go and see the good

364
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:54,111
It's kind of frightening it

365
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,647
In that much

366
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,415
Extreme version

367
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:59,999
Having you know ventured out to the moon and

368
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,023
Spacecraft

369
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,559
You know the Voyages

370
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:03,839
Beyond the solace
