23
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,120
I'm Roman Mars

24
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,032
Producer Katie mingle dad retired he began walking a lot

25
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:22,176
He's always been a walker but with all the new time on his hands his walking to Ghana Forrest Gump Ian

26
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:22,944
Fervor

27
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,296
He started doing these really long multi-day treks through the countryside

28
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:33,952
And even though he's American he mostly prefer to walk in the UK and backed over the course of several years

29
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,512
He walked the entire length of Great Britain

30
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:38,304
And I'm one of these many trips

31
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,840
In 2003

32
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:41,376
I was walking through

33
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,400
Beautiful

34
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:44,448
Rolling Hills and wooded

35
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,984
Area and their work

36
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:52,896
They were just literally hundreds and hundreds of pheasants and Grouse along this Trail and you'd Walk Alone

37
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:55,200
They would fly up in the air

38
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,480
That's my dad

39
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,504
Jim Mingle

40
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,296
I walked and walked and

41
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:04,160
It got later and later and I realized I couldn't get back to my

42
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,208
B&B where I was staying

43
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,000
So I decided I'd

44
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,280
I would hitchhike that

45
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:12,096
Hitchhiking is dangerous. But go on

46
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:14,144
I stuck out my thumb in

47
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,448
I pulled this Jeep

48
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,984
I hopped in

49
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,336
And there was this guy sitting there all dressed

50
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:28,736
In search of traditional Tweed outfit there was a funny cap and

51
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,272
There was a shotgun

52
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,320
On the rack in the back with you

53
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:34,368
Never ever saw

54
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,904
And Breton

55
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,952
And we got to talking and he

56
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:41,280
You said he was the gamekeeper for

57
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,584
Madonna and Guy Ritchie

58
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:47,168
My dad have been walking through Madonna's

59
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:50,752
State when he was picked up by her gamekeeper

60
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:53,568
Which is the thing a lot of wealthy landowners have in England

61
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,896
Person who manages the hunting activity on their land

62
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,200
Rates of this game keeper drove him back to

63
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:01,504
To the village where you staying and drop them off

64
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:06,112
I know his story doesn't end with him meeting Madonna

65
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,648
I wish you did too

66
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:12,256
And I asked about Madonna how he liked this game freak keeper like

67
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,792
Working for her and

68
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,144
He said he loved his job and he thought Madonna was too

69
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:18,912
Just wonderful

70
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,448
What's your favorite Madonna song

71
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,616
I just like the idea of put on I've got very good at remembering

72
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,432
Now that we've established that

73
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,736
Madonna is wonderful and my dad cat name is

74
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,016
Single one of her songs

75
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:35,808
You might be asking yourself

76
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:36,576
As I was

77
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:39,648
Dad what were you doing in Madonna's backyard

78
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:43,232
I was walking most of the time across

79
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:46,048
Private property I was walking from

80
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:52,192
One field to the next climbing over the fence where they are through a gate

81
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,472
And

82
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,032
I'm going on in this was

83
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:57,824
This was

84
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,592
Permitted

85
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:04,224
It's true my dad walked the length of Great Britain and was on private property a lot of the time

86
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:08,576
Which is different obviously than the way we do things in the US

87
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:12,672
If you wanted to walk across this country you'd have to do it on a combination of

88
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:17,536
Public trails and Roads and you certainly couldn't cut across Madonna's

89
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,303
Property

90
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,839
This right in Britain

91
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:23,167
To walk through private land is known colloquially as

92
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,447
The right to roam

93
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:27,775
In the movement to win this right was started in the 1930s

94
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:32,127
Buy a rebellious group of young people dressed in Army Surplus shorts and hiking

95
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:35,199
Curing cannabis rucksacks and canteens

96
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,479
They called themselves

97
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:37,759
Rambler

98
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,575
Rambler is one of those

99
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,623
Quaint Old English words

100
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,415
Time from really

101
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:47,231
But it means walking or hiking

102
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:47,999
In the country

103
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:51,839
Seaside this is Rollie Smith the rambler / journalist

104
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:54,911
To says his rambling forefathers and mothers were

105
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:58,495
Toiling away in the factories of 1930s mansion

106
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:02,079
Leicester Manchester was a very grimy town

107
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,871
A very

108
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,151
Dirty

109
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:07,711
Smokey a horrible environment

110
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,039
A product really of the Industrial Revolution

111
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:16,159
Outside Manchester it was one of the most beautiful parts of England an area known as

112
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,183
As the Peak District

113
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:23,839
So if you can imagine Factory workers in Manchester and Sheffield could actually see the

114
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:28,447
He's inviting boys from their homes and their workplaces

115
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,007
And they will until I have to walk on them

116
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,799
It hasn't always been this way

117
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:37,151
Hundreds of years and idea of the comments that existed in England

118
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,943
So the commons

119
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,967
They were

120
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,759
Integral part of

121
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,807
Medieval life for the ordinary

122
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,343
Villager in England

123
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:51,743
That's kind of Jonas author of this land is your land how we lost the right to roam and how to take it back

124
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,535
All the way

125
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,143
But the peasants

126
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:02,495
Statue in Rio rights on these common land

127
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,799
In this feudal system

128
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:07,103
Kings and Lords control of all the land

129
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:10,687
In the manner grew enough food to support itself and its tenants

130
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:17,343
The Peasants lived on the land sometimes without written leases but with assumed rights to use it in exchange for vert

131
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:18,879
Service

132
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:19,647
They could

133
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:23,743
Graze their cattle lumbar they could draw water they could

134
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:27,071
Collect could use it for a whole bunch of

135
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,095
Purposes

136
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,911
That began to change in the 1400s

137
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,471
When will Prices rose across Europe

138
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:39,615
Landowners wanted in on the profits and in order to graze sheep more efficiently they needed to fence off

139
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,663
And that's when we begin to

140
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,943
Asia.

141
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,991
Enclosure

142
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:49,343
Landowners clear the entire Villages of people

143
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,367
Making them homeless

144
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,975
Put up little stone walls and hedges to Mark the boundaries of their property

145
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,767
Accounting called works

146
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:00,863
61 Villages were wiped out before the year 1500

147
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:04,191
Over the years Parliament created more and more laws

148
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:07,519
How to keep people from using what was once common land

149
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,823
It all wrapped up in the 1700

150
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,103
There was

151
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:14,687
Nearly 4000 acts of parliament between

152
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,967
1760

153
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,247
M18 7

154
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,319
That's a sixth of England that went from

155
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,343
Common lab

156
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:22,623
2

157
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,647
Enclosed

158
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,415
Private

159
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,183
Property

160
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,999
Destroying people's livelihood sin

161
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,279
And way of life

162
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,863
People are so desperate to continue hunting on this once

163
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,887
Common land

164
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,703
But they came at night and covered their faces in

165
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,471
So it for x

166
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,495
Camouflage

167
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,799
They became known as the blacks

168
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:43,871
In 1723 parliament passed

169
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:44,639
The black Act

170
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,431
So this black Act

171
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,455
It created

172
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,479
50 offense

173
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,247
That were

174
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,527
Punishable by

175
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,343
For people who are accessing

176
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,111
Westland

177
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,903
Delete the death penalty

178
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,695
Trespassing was done away with

179
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,487
But the land remained closed

180
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:01,023
To the vast majority of

181
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:01,791
People

182
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:04,351
In the 1800s Britain industrialize

183
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,911
And people found themselves indoors

184
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,935
All day

185
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:10,751
And unable to find places for recreation

186
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,799
England did not have a national park

187
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:17,151
System at this time and the trails that people could access we're extremely Limited

188
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,223
People long to be in the Hills

189
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,295
They walked where they could and trespassed where they couldn't

190
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:26,623
They climbed over fences and tried to stay hidden from the game

191
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,391
Keepers

192
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,671
And all over England

193
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,207
So-called rambling Club

194
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,487
Started to form

195
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,279
The forest rapper

196
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,839
The Midlands Institute of Rambler

197
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,143
The Manchester rambling Club

198
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,191
Tons of bees

199
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:40,959
Walking group

200
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:44,287
In the late 1800s and early 1900s

201
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,847
Forming to fight for access

202
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,127
And walking right

203
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,175
They often times head

204
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:52,991
Socialist sensibilities but the heart

205
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,039
There was a lot of for walking

206
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,343
In a belief that it was their right

207
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:03,231
Access was no longer a matter of survival as it had been in the days when enclosure begin

208
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,023
It was about Recreation

209
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,095
And getting away from the polluted industrial cities

210
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:12,447
Which brings us back to polluted industrial 1930s mansion

211
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,239
Rambling Club

212
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,031
Call the British workers Sports

213
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:16,799
Federation

214
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:17,567
The British

215
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,335
Workers

216
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,615
Sports Federation

217
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,407
And in this group was it

218
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:24,479
Automatic Rambler named Benny Rothman

219
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,759
Stucky middle

220
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,295
A very Broad

221
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,087
Grand and great sense of humor

222
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,415
A man of the highest

223
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,439
Principles

224
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:38,303
But he was exceptionally short it was about five foot nothing is Wayside

225
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:41,375
Really actually got to know Benny later in life

226
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,935
He was a man who I very much look.

227
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,471
240 short

228
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:48,543
So one day back in 1932

229
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:52,895
A few people from Benny's group tried to take a walk in the Hills near Manchester

230
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:56,223
In that beautiful mountainous area near the city called the

231
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:56,991
Peak District

232
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,783
And I will chase store

233
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:01,343
Buy a group of game capers

234
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,903
And when they go back to their camp

235
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,183
Betty Ross

236
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,719
Osman and others

237
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:10,047
Set you know if there was enough of us I couldn't stop

238
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,607
So Benny and the other Ramblers came up with

239
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,375
What's an idea

240
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:16,959
Let's get a huge group together and walk on to this mountain called

241
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:17,983
Kinder Scout

242
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,007
Which was the biggest

243
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,591
And this Peak District it was called The Forbidden

244
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,639
Mountain in this area this was

245
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,919
Guarded by

246
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:26,943
A whole bunch of

247
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:27,967
Gamekeeper

248
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,247
Are these words

249
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,527
Intimidating

250
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:32,575
Telescope

251
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,879
Apps to identify trespassers from

252
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,951
They carry these big sticks or clubs

253
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,487
That they would sometimes use

254
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,767
Xiamen trespasser

255
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,607
The British workers Sports federation did not keep their plans

256
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,143
To trespass a secret

257
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:49,215
They gave an interview to the local paper saying

258
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,519
We feel we cannot any longer submit

259
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:56,383
Being deprived of the beauties of the countryside for the convenience of the landowners

260
00:10:56,895 --> 00:11:00,735
Wherever we claim we have a just-right to go we shall trespass in Mass

261
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:04,063
And Sunday will be the opening of our campaign

262
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:10,207
Not everyone was on board more conservative rambling groups in the area wrote editorials denouncing their plan

263
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:14,047
It would hurt the cause for expanded access to the country song

264
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:17,119
One editorial argued that trespassing was fine

265
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,911
It should be done alone

266
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,703
Or would just one or two people

267
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:21,727
Quietly

268
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:22,495
Neely

269
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,519
And successfully

270
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,567
The police were well aware of

271
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,847
The plans to trespass

272
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,919
The Kinder Scout and Benny rothman's role in all of it

273
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:33,759
And on the day of the event they tried to serve him with an injunction

274
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,039
Keep them from going

275
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,575
The police know he was coming

276
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,623
Mini arrive by

277
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,391
Bicycle

278
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,927
And they all expected him to

279
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,487
Hang out at the train station

280
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,791
Rothman makes it to the trespasser

281
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:46,559
Vines about

282
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,607
400 other people are there too

283
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:53,727
Mostly young people below the age of 21 a lot of men but some women too

284
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:54,495
They're wearing

285
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,287
Old army top

286
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:57,823
Multicolored

287
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:58,591
Sweaters

288
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,127
Khaki shorts

289
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:03,711
Warren work boots this is kind of the standard hiking

290
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,991
Garb of the day

291
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,783
For whatever reason they carry these

292
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,551
Enormous

293
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,575
Rucksack

294
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,367
They're considered like the thing

295
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,903
To do at the time

296
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,951
Lake often Wilburys

297
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:14,719
On the head

298
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:17,535
So is a very very Motley Crue

299
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,303
Pink

300
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:23,167
This Motley Crew of hikers gathered with their Berets and rucksacks at the base of the mountain

301
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,215
Anthony Rothman gave a speech

302
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:29,823
About taking back the rights they lost during the enclosure acts of the 17 and 18

303
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,359
Any emphasize

304
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:33,407
The trespass on Kinder Scout

305
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,943
Was meant to be peaceful

306
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,759
And with that the group set off up the mountain

307
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,807
The other thing they did was sing

308
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,879
They quite often sang when they went a trembling

309
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:46,975
And then they were singing songs like be internationally and

310
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:47,999
That sort of thing

311
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:50,047
About course

312
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,351
Show their political leanings

313
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,375
As well

314
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,655
Communist

315
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:59,263
The Ramblers were in a good mood to say hi

316
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,799
The saying and talk

317
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:06,943
There was some police behind them keeping an eye on things and having to keep up with the pace of the young walkers

318
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:10,783
At one point a group of gamekeepers approach them wagging their sticks

319
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,319
And a small scuffle into

320
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:16,671
One gamekeeper going to rolls over and hurt his ankle that's the extent of the

321
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,695
A scuffle

322
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,999
Eventually the Ramblers made their way back to

323
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:20,767
The bottom

324
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,047
The trespass have been

325
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:22,815
Success

326
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:27,167
They openly walked on Kinder Scout and no one has been able to stop them

327
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:29,983
And it probably all would have ended right there

328
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:33,055
With nothing much gained or lost on either side

329
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:39,455
If the police hadn't decided to make some arrests

330
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:44,575
Arrested at this time trespassing wasn't even an arrestable offense

331
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:49,439
So the police came up with another charge

332
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,463
Assembly

333
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,255
1 Rambler got off

334
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,791
But the rest were convicted

335
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,327
Prison Center

336
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,351
This is from

337
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,375
2 to 6 months

338
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:01,727
But when the sentences were handed down by the judge

339
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,799
But actually United the Rambler schools

340
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,359
And I also this was terrible you know

341
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,663
Just for walking on the moon with paper being sent

342
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:15,039
Suddenly there was this huge amount of awareness and the general public about walking rights

343
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,319
This was like

344
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,343
National

345
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,647
Item at the time

346
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,695
Sympathetic

347
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:23,999
Set in motion

348
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,023
Change

349
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,559
Transformers power England

350
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,095
Facts about private property

351
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,887
It's been described as

352
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:30,911
One of the most

353
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,191
Successful

354
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:34,495
Acts of civil disobedience

355
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,543
Ever in the history of this country

356
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,359
The whole thing is even memorialized in song

357
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:42,431
There was a guy on the trespass name Jimmy Miller

358
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:47,551
He eventually became a pretty well-known folk singer in England and changed his name to you and McCall

359
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,599
And you and wrote the song

360
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,135
Based on the mass trespass

361
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,671
School to Manchester Rambler

362
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:53,695
Another word

363
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:56,255
You're not going to ask me to sing it on you

364
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,279
Kayak

365
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,303
Yeah

366
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,327
I really want

367
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,399
I can sing the chorus

368
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,447
I think you should get a recording

369
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,215
Really

370
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:09,823
I'm a rambler I'm a rambler from Manchester

371
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,103
Stowaway

372
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:15,455
I can o my pleasure. Moreland way

373
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:19,551
I may be a wage slave on Monday

374
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:23,135
But I have my freedom on Sunday

375
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:23,903
I

376
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:28,255
The day

377
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,279
ESPN

378
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,327
For the trespasser

379
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,631
In this country and then

380
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,679
It'll be played at my funeral

381
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:41,823
Nothing

382
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,407
After the trespass

383
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:48,479
The rambling groups continue to push for expanded access

384
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,503
There are more tests

385
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:53,599
In 1951 when Britain opened its first national park

386
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:56,927
It was in the Peak District for the Kinder Scout trespass 2

387
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:57,695
Place

388
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,231
This was no accident

389
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,791
Years of negotiations between the Ramblers

390
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:05,375
And the landowners and legislators in the area and pave the way

391
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,679
But it wasn't until the year 2000

392
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:10,239
But the Ramblers got within always wanted

393
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,287
An act of Parliament that opened up

394
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,311
Huge swath

395
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,079
Country

396
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,615
Where people could roam free

397
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:18,943
The countryside and rights-of-way act

398
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,735
And that opened up

399
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:21,503
Mountain

400
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,271
More

401
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:26,623
Stars are just kind of fancy English words for

402
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,927
Unimproved grassland

403
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,207
And now

404
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:34,559
We do have the right to roam in Open Country which is what those lads

405
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:37,375
A1932 Worth Fighting For

406
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:45,567
The 2000 act opened up about 7% of the land in England and 21% in Wales

407
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:49,407
On which you are free to roam meaning you don't even have to stay in the trailer

408
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,687
You can truly just

409
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,223
Wander around

410
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,527
And 10% may not sound like a lot

411
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:58,111
Between that and other designated Trails where there are more worst

412
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:01,439
You can now pretty easily walk across England

413
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,231
Just like days.

414
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:04,767
Smallfoot

415
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,839
For my dad rambled across Madonna's

416
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:10,143
Property she actually sued to keep

417
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,191
People from wandering around out there

418
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:18,847
The government ended up allowing her to close off a lot of her estate but did keep some small amount of it open

419
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:19,871
Ramblers

420
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:23,199
Madonna wasn't the only person with concerns about Ramblers

421
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:26,271
When the countryside and rights-of-way Act passed

422
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,807
A lot of land owners

423
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:28,831
Fear the worst

424
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:31,135
You know everyone was worried about

425
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:35,487
People sniffing glue or the countryside in people

426
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:39,071
Tractors at work

427
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:42,655
Fornicating like this was all in the newspaper that people really worried but

428
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:43,935
None of that stuff

429
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:44,703
Turned out

430
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,471
To be

431
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,239
True

432
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:52,895
In addition to Britain a bunch of other European countries also have partial right to roam

433
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,663
Systems

434
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,015
Meaning some but not all private property is accessible to walkers

435
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:02,111
But then there are countries where the right is even further expanded

436
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,135
Norway

437
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:03,903
Finland

438
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:04,927
Sweden

439
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,463
Sweden has this thing called

440
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,231
Alamance

441
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,279
Which means every man

442
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,815
That's right and this means you can walk

443
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:14,655
Silver cowpasture this means you can walk through the woods to Spain

444
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:18,751
You can access virtually the whole

445
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:19,519
Countryside

446
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:23,103
In the United States we have a system of national and

447
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:23,871
State Park

448
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:27,199
But we don't have any rights to wonder through private

449
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:27,967
Property

450
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:29,247
And in some places

451
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,527
You might even get shot

452
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:34,367
The idea of opening up private land to the public

453
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,903
Seems almost on America

454
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,207
But this wasn't always the case

455
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,743
Yeah this is kind of like a

456
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,535
Forgotten chapter

457
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,815
Of American history

458
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,095
Americans

459
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:45,887
Sewer unenslaved

460
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,191
We have the right to roam

461
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,215
From

462
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,495
The colonial days

463
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,031
Up until the Civil War

464
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,823
In the early days of this country

465
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:58,943
It was common practice to hunt and fish on private land if it wasn't enclosed by a fence

466
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:02,015
In fact the Pennsylvania delegation to the Constitution

467
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:05,087
Even tried to get this enshrined in the Bill of Rights

468
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:05,855
That's how I

469
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,391
Important this was

470
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,183
The early Americans

471
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,719
Nearly a century later

472
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:13,535
In an 1862 essay entitled walking

473
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:17,375
Henry David Thoreau wrote that he feared that one day quote

474
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:19,935
Walking over the surface of Gonzo

475
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:24,031
Shall be construed to mean trespassing on some gentlemen's ground

476
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:27,615
The state may have come even sooner than throw fear

477
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:31,199
Kennel gouna says our concept of private property begin to

478
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,991
2 Chainz just a few years later

479
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:38,367
After the Civil War partly because of the end of slavery

480
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:42,719
This is the isn't Louisiana

481
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,743
Legislature

482
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:47,071
After the war they passed this resolution

483
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,887
Acknowledge the end of the war and they also do something else

484
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,167
Criminalize

485
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,191
Trespass

486
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:56,543
Now why would they do that right after the Civil War I think I know

487
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,383
They did that because now you had a whole bunch of

488
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:02,175
Free and independent

489
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:05,247
There were other reasons as well

490
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:08,319
As Native Americans were forced onto reservations

491
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:12,927
Land grants to the railroads and the Homestead Act of 1862

492
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:13,695
Turn gray

493
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:16,255
Swanson public land to private ownership

494
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,535
And then

495
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,815
Team Barb Wire

496
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,095
Fences became

497
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,119
A lot cheaper

498
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,679
So you could put fences up for livestock

499
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:25,727
Suddenly a whole bunch more the country

500
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,007
Isn't close

501
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:28,543
You haven't diverse

502
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,311
Certified

503
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,079
Economy

504
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:33,151
So people are no longer

505
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:33,919
For hunting

506
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:34,943
And fishing

507
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,223
And Gathering

508
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,015
As much as I used to so when

509
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:41,343
People start chipping away at access rights

510
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:42,623
You don't have

511
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,159
An impassioned

512
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:44,927
Group of

513
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:45,951
Proponent

514
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:49,279
Access ride

515
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:54,911
But kennel goodness thinks we should be fighting for recreational access in this country

516
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:59,519
Where a lot of our public land is concentrated in places that are hard for most

517
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,543
People to get to

518
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,591
For instance Alaska has

519
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:05,151
329 million Acres of Republican

520
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:08,223
That's 41% of all public

521
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,527
You look at the five states

522
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:12,319
With the highest percentages of public

523
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:13,343
That's Alaska

524
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,647
Nevada Utah Idaho

525
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,416
Wyoming

526
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:19,232
All this all this land is in

527
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,792
States where there aren't that many people

528
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:26,912
Guinness believes a right to roam system could help connect all these disparate pieces of

529
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:27,936
Public land

530
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,984
And give us a sense of ownership

531
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,776
I think if we bring in a system

532
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,312
Like the right to roam

533
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,640
You know we're still going to look at the land as if

534
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:37,408
It's someone

535
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:41,248
But I think we'll also begin to look at it as if it's

536
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,784
Sort of hours

537
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,112
And for what it's worth my dad agrees

538
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:47,904
He says there's something really special

539
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,952
About being able to walk wherever you want

540
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:53,024
I thought the whole concept of being

541
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,304
Able to

542
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:57,120
Walk respectfully across

543
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,400
Private land

544
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,168
Was

545
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:02,240
Extraordinary and it was something that

546
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,776
Just doesn't exist

547
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:07,616
We have a lot of public land where you can

548
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:09,408
Walk in the US but

549
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,944
The same very different

550
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:13,760
So many routes and trails

551
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:14,784
To choose from

552
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,624
Felt like the whole country was open

553
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,392
To you

554
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:26,304
These days if you ramble across the open grasslands of England or Wales

555
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,608
To see the remnants of enclosure

556
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,400
Stone walls and fences

557
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,936
And you also see

558
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:34,240
Things meant to help you get past these barriers

559
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:38,592
The Styles which are step ladders to help you get over fences

560
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:40,128
So called kissing Gates

561
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:42,176
What are v-shaped openings that

562
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,456
People can walk through

563
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,480
Livestock

564
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,248
Cannot

565
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,064
Because the fences aren't there to stop you anymore

566
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:49,856
You just hop over

567
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,904
And continue on your way

568
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:09,312
Some places go beyond a right to roam an offer free shelter

569
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,592
To a weary Rambler

570
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:11,872
We visit Bobby

571
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,152
Up next

572
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:20,064
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices

573
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,648
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

574
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:29,280
If I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexis

575
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:35,168
Is talking to me and my wife is in another room and another hearing.

576
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:36,960
Technology talk to us

577
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:39,264
It is a creation of Sonic trash

578
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:42,080
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

579
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:45,664
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

580
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,712
To make them more human

581
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,808
Turn the living room lights on

582
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,344
Okay

583
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:55,392
Dim the living room lights to 50

584
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,160
50%

585
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:57,952
Okay

586
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:04,352
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

587
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:07,168
Makes for a much more natural experience

588
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,216
Turn the living room lights on

589
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,800
Dim the living room lights to 50

590
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:14,080
2%

591
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:20,736
We're presenting to special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

592
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,272
About how are sounds gay

593
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,808
Is impacting our health

594
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:26,112
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

595
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:29,184
Look for them Fridays May 17th and May 24th

596
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:29,952
Right here

597
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,232
Npip

598
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,584
We need to talk about something

599
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,144
Constipation abdominal pain and bloating

600
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:44,544
You tell yourself it's not that bad you take laxatives modify your diet and exercise routine but thinking about it all the time is free

601
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:50,176
Frustrating but doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again

602
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,456
And you don't know why

603
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:53,760
Then it may be time to seek help

604
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:56,832
Go to oh my God. Info podcast

605
00:24:57,088 --> 00:25:01,952
We can learn more about your symptoms that's omigod. Info podcast

606
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,488
Oh my God. Info

607
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:09,632
After England and Wales began implementing their Countryside and rights-of-way act

608
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:10,656
Scotland

609
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,984
They decided to take things a step further

610
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,520
7 mm 3

611
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:17,824
They passed their own Land Reform Act

612
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,616
And it did a bunch of things but

613
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:20,896
First and foremost

614
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:23,712
It codified a long tradition of public Acts

615
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:26,528
Basically if people are respectful

616
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,064
Have other people and property

617
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:31,648
They can roam even more freely on private land up north

618
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:38,048
And it's part of a larger ethos about accessibility exemplified but he's a little building called body

619
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:41,120
Original phenomenon that Kurt Kolstad is here until

620
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:45,216
So historically Abbasi was typically a small cottage

621
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:46,240
For Farm Workers

622
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:50,080
But World depopulation led to a lot of these being abandoned

623
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:52,640
Two Travelers who saw they were empty

624
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:53,664
Started spending the night

625
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:57,248
To the first time I ever encountered the word bothy

626
00:25:57,504 --> 00:26:03,648
Was in Stirling Scotland and I ate at a place for lunch called but coffee body which I think is not these

627
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:10,048
Sort of things but it's kind of like us saying that I ate a Pizza Hut last night

628
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,120
Broader Association of these old

629
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:15,168
Old tall buildings on farmstead

630
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:19,520
But yeah it is now it's sort of grown to have this larger meaning of also these places

631
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:22,848
Hey I'm saying it

632
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:24,128
Delta probably don't you

633
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:29,504
So bodies can be found across the British Isles but especially in the Scottish Highlands

634
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,832
Father publicly-accessible most are still on private property

635
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,112
And the owners

636
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:38,720
Just let Ramblers sleep on their land and Buffy's that they own they do

637
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:43,072
Overtime a lot of these landowners who actually really embrace the tradition

638
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:45,376
Leaving building's unlocked and open for you

639
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:49,728
What is a community effort to their volunteers who help take care of and manage bothy

640
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,776
Please do the mountain bothy Association

641
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:53,056
Which is a Scottish charity

642
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:58,176
He's mostly As like small dark stone Cottages angled roof little chimneys

643
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:03,808
On rolling grassy Hillside says that's the image I'm going to complete that about right

644
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,744
There's actually pretty settings in the architecture

645
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,048
Summer Inland others fell on the beaches

646
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:17,120
Sonny's sweet things like post offices or schools

647
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:20,192
And there's this one out in the coastal Cliffs of Sky called

648
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:20,960
The lookout

649
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:23,008
That was actually built to be a coast

650
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:27,616
That has these big windows and he's a really awesome panoramic views

651
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:33,248
And it comes with binoculars Wildlife identification charts and this log book for people who want to watch

652
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,272
The Dolphins and the whale

653
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:37,088
There's No Reservations use ramble opinion

654
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:37,856
Stay in one of these

655
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,392
That's the idea

656
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,672
So you have to find them first

657
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:42,976
Wasn't always easy to do

658
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:45,792
For decades it was mainly a word of mouth system

659
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:47,840
And then a few years back

660
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:50,656
The mountain bothy Association started putting Maps app online

661
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,680
Making it easier for

662
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:52,704
People that point out there

663
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:55,776
Nature you get views

664
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:56,800
Free

665
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:59,104
Where do you sign up I mean that's pretty

666
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,200
Will you don't have the beauty of it but I should warn you

667
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:06,016
These can be pretty minimalist set times

668
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:11,392
Some have sleeping Platforms in stoves and little libraries things like that but they don't

669
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,416
Typically have

670
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:14,720
Running water or much insulation

671
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:18,304
It is a really impressive system and

672
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,120
A great way to repurpose old buildings that are not otherwise in use

673
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:23,680
And it works especially well in Scotland

674
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:26,752
We're really remote places can be accessed in part

675
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:28,288
Thanks to really permissive

676
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,056
Roman laws

677
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:32,640
How do I know I'm staying at a designated bothering on someone's land

678
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,664
Rather than just

679
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:35,968
Accidentally sleeping in their garden shed

680
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:37,760
You know I'm not

681
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:38,528
Sure

682
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:43,392
I didn't see anything about this when I was reading about them

683
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:49,792
Wonder Lake if you did just accidentally started right

684
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,328
That was sort of the origin of it

685
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:53,376
Is this A system that unique to Scotland

686
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,656
Not entirely

687
00:28:54,912 --> 00:29:00,288
The US and Canada Australia New Zealand and actually a lot of northern European countries

688
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,568
He's also have their own verse

689
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:05,152
That said in many places there even more rustic

690
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:09,248
And they're often owned and operated by government agencies and set up on public land

691
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:12,832
Right and we have a much more divided system he republic versus

692
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:13,600
Private land

693
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:15,392
And when it comes to private property

694
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:17,952
You really have to watch out for those no trespass

695
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:18,976
Driving signs and

696
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:20,000
Keep their warning

697
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:20,768
Exactly

698
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:24,864
While in Scotland people really can just go out and wander

699
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,656
In the truest sense of the word

700
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:29,728
And if they happen to come across a coffee along the way

701
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:30,752
They can just walk right

702
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:34,336
And listeners combine images of bodies as well as links

703
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:39,456

Series from below radiotopia show the truth

734
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,160
The body genius is a dark

735
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,184
Comic mystery

736
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,464

Might cost you your life

740
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:36,960
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

741
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:41,312
Or lose a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

742
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:44,640
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like

743
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:45,664
A dad

744
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,016
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

745
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:54,368
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that kind

746
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,392
Nothing

747
00:31:55,648 --> 00:32:01,792
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

748
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:05,120
Was found dead in my private gym

749
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:08,448
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

750
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:09,728
Even worse

751
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:12,800
The cops think that I had something to do with it

752
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,080
Now

753
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:16,128
I need to clear my name

754
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:22,528
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes to find them

755
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:30,464
