I'm Roman Mars

20
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,216
If you've ever wondered what

21
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:13,984
Squirrels

22
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,008
We're good for

23
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:16,544
Besides being adorable

24
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,336
Wonder no longer

25
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,872
These are

26
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:20,896
Lettering quills

27
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:27,552
Brushes I was talking about and they generally are squirrel hair that Scott Theisen from New Bohemia signs a world-famous

28
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:28,832
Hand-painted sign shop

29
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:29,856
In San Francisco

30
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,392
And have

31
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,952
Pretty long very thin handles

32
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:34,976
Petroleum

33
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:37,536
Or Das

34
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,888
Any movie made before 1980

35
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,960
Campaign signs everywhere

36
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:51,360
Would see like a certain type of an A or a certain type of an S being repeated and all the difference

37
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:53,408
Signage in certain neighborhoods

38
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,944
The first time for me

39
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,248
I realize there was actually a

40
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:59,296
Job that was a sign painter

41
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:05,952
It's not as common a job these days but sign painting is still thriving in According to some of the voices you'll meet today

42
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,744
Even undergoing a kind of Renaissance

43
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,280
But let's start

44
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,304
With a cartoon

45
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:15,424
Not just any cartoonist one of America's original underground cartoon

46
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,704
Justin Green

47
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,568
My comic book Frankie Brown beats the only Virgin Mary

48
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,408
That's my best known work and I did

49
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,688
Is a young man

50
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:29,504
I can't seem to shake a little faster

51
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,880
I got to see Justin speak last year at this fancy academic comic book conference in Chicago

52
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:37,696
And he gave me a book of his sign painting,

53
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,256
Reporting right there is our friend Benjamin Walker

54
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:44,608
The way Justin Green tells it is one night his wife asked him how he was going to pay the bills

55
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,632
And he said

56
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,656
I'm a cartoonist

57
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:48,448
And she said I know but

58
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:50,240
How are we going to pay the bills

59
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:53,824
But an artist entering the sign painters world

60
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,104
Had to tread

61
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,664
Carefully because to tell you the truth

62
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:58,944
Oman

63
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,480
Harbin sign colors

64
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,528
The word artist

65
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,552
Is 8

66
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,320
Pejorative

67
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:08,416
Mechanic is the term they use

68
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:12,000
Justin came up with an ingenious way to have it both ways

69
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:14,816
He threw himself into the world of sign painting

70
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:15,840
Frantically

71
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:19,424
Reading technical manuals written in the twenties

72
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,704
Work learning

73
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,728
On the job

74
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:26,336
Gathering tips from the Elder Statesman mechanic

75
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:29,408
Any documented all of his adventures in a comic strip

76
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,944
Called sign game

77
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:34,784
But the best thing about these trips is that Justin actually teaches us

78
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,808
How to book

79
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,600
An old hand-painted sign

80
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:42,464
I literally did that I mean I would stand in front of these old sunburned signs

81
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,256
Leica history Detective

82
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,584
And I would see how good the Craftsman

83
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,360
If someone was a fledgling or

84
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,384
A drunk

85
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,408
UC

86
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,176
Lawsuit

87
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:04,992
Brush work around the tricky parts

88
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,272
Like an oval

89
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:11,904
Play old-timer was done in about 4 Strokes amazingly

90
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,720
Although I can use

91
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,256
50 spokes too

92
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,280
Skin the ballpark

93
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,583
But at that point you're

94
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,351
You know you

95
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,399
You can't make a living

96
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,447
So you very quickly you learn

97
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:27,263
How to coordinate your eye in hand

98
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:33,663
Is mind-blowing to think about what was done by hand in comparison to let me know how things are done now

99
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:40,063
That's Faith Levine she just co-directed a movie about sign painters and also wrote a great book with a guy named

100
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:46,463
Making my name is face reveal

101
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,767
Justin Green to tell a story

102
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,047
About a group of people

103
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,583
Who used to be in charge

104
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:52,607
How are

105
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,679
Letter forms were

106
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:58,239
Ideal for a barbershop

107
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,543
And you're not for restaurant

108
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,079
Sometimes I think the most

109
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:10,271
Design signs are the ones that we don't even notice like a No Parking sign are the street sign that tells how to get away

110
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:14,623
And so you know we got a lot of really amazing stories about

111
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:21,535
People getting job lettering all the street signs for an entire city at back in the day

112
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,863
Stand-alone trade-in industry that employed

113
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,167
Thousands of people

114
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:30,239
That had a direct impact on or hand in

115
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,543
Define commercial landscape

116
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:36,383
All of the sign painter Sam and Faith introduced us to our unique

117
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:38,431
But as a group

118
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:41,503
A consistency to these unique individual

119
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,087
Their characters for like or as

120
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,111
Anyone

121
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,391
In the song for you

122
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,183
It's a little bit nuts

123
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:54,559
We got some wild stories many of the sign painters use their painting skills to crisscross the country

124
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,095
Bob Dorr says that

125
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:58,655
He could just show up in a town on a Greyhound bus

126
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,679
Sleep in a field

127
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,215
And the painting a sign

128
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,239
The next day

129
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,127
It seems you can't be a good sign painter

130
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,407
Unless you're also

131
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,175
A good Hustle

132
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:16,575
You got any business that opens you walk in and I'm going to make people come into your shop

133
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:22,463
Because I'm going to paint the sign that people are going to walk by stop look at income in the door because it looks so good

134
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:33,983
At the heart of the sign painter hustle is a promise that whatever you have me put paint on a wall of Sandwich Board

135
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,263
Side of your truck

136
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,055
It's going to make you

137
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,335
Us both

138
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:42,175
Look good you want to make sure that this truck stops traffic

139
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:46,527
But the thing is there was never just one guy doing the sign painter Hustle

140
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,575
Sign painting with competitive

141
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:51,903
It was very very hard to break into the business

142
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:58,303
It's like you couldn't get hired if you didn't have experience but didn't want to hire someone with experience cuz I didn't want them to take all the jobs

143
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:01,119
I really had the time to earn your stripes or talking about

144
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:04,191
A minimum of two years experience to even

145
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,727
Call yourself you know

146
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:12,383
Cuz I may not even that could be debated need to have the necessary knowledge

147
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,407
How to

148
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,199
Form the letters

149
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:21,343
Lay out the wording certain kinds of informational signs

150
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,391
Illuminator Foreman

151
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,671
Inappropriate

152
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,207
That knowledge needs to be disliked

153
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,487
So bacon

154
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:31,071
But you can then apply it hanging off the side of a building

155
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,095
In the winter

156
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,119
Painting class

157
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:36,191
It really is an arduous training

158
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,519
Physically

159
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:44,127
Ensign game strip Justin Green tries to help us understand

160
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:46,431
Why things used to be done a certain way

161
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:51,295
In one of his Comics he explains why sign painters didn't like to use the color yellow

162
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:54,111
He require double coating and Faded easily

163
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:57,695
But in every single one of Justin greens Comics you get a sense

164
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:01,535
That he is scrambling to document a world that is fading away

165
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,815
I feel compelled

166
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,607
2

167
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:10,495
Do the song game as a historical piece because I knew the world around me was

168
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,799
Overnight

169
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:16,127
Sign painting is by no means the only industry that was

170
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:18,431
Wiped out by digital technology

171
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:23,295
But still I can't help but feel extra sorry for these guys because they got their butts

172
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,831
Buy vinyl

173
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,879
Specifically the vinyl plotter

174
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:29,695
Which looks kind of like a big computer printer

175
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,487
The vinyl plotters are

176
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:35,583
Machines that would basically Tap Out vinyl letters

177
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:39,423
You wouldn't program in you know welcome and then it would

178
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,519
Punch out the vinyl letters indeed weed out the vinyl with a razor blade and

179
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:47,871
Welcome letter is onto the surface

180
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,407
Of your sign

181
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,711
1 vinyl first appeared

182
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,503
No one

183
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,599
And yet for all intensive purposes

184
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:00,671
It was even better than a hand-painted sign because

185
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,207
It was perfect

186
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,767
It was of the same color

187
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,327
It would weather better than paint

188
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:12,191
For letting us because Window Washers were enemies

189
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,215
Its deductible

190
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,263
The vinyl plotter with something

191
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,567
Sign painters really like to have

192
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,895
In theory it was considered like

193
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:25,503
Undermining your brothers in the trade

194
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,087
Slowly the guards

195
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:32,671
Stubbornly cling to their brushes would call them

196
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,463
The guys who have the machines

197
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,743
When they got the chance

198
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:39,071
I'm just going to do this one

199
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,887
First hundred words

200
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,447
Before long

201
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,239
Everybody bought into it

202
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:49,311
By the mid-1980s sign painters

203
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,359
We're no longer in charge

204
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,639
It's a very

205
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,407
Simple

206
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:54,687
Story

207
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,223
Technology

208
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,271
Lower the bar to entry

209
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:03,391
You got people that are necessarily the most like visual people sometimes going into like a Kinko's

210
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,207
These are the words

211
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:13,631
And those words are printed out in the thing they could qualify to sign and that's what goes up

212
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,447
Songs

213
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,287
Girlfriends

214
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,895
But all is not lost for the sign painters

215
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:31,807
New and old businesses who want to advertise quality and craftsmanship of the items and services inside the store

216
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:35,647
Wanted sign that embodies that quality and craftsmanship

217
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,927
On the outside

218
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,999
And back in San Francisco at New Bohemia

219
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:43,327
Scott Theisen says business is booming

220
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,351
Since the past

221
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,399
Three or four years have been a Resurgence of

222
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,983
Especially designers really appreciated hand-painted signage

223
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,031
You know the way the letters flow on the brush

224
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,055
You can

225
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,335
Do slight things to

226
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:59,455
They just having something that's Hands-On hopefully we'll always be appreciated

227
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,527
The pendulum always swings back

228
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,599
And unlike the Cutthroat days of a Hustle

229
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:09,695
New Bohemia now teaches sign painting classes that consistent

230
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,463
Play sell out

231
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:14,815
And we don't view it as Creighton competition reviewing it as

232
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:15,839
More people

233
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,375
See that

234
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:19,167
You know what happened at sign looks like

235
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,959
More likely someone's going to want it

236
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:25,567
Heather Hardison is one of the young painters who took up the craft a couple years ago

237
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,103
And is now a journeyman painter

238
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,127
The New Bohemia

239
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,687
Damon who's the owner always says

240
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:35,295
It's not perfect it just looks really good and that and that lends to

241
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,831
What makes it beautiful.

242
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,111
That little wobble is

243
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:38,879
Gorgeous

244
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:50,911

00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:54,751
Cities

248
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:55,519
And sign

249
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:56,799
How you say

250
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,103
Am I

251
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,383
Deep back

252
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,407
Observation

253
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:02,943
Blah blah blah

254
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:05,247
Sam Greenspan and me Roman Mars

255
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:11,647
It's a project of 91.7 local public radio kalw in San Francisco and the American Institute

256
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,439
Dude of Architects in San Francisco

257
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:20,607
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices

258
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:24,191
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man made sound

259
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,215
If

260
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:31,615
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife isn't

261
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,503
Technology talk to us

262
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,551
It is a creation of Sonic trash

263
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,623
That's Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

264
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:46,207
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

265
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:48,255
To make them more human

266
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:52,095
Turn the living room lights on

267
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:53,887
Okay

268
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,447
Dim the living room lights to 50%

269
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,495
Okay

270
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:04,639
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

271
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:07,711
Makes for a much more natural experience

272
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,503
Turn the living room lights on

273
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,855
Dim the living room lights to 50%

Before we go I want to tell you about the body genius a five-part series from Bello radiotopia show the truth

291
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,199
The body genius is a dark

292
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,223
Comic mystery

293
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:47,551
That whines through a treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

294
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,087
We're looking the part

296
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:55,999
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

297
00:14:56,255 --> 00:15:00,351
Or lose a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

298
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:04,703
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like a dad

299
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:09,055
I'm having I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

300
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:13,407
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that kind

301
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:19,807
I think a few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action

302
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,087
Movie called Immortal cop

Was found dead in my private gym crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

304
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:33,119
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it now

305
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,167
I need to clear my name

306
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:41,567
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes to find them

307
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:50,527
