69
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:57,408
But he's not from here these base their book is actually a spin-off

70
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,688
Of his previous work

71
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,992
Secret Stairs of Los Angeles

72
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,784
Which is where Charles lives

73
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,088
That's where Sam tracked him down

74
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:12,000
My name is Charles Fleming I'm the author of Secret Stairs a walking Guide to the historic staircases of Los Angeles

For the past few years

78
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,424
Charles has been leading Public tours

79
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,704

00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:32,480
About to embark on a stair walk it's actually scare walk number 41

82
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:36,320
From the book secret stairs and we will set forth here

83
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:42,720
Walk up the Coast Highway a little bit and then enter the historic castellum are a area of the Pacific Palisades which features

84
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:43,488
The number of

85
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,536
Striking public staircases

86
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:51,424
And we're off back before the tour is before the book

87
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,496
Before you really cared about public staircases at all

88
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:55,520
Charles

89
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:56,800
Just needed to walk

90
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:03,456
Now I got started with the stairs because I was trying to walk my way out of a surge

91
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:09,856
Surgery I had had two hip replacements and two spinal surgeries

92
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:16,256
Space of about 6 years and I was up for a third spinal surgery and I

93
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:22,655
Simply couldn't trace it and I knew what the surgery was going to be like and I knew what the rehab was going to be like

94
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,191
So I told the surgeon I'm not coming

95
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:30,847
Because I had found it a little bit of walking relieve the pain I was in so I started

96
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:37,247
Walking flat streets maybe two blocks at a time it was that hard to walk

97
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:43,647
Oh it was literally would have to have my wife put me in the car and drive me to a

98
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:50,047
Platt Street and help me out of the car and watch me walk two blocks pick me up and take me home that was

99
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:56,447
What's the first day and you know within a week I was walking three blocks and

100
00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:02,847
Within a month I was walking a half a mile and because it was working I kept going and when I got

101
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:09,247
Boardwalk in the flat I started walking the hills when I get bored walking the hills I started

102
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,807
Taking out the staircases

103
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:12,575
So

104
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,855
First point of his

105
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:14,623
Dora Kent

106
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,415
Charles knew a little about the

107
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,183
The staircases

108
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,231
15mm around Silver Lake where he lives

109
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:22,815
The staircases are generally either from the 1920s boom years

110
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:25,119
Or from the days of the works progress administration

111
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:29,727
They were built because developers in hilly areas needed to find a way for

112
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:30,751
Prospective homebuyers

113
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,799
To get down from their houses

114
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:33,823
School work

115
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,615
Church for a streetcar line

116
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,919
But the depression

117
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,455
And then World War

118
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,503
Halted staircase Construction

119
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:46,111
And after that in the car really became the dominant feature of the Los Angeles landscape

120
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:49,951
So staircases were necessary because they weren't trying to serve a pedestrian

121
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:53,023
Population anymore they were trying to serve a car population

122
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,327
So they stop building the staircases

123
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:59,423
Charles looks for an inventory of all the public staircases in the city

124
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,703
I can find one

125
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:07,103
So I decided I would map I think they were probably 15 of them and I would make that my my little Quest

126
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,895
Neighborhood

127
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:09,663
Silver Lake

128
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,687
50

129
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:18,111
And but I felt so much out there when I was done with that and I decided I would do Echo Park 2

130
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:24,511
I figured they were probably 10 or 12 of them over there will turn out there about 60 and Echo Park

131
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:28,351
But I felt so healthy when I finish that continue

132
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,143
Sir Charles kept extending his reach

133
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,679
Different parts of Los Angeles

134
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:38,079
Pacific Palisades where we are now in Santa Monica Hollywood and walking

135
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:44,223
Franklin Hill Washington Highland Park Happy Valley and Pasadena

136
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,527
By the end of it he recorded routes that use

137
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,063
400 public staircase

138
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:54,719
400 and change over 500 that I actually map but in terms of ones that I was able to turn

139
00:06:54,975 --> 00:07:01,119
Turn into practical walks 400 and something in the stairs and making all the routes to connect them

140
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,679
Charles Morgan 3 years

141
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:06,495
At first he just wander aimlessly through the neighborhood

142
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,031
Overtime

143
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,335
His approach began to get a little more sophisticated

144
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:14,431
Call Cindy was just looking for hilly areas where street cars used to run

145
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:20,831
And then I gradually figured out that if you found a curvy street a Lamppost

146
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:27,231
And a sewer line and a fire hydrant in the middle of a curve there was probably going to be published

147
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:30,559
Because if a city is going to retain ownership of a little

148
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,583
Slice of land

149
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:35,423
It's probably don't want to pack it with as many public utilities as possible

150
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,983
These little slices of land often snake

151
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,775
Greenhouses in yards

152
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,543
And that's one of the

153
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,823
Great things about the

154
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:42,847
Its 6

155
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:46,175
Exploring getting really close to someone's yard and house

156
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,711
Without actually trespass

157
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:51,295
But not everyone loves that these stairs are public

158
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,671
One set of stairs we came across

159
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,695
Buzz fence.

160
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:04,607
I'm not sure who put the gate up there it's another public staircase that was open to the public until quite recently

161
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:10,239
Is it at night sometimes the staircases can get used by people looking for a hidden place to do Shady business

162
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:14,079
I suppose it possible that could happen up here in the Pacific

163
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:14,847
Palisades

164
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,663
But but seems more likely at least in this case

165
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:20,735
Is it someone fenced off The Stairway to keep out the riff

166
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:28,159
The staircase is all go through residential districts and because they go quite narrowly between homes

167
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:30,463
There are a number of staircases

168
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:35,071
Around the city that have been closed by the residents

169
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:42,495
Against other residence without any permission from the city can they do that well they can't do it legally

170
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:45,567
Has managed to get some of these fences taken down

171
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,615
I'm meeting on congressman and City officials

172
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,663
Throw some use less

173
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,687
Bureaucratic

174
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:55,807
I know one fellow who just goes around with a bolt cutter and liberates the stairs

175
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,855
We couldn't confirm this but

176
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:01,439
I just love the thought of a guy going around in the dead of night

177
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,975
With a pair of bolt cutters

178
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,767
Liberating staircases

179
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,583
This is my kind of vigilante

180
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:22,175
Play idea of public access to the small spaces in between private property is in an oven

181
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:22,943
Self-compassion

182
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:25,503
As is the Allure of hidden.

183
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,783
Connecting neighborhoods

184
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,807
Art across the city

185
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,599
The part of the magic

186
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,623
Republic Airways

187
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:31,903
Is that you

188
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:35,231
Don't see Public Instruction devoted solely

189
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,511
Pedestrians all that much

190
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,839
They feel like going back in time

191
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,119
On your feet

192
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:41,887
Connectedu

193
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:42,911
To everything around

194
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:47,775
La is kind of a hard City to own I don't think people feel an intimate

195
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:51,871
Personal connection to it the way that they might if they grew up in Boston or London

196
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:56,223
And I think part of that is that you're in a car going past it so fast

197
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,527
Most of the city is just

198
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:04,159
The name of an off-ramp it's not you don't have any sense of who lives there or why they live there or

199
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:10,047
What would you like and when you slow down and move at pedestrian Pace it gives you the opportunity to get a little more connect

200
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:14,399
I think anybody would want that I make us human beings that's part of what is it

201
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,679
Why we live in cities

202
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,959
Why we live in community

203
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,799
If the streets are arteries

204
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,335
And the public walkway

205
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,615
Cesar the occasional

206
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,175
I can get so narrow

207
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,223
But only one red blood cell

208
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,503
Set a time

209
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,063
And when you encounter someone on the path

210
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,087
Air Force in Iraq

211
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,879
The step to the side

212
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,415
Maybe smile or not

213
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:41,535
Also it really feels like your trespass

214
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,583

Bongs and chatter of our devices

223
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:20,959
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man made sound

224
