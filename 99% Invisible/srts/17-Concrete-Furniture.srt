I'm Roman Mars

25
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:42,656
It's a big Majestic building on Nathan Phillips Square and this is my friend Sean Cole

26
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:44,192
In Toronto Ontario

27
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,728
New city hall

28
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:46,752
Its forms

29
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:50,336
Totally of concrete are these two towers that start

30
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,104
Curve like

31
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,896
Hands cupped around a

32
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:56,992
The clamshell to this was a big deal when it opened in 1965

33
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:57,760
The first

34
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:03,392
Modern concrete Civic building for Toronto inserted very prominently into the Victorian fabric

35
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:06,208
Master Cummins used to work in the city planning office in the east

36
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,744
Tower on floor 19

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,536
She's an architect building really

38
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,072
Explored and exploited

39
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,352
Possibilities

40
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:15,680
The concrete everything was about Concrete in Toronto back then

41
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,216
Play of a capacity versus

42
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,264
Transparency in everything

43
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,312
So that the furniture really picked up on that

44
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,592
Yes

45
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:25,664
Even the office furniture inside City Hall was made

46
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,432
In Paris

47
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,456
Of concrete

48
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,736
But let's back up

49
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,528
In the fifties

50
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,088
China decided that it needed a new city hall

51
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,904
So there was an International Conference

52
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,464
And in 58

53
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,232
There was

54
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:41,024
Define selected by finish

55
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,816
Architect Billy Oroville

56
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,608
But he wasn't satisfied with simply

57
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:48,192
Designing one of the most prominent buildings the city of ever seen

58
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,984
Know or go what you know

59
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:54,336
Proposed that he was also going to design the furniture he wanted to design the furniture

60
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:55,872
He had a vision

61
00:02:56,128 --> 00:03:00,480
But it wasn't to be the decision I made was to commission the furniture thrift second competition

62
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:04,064
Summerville was very disappointed

63
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,368
Set this appointment of his life and he subsequently passed away

64
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,672
City Hall El Paso

65
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:12,000
Or at least they felt the weight of the responsibility

66
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,536
So where the competition

67
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:19,936
To someone who really understood and capture the spirit of the building so they gave it to a company called

68
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:22,496
Any was the only design

69
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:23,776
Used concrete

70
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,312
Craft desks

71
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,592
Coffee tables cabinets

72
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:27,616
They all had

73
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,640
Concrete legs

74
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,944
The mayor's desk was this sleek

75
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,736
Concrete and Polished wood stain

76
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,016
And all of this

77
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,552
Was really expensive

78
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,088
And there was immediate

79
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,392
Public outcry

80
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:43,744
About the furniture particularly from the people who were actually using it there were

81
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,816
Complaints about the desks are wobbly and that

82
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:49,376
Secretaries typed on them they weren't sturdy

83
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:53,472
Put it through the legs are concrete how could it not be sturdy it's hard to imagine you

84
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:57,056
Toronto Star Furniture Rouse on again

85
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:59,872
In my research how many articles from that time

86
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:03,200
With all kinds of really interesting headlines

87
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:05,760
Wobbly deaths at City Hall spark new furniture

88
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:06,528
Controversy

89
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:10,112
Various officials at City Hall were fighting over at the receiving one

90
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:16,256
The talked about somebody quitting Rusty George Bell went out as coordinator today after a blazing row with bordick

91
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,791
Control over secretary

92
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:18,559
Desks

93
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,095
Sixties and

94
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,375
Hemlines were starting to

95
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:24,191
Shorter than the shield of the secretaries knees

96
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,983
And the new desktop no drawers

97
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,823
But magic Hellman's has sat at that furniture

98
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,103
Used to work at one of those

99
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,895
And it didn't wobble

100
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:37,247
When she said it's hard to imagine because some of the complaints make no sense to her

101
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,783
And she has a theory

102
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,319
Once

103
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,343
Quite uncomfortable

104
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,367
People to

105
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,159
Internalized but this is really what the heck

106
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:44,927
Chosen

107
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:51,583
And perhaps there was a kind of anxiety about this new modernism in this new concrete that we were inserting into our traditional

108
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,351
So

109
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:55,679
Perhaps the furniture which was kind kind of mimetic

110
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,703
Of the building

111
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,727
Mimetic

112
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:08,223
Relating to characteristic of or exhibiting mimicry okay so perhaps the furniture which was mimetic of the building

113
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,247
Served as an outlet

114
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,527
For that anxiety

115
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,087
And perhaps this is why

116
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,367
The controversy

117
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,135
Didn't seem to me

118
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:15,903
How much time

119
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,535
Later of the complaint was that it was

120
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:25,375
Difficult to move and so on so of course you know actually holding on to update itself

121
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,655
Over the years

122
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:27,935
The furniture

123
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,727
Since it was not valued

124
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:35,103
It was it was lost just simply three replacement it was it was actually thrown away

125
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,151
But not all of it

126
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,431
It's kind of like a

127
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,455
A haunted house

128
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,247
Looking for them

129
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,271
They are here

130
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:46,623
In the late 80s the city's director of Urban Design at the time saw what was happening

131
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,903
This is a very subtle one

132
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,463
And put the word out to the rest of City Hall

133
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,535
If you replacing your concrete Furniture he said send it up

134
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,559
The 419

135
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:55,583
We like it

136
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,863
Which is why today

137
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,167
Whatever does were mean

138
00:05:59,423 --> 00:05:59,935
Is

139
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:02,751
Still have wisdom in the Urban Design offices which are within the sea

140
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:06,591
City Planning Department there's a bit of it scattered elsewhere to the mayor still sets

141
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,359
Concrete desk

142
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,383
But mostly

143
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:11,455
Floor 19 is the Florida of retired Concord

144
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:14,015
Free furniture notice the concrete unless you really

145
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,295
Squat down

146
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:19,903
The concrete legs are curved and smooth the Cabinetry is a little worse for wear

147
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:20,927
It's kind of

148
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,487
Furniture only an urban designer could love

149
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:27,071
People like Robert Friedman who runs the urban planning office now

150
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,119
Is there a certain aspects of it that aren't that bad

151
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,935
What's really heavy if you want to rearrange your office

152
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:32,703
Call it

153
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,495
Tema people in to help you do it

154
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,799
And I think most of the Planters Inn

155
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:39,615
Urban designers Retin-A 19 at 7

156
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,895
Are you training right lyrics

157
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:41,663
Opposed to the

158
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,199
Different eras of design

159
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,271
On our staff that me.

160
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,831
Divisions in the city

161
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,111
This plant look at this pain

162
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,391
Do I have to say

163
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,927
The furniture really grew on me

164
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:53,951
Wow

165
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:57,023
That is actually very pretty

166
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,815
Rooting for its survival

167
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:01,119
Which is exactly what magic Cummins wants me to do

168
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,143
So the hope

169
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,167
Is that

170
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,447
Its actual value

171
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:07,519
As a rather important piece of uniquely Canadian

172
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,311
Furniture Design will be Rec

173
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:13,919
Organized and that that it will receive the the restoration and then

174
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:14,687
Ducks Unlimited

175
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,479
Do you miss it

176
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,063
No

177
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,207
This episode of 99% invisible was produced by Sean Cole and me Roman Mars

178
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:29,535
With support from the lunar making a difference with creativity

179
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:33,631
I think life is much bigger than my old office desk

180
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:40,287
It's a project of kalw the American Institute of Architects San Francisco and the center for architecture

181
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,055
Grand Design

182
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,407
A nice desk though

183
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,175
Agreed
