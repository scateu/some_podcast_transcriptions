I'm Roman Mars

30
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,416
In the beginning

31
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:33,952
There was design

32
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:37,280
At least according to the designer and author will live well

33
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:39,840
Design is the oldest human discipline

34
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,400
Older than Humanity itself

35
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,192
And will believe

36
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,728
But in this oldest

37
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,264
Of all the disciplines

38
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,568
Everything ever designed

39
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,592
Spaceships

00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,360
Building

00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:53,408
Pyramids weapons clothing artwork

42
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,432
Everything

43
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:57,248
Can be traced back to a single designed object

44
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,040
Design.

45
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,088
This is as close

46
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,880
To a Genesis object

47
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,416
Ask me that

48
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:06,464
I need this is where it all began

49
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:10,048
Set design had its own Cosmos series

50
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,840
This would be episode 1

51
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:12,608
I think

52
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,632
This is

53
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:14,656
The greatest

54
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,680
Grandis

55
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,472
Like most interesting story

56
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,496
In the field of design

57
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,056
It has it all

58
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:23,104
Mystery intrigue

59
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,128
Controversy

60
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:26,432
We are on the edge of our seats well

61
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,480
Wait for it I need like that the drum roll

62
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,088
The first designed object

63
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,136
Was the issue in hand.

64
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,560
The Australian hand-axe ladies and gentlemen

65
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,608
Actually it doesn't look like an accident

66
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,632
There's no handle

67
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,656
The new metal

68
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:48,960
Honestly it should be called the issue lien

69
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,008
Hand Rock

70
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:53,824
Zantac

71
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:56,640
Is made a rock and its teardrop-shaped

72
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:59,456
And if you join your hands together is it

73
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:03,808
Despres fingers together this is almost the exact shape

74
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:04,576
Incise

75
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:08,672
The term Australian refers to where the first

76
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:11,232
Specimens were found which was a dig site

77
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,024
Instinct actual France

78
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,584
But they've been found in a lot of other places

79
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,632
Define the issue lien tools

80
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:20,704
Are found almost exclusively in Africa

81
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,776
In Europe in South Asia

82
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,336
I'm Terrence Deacon and professor

83
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,128
Of biological anthropology

84
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,176
At the University of California Berkeley

85
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:33,504
Berkeley has a whole bunch of samples of these Hannah

86
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,088
Another hand axe

87
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,904
You can see that it's not quite so symmetric and

88
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,696
Nice little sharpest Edge

89
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:45,024
Summer sharp all along the entire perimeter sum art

90
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,840
Summer perfectly symmetrical and summer not

91
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:53,728
But those hand axes in the UC Berkeley basement aren't actual primordial hand axes

92
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,032
These are replicas made by gradle

93
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,312
Current students

94
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:00,384
There have been courses here in which

95
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,944
One of the challenges is to make tools

96
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,992
In the point of this challenge for the graduates to

97
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:09,856
It's a see how involved this process is and making one of these pointy rocks

98
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,648
The way the early humans would

99
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,440
You break off big pieces

100
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,208
With large

101
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,000
Rocks in large strike

102
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,303
When you break off these little edges

103
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,071
To Shake The Edge

104
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,119
Smaller pieces

105
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:28,031
I just love the image of a bunch of grad students sitting around smashing run together and sometimes I have to do it for a while

106
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:30,079
Someone weekly practice at it can make

107
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:36,223
Hi-end accents something like 15 minutes to half hour to make a really fine tool

108
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,783
Probably talking about

109
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,087
Asurion and access

110
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:43,903
Required time effort and skill to make

111
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,719
They were a product of a design process

112
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,487
The first

113
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,767
Design process

114
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:51,583
The ensuing hand-axe was not the first

115
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,375
Tool the first

116
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,935
Basically a rock that is

117
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:58,495
Chips with just a handful of

118
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:05,151
Major strikes to produce a few sharp edges not very sophisticated tools

119
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,943
All these old lawn tools

120
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,247
Are Homo habilis ancestors use them to

121
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,855
Ash open bones and scrape me off of them around 2 million years ago

122
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,647
Do this kind of technique

123
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,671
Isn't unique

124
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,439
The humans

125
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,231
This can be done

126
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:22,303
Even by South American monkeys the capuchin monkeys

127
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,607
Get these large

128
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,631
Pine nuts

129
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,423
And they have Hammerstone

130
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,959
The bacon men

131
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,775
List append Bash these things until they open them

132
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,311
What they want to achieve

133
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,079
Buffet

134
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,383
I actually simply go out and select something

135
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,151
Helicopter

136
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,199
Rather than actually design something

137
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:42,015
Chimpanzees in examples stripping

138
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:44,319
Believes in the side branches off a little princess

139
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,087
They can stick it down

140
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,391
A termite nest and get the termites to buy it

141
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,695
I asked they can eat the termites that way

142
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,487
So this requires cunning

143
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,279
Yes but crafts

144
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,815
Not really

145
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:57,887
So early humans understood the importance of oldowan tools

146
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:58,911
So sharp Rock

147
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:03,263
And they realize that they could fashion more precise tools by sharpening rocks

148
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,031
Purposefully

149
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:06,335
So it's not just adventitious products

150
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,871
China's planned production

151
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:11,199
Spandex he's the first designed object

152
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,223
At least we can find

153
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:16,831
If there were any wooden tools that are human like ancestors made

154
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,623
Those have long since to centigrade

155
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,671
But even if there are other example

156
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:23,231
Hand axes are really significant

157
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:26,303
With issuing a hand actually issue lien

158
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,071
Technology

159
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:27,839
Showing up

160
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:30,143
We suddenly now fine people

161
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:33,983
Making people I say they're their ancestors making tools

162
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:37,823
With an end in mind and making them in advance

163
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,871
They almost certainly have to carry them with them

164
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:43,455
They don't just make them on the spot there they take time to make them they take

165
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,479
Thought to make them

166
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,015
And you're shaping them

167
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,551
Towards a particular shape

168
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,087
For some particular use

169
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,367
Which we today don't

170
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:51,903
We don't know

171
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:52,671
We don't

172
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,951
Know how they were used

173
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:56,767
That's the crazy mystery here so

174
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,815
This is where we get into the entry

175
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,351
That will live well again

176
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,655
Dirt their ideas right so smart people.

177
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:05,471
Are working on the problem and in there are like

178
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,239
3

179
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,007
Theories

180
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:13,151
There are more than free if you want me to talk about more theories I can talk about more theories but I'll stop at 3 unless you tell me otherwise

181
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,431
Will ledwell has

182
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,711
3 favorite

183
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,247
As to why the hand-axe.

184
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,295
Theory number one

185
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,343
Right of the powers uses the multi-tool

186
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:25,439
Set theory number one is that the SLI hand-axe

187
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,231
Was the original Swiss Army knife

188
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:29,535
Primarily used for butchering me

189
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:33,887
But it's also good for breaking up in knots and digging up grubs or whatever else he might be

190
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,679
And so the strength

191
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,959
Of this Theory

192
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:40,799
Is it fits with where patterns do you see on a lot of the hand axes that are found

193
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:43,103
Here's the problem with Theory number one

194
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:47,967
In some cases the full perimeter of the axe is sharp and remember this is a hand axe

195
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,247
Holding

196
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,015
Palm of your hand

197
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,319
So if you wanted to use it

198
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:55,135
There be this sharp blade digging into your palm

199
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,671
Another problem with everyone

200
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,719
Is that some of the axes are symmetra

201
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:01,023
Which is a lot of extra effort

202
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:05,119
That isn't really necessary if you're just using it to break up nuts or cut meat

203
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:08,191
And so to address some of those problems

204
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,727
We get into Theory number two

205
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,775
Nothing this is my personal favorite

206
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,079
The sexy handbags

207
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,127
The current quote

208
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:18,175
Sexy handaxe Theory

209
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:21,247
Proposes that these tools didn't have I used

210
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,015
Per se

211
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,831
They were created mostly as a way of showing off

212
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,367
Like the feathers of a peacock

213
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:29,183
The goal wasn't to create a functional tool

214
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:29,951
Butchering

215
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,743
Are symbolic tool

216
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:32,511
For me to track

217
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,351
And making these things is really really hard

218
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,911
Why spend so much time doing it

219
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,447
Unless you're showing off

220
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,007
Raintree showing the opposite sex what you can do

221
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:48,639
But there are a lot of experts were doubtful of this one including Anthropologist Terrence deacon

222
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,919
Not all of them are beautiful

223
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,687
Teardrop shape

224
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:53,759
They weren't all that nice and neat and symmetric

225
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,319
There is one interesting except

226
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,343
I mean one

227
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:03,999
One beautiful 350000 year old exception

228
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,279
Bottom of a kind of whale

229
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,559
In southern Spain

230
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,863
It looks as though

231
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:12,447
Bodies were tossed down here and one of these it found in this

232
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,983
This whale so to speak

233
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:14,751
Make it just up

234
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:15,519
Cave well

235
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,591
Is a hand axe was made of

236
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,383
A kind of

237
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,175
Rose quartz looking Stone

238
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,455
Really pretty

239
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:25,759
It doesn't look like it was ever used

240
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:28,319
I'm not a sexy hand axe

241
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:31,391
But this may be the first indications that they're beginning

242
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,159
To sort of

243
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,975
Grieve over the death of someone

244
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:37,535
What if there is some kind of ritual issue here

245
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,815
Wichita beautiful

246
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:39,583
Hand axe

247
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,863
It's about playing a role

248
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:41,631
Okay

249
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,423
The world's third favorite Theory

250
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,703
It's still a really fun one

251
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,239
Number three is pretty fun

252
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:51,615
Number 3 in in a closed follow onto my favorite too sexy hand-axes the killer frisbee

253
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:55,199
And so in the killer frisbee Theory

254
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:57,759
Right hand axes were made to be

255
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,527
Projectiles

256
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,319
The throne in the passionate

257
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,855
Discus in the Olympics

258
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:04,415
A lot of hand axes are found near Riverbank

259
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:09,023
Hunters would wait for herds of animals to come and then

260
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,327
They wouldn't taxes

261
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,887
This might not be enough to make a Kill

262
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:17,727
But the stones would name a few and give the hunter is an opportunity to charge

263
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,287
This hypothesis right explains

264
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:24,895
Why it looks the way it does right by the hand axes sharp all the way around

265
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:28,223
Wyatt so symmetrical Wyatt so aerodynamic

266
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,015
William not all of them are

267
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:32,319
Sharp all the way around and perfectly symmetrical

268
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:35,135
He was like a frisbee was use like a weapon

269
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:37,951
I really have my doubts about that

270
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,999
I like the Swiss Army knife

271
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:44,095
In part because it looks like it's a one tool fits all

272
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,399
It was clearly something that we see

273
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:49,471
Again and again and again and again all over

274
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,495
Other world

275
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,543
That means it was very effective

276
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:57,151
And if you don't find a lot of diversity of tools it was almost certainly use for more than one thing

277
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:01,247
But whatever the hand axe was used for it must have been a really good job because

278
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:05,855
This basic design was used for a mind-blowing Lee long time

279
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,135
Xiamen adult

280
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,951
We're literally teaching hominy children

281
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:13,023
How to make hand axes for more than a million years

282
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,839
Passing the knowledge down from generation to generation

283
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:19,423
Until you compare that to any modern product life cycle

284
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,959
Write it just crazy long

285
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:26,591
So long that our human mind can barely wrap our heads around it

286
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:30,943
Understanding of history is only what may be five thousand ten thousand years

287
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:33,247
That's our biggest understanding of History

288
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:35,295
Sonia stayed the same

289
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,575
Culture that was constant

290
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,855
For a million years

291
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,135
That's pretty remarkable

292
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:42,463
And no matter what the issue in hand axe was actually used for

293
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:46,815
Just the mere existence of a designed object that is so old

294
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,607
Has huge implications

295
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:52,447
I often have students or colleagues think that designs a new field

296
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,495
Like a 20th century invention

297
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,775
When in fact

298
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:56,543
It's the most

299
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,311
Ancient

300
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,103
A ball academic

301
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:02,687
Before there was mathematics or engineering or science

302
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,223
Where art or music

303
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:04,991
Her poetry

304
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:08,319
Before this philosophy literature religion or

305
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,599
Or even language

306
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,647
There was design

307
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:24,703
99% invisible is produced by the crackerjack team of Avery trufelman Katie mingle the same Greenspan and me Roman Mars

308
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:29,055
Whether you're building websites for doing industrial design architecture

309
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,847
To have that sense of History

310
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,663
I have those routes to music

311
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:41,599
Special things to will live well for bring the whole hand axe story to us Wills book Universal principles of design is one of my

312
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:44,415
To go to recommendations for books about the sign

313
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,207
Insightful

314
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:51,583
Quick-hit Encyclopedia of all kinds of design principles I consulted all the time but highly recommended

315
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:58,239
We are project 91.7 local public radio kalw in San Francisco and produced at the offices of Arc

316
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:02,079
An Architecture Firm in beautiful Downtown Oakland California

317
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,943
Between the beats

318
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:09,247
Bongs and Charter of our devices

319
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:12,831
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

320
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:13,855
If

321
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:18,463
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexis

322
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:24,351
Talking to me and my wife is in another room in a kid is another remembrall hearing that voice

323
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,143
Technology talk to us

324
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:28,191
It is a creation of Sonic trap

325
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,263
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

326
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,847
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

327
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,895
To make them more human

328
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,735
Turn the living room lights on

329
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:42,527
Okay

330
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,575
Dim the living room lights to 50

331
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,343
80%

332
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,135
Okay

333
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:53,535
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

334
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,351
Makes for a much more natural experience

335
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,399
Turn the living room lights on

336
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:02,495
Dim the living room lights to 50%

337
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:09,919

Constipation abdominal pain and bloating
