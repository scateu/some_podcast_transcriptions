This is 99% invisible

I'm Roman Mars

Let me take you back

27
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,336
Back to a simpler time

28
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,360
The year

29
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:20,384
2016

30
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,408
What is this

31
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,712
So this is recycle Central

32
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:24,992
To stay large

33
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:29,088
A recycling plant where we sort all the materials from the blue band the bottle

34
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,368
Cans with paper

35
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:37,280
In 2016 producer Avery trufelman was working on a story about garbage and recycling pickup systems its episode

36
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,304
213

37
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,096
But don't worry this is not a rerun

38
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,376
The story is different

39
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:45,472
Back then to that story in 2016 I took a tour of the plant

40
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:48,032
That's sort all of San Francisco's recycling

41
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:50,336
We do 600 tons a day here

42
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:54,176
That's Robert Reed the representative for San Francisco Recology

43
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:57,760
Which is the company that is responsible for San Francisco's recycling

44
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:01,088
Their trucks Roundup all the recycling around the city

45
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:01,856
And bring it

46
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,136
To immerse

47
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,160
Murph

48
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:04,928
Mrf

49
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,976
Materials recovery facility

50
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,256
At the Murph

51
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:11,328
The trucks dump all their cycling into a big mountain

52
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,632
And then the wild park again

53
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,960
This particular Murph in San Francisco

54
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:21,312
Has all this elaborate Machinery that looks like it's out of a Miyazaki movie

55
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:24,128
UCI recycling superstructure

56
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,664
Three stories high

57
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,944
Pretty shortly

58
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:30,272
The conveyor belt to start up or going to sort all this

59
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:33,088
Material here in the 16 different types of material

60
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:39,232
This three-story tall superstructure and the 173 people that were working on it

61
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,256
We're separating

62
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,280
Cleaning the recycling

63
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,328
Starting at the glass paper plastic

64
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,376
Separate

65
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,424
Is there a combination of

66
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:50,752
Hand sorting and Modern Recycling equipment

67
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:53,312
Modern Recycling equipment like

68
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:57,408
The optical sorter that can automatically separate different color plastic

69
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,688
Right here

70
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:03,808
The scanners looking at the materials as they come by and when it sees a

71
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:06,368
Clear plastic like a clear plastic water bottle

72
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:08,160
Hitler was a puff of air

73
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,440
Can you can hear it

74
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:21,216
Spencer the first 3 million dollars for this machine and it came from the Netherlands

75
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,520
And at the time

76
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:26,848
In 2016 when I was younger and things were simpler

77
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,384
I'm quite grasp

78
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,664
The simple fact

79
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,016
Actually recycling anyting

80
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:38,112
Do not turning the paper into pulp or melting down the plastic and appellate

81
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,904
The Murph workout

82
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,440
Simply sorting and

83
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,976
Cleaning all the materials

84
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,512
They were loading bales

85
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:46,560
Clean recycling onto shipping container

86
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:51,168
So they could sell them to millswood then pulp the paper and melt the plastic

87
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,216
And I was just like okay cool

88
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,008
And left well enough alone

89
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:59,104
I just figured all those Mills and plants would always be there

90
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,128
Wherever they were

91
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,920
Waiting to accept our stuff

92
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,968
How could I have known

93
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,248
But in the near future

94
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:07,296
This Global Recycling system

95
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,832
Would go off the rails

96
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:11,136
It happened right under our noses

97
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,416
And most people

98
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,208
Macleamy don't marry recently

99
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,744
Had no idea

100
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,327
The industry has been using the phrase the end of recycling as we know it

101
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:25,471
Kate O'Neill is an associate professor in the department of environmental science policy and management at UC Berkeley

102
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,263
And she kinda freaked me out

103
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:30,335
Yeah you know I would say for a lot of

104
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:33,407
Stuff that we turn to the recycling it's not happening

105
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:36,223
A lot of recycling is no longer

106
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,271
Actually getting recycled

107
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:41,855
The list of accepted materials are shrinking in some cities

108
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:48,511
Depending on where you live certain types of plastic are being collected anymore maybe certain kinds of paper or cardboard

109
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,047
In many communities

110
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:52,351
Barack Obama sister picking up recycling

111
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:55,423
Does in the general trash

112
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,215
Even if they do collect it

113
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,775
Without a hard time finding places to ship it

114
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:04,895
Instead of making money selling recycling recycling companies are losing money on it

115
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:07,711
Now that someone take it

116
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:12,575
Skip the store it yes because they lost their biggest buyer

117
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:18,975
The place America and much of Australia and Europe in Canada huge amount

118
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:19,743
Cycling

119
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:26,143
This magical land where your empty plastic bottles in Old Soup cans went to be reincarnated

120
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,935
Was China

121
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,471
They will taking most of the wealth

122
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:33,055
China has been taking most of the world scrap since about

123
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:36,639
2001 which is around the time China joined the World Trade Organization

124
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:40,223
That's only really ramped up selling Goods all over the world

125
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,015
In massive shipping containers

126
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,039
And

127
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:45,343
Rather than send the containers back empty

128
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,879
We sent them back

129
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:47,647
Filled with

130
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,415
Recycling

131
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,719
Which was actually really cost-effective

132
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,255
What's cheaper to ship

133
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:56,607
Trip from California to China than California to even Arizona potentially

134
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,655
And the system seemed to work well

135
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:01,983
Cities could subsidize their recycling pickup program

136
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,519
From the money they made

137
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,311
Selling these materials to China

138
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,639
And then they didn't need to process the materials themselves

139
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,175
Capitalism at work

140
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,991
We basically assholes we gave up on even trying to

141
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,551
Improve infrastructure here because witches

142
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,319
China

143
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,111
And it seemed like a logical

144
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,951
As long as China kept wanting to buy a recycle

145
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:24,255
But then

146
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:27,839
China pulled a move that no one saw coming

147
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,399
Operation National

148
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,423
Sword

149
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:35,007
A pretty aggressive name for a piece of recycling legislation

150
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:40,127
Basically national sword is China's ban on the import of foreign recyclables

151
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,919
It started in 2018

152
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,455
And a list of banned items

153
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,735
Steadily grown

154
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:49,343
It has the potential of banning all recyclable materials by 2020

155
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,879
We don't know if that'll happen or not

156
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:55,999
It's hard to pinpoint exactly why China got fed up with this system all the sudden

157
00:06:56,255 --> 00:07:01,119
There are number of factors you can point to but a lot of experts think it's because

158
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,399
Abba movie

159
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,447
This Chinese documentary

160
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,983
Plastic China

161
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:08,287
Buy director wangjing

162
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:15,967
It focuses on this insanely cute little girl whose family works at a plastic recycling facility

163
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,271
She never gets sent to school

164
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,831
Because she's helping her parents watch her younger siblings

165
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,367
And sort through mountains

166
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,903
Shredded plastic

167
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:31,583
They're cutting up plastic melting it soaking it and turning it into a sludge

168
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,631
And then turning that into hardened appellate

169
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,703
The little girl watches her face in the grape last

170
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,471
Sticky water

171
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,519
And it's fish that have choked on plastic

172
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,591
This family lives with the shredding machine

173
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,895
They eat and sleep near it

174
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,175
Inhaling

175
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:49,759
The dust of microparticles that come off during the shredding Pro

176
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,783
Process

177
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,855
The fumes from the melting process is a lot of bad stuff that

178
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,391
And all the plastic

179
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,463
It's all clearly from Western countries

180
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:03,071
A little girl longingly cuts out shoes from a discarded European catalog

181
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,399
And gleefully plays with dirty old figurines of Mickey Mouse

182
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,679
It is

183
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,727
Absolutely heartbreaking

184
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:13,055
And it broke alot of hearts on the International Film Festival

185
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:17,919
Target and then it was also shown in China for a while and get caught in the internet there

186
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,735
The government start in Yankton

187
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:24,319
Chinese internet wehunt

188
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,367
Keep doing that

189
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,135
Really

190
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,415
Yes

191
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,951
Yes I believe it did

192
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:37,119
Causation or correlation it was after this documentary that China instituted operation National

193
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:37,887
Sword

194
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:42,239
China realize that they needed to crack down on these informal recycling plants

195
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,775
And don't say sufficient

196
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,055
Recycling systems

197
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:48,127
They want to improve their own domestic recycling rates

198
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,407
Center cities and towns

199
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,455
A lot of work to do

200
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:56,063
I need more than enough stuff to recycle without taking on more from other countries

201
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:59,391
So they decided to stop accepting our recyclables

202
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,415
What I mean

203
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02,975
Turn up it's a good move for them

204
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:06,303
I think China was no longer interested in being

205
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,839
But never really wanted to be but

206
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:10,911
Felt like it was being seen as the garbage dump

207
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:16,799
You know it's not its responsibility to taken all about trash got a point

208
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,735
And so now here we are

209
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:31,135
Blinking into the cold harsh light of 2019 national sword has been in action for about a year

210
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:31,903
Here now

211
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:38,303
Some people call it a crisis I just don't like the word crisis by that's where we are

212
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:42,399
That is unless you are a dedicated reader of waste dive

213
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:47,775
Waste time is triplication we cover the the waste recycling industry

214
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:50,847
Just generally the future of what happens to the materials we buy and throw away

215
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,663
Cool rosengrant is the senior editor

216
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,455
And reading waste dive

217
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:57,759
It's like reading the news from the upside down

218
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:02,623
It's a parallel world where the things we do in the realm of the shiny and new

219
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,159
Are perfectly reflected

220
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,951
In the grimy and used

221
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:09,279
Because we systems are affected by so many fans

222
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:15,679
Local resources Global policy packaging and product Trends new material technology on and on

223
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,727
It's a whole complex system

224
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,263
Especially in the US

225
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,103
Super complicated so more complicated than it ought to be

226
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,383
In the United States

227
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,175
Recycling programs very

228
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,967
Depending on individual cities

229
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,247
Counties in States

230
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,527
We don't have a national

231
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:32,319
Recycling policy other countries

232
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:34,623
Dune the right away sir in the US we do not

233
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,695
So in the wake of national sword it's been up to

234
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,743
Each individual recycling program

235
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,023
Find new buyers

236
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:41,791
Wherever they can

237
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,095
Summer started selling the recyclables

238
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,119
Southeast Asia

239
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,679
Countries like Vietnam and Malaysia and Thailand

240
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,983
Others are finding domestic Market

241
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,775
At least for certain material

242
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:56,127
With a woman with plastic and paper mills you know there's there are places in the US

243
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:58,943
Descendants that will buy this material to making products

244
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,479
And so

245
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:05,343
With that in mind areas of the country that have an End Market and reasonable distance

246
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,623
They doing okay

247
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:11,743
And now there's a big push to invest more in domestic recycling infrastructure

248
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,511
Which is good

249
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,815
There's over a dozen announcements of either

250
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,631
New expanded paper towels happening in the US

251
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,167
But here's the thing

252
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:23,519
All these new plastic glass and paper mills will not save us

253
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:27,103
Because now they are getting so inundated with recyclables

254
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:31,711
That they're increasingly putting their own restrictions on what kind of materials they are willing to accept

255
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:36,319
And there's a good reason why all these places started turning away our recycling

256
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:42,719
The stuff we've been sending them was too dirty so much of what we

257
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:48,863
Throw into the recycling bin is filthy contaminated with liquids or food waste oil

258
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,447
And this kind of contamination just ruins material

259
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:58,847
So if you're the anal one in your house was renting the yogurt out of the yogurt containers before you throw them out you are right

260
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,127
You are doing it right

261
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:03,455
But most people haven't been doing it right

262
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:08,063
I've been pretty high in the Risen in the past 10 years or so

263
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:14,975
As a result a lot of the stuff we were throwing in the recycling bin was never truly recyclable material in the first place

264
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,255
It was just

265
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,023
Trash

266
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:21,375
A lot of time it just ended up in landfill or incineration

267
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:27,263
Operation national sword didn't create these problems

268
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,799
I just revealed them

269
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,591
And then through the back

270
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,127
Well

271
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,663
Mostly through them at the Murph

272
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,223
They're the ones with the heaps and heaps

273
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:38,015
Useless recycling piling up

274
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,807
Wondering where to put it

275
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,111
It's been a minute since we spoke last

276
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,903
Happened

277
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,463
Yeah so I check back in with Robert Reed

278
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:50,047
Representative of San Francisco Recology who showed me around their plan

279
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,327
Back in the good old days

280
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,351
The 2016

281
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,655
What's been going on

282
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:55,935
The lots of things

283
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,983
If you lose your biggest customer

284
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,287
It really upsets the apple cart

285
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,871
Read explained that now and it's new buyer's market

286
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,919
Mills are only accepting the most

287
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,455
Easily recyclable items

288
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,015
Which means the items that are almost

289
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,039
Perfectly

290
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:11,807
Pure

291
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:15,135
Clean those efforts underway to reduce liquids

292
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,671
In any food scraps

293
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,951
In recycling bins

294
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:23,839
It's a Recology has been investing more and more and sorting and cleaning technology to make sure they can keep selling

295
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,119
Which means

296
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:27,935
They bought more Optical sorters

297
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:30,495
As we speak we're installing

298
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,519
State-of-the-art

299
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,311
Optical sorters

300
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,591
In our plants

301
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:35,871
It came from France

302
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,663
They now have seven

303
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,735
High-speed computer-controlled Optical sorters

304
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,039
Big machines

305
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,087
Do the work that we don't want to do

306
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:51,999
But also the murph's want us there consumers to send them cleaner recycling which would make recycling

307
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:54,559
Less expensive and more efficient for everyone

308
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,607
We're doing things to encourage

309
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,375
The public

310
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,143
To help us

311
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,191
Make cleaner bales of recycle

312
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:06,591
And so we've launched a new initiative in October called better at the bin

313
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:09,407
All of us doing a better job at sorting are recyclable

314
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,943
We call this initiative

315
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,735
Better at the Ben

316
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,527
Recology postings

317
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:18,879
High production value videos on their social media and on better at the ben.com

318
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:22,463
To try to convince everyone to take these little steps to be better recyclers

319
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:26,303
A point hostel bottle or can get stuff in the recycling bin

320
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,351
The liquid can ruin the whole lot

321
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,935
Remember reduce reuse recycle

322
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,471
Somewhere along the way

323
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:37,823
We totally lost track of reduce and reuse and focused too much

324
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,103
On Recycle

325
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:41,151
Refuse single-use plastic

326
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:48,575
Plastic bags and plastic coffee cup lids don't buy plastic water bottles carry a metal water

327
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:49,599
Replace

328
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:50,623
Yes

329
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,671
This is 100% true

330
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:56,511
We definitely have got to get better about generating less waste

331
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,559
And cleaning what we do recycle

332
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,095
But this alone is

333
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:02,655
Simplifying the real complexity of the problem

334
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:05,215
For example at the end of the interview

335
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:09,055
Robert Reed pulled out a totally normal-looking tube of toothpaste

336
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,359
You can't recycle this container

337
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:15,711
Do you still have the metal on the inside the soft plastic on the outside the hard plastic neck

338
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:19,039
Can tap into residual toothpaste on the inside not to mention the

339
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,855
Four five materials here

340
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,647
Do they all go to landfills are in

341
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:27,231
And then he pulled up the small aluminum can

342
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,791
And I'm opening it up and inside there's a

343
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:30,559
Hake

344
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,095
Toothpaste

345
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,119
What's a dry cake

346
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:36,191
It last for 45 days

347
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,751
And at the end of those 45 days

348
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,799
You just drop another cake

349
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:41,823
Into

350
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,615
The aluminum jar

351
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,919
I mean can you buy them in the states

352
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:51,039
I haven't been able to find them in the states yet

353
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,063
This one

354
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,855
Was purchased in

355
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:54,623
France

356
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,415
This struck me as

357
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,183
Fairly ridiculous

358
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,463
How

359
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:01,791
Are we supposed to buy cakes of toothpaste from France that we don't know exist

360
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:06,399
I don't like shipping toothpaste across the Atlantic is exactly environmentally friendly

361
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:07,935
Again

362
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:11,007
Absolutely true we need to get better at using less

363
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:13,823
Recycling and researching what are local systems will except

364
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,103
Definitely

365
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,383
Like

366
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,943
We throw out a lot of junk

367
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,479
Because we are sold

368
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,503
A lot of junk

369
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,551
So much

370
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,319
Problem

371
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:27,391
Is about the products we are sold and have access to

372
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:31,487
I just getting fed up with the way that we talk about our pollution problem

373
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,535
Matt Wilkins is a biologist

374
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:37,375
You are a piece for Scientific American about our current recycling

375
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:42,751
We should not have to fight as individuals against this constant onslaught of plastic

376
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:45,311
Take for example the term litter box

377
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:47,103
You don't want to be a litterbug right

378
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,895
The problem

379
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:51,711
It's not the fact that we have this unfettered production of

380
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:56,319
Billions of containers happening at all times and no infrastructure to reclaim this

381
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,087
Materials

382
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,367
And that nickname

383
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,135
Litterbug

384
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,695
It was popularized in large part

385
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:04,255
My group called keep America beautiful

386
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:07,071
Lobbying group keep America beautiful

387
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,095
Founded by

388
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,119
Pepsi and Coke

389
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,655
And Philip Morris

390
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,935
Among others

391
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:15,263
Keep America beautiful was formed in 1953

392
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:19,615
Around the same time Vermont was creating legislation way ahead of its time

393
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:24,223
It would have made it illegal to bottle anything in a non-refillable container

394
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,247
Of course

395
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,039
The beverage industry was against it

396
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,343
They wanted to frame the problem of waste

397
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,879
A something that should be dealt with

398
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,159
Not by companies

399
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,695
But by consumers

400
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:34,975
You know

401
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:35,743
Schlitterbahn

402
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:39,327
Keep America beautiful was essentially a lobbying group

403
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,119
But it's masterstroke

404
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,935
In consumer Shaymin came in 1971

405
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,215
When they rolled out

406
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,239
A very

407
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,263
Persuasive

408
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,055
Advertising campaign

409
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,591
Yeah the crying

410
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:51,615
Indian ad

411
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,639
Was

412
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:59,551
Basically they're there is a Native American canoeing through like a pristine Forest which is apparently right next

413
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:00,319
Dual Highway

414
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,855
And he

415
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:08,511
He paddles right up to the bank of the highway and climbs out and then people are speeding by and then

416
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:12,863
Motorists Life as we had some with a bag of trash and then the camera pans up

417
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,655
There's a tear rolling down his

418
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,423
Cheek

419
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,959
The sad witch

420
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:20,543
Featured an Italian actor playing a Native American

421
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,079
Became iconic

422
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:26,687
But it's basic lesson wasn't exactly wrong

423
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,879
But the ad made it seem that

424
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,927
The longest consumer stop littering

425
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,975
All of our garbage Rosewood besaw

426
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,767
Which of course is not true

427
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:45,375
It let the corporations that we're making all those disposable items off the hook

428
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:48,959
Although to be fair this is not exactly their stance anymore

429
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,519
Only a few years after the crying Indian ad

430
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:54,079
Keep America beautiful change their tune

431
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,871
So they actively

432
00:18:56,383 --> 00:19:00,991
Bought this legislation in a public way I think up until the early 80s

433
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,527
And then they kind of switch tactics

434
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:04,831
And have basically since then

435
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:08,159
Just been kind of getting in on the Earth Day push and

436
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:10,207
You're telling people to recycle and

437
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,999
Organizing cleanups and stuff

438
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:14,559
Representatives from keep America beautiful told me that

439
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,839
They now advocate

440
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:16,863
Recycling legislation

441
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,423
And that their corporate Partners want to do their part

442
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,215
Jesus

443
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,519
Especially in the shadow of national sword

444
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:26,591
Corporations and governments have had to acknowledge this

445
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:28,127
Scale of our recycling problem

446
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,431
A very public way

447
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:35,551
We are gathered here today to advance solutions to today's recycling challenges

448
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,855
That's the voice of Andrew wheeler

449
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:41,695
Former coal industry lobbyist and current acting administrator of the environmental

450
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:42,463
Protection Agency

451
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,511
In November of 2018

452
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:47,583
PPA convened a two-hour-long panel discussion

453
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:50,399
In an attempt to attempt to deal with the Fallout

454
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,423
National sword

455
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,239
We cannot tackle these challenges alone

456
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:58,335
Which is why we are thrilled to have representatives from nearly every aspect

457
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,871
Of the materials economy

458
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,407
Gathered here today

459
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:03,199
At this little round table

460
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:06,015
All the biggest names in the recycling world

461
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:08,063
From Waste Management to Walmart

462
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:13,439
Sad every day that you get Keurig and Starbucks and Coca-Cola Pepsi and Dr Pepper all in the same room together

463
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,975
And I'm really glad you're all here

464
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:16,767
Keep America beautiful is there

465
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:19,327
Culver's in Grand was also there in the room

466
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,607
Covering it for waste.

467
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:25,727
Tennessee Phi Beta be so flippant about that maybe it does

468
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,007
Happy quote

469
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:33,151
Basically each representative had like less than one minute to speak and everyone mentioned a million different problems with our recycling system

470
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:34,943
But

471
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,735
There was a butterfly

472
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,015
At the bottom of Pandora's Box

473
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:42,623
The common refrain at companies recyclers and municipalities alike

474
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,415
All mentioned

475
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:50,815
Consumers look for us to give them sustainable products

476
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,095
Design the right way

477
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:57,983
Yes dear listener one of the most important solutions to our recycling woes

478
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:00,031
Actually laying

479
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,055
Design

480
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:08,223
At the EPA meeting the representatives from Procter & Gamble talked about their award-winning container made out of plastic

481
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:08,991
Cleaned up from the beach

482
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:12,831
What we do with a head and shoulders bottle as we took the iconic white bottle

483
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:15,647
Will use plastic collected from beaches

484
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:17,184
And it became Gray

485
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:19,744
But we sold it that way and consumers bought it

486
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,816
Okay so this was a limited edition product

487
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,096
And I could you not

488
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,888
Is only available in France

489
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,168
Dammit France

490
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:27,936
But

491
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:28,704
Appointed

492
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:31,520
That kind of packaging is possible

493
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:34,080
These companies have the capacity

494
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,104
And the technology

495
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,152
Wechat ask for it

496
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:42,016
I think another thing that we can do is demand better design of

497
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,040
Everything

498
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:43,808
With

499
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:45,088
The end of life

500
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,368
Planned from the beginning

501
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,672
Matt Wilkins the biologist again

502
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:51,232
And better design Camina couple of things

503
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,608
Jessica means finding new ways to use recycled materials like that gray Head and Shoulders bottle

504
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:59,680
Or at the very least it can be making products

505
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,472
Really easy and efficient

506
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:02,752
To recycle

507
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:04,544
Everything should be able to

508
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,360
Break down into its composite materials and separate them

509
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:11,200
In a way that doesn't introduce impurities so they can be used to

510
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:15,040
And designers can and should visit murph's and Mills

511
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:18,112
They should know how their products and packaging sort

512
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:18,880
Weirdo

513
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,672
What is a breakdown

514
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:21,696
Or don't break down

515
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:25,024
Designers can also use biodegradable materials

516
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,096
Or materials like aluminum that recycle more easily than plastic

517
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,144
The ideal thing

518
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,936
Is to design products

519
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:32,960
Or even parts

520
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:33,728
The products

521
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,800
But don't need to be thrown away at all

522
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,336
The sound

523
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,384
And that you design

524
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,920
Things that can be repaired

525
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:43,200
Let your toothbrushes

526
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:46,528
Yeah

527
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,320
Cell phone

528
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:51,136
That you can swap components in and out of

529
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:53,696
The Berkeley Professor Kate O'Neill says yes

530
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:56,256
Companies have to design Greener products

531
00:22:57,024 --> 00:23:00,352
But then the next step is that this shouldn't just be specialty items

532
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:02,144
That should be the norm

533
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,960
I guess people have the label on it so people who are

534
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:06,752
Environmentally conscious will buy it

535
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:10,592
Turns out it might mean the people who don't care what by

536
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,432
What do it seems like a kind of paradox where were saying like

537
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:20,320
You know don't blame the consumer there's a whole world of influences but also like it's up to us

538
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,880
To harness the power of capitalism

539
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:27,232
And to send the market to our our will as as people who

540
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,000
We spend money

541
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:32,352
Yep which also it would also seems like it's putting the onus kind of back on the consumer now

542
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:34,400
Welsummers that was a thing

543
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:36,448
Not just consumers but how we Act

544
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,472
The citizens

545
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:39,520
So listen

546
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:42,080
In the course of researching the story

547
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,616
I had various freak-outs

548
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,968
At one point I was defiantly tossing my aluminum cans in the trash like

549
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:50,272
Wake up sheeple recycling isn't real

550
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,320
True

551
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,112
Don't do what I did

552
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:55,904
Instead

553
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,928
Ask around

554
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,256
And find out what is happening to the recycling where you live

555
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:04,608
This is a system that has been kept deliberately invisible

556
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:06,144
For the sake of our convenience

557
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,192
We need to learn how to notice it

558
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,984
Really think

559
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:12,288
About how our stuff is made

560
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,080
Going

561
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,360
When we throw it

562
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,640
Away

563
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:20,992
Operation national sword could be a wake-up call

564
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:23,296
But only if everyone

565
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,320
Can hear it

566
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:39,424
Okay you might be skeptical that design can really make a difference and recycling but I assure you it can not just product

567
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,472
Design but systems design

568
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:43,264
Take for example Taipei

569
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,544
The capital of Taiwan

570
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,640
They became one of the cleanest cities in the world in only a few years

571
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:49,664
By using

572
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:51,712
Singing garbage trucks

573
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:53,248
MapleStory

574
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,528
After this

575
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,256
Between the beats

576
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:06,560
Bongs and chatter of our devices

577
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:10,144
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man made sound

578
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,168
If

579
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:17,568
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife isn't

580
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:21,664
All hearing. Voice

581
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,432
Technology

582
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,200
She talked to us

583
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:25,504
It is a creation of Sonic trash

584
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:28,576
That's Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

585
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:32,160
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

586
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,952
To make them more human

587
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,048
Turn the living room lights on

588
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:39,840
Okay

589
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:42,400
Dim the living room lights to 50%

590
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,448
Okay

591
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:50,592
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

592
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:52,896
Makes for a much more natural

593
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:53,664
Experience

594
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:55,456
Turn the living room lights on

595
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,784
Dim the living room lights

596
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,808
50%

597
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:07,232
We're presenting to special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

598
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:10,048
About how are soundscape is impacting our health

599
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,608
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

600
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:15,424
Look for them Fridays May 17th and May 24th

601
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,192
Right here

602
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,728
E9pay

603
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:24,896
At the top of the show I reference in episode that Avery reported back in 2016 we called it

604
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:26,432
Separation anxiety

605
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,712
People really loved it

606
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:30,272
So if you missed it back then here it is now

607
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,040
Enjoy

608
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:37,440
If you could recognize any piece of classical music

609
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,720
I bet it's this one

610
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,024
This is chi release

611
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,096
Written by Ludwig van Beethoven in 1810

612
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:47,936
Maybe it reminds you of piano lessons you took when you were a kid

613
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:52,032
In my town it was also the song the ice cream truck used to play

614
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:55,360
That's pretty sure Avery truffle

615
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,408
But if you live in Taiwan

616
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:00,480
And you hear a truck rumbling down the street playing Fearless

617
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:03,040
It doesn't mean it's time to buy a popsicle

618
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:06,880
It means it's time to take out your trash

619
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:10,976
Because this is what a garbage truck in Taiwan sounds like

620
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:21,216
This garbage truck song isn't just supposed to be cute and fun

621
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:24,032
Although it is also supposed to be cute and fun

622
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,568
The singing garbage trucks

623
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:31,968
Are all a part of a completely different way of thinking about waste disposal completely different.

624
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:35,552
That is from the way that we think about it in the United States

625
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:39,392
In the late 1990s Taiwan recycled only 5% of its waste

626
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:41,440
Today Taiwan recycles well over

627
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:45,280
The country is now among the world's top recyclers

628
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:50,144
And what changed in this. Has a lot to do with the way that the trash is collected

629
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:55,008
Okay Fearless isn't the only song the trucks play

630
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:57,312
In Taipei the capital of Taiwan the trucks

631
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,848
Also play this song

632
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:07,808
That's a maiden's Prayer by Polish composer tekla baidu zuzka Baranowski

633
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,416
In Taipei City the garbage trucks just alternate between these two song

634
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:15,488
Protectors to pledges to songs

635
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:17,024
Stop music.

636
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,816
Taipei City

637
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:22,400
Given the elementary school kids can sing the song

638
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,704
So we have brainwashed

639
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:26,496
This is dr jasmine Wang

640
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:28,288
And she grew up in Taipei

641
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,824
Since I was a child

642
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,384
I knew that every time when the garbage truck

643
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:35,712
Cubs

644
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:40,576
Now the singing garbage trucks are such a part of life it's hard to imagine a time before then

645
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:43,392
But that time actually wasn't too long ago

646
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:46,464
We used to have a lot of a big dumpster

647
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,560
So there was a lot of rats mosquitoes and

648
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:52,864
Despite that and it's not good for our house

649
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:59,008
Just a couple of decades ago type a residence through their trash into massive smelly dumpsters on the street

650
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,336
Garbage would end up in piles on the sidewalk and then Park

651
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:04,128
Food faster in the heat

652
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,408
It was just nasty

653
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:09,248
Then taiwan's democratization accelerated in the mid-1980s

654
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:11,808
And created this desire to tidy up

655
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,880
Modern country means being a clean country

656
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:19,488
And when you have foreign visitors coming and visiting your Capital they shouldn't think

657
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:22,048
This is Mary Alice a.

658
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,864
Charity East Asian studies at Wesleyan University

659
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:27,424
In Taiwan the

660
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,728
Pro-democracy movement

661
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:36,384
Got fully entangled with the environmental movement and so as all those things move together in the state

662
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:41,248
The pro-democracy and pro-environment

663
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:43,296
Agendas got on to the public

664
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,320
Consciousness

665
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:47,904
Also the environmental movement had a practical end

666
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:52,000
Taiwan was running out of space to actually put piles of trash

667
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:55,584
Because it's a small island and extremely popular

668
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,608
Small island

669
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,704
There's not that much space where does you're going to stick all your junk

670
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,544
Where is in the United States there has been historically a sense of the

671
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:06,848
Untamed untappd

672
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,128
Endless

673
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:08,896
Wilderness

674
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,432
And you could just

675
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:14,272
Throw your junk Into the Wilderness and it would go away and you wouldn't have to worry about anymore

676
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,808
Not true in Taipei

677
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:16,832
The big city but it's

678
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:18,112
Clean in the subways

679
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:18,880
The cleaning

680
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:21,440
Sores are clean in the sidewalk so clean and it

681
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,720
It's really Pleasant to be there

682
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:27,328
You never know that the city used to have piles of garbage littering the streets

683
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,888
Type A and A number of other Taiwanese City

684
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:34,240
Reduce the amount of trash by changing the way the trash got collected

685
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:36,032
Take a look at my garbage

686
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:38,080
This is my friend Aaron Newport

687
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:39,616
She lives in Taipei

688
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:42,176
Where the garbage truck comes five nights a week

689
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,968
EBay like after work

690
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,552
It comes Monday Tuesday Thursday Friday and Saturday

691
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:50,368
In Aaron's neighborhood trucks come twice in the evening

692
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,648
At 5 and at 7

693
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:54,464
Take out the trash like once a week on one of their

694
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,560
Usually once I mean it's kind of hard sometimes to find the time

695
00:30:58,816 --> 00:30:59,840
To always be home at 5

696
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:00,864
5 / 7

697
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:06,496
Erin has to gather her own garbage and recycling and bring it out to a designated street corner and wait

698
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:08,032
For the big yellow truck to come

699
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,824
Frontier Park for the sound

700
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,640
MP release or maiden's prayer coming down the block

701
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:19,040
Basically this is a bindless system garbage can with system your trash goes right from your house to the

702
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:21,600
Truck ideally without ever touching the street

703
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:23,648
You just have to bring out your garbage

704
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,928
A special bag

705
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,720
I pay my garbage

706
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:27,488
Bill

707
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:29,280
By purchasing these

708
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,048
Blue tie dye

709
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,632
City garbage bags these official blue garbage bags

710
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,424
Pay city of Taipei

711
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,472
I eat is emblazoned with

712
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:41,056
I buy them from the convenience store across

713
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:47,968
The official blue garbage bags come in a number of different sizes ranging from 3L to 120

714
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:50,784
Lemoore garbage you throw away the Mortal costume

715
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,112
And although Taipei residents have to pay for their garbage by the bag

716
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,904
Recycling and compost

717
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,672
Are free

718
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:58,720
You don't need to buy bags for them at all

719
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:02,048
You can just take out your recycling in non-official plastic bag

720
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,888
And you can generate as much compost and recycling as you'd like

721
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,936
So residents are incentivised

722
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:10,240
Is to recycle more and throw out less

723
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:13,056
OS Aaron sort out all of her recyclables

724
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:13,824
The perfect

725
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,592
Categories

726
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:16,128
He said the cans

727
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:19,968
Cans and bottle so we have a few tea bottles

728
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:25,088
So in Taipei every yellow garbage truck is followed by small white recycling truck

729
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:27,392
Was basically a cart full of different bands

730
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:29,184
There's a bin for plastic bottles

731
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,464
Lowe's 1/4 glass bottles

732
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,256
Different Metals in cans

733
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,792
Papers and cardboard

734
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:36,352
The compost bucket for raw food waste

735
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:37,888
In a compost bucket

736
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:38,656
Cooked food weigh

737
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:43,776
Taipei residents have to sort their recycling into all these different categories themselves

738
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:47,360
Although in the white recycling trucks there are officials and volunteers

739
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:50,688
Who can help instruct you about which item goes where

740
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:56,320
So Aaron her housemates and I got all of her bags of trash and different kinds of recycling sorted out

741
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:59,904
And then we walked about a block down the street to wait with the rest of her neighbor

742
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:02,976
Who are all clutching official blue garbage

743
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:04,768
Quite a lot of people gathered

744
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,304
Genesis Maybe

745
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,096
Larger than your average

746
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,632
Then

747
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:11,424
The moment we were waiting for

748
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:20,384
There was this Mad Dash of people swarming to the school bus yellow garbage

749
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:22,176
And the white recycling truck

750
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:25,504
Okay that's not passing it in

751
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:31,648
Swiftly tossing their separate recyclables in the bins tossing their blue bags and the garbage truck and running away

752
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,928
It was Madness

753
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:33,696
Like

754
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:35,744
Greenlee well-organized Madness

755
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,024
I was so chaotic

756
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:40,352
And this system for all its chaos has been working

757
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:45,216
Taipei City used to produce 3296 tons of trash a day

758
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:48,288
Today the city produces about 1000

759
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,104
What's a day that is according to Chadwick

760
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:53,152
When it's 65 official

761
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:54,688
Who supervised the garbage trucks

762
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:55,456
And the rocks

763
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:57,504
I met him at a garbage pickups

764
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:00,576
Where Jasmine Wong acted as interpreter

765
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:07,232
Eveready listen to mr. 10 and he's his supervisor

766
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:12,096
In his district 10 overseas 20 garbage truck routes

767
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:16,192
And all those trucks have to make sure that citizens are sorting properly

768
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:20,288
If it's a fly the garbage tree in the recycling bag

769
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:24,384
The people here will tell them that you cannot do that

770
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,456
One more Thai otherwise see you I get tickets

771
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:33,856
And how much is the ticket 200 US dollars

772
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,648
You might think

773
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:37,184
This is such a drag

774
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,536
There must be some people who Buck the system by tossing their trash into public trash can

775
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:45,376
Well there are hardly any public trash cans in Taipei

776
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:48,192
They're only in train stations or at bus stop

777
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:49,472
And those are little

778
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:51,008
Play come up just below your knees

779
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,056
So in Taipei for the most part

780
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:55,104
If you eat a candy or buy a coffee

781
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,640
You just take your empty coffee

782
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:58,176
Candy wrapper

783
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:00,224
Put in your pocket and bring it home

784
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:01,504
Your trash

785
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,552
That you put in your blue bag

786
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:04,832
I can bring out to the truck

787
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,112
Yourself

788
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:09,952
It's hard to imagine a system like this working here in the US

789
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:13,280
Every city here has a different method of trash pickup

790
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:14,304
But across-the-board

791
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:19,424
Uniting factor is that our American trash pickup system strive to be invisible

792
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:25,056
The trucks made great efforts to come when we're working or sleeping or trying to sleep

793
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:29,152
Keeping out of the way of traffic and not disturbing the flow of the city

794
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:34,528
We take our trash and recycling out to Benz or down the Chute or to a dumpster

795
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:36,064
And it's gone

796
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,344
We don't have to think about

797
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:39,136
According to the EPA

798
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:42,976
Americans recycle and compost about 34% of their trash

799
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:45,280
Which is less than most rich country

800
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:47,840
But some American cities

801
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:48,864
Do a lot better

802
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,912
San Francisco has

803
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:52,192
Probably the most forward

804
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:55,520
Recycling program in North America this is Robert Reed

805
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:57,568
Is the representative of Recology

806
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,152
The company that takes care of San Francisco's waste recycling and comp

807
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,992
Unlike type A which has a public trash pickup system

808
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:08,320
Mini waste pickup services in the US are private companies

809
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:09,856
And we are the customers

810
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,416
That's how it works with ecology which means

811
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:14,464
They got to keep their customers happy

812
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,000
Number one Focus

813
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:17,536
Provide Superior

814
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:18,560
Summer service

815
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:19,584
Our next Focus

816
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,608
Chris is stupid

817
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:22,144
Do as much recycling is

818
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:22,912
Is possible

819
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:25,728
And to make recycling easy and convenient

820
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:26,496
For customers

821
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:27,776
Recology has set up

822
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:30,080
Similar incentives to the system in Taipei

823
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:33,920
What trash pickup is way more expensive than recycling or compost

824
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:36,224
For example in San Francisco

825
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,552
Recycling and compost cost about $2 a month

826
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:40,320
Corbin

827
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:42,624
Trash is about $26 a month

828
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:44,928
Above all

829
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:46,720
Ecology system is meant to be

830
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:47,488
Simple

831
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,256
And stress

832
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:49,536
It has to

833
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:50,816
If you want people to keep

834
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:51,840
Paying for your service

835
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:52,864
People

836
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:56,448
I have a lot of demands in their lives we understand that you don't

837
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:59,264
Recycling might not be the very first thing they got the guy

838
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,568
Make the boss happy to go to pay their mortgage

839
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:04,896
Garbage and recycling and composting might not always be the top of the list

840
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:06,176
We understand that

841
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:12,576
Basically instead of putting the onus on the citizens to separate the different kinds of compost and recycling for themselves

842
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:14,624
Recology does the brunt of the work

843
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:16,672
Sorting so we don't have to

844
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,024
San Francisco like a lot of other American cities that collect recycling

845
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,584
Uses one catch-all recycling bin

846
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:27,424
So you tell your cans or bottles are cardboard all in the same place

847
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:31,264
And then all those different materials end up in a facility

848
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,800
Like recycle center

849
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,360
Recycle Central

850
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:37,408
Large

851
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:39,712
Recycling plant on pier 96

852
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:43,552
Where we sort all the materials from the blue bin to bottle

853
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:44,576
Cans with paper

854
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:47,904
Going to go inside now

855
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,464
The facility is massive

856
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:54,048
That's where ecology process is most of San Francisco's recycle

857
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:56,864
Scrapy

858
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,656
Pile of recycling

859
00:37:58,912 --> 00:37:59,424
This is

860
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,704
From this morning

861
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:02,240
From one day

862
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:03,520
And we're going to get the

863
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:04,544
Started out

864
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:06,080
Because we got another big

865
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:08,896
Pyle coming in tomorrow so we do 600

866
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:09,664
Tons a day here

867
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:13,760
That 600 ton pile will wind its way up a huge

868
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:15,552
Surreal web of conveyor belt

869
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:22,208
Where some of the 173 people on staff will separate the recyclables into 16 categories

870
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:22,976
Materials

871
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:25,536
With the help of some Modern Recycling equip

872
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:31,680
So we've got a magnet's and we have fish ladders that separate bottles and cans

873
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:32,704
Sandpaper

874
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:35,776
They're on their on an angle and they temporarily

875
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:36,800
Suspend gravity

876
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:41,920
Make sure everything gets precisely sorted there's some real state-of-the-art technology

877
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:45,760
Like this apparatus that separates clear plastic from color plastic with

878
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:46,784
Optic sensor

879
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:48,320
Rainier

880
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:53,440
The scanners looking at the materials they come by and when it sees a

881
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:56,000
Clear plastic like a clear plastic water bottle

882
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:57,792
Hitler with a puff of air

883
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,072
And you can hear it

884
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:03,680
Expensive

885
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,216
$3000000 for this

886
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:05,984
Shein

887
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:07,776
And it came from the Netherlands

888
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:16,224
So this system with all this worrying twirling conveyors and magnets and machinery and 173 employees

889
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:17,760
Dazzling

890
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:20,320
Makes less trash by doing more cycling

891
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,088
And

892
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:22,112
Recycling

893
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:23,904
Creates ten times more jobs

894
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,184
Stan landfilling

895
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:25,952
Sonoran sunrise

896
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:31,328
Of course it also takes all the direct sorting out of the hands of people who actually create the waist

897
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,376
Charges them for the service instead

898
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:35,936
As a result recycling in the US

899
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:41,568
And I guess that's part of the problem like to be sent there's pushback in recycling

900
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:45,408
Which I've seen some of the United States now is often about the cost of a

901
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:47,200
Costly

902
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:50,016
And that's true if you're using me single-stream

903
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:51,296
Prophecies about China

904
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,576
And it was true

905
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:53,600
The household

906
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,928
That's Professor Mary Alice Haddad

907
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,232
Is your community wants to recycle

908
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:02,048
All that stuff needs to be separated and sort

909
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:03,328
Somehow

910
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:06,912
Whether you use a $3000000 machine from the Netherlands

911
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:12,544
Or compel an entire sweet potato shaped island of people to stand on the corner at night

912
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:17,920
The Taipei system is cheap and efficient because the city has conscripted their citizens

913
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:18,688
It's workers

914
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,224
And it's been successful

915
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:22,528
Taipei

916
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:23,552
The great example

917
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,112
A big major

918
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,136
Global

919
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,160
Metropolitan area

920
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:31,232
That did not have a good garbage collection

921
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:32,768
System not that long ago

922
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:33,536
And they have

923
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:34,560
Completely transformed

924
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:36,096
And it could be an example for us all

925
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:38,912
Which is not to say we should necessarily

926
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:40,192
Copy typing

927
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:42,240
What's work for them might not work

928
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,008
Work for the US

929
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:45,568
But consider the American garbage

930
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:48,128
Seeping around Dawn

931
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:49,152
Ordering work hours

932
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:51,712
Trying to be an inconspicuous

933
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:54,528
Trying to keep trash

934
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,552
Out of sight

935
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:56,832
Out of mind

936
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,136
You don't really pay attention to it

937
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:00,672
But

938
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:01,952
Everyone should

939
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:02,976
Pay a lot of a

940
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:03,744
Attention

941
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:08,608
We have to watch our garbage pile-up in our homes without taking it out to the van

942
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:10,656
And had to set aside time in our days

943
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:13,728
The catch the garbage and recycling trucks coming down the street

944
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:16,032
I bet we produce less drunk

945
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,872
But I also think if I had to hear this song twice a night 5 days a week

946
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,152
I would

947
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:21,920
Murder

948
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:22,688

Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like a dad

I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

994
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:14,207

00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:15,231
I think

00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:21,631
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop
