This is 99% invisible

23

I'm Roman Mars

24
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:14,496
In September 1958 Bank of America decided to try and except

25
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:18,592
One that would have far-reaching effects on our lives and on the account

26
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,968
They decided after careful consideration to conduct this experiment in Fresno California

27
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:25,504
The thinking was

28
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,552
No one was paying much attention to Fresno

29
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:28,832
The plan failed

30
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,624
It wouldn't get a lot of media attention

31
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:33,184
Dangerous low back down here

32
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,024
Fresno was not the big metropolitan area is today

33
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:38,816
That's Joseph Russo

34
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,864
My name is Joseph Russo

35
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,704
I work with Bank of America since 1956

36
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:47,776
Henry tires 1985

37
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:50,848
Started off as a teller and worked our way up

38
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,384
As most of us

39
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,152
Young

40
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,176
Fellas did

41
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,992
Joseph was there when all this went down

42
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,808
And so in September of 1958

43
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:03,904
Bank of America sent out 60000 pieces of mail to people in Fresno

44
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,464
Inside with a little plastic

45
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,536
Checked has become an equal parts emblematic of opportunity

46
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,560
Convenience

47
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:11,328
And that

48
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:16,448
He's talking about the credit card that's reporter Nate Berg here to tell you when I'm talking

49
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,824
Bank of America had recruited about 300 merchants in Fresno to accept this new payment

50
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:25,664
And they asked employees like Joseph two-hand credit cards out

51
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,688
The people they knew

52
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:31,296
We did we pass around our friends and you know the neighbors that's about it

53
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,832
But that's for Joseph

54
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:35,648
He was skeptical about using a credit card himself

55
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:39,744
Be honest with you I don't remember if I took your car drive better in order

56
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,304
If I waited a couple years

57
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,840
But dog

58
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:47,168
As a bank riding reap leaving credit myself

59
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,728
Minot

60
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,080
Well you have to pay back interest and I don't like giving money away

61
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,128
Joseph wasn't alone

62
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,712
The whole town of Fresno was a bit nervous about this new credit

63
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,480
Card system

64
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,784
The concept of credit wasn't new

65
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,064
But it never been done

66
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:04,832
Quite like that

67
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,976
Going back in to say the 1800s early 1900s you had

68
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:15,072
Credit with a store or some kind of a business

69
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:18,400
It was just kind of a ledger book type of thing

70
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,936
This is Ken hallenbeck

71
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,472
He's a numismatist

72
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,008
A numismatist

73
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:25,824
That is someone who studies or collects currency

74
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,920
Not just coins but it's paper money medals tokens

75
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:34,528
Anything that some money or money substitute can is retired now

76
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,552
Who used to work

77
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,856
The American numismatic Association

78
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,648
New Miss Matic

79
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,952
So back in the late 1800s

80
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:45,280
Every place from the Corner Bar to the local pharmacy

81
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,584
The allowed patrons to keep open tab

82
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:53,472
Big record everything in a ledger book and allow their customers to charge of a bill that they typically pay back

83
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,240
At the end of the month

84
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:57,568
For businesses this was an accounting nightmare

85
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:02,688
Stores could have hundreds of accounts billing tabs for a dollar here and

86
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,712
Dollar there

87
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,480
And with each

88
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:07,808
Chart a shopkeeper would have to haul out a ledger book

89
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:11,136
And look up a customers records just to complete a transaction

90
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:17,024
Eventually store owners cut down on some of the paperwork by assigning customers account numbers

91
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,839
Which state would inscribe on little token

92
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:26,495
Most of them are round or oval a hole in them and they had a number on him and that was your account number

93
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:30,079
Kim has a collection of a few dozen of these old credit

94
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,895
Many dating back to the early 20th century

95
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:35,199
I have one here at

96
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,991
Pocahontas

97
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,527
Pioneer

98
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,063
Garage

99
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,111
But it has a head of an Indian on it

100
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,207
And in the back it has a number 839

101
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:49,279
After credit tokens came something called charge of

102
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,839
They look like little dog tags for the Army

103
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:54,911
They were metal and had your name and information imprinted on

104
00:04:55,679 --> 00:05:00,031
Shopkeepers could make an impression of your personal information directly onto the bill

105
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,079
Instead of having to write it all down

106
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:06,943
The more accounts you had the more charger plates and tokens you had to carry around with you

107
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,783
It still wasn't a great system for the retailer or the customer

108
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:17,183
So in 1949 a New York businessman named Frank X McNamara

109
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,743
Came up with an idea for a single charge

110
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:22,559
Card that could be accepted at multiple established

111
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,095
He called it

112
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:24,863
The diners

113
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:29,983
Club card and with it you can make charges at a number of New York restaurants and hotels

114
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,031
But unlike the credit card of today

115
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:35,615
You could only use your Diners Club card in certain places

116
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,919
The idea caught on someone

117
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:40,991
About 20000 people signed up mostly businessman

118
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:45,343
It wasn't a smash success but still the bank started to see an opportunity

119
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,391
So you have this

120
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,695
Giant change taking place

121
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:56,351
Right around and especially in the aftermath of World War II in the American economy was the basically

122
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,887
The only economy in the world that was

123
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,935
Still Standing that's Joe nocera

124
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:03,775
Columnist for the New York Times and author of a piece of the action

125
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,823
How the middle class joint the money

126
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,615
Keepall

127
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,663
I haven't gotten to the war

128
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,455
Settling down

129
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:16,063
You know getting married raising kids wanting to live in the suburbs

130
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:19,135
There was suddenly things they wanted to buy

131
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:21,183
Refrigerator for example

132
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,463
Or as

133
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,999
Cayman divoga television

134
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,047
Do you have a Sears account

135
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:29,631
You could buy things there and pay your bill at the end of the month

136
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:36,287
We didn't have an account with a store you'd have to go to a bank and get a traditional loan for any relatively large

137
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,055
Large purchase

138
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:37,823
What it was

139
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,383
Car whether it was a sofa

140
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,455
Weather refrigerator you'd go to the bank

141
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:46,783
Every single time every single time you know you have to

142
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,087
You know have collateral to pay for it

143
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,367
Every single time

144
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:56,767
The bank it would have to figure out what you were good credit risk it was it was a pretty cumbersome process both for the

145
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,303
Consumer and for the bank

146
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,143
Bank of America wanted to find an easier way to make

147
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,167
Make these small loan

148
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,959
Bank of America

149
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,727
Was

150
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,519
In the 1950s.

151
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,543
Premier

152
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,567
Consumer-oriented

153
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,335
The bank and then I

154
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:14,431
Bank of America really believed in the idea that

155
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,455
Would grow

156
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,223
By helping consume

157
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:21,343
So it was Bank of America that decided that they would basically give clients a car

158
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,879
Did they can put in their pockets

159
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:25,951
That would give them roughly a $500 line of credit

160
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:31,583
Unlike the Diners Club Bank of America one of their customers to be able to use their card anywhere

161
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,119
Not Justa restaurant

162
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:39,775
And where the Diner's Club had to be paid off within 60 days Bank of America would allow its customers to pay them back whenever they

163
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,543
They wanted

164
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,615
They called her new credit card the BankAmericard

165
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,711
You could spend it all down you can pay part of it back youku

166
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,991
Call back

167
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:52,063
You didn't have to get a bank or to approve your purchase

168
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,879
And you didn't have to pay the bank back by any specific time

169
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,439
They called this revolving credit

170
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:00,255
The card was essentially an instant loan

171
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:03,071
Of course it was a loan with an interest rate attached

172
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,119
This was one of the

173
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,655
Profound shift

174
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:09,215
And the way people handle money

175
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,007
Instead of it the banker being

176
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,031
In control

177
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,103
Your money

178
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,151
Upsetting the terms

179
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,431
For how you dealt with your money

180
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,223
With a credit card

181
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,759
You were the one setting the

182
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:26,367
And you were the one making the decisions about what to do with your money

183
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:30,463
Now all Bank of America had to do was convince retailers to

184
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,255
Accept credit cards as payment

185
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,279
It convinced people

186
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,047
The user

187
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,631
Now because they were a new invention

188
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:40,191
And because people didn't really know what they were

189
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,983
And because there were no laws

190
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,007
Surrounding

191
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:43,775
Credit cards

192
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,335
The way they tested the car

193
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,639
Was they simply sent a mailing

194
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,199
To basically every Bank of America customer

195
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:53,503
In Fresno California which brings us back

196
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,271
To Fresno

197
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,551
They called it

198
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,087
The Fresno drop

199
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:02,975
Bank of America mailed out 60000 credit cards all over the

200
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,791
Fresno had become a laboratory

201
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,839
For the future of personal finance

202
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:14,751
The Fresno drop was supposed to be a controlled experiment with a bank could test the concept in work out any kinks

203
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,591
But within just a few months of the Fresno credit card drop

204
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:23,967
Bank of America's Got word that one of its competitors in California was planning a similar program

205
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,271
So Bank of America quickly expand

206
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:30,879
Mass Millions went out in the Central Valley Cities of Modesto and Bakersfield

207
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:35,231
The bigger cities of Sacramento San Francisco and Los Angeles

208
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,791
Within 10 months of the Fresno drop

209
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:41,631
More than a million BankAmericard have been mailed out across California

210
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:45,215
Once the cards have begun saturating the bigger cities

211
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:54,431
People would go around to mailboxes in the suburbs and steal cars out of on days when the new

212
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,711
The car tripping dropped

213
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:57,759
The system was being abused

214
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:01,599
But the system was also randomly mailing out pre-approved

215
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,367
Credit card

216
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:06,463
Is that allowed anyone to buy it to $500 of whatever they wanted

217
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:09,535
No dead people get in car dogs will get in cards

218
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:12,095
It was just very very willy-nilly

219
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:15,935
Despite these Mass mailings the cards didn't catch on right away

220
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,983
It was hard to convince stores to accept

221
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,799
They had to pay a percentage of the sale to the bank

222
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,079
It was hard to get custom

223
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:22,847
First used

224
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:27,199
And when people did start using the cards they didn't always pay the money back

225
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:29,247
Which was a bit of a surprise to Bank of a

226
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:33,343
People that mostly been pretty good about paying back traditional loans

227
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:37,439
And what they forgot was in those days when you made a loan

228
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:43,839
The customer look the banker in the eye in the bank or look the customer in the eye and they both had this kind of relationship

229
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:47,167
And the customer would not want to let the bank or down

230
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:51,007
Whereas with the credit card it was an anonymous thing

231
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:55,871
And this one in four people weren't paying their credit card debt

232
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,919
In 1959

233
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:01,503
About a year after Bank of America did their first mass mailing in front

234
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:04,831
They mailed out more than 2 million Bank of America

235
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:08,159
But they hadn't made a single Cent lyrics pyramid

236
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:08,927
The fact

237
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,975
They lost about 20 million dollars

238
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,511
Until the bank

239
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,047
Started making a few changes

240
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:17,375
They really start to think about it differently

241
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,655
Bank of America setup

242
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,935
The collections department

243
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:24,543
People who weren't paying their bills Heather cards revoked

244
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,103
The government also started to regulate the credit card act

245
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:32,991
In 1968 the truth in Lending Act made it illegal to mail out credit cards to people who've never asked

246
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,039
From that point onward

247
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,087
Instead of getting a card

248
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:41,183
In the mail you got instead of solicitation to apply for a card

249
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,463
Which

250
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,255
It's in one form or another existed

251
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:47,071
The stack it wasn't until 1961

252
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,887
3 years after the Fresno drop

253
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,703
The Bank of America actually turned a profit

254
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,983
On their crazy credit

255
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,287
1968

256
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:59,359
They were making about 13 million dollars a year

257
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:02,687
The Bank of America system which became a nationwide system

258
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,479
Eventually became known as Visa

259
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,527
And the other card

260
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:11,391
That had competed with Bank of America they also Consolidated and they became Massacre

261
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:15,999
The major credit card companies now make lots and lots

262
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,791
Lots of money

263
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,559
Every year

264
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:19,839
Which is great

265
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:20,863
For that

266
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:21,887
Maybe not so great

267
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:22,655
The rest of us

268
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:27,263
Today over 70% of American adults have at least one credit card

269
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:32,383
And the us as a whole has about 900 billion dollars in credit card debt

270
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:36,223
In 2009 more credit card reform was passed

271
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:39,039
It prevents arbitrary interest hikes

272
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:43,135
Stop credit card companies from specifically marketing to college kids

273
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:45,695
Prohibit certain types of abusive fees

274
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:48,511
But a lot of people think more reform is needed

275
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:53,887
The experiment in Fresno created a tool that made buying things much much easier

276
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:59,263
You no longer had to put on a suit and a tie and go to the bank for a loan every time you wanted to get yourself something nice

277
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:04,383
The credit card facilitated an unprecedented amount of economic freedom for the middle class

278
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,687
Aspect was intentional

279
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,967
And maybe even Noble

280
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:11,807
What is important to keep in mind that the credit card

281
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,855
Who designed to make money for bags

282
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:17,439
And everything about their design betrays that primary objective

283
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:20,511
Credit cards don't have to be complicated

284
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,047
They don't have to trick you

285
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,071
What they do

286
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,375
Because they were designed that way

287
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,087
I got a gal.

We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

312

It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

313
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,663
Makes for a much more natural

You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

347

Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like a dad

348
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:16,031
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

349
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,335
Actually if I'm being honest

350
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:20,383
I'm one of the main guy to know how to do that

351
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,735
A few days ago Wesley Stern

00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:28,063
After that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

353
