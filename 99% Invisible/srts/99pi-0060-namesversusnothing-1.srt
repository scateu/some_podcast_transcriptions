Every house is haunted

This is 99% invisible

16
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:08,864
I'm Roman Mars

17
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:15,520
There's this 80s movie that I have a real soft

18
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:17,824
What's on the theater in fact

19
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,872
Now I get to show it to my kids

20
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:23,456
It's a good one which is a good thing because when your kids like a movie

21
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:25,504
You end up watching it over

22
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,784
And over again

23
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:29,344
It's called The NeverEnding Story

24
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:37,280
The Neverending Story is a tale of a boy Adventurer name

25
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:43,936
He and his luck dragon name are trying to save the world from the

26
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:46,496
Onslaught of a terrible Force called

27
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:52,896
Nothing but the story also takes place inside of a book that being

28
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,688
Red by present-day boy

29
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,992
A boy name

30
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,344
Pretty much all the dialogue in the movie is written with exclamation

31
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,648
2 points anyway so Bassinger reader

32
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:07,744
Realizes that he is actually written into the story and it's up to him

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,536
To save the storybook world

34
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:16,448
Vashon wind-up defeating the nothing

35
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,472
Weather alert

36
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,008
By giving the empress

37
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,056
Set the fantasy world a new name

38
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:25,920
Give me a new name already chosen it

39
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:29,504
You just have to call it out

40
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:35,392
It's really hard to hear but he names her moonchild

41
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,952
I didn't know that for like 20 years

42
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:42,048
The power of one child imagination

43
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,328
Excellent

44
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,632
Seriously

45
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:49,216
There is a reason why I'm telling you this story

46
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,264
I want you to hold on to that idea

47
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,288
The name

48
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,312
Can defeat

49
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,336
Another

50
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:57,152
Okay with that in mind here's a producer Sam Greenspan

51
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,176
Hey Roman

52
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,456
Alright everyone I was

53
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:00,992
Names

54
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:01,760
Versus

55
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:02,784
Nothing

56
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,856
When I was a kid growing up in South Florida there was a

57
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:08,672
Beautiful green place where I always wanted to go play

58
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,512
Look perfect for a kid to run around and throw a ball

59
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:15,328
Was a flat mole on that just stretched into Infinity

60
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,376
But my parents wouldn't ever take me there

61
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:24,288
But with good reason it was inside of a giant Highway interchange my five year old self would never have been able to convince

62
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,056
My parents

63
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:27,104
This would be a good place to play

64
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,944
Because no responsible parent takes their kid to play catch-up a side of I-90

65
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:35,296
But I don't think I would even have known how to ask them to take me there because this

66
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:37,856
Place isn't really anywhere that we think of is

67
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:38,880
Being a

68
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,928
Place there's no name for

69
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,720
Let's call it a nothing

70
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,768
As a kid I couldn't look away from these

71
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,304
Perfect grassy areas

72
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:50,656
But as I grew up and became a driver I learned to ignore them like everyone else

73
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:52,960
So what happened

74
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:55,008
When you give that nothing today

75
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:57,568
That's totally what I'm doing I'm keeping things in the

76
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,848
This is my friend Graham

77
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,640
My name is graham coreil Allen

78
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:04,480
Grams in Artisan Baltimore and he has his project where he's trying to

79
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,760
Categorize and classify

80
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:08,320
All the different kinds of invisible public spaces

81
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,600
That we overlooked

82
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:12,416
Field Guide for how to spot them

83
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,696
It's part of the bigger project

84
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:15,232
Called new public site

85
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:20,863
New public sites is the investigation into some of the invisible

86
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,679
Sights and overlooked features of our everyday public

87
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,447
Spaces

88
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:26,239
Within cities that are

89
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:28,543
Not traditionally frames as public

90
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,311
Space

91
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,847
Is important to name these place

92
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:33,407
Because by giving these places

93
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,431
Succinct

94
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,455
Infinite

95
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,735
Poetic names

96
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,783
We can help

97
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,831
Start a discourse

98
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,623
About our public spaces

99
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,183
And how we want to Envision them for

100
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,487
I'm reminded of the never ending

101
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,279
Sebastian you must give me an a

102
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,119
See

103
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:59,775
Crank is the story where he puts his language to use

104
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:02,335
Describing incredibly boring pieces

105
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,615
Baltimore landscape

106
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,151
This is the first

107
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,479
And here we have

108
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:10,783
I remember the building

109
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:11,551
Stand here

110
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:12,575
Blue

111
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:15,135
Passing through it you can imagine

112
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:19,999
Acid ghost should a building be standing here would have to actually be

113
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:23,583
To pass through these walls and now it's the reverse

114
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,887
The building is The Ghost and where

115
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,167
We're passing through its walls

116
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:31,007
So Graham is really giving a tour of a vacant lot

117
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:33,823
Big Lot is one way to put it but notice what brand call

118
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,847
Avoid

119
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:37,663
And if you pull up his book The Grand published

120
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,967
Field Guide to Disney Publix I still see

121
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:40,991
Hang on

122
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:44,575
I don't have the book handy but here this is

123
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,391
Command app

124
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,487
Page 14

125
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:52,767
Void

126
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:57,631
A framed open-space imbued with a psychic presence of a former Mass

127
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,191
Andorra the profound immersion

128
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:01,983
Seductively in

129
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:02,751
Infinite nothingness

130
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,055
That certainly is a something

131
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:09,663
To find out more about these invisible public spaces

132
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,735
Ramen-san road bike to the edge of East Baltimore to look at a few

133
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,039
Like the one Sam Pine for the kid

134
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,575
It looks like there's a

135
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,343
Small party

136
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:21,183
We can actually see through right now at the foot of a

137
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:25,023
Of a small embankment that's probably 15 ft tall or so

138
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,071
We're going to walk up to the edge of this embankment

139
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,887
And meet a low line concrete wall

140
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,935
That will safely separate us from

141
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,727
The Cloverleaf

142
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:36,031
The traffic right Beyond this

143
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,567
This on ramp onto

144
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:43,967
Will be able to hopefully actually look into a freeway Eddie so let's let's do that right now

145
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,647
Raleigh traffic

146
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:54,207
You're looking at there's

147
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,487
Curved Highway

148
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,791
Exit ramp come in front of us and

149
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,327
Teen feet

150
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,607
20 feet ahead of us

151
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:01,887
This kind of disc

152
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,679
Almost like a Wilderness Area

153
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:06,751
Instant no trespassing nearby

154
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:07,775
Maryland transit

155
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:08,799
Authority

156
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:13,407
Correct with the invisible public space inside Graham turns to his Field Manual

157
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:14,943
Freeway Eddy

158
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,991
An interstitial

159
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,271
Fragment of space

160
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,319
Between intersecting curves

161
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:26,975
Of Highway pavement and there you have it that grassy non place I always wanted to hang out in as a kid

162
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:27,999
Now is the name

163
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,791
Freeway Eddy

164
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:36,191
Grams Field Guide to new public sites is full of new identities for these kind of places

165
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,799
So here we have median Refuge

166
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:47,455
A liminal zone of linear respite between parallels of turning traffic

167
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:52,063
Elevation Supple terrain providing the ideal incline

168
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,111
From which one make gays

169
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:57,695
Remote viewing distance Monumental isolation

170
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:01,023
Loose Parts movable materials

171
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:06,655
That invite playful reconfiguration

172
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:13,055
Loose Parts if you ask me triangle Crossing

173
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,079
A three-sided

174
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:16,895
Concrete platform or asphalt Zone

175
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:23,551
Providing Solace for Street crossing pedestrian we have

176
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:29,951
The overwhelming occupation of a surrounding soundscape by site generated

177
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:36,351
Groaning noise median Refuge of liminal pause of restraint empty signifier opposed

178
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:40,959
Or Paul absent of its original sign and or meaning

179
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,263
Sears news

180
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:47,359
If there's a common theme connecting these sites

181
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:52,223
Is there mostly the empty leftover spaces from.car Centered City Planning

182
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:55,295
Hot celebration of these nothing places

183
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,087
What's the hell Graham describes the

184
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:01,951
Beauty beauty beauty that one can enjoy spectacular and Sublime quite beautiful

185
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:08,351
This is a really beautiful spyware actually stating right now in

186
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:13,215
The long strip of sunlight that is past the it created by the space

187
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:16,031
Between these two elevated highways

188
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:21,919
We're at the

189
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,735
Chinatown Bus Stop across the street for

190
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,015
Turn the Baltimore Travel Plaza

191
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,551
Miles outside of the

192
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,319
The city

193
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,599
Perhaps

194
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,367
The most

195
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,415
Unglamorous way

196
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,439
Interbelt

197
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,207
And yet it's

198
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,743
It's a gateway

199
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:36,511
400

200
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,535
A week

201
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,071
It is quite beautiful

202
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:39,839
Space

203
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:40,607
What were

204
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,399
Here's what I got to draw the line

205
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,191
Because there's some freezers

206
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:44,959
Birds

207
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,751
You know there's I guess I'm intense

208
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:48,799
Masseria

209
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,591
Around here but

210
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,359
I mean

211
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,151
It's basically a big parking lot with

212
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:54,687
Diesel gas

213
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,455
Across the street is a

214
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,223
Subway

215
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:56,991
There's a

216
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,271
My bus stop

217
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:00,831
What what are your grounds for calling this beauty

218
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,623
Let's be clear here

219
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,903
You can call that

220
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:07,743
Grassy patch off the highway and a freeway Eddie all you want

221
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:10,303
But I can take my kids to play ball in one

222
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:15,167
A highway exit ramp at By Any Other Name is still just as unattractive and dangerous

223
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,703
This is beautiful

224
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:17,983
Because it's

225
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:21,823
It's a space that shared by so many and yet

226
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,127
It was completely undesign

227
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,431
This place was designed to the parking lot

228
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,711
And it's become

229
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,991
This huge

230
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:31,039
Nexus 4 people coming in and out of all time

231
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,855
It's so it's not necessarily what it looks like

232
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:36,159
It's more about what it represents

233
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:40,511
Yeah there's no denying that the experience of being in these new public sites

234
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,791
Actually pretty terrible

235
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:44,351
Flipagram the beauty is in there but

236
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,119
Potential

237
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:49,727
Sometimes everyday unremarkable spaces can become something more simply by virtue of

238
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,751
People being there

239
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:55,615
It's worth noting hear that zuccotti Park in New York City the birthplace of the Occupy Movement

240
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,663
With a privately owned space

241
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,455
And not a public park

242
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,735
So is your goal is

243
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:04,063
Finding new spaces for engaged democracy to happen as it is

244
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:04,831
Instagram

245
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,367
Then you need a way

246
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,671
To redefine the places in your neighborhood

247
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,463
That kind of activity can happen

248
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,511
I think it's important.

249
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,303
Not to fetishize

250
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:17,631
Public spaces as only existing in town squares or

251
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:23,775
Yosemite or Yellowstone or something like this not just the National Mall in DC for example but anyplace

252
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,311
Our everyday public space

253
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,103
Spaces that we all share

254
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:30,687
It's everywhere and we all have access to it these spaces

255
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:35,807
Are the places where this happens it doesn't just happen over the Internet it happens in physical spaces

256
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,367
New public sites are these physical space

257
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:41,183
That we can appropriate that we can make our own

258
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,975
If it's only for a temporary

259
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:46,303
You know demonstration and so be it but maybe it's for a farmers market

260
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,351
Maybe it's for a community garden

261
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,887
Maybe it's simply

262
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:50,911
Playground

263
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:51,935
Or

264
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,519
A place where we need to add a few benches to make it a better bus stop

265
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,055
But nevertheless

266
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:59,871
There's potential there and by giving it a name

267
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,663
Dubai starting that conversation

268
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:04,223
We can kind of get these ideas moving into reality

269
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:07,807
All comes back to a name against

270
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,575
Nothing

271
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,623
When you give a nothing a name

272
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,903
You can reimagine it

273
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,927
As of something

274
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:15,743
If we can create terms or these otherwise

275
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,535
Invisible experiences and places in

276
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,303
Things

277
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:21,631
That we all share that we all of us share these public space

278
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:22,911
Is new public site

279
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,751
It's a starting point for that conversation

280
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,311
By giving it a term we can then talk about it

281
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,615
And we all know what we're talking about

282
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,663
That's the first step

283
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:39,295
The second step is envisioning okay well how does this need to be improved in third step is how do we do that

284
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,623
The naming is where it starts

285
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,439
I don't know if I named anything runechild

286
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:15,903
99percentinvisible was produced this week by Sam Greenspan with help from me Roman Mars it's a product of k a

287
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:22,047
Kalw 91.7 local public radio in San Francisco in the American Institute of Architects in San Francisco

288
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:30,495
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices were immersed in a cluttered world of man

289
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,519
Handmade sound

290
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:38,175
If I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexis talking to me in my

291
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:44,575
Wife is in another room in a kid is another remember all hearing that voice technology talk to us

292
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:47,135
It is a creation of Sonic trash

293
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:53,535
That's Joel Beckerman he's a sound designer and composer who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

294
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,583
To make them more human

295
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:59,423
Turn the living room lights on

296
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,215
Okay

297
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,775
Dim the living room lights to 50%

298
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:05,567
Okay

299
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:12,479
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound makes

300
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:15,039
For a much more natural experience

301
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,831
Turn the living room lights on

302
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,927
Dim the living room lights to 50%

303
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:29,631
We're presenting two special episodes from 99percentinvisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation about how are sound

304
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,423
Escape is impacting our health

305
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,983

You take laxatives modify your diet and exercise routine but thinking about it all the time is frustrating but doesn't have to Define you

Before we go I want to tell you about the body genius a five-part series from fellow radiotopia show the truth

320
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:51,551
The body genius is a Dark comic mystery

321
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:56,415
That whines through a treacherous fictionalized Hollywood we're looking the part

322
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,951
Might cost you your life

323
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:03,327
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

324
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:07,679
Or lose a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

325
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:12,031
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like a dad

326
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:16,383
I'm having I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

327
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:22,783
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that kind of thing if you

328
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:28,415
Days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

329
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:34,815
Was found dead in my private gym crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

330
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:41,215
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it now I need to

331
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,495
To clear my name

332
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:48,895
