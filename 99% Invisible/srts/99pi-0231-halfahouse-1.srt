31
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:33,184
The night of February 27 2010

32
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,768
Luis henriquez was getting home from his job at a lumber Factory

33
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,560
In constitucion Chile

34
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,864
Isolated

35
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,424
It was around 3 in the morning

36
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:50,336
I was watching TV with my wife and a neighbor and all of a sudden we started feeling the Earth

37
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:56,736
Shake and it was just getting stronger and stronger

38
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:03,136
Couldn't stand up producer Sam Greenspan translating for Lewis Lewis was in an earthquake

39
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:09,536
A bad one when the shaking finally stopped he was relieved to see that his wife and their two kids are all fine

40
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:16,192
But Lewis knew they were still in danger because into a everyone is taught from childhood that after North

41
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:16,960
Quick hits

42
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:19,776
The first thing you do is get to Higher Ground

43
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:22,336
Which is what Lewis and his family did

44
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:25,664
They got in a car and they sped to the top of a nearby Hill

45
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:26,944
From its peak

46
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,528
Please look down from the hillside To Where the River male men

Supercloud you can see it super Clear Lake

50
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:39,744
You can see the waves

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,768
Coming into the city

52
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:47,680
The earthquake that Louise is describing was tremendous

53
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:52,288
A magnitude 8.8 second-biggest that the world has seen in the past

54
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,056
50 years

55
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:59,200
The quake and ensuing tsunami completely crush the seaside town of constituciÃ³n chile

56
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,224
Ray Lewis live

57
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:04,576
By the time it was over more than 500 people we're dad

58
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:06,624
And 80% of the city's building

59
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,392
It's were ruined

60
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,184
As part of a relief effort

61
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,000
An Architecture Firm called Elemental was hired

62
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:14,048
To create a master plan for the city

63
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,584
Which included new housing for

64
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,608
4 people displaced

65
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,376
And the disaster

66
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:21,216
But the structures that element all delivered were a radical

67
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:24,288
And somewhat controversial approach towards housing

68
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,824
They gave people

69
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,848
Half a house

70
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:33,248
Picture of simple two-story home with a pitched roof

71
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,040
A square with a triangle on

72
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,832
Basically how a kid would draw

73
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,160
Only in these there's a wall that runs down the middle

74
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,440
Peak of the roof

75
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,720
All the way to the ground

76
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,000
Splitting the house in half

77
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,304
One side of the house is finished

78
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:49,376
And the other side

79
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:52,960
The other side is a completely empty space there's a roof

80
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,240
And an exterior wall

81
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:56,800
The rest is just an open boy

82
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,616
The Architecture Firm Behind these houses

83
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,920
Santiago based Elemental

84
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,456
Has made a name for themselves

85
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,992
Building these half a home

86
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:07,296
And not just as disaster relief

87
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:12,928
Either today element all has done about 10 low-income housing projects across Thule

88
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:17,791
All design so that the homes would be largely unfinished when the residents moved in

89
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:21,119
And the response from the architectural Community has been immense

90
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,911
In 2016

91
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,215
The firm's founder Alejandro aravena

92
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,495
Was awarded the pritzker prize

93
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,287
The top prize in Market

94
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:32,639
In there jury citation the pritzker architecture prize set that quote

95
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,175
Alejandro aravena

96
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:37,759
Epitomizes the Revival of a more socially-engaged architect

97
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:40,063
Especially in his long-term commitment

98
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,367
To tackling the global housing crisis

99
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:45,183
And fighting for a better Urban environment for all

100
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,231
This for building disaster victims

101
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,511
Another poor people

102
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,791
Unfinished homes

103
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:54,911
To understand where these half-built houses came from

104
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:57,983
You have to understand them as an attempt to solve the problem

105
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00,031
Global Urban migration

106
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:05,151
Over the past several decades people the world over have been migrating from the countryside

107
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,199
The cities the driver city was

108
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,223
Creating spell

109
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:09,503
So

110
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,783
The results of squatting

111
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,063
This is George gattoni

112
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,623
An architect who grew up all around Latin America

113
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,159
Mostly in El Salvador

114
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:20,255
George saw firsthand what happens when a population grows

115
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,279
It's supply of building

116
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,815
The housing deficit

117
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:25,119
Of San Salvador the capital

118
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,399
What's something about

119
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,679
10000 units

120
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,447
A year

121
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,471
And growing

122
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,031
The backlog

123
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,055
People

124
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,335
That had no service

125
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,615
It was

126
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,151
It was unbelievable

127
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,711
George wanted to help solve this

128
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,783
But I was struggling with how to make a house

129
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,551
Affordable

130
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,831
In the 1970s

131
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,367
George heard about a new master

132
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:51,231
Program that MIT program called Urban settlement design in developing country

133
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:56,607
At MIT George found a mentor in a professor named John FC Turner

134
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:59,167
John FC Turner of British

135
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,191
Urban planner

136
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,727
Wisp irritating

137
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,263
Idea that

138
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,567
People can build for themselves

139
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:09,407
In a 1972 essay called housing as a verb

140
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,759
Turner made the case that housing ought not be as static unit that is

141
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:14,527
Package

142
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,551
Handover.

143
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:16,831
Rather

144
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:20,415
Housing should be conceived of as an ongoing project

145
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,439
When residence

146
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,719
Are co-creators

147
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:27,071
And from this thesis Turner helped promote an idea this idea that was emerge

148
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,863
This site and service

149
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:33,471
Sites and services also sometimes called incremental build

150
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:37,055
It basically means instead of building people completed homes

151
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,847
Government should just build the

152
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,383
The key parts of a home

153
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,199
The people have the hardest time building on their own

154
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:48,831
Like concrete foundations insulation Plumbing electrical wiring

155
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,879
To provide services to those sites

156
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:57,279
Road drainage sores that latrines whatever the case may be garbage collection you got to write your

157
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,815
Tracks to the schools

158
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:04,191
Does gradually over time people start to turn their basic sites into suitable housing

159
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:06,239
With materials they Source themselves

160
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,519
On their own terms

161
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:11,103
What people have to be to donate of Their Own

162
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:11,871
Is

163
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:12,639
Labor

164
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,943
The cost of Labor

165
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,735
And the cost of materials to expand

166
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,015
But in the end

167
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,551
They own what they built

168
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,831
It's their investment

169
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:21,855
They have the ability

170
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,647
And governments cannot build

171
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,671
Old as well

172
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,439
As

173
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,463
Quickly

174
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:30,047
And no way that makes sense to these house

175
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:33,887
Since finishing his studies at MIT in the 1970s

176
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:36,447
George has done these kinds of incremental building projects

177
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,471
All over the world

178
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:40,287
In Latin America Kenya Indonesia

179
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,311
Annies projects

180
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,591
Can take different forms

181
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:46,431
Sometimes it's just giving people a concrete pad with utility hookups

182
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:53,087
Sometimes it's just giving people a one-room house with a kitchen and bathroom in the expectation that they'll build extra rooms on to

183
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,135
It sounds odd but

184
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,159
Believe me

185
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:01,279
These ideas that Georgia Tony and his contemporaries and MIT pioneered

186
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,047
Sacraments

187
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:05,887
Report people building for themselves and then let them on what they build

188
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,447
Began to spread through the developing world

189
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:14,335
And so when the architecture from Elemental got their first commission to do low income housing in chili

190
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:16,895
They took the ideas from incremental housing

191
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,431
As Point of Departure

192
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:21,503
Absolutely

193
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,575
To make something that can be improved

194
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,343
By time

195
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:29,951
This is Juan Ignacio Cerro though one of the principal Architects at elementary

196
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:36,607
Sarah told me that in 2002 Elemental got a commission to build a hundred units of low-income housing

197
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,911
In a city in Northern Chile called

198
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,983
He gay and they had to deliver it on a tight budget

199
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,519
$7,500

200
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:47,615
Unit with only $7,500 allocated for household

201
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:51,967
The most straightforward and cost-effective way to house all 100 families

202
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:55,295
Was the cram everyone into big block style apartment

203
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,319
When they

204
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,343
What about blocks

205
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,135
They said if you dare

206
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:01,439
To propose to block we started hangers

207
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,487
Because it's the worst thing ever

208
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,535
According to Juan Ignacio cerda

209
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:10,143
The community threatened the hunger strike because an apartment block would be extremely limiting

210
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:15,263
Sure they were living in a slum before but at least they had control over their own space

211
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,335
They can make expansion some adjustments when they wanted to

212
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,639
But with a block style housing project

213
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:23,455
They be confined to a small static space

214
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,479
Which is worse

215
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,783
Because you are not able to expand a house

216
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,575
Into what element all came up with

217
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:32,415
We're tall rectangular houses separated by empty space

218
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,439
Each unit was

219
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,463
Just big enough

220
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:37,535
Give me Chili's minimum standards for low income housing

221
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:41,631
And then residents could on their own time however they wanted

222
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:44,703
Expand into the empty space adjacent to their home

223
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,799
Element all spent the early 2000s iterating on his concept

224
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:54,431
Building homes that just met the basic legal requirements for low income housing in chili

225
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,967
What was room to grow

226
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:58,783
And then in 2012 after the earthquake

227
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,063
Can Constitution

228
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,855
Elemental got a commission

229
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,135
To help create a new map

230
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,415
For the city

231
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,719
Which included creating a new neighborhood

232
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,511
Full of incremental building

233
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:11,839
It would be located on one of the tallest Hills in the city

234
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,119
It would be called

235
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,399
Via Verde

236
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:18,495
Okay we are on our way up to be a better day and

237
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,311
Oh wow here it is

238
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,847
This is it right here

239
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,151
Wow I was really big

240
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:28,479
The same went out to see Via Verde with producer Martina Castro

241
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:34,623
To get to Via Verde you drive straight up one of the tallest heels and constitute

242
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,695
You pass a traditional looking apartment complex

243
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,975
Also built the house

244
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,255
People act mm

245
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,023
And Quake

246
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,583
Once you're on top of the hill you get some just

247
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,191
Staggering views of the town the ocean and the river male below

248
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,983
It's like a whole bunch of

249
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,775
These little boxes on the hillside

250
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,335
Looking over let the river male

251
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,711
Via Verde is made of neat rows

252
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:01,247
Simple two storey house

253
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,551
Half of each house is identical

254
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:06,623
Play Windows steam color kind of a Farmhouse Red

255
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,927
The other half of each house though

256
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,463
Is completely different

257
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:13,279
They have different doors different windows or

258
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:15,327
Pieces of tarp where windows will go

259
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,607
And it's on houses

260
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,911
Half the house has nothing there at all

261
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,447
Half the house is missing

262
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,775
And that's an Ender funny vows

263
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:24,799
Full Tilt out

264
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:29,407
When people get their houses beside that comes pre-built is pretty bare-bones

265
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:34,015
The walls are unpainted sheetrock in the floors are unfinished concrete and plywood

266
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:38,111
The kitchen comes with just the sink no stove no refrigerator no cabin

267
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,903
Houses are Spartan

268
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,671
To say the least

269
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:41,951
But their habitat

270
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,999
Practical and well-insulated

271
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:48,351
Martina Castro and I spent a couple of days walking around Via Verde talking to residents

272
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:52,703
And is there that we met Luis Enriquez the earthquake Survivor We heard from earlier

273
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,007
Is some of them program in California

274
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:00,127
When we met him Lewis and his wife were outside

275
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:02,175
Working on a gravel walkway to their home

276
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,711
Lewis invited us in

277
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,991
Martina Translate

278
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:09,087
When you when you moved in more the most important things that you wanted to do right away

279
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:13,183
Cuando Cimarron air quality

280
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,511
Compare 4K

281
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,303
Evil lair

282
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:22,399
People say lalala

283
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:25,727
Yeah just make it bigger because it was a really small space

284
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,751
So we had to

285
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,055
Build it out to be comfortable

286
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:32,639
With help from his wife and his brother who also lives in Via Verde

287
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:36,223
Lowest laid concrete on the empty side of the house to make a floor

288
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:39,039
And put up exterior walls and flooring for the second

289
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:39,807
Story

290
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,135
None of them had really done construction before

291
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:46,463
But they had direction from workshops on building techniques

292
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,743
Elemental health

293
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:48,511
Facilitate

294
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:52,863
The homes also come with a user manual with directions for how to expand the house

295
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:56,191
Expansions can be done with standard size building materials

296
00:12:56,447 --> 00:13:00,031
The residents don't have to pay lots of money for a custom cut pieces of lumber

297
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:05,663
So far Lewis has focused his efforts I'm just getting the house to be big enough to accommodate his family

298
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,735
And so inside the walls are still in painted

299
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:14,111
The downstairs floors are still just unfinished Concrete in upstairs it's unfinished plywood

300
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,671
Louis knows they've got a long way to go on there

301
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:20,255
But he doesn't just see the bare walls and course floor

302
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,559
He sees what it all can become

303
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:27,935
If and when the Enriquez family does have tiling in

304
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:28,703
Carpet

305
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,495
Painting baseboard on the walls

306
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:34,591
It'll be way nicer than anything that they ever could have afforded on their own

307
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:39,199
Or what they could have normally gotten through state-funded low-income housing programs

308
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,479
And some now

309
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,295
Louis is the owner of a four-bedroom home

310
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:47,135
It keeps out the cold won't get flooded then won't fall down in an earthquake

311
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,951
Yoakum, Senora

312
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:50,975
Telemundo

313
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,255
La vida dificil

314
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,535
You know my wife and I

315
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,351
Japan

316
00:13:56,863 --> 00:14:00,959
So finding out that we were going to be owners of our own house was just

317
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,239
Incredible

318
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:07,871
Not everyone I talk to it Via Verde was enthusiastic about having to build their own home

319
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:11,711
And some thought Elemental contractors could have done a better job

320
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:15,551
But for the most part people there seemed really happy with their homes

321
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,111
Even people who had an expanded there's at all

322
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:21,695
One resident of single mom named Camilla Hernandez Rodriguez

323
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:22,975
Admit any Edition

324
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,279
Aqi

325
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:28,863
Yeah so of course you know when when dream

326
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,399
Can you think that you're going to

327
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,703
Just have everything ready all all is one

328
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,495
And so I wanted

329
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,263
2

330
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,567
Build out the house and everything but the

331
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,847
Then I just focused on

332
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:39,871
Small things

333
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:45,503
Most people in Via Verde are further along with lyrics

334
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:46,783
Camilla

335
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,831
And everyone seems to have some prog

336
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:53,439
Some residents have been opted to use their extra space to start businesses

337
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,719
Lakeville stores that

338
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:56,255
Sell bread and candy and

339
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,023
Cell phone minutes

340
00:14:57,535 --> 00:15:00,863
If you only got from residence is that they felt invested in Via Verde

341
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,399
They like living there

342
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,167
I felt safe

343
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,215
It all kind of made me wonder

344
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,519
Why haven't we seen this approach in the US

345
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,799
I don't think this could work in

346
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,871
There's a lot of things going on here which are

347
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,431
Really Innovative and there's a lot of things

348
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,711
Where things go wrong

349
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:19,551
This is dr. Jennifer stoloff a researcher with the consulting firm

350
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,319
Econometrics

351
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:23,903
Before that I was a social science Analyst at HUD and the office

352
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,927
The policy development

353
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,463
For about 14

354
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:30,047
Dr. stoloff is an expert at evaluating government programs

355
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,607
Particularly those that pertain to housing

356
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:35,167
She's also an historian of public housing in the US

357
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:38,495
I told dr. stoloff about the Via Verde project

358
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,543
There's some pictures and she says yes

359
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,311
It does

360
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,359
Kind of a line with the US ethos

361
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,639
Pulling yourself up by your

362
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,175
It is very bootstrap

363
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,735
It's true but it's also very risky

364
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,783
I mean and I mean in a safe

365
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:51,807
The way

366
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,087
Not just in a financial

367
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,111
It is both

368
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:57,183
First off someone could get hurt building out their house

369
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:01,023
Which means you'd have to do with both a medical and illegal emergency

370
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,071
In the States you know there be

371
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,095
Litigation

372
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:04,863
Issues

373
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,655
Right I mean if you

374
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,679
We're working

375
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,471
Building your floor ceiling

376
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:10,751
And you fell down

377
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,543
States maybe you was

378
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,567
Sue the developer

379
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,359
Look for Doctor stoloff

380
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:20,991
The biggest hurdle to an incremental building project working in the US isn't a matter of safety

381
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:21,759
Legality

382
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,039
It would be embarrassing

383
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:27,391
Rights of the United States of America can only build poor people have a house

384
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,439
Movie ashamed of ourselves

385
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:33,279
Even though in fact that might end up providing way Murphy

386
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,815
People with adequate housing

387
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:35,839
At the end of the day

388
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,399
But we couldn't do it it's like we lose face

389
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,191
Because unlike Thule

390
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,215
United States

391
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,239
Does have the money

392
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,799
And perhaps also unlike July

393
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:47,103
We don't like to spend money on poor people

394
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:51,199
I think everybody should be able to

395
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,991
Find their own way out of poverty

396
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:57,343
And it's just not true but that is the expectation

397
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,367
And

398
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,927
We are not in a scarcity

399
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,487
And we could afford to

400
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:04,767
People and Tire

401
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,559
But by and large

402
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,327
We don't

403
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,143
The US it's not a matter of scarcity

404
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,935
It's a matter of values

405
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,983
Elemental however

406
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:16,287
Has come to see scarcity as a tool

407
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:19,103
A tool which Juan Ignacio cerda

408
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,127
Find vital

409
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,919
I'm sure that in the states

410
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:28,063
Everything have rules and controls so you don't leave room to all those new things and came up

411
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,087
From Latin word

412
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:32,159
That obviously come comes from

413
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,463
So if you had if you're doing this project

414
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,279
Unless it's at the very last minute

415
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,815
Had to go okay we're going to double your budget

416
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,119
Would you would you would have made

417
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:41,887
Everyone Full House

418
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:48,287
Theoretically

419
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,055
You still want to go

420
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:55,199
It's a good thing to deliver whole house but if you give me double the money I keep their houses it is

421
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,223
And I improve

422
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:59,295
With all that money the public space surrounding the house

423
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,063
The neighborhood

424
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:06,207
Providing the infrastructure that people can't provide themselves like parks and libraries and public transit

425
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:09,279
Is at the very root of the sites and services approach

426
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,815
Building half a house

427
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,351
Might be the best way

428
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,887
To make a community

429
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:22,335

Between the beats

441

Bongs and Charter of our devices

442
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:07,135
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man made sound

443
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,159
If

444
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:14,559
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife is

445
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:18,655
All hearing that voice

446
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,423
Technology

447
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,191
You talk to us

448
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,495
It is a creation of Sonic trash

449
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:25,567
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

450
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:29,151
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

451
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,943
To make them more human

452
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,039
Turn the living room lights on

453
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:36,831
Okay

454
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,367
Dim the living room lights

455
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,391
50%

456
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,439
Okay

457
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:47,583
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

458
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,887
Makes for a much more natural

459
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:50,655
Experience

460
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,447
Turn the living room lights on

461
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,775

Constipation abdominal pain and bloating yourself it's not that bad you take laxatives modify your diet

Size routine

472

But thinking about it all the time is frustrating

473
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:34,687
It doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again and you don't know why

Series from Bellow radio TV show the truth

486
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,424
The body genius is a Dark comic mystery

487
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,704
That whines through a

488
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,752
Treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

489
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,288
We're looking the part

00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,824
Might cost you your life

491
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:39,200
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

492
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:43,552
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

493
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:46,880
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like

494
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:47,904
A dad

495
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,256
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

496
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:56,608
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that kind

497
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:57,632
I think

498
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:04,032
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

499
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:07,360
Was found dead in my private gym

500
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:10,688
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

501
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:15,040
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

502
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:18,368
Now I need to clear my name

503
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:24,768
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes to find them

504
