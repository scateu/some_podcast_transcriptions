This is 99% invisible

38
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,496
I'm Roman Mars

39
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:52,896
The name is important

40
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:56,480
Tip of the spear with any product

41
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:02,880
And you're bombarded by thousands of names everyday

42
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:06,976
And the daily barrage of names only the names that are most interesting

43
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,768

45
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,632
If it's any kind of consumer product

46
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,168
Like from

47
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,216
PNG or

48
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,496
Sony

49
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:19,264
It's going to be a name

50
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,312
Company that did it you might not know it but

51
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,872
And naming companies

52
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:26,176
Event companies that name thing

53
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,504
Are responsible for many of the proper nouns that you remember

54
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:30,784
Naming it

55
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,088
Weird little area and

56
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,368
Their business right

57
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,392
And then there's Market

58
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:36,928
And then there's Brandon

59
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:43,328
And then there's naming naming is so small they're so really there so few naming companies there's like 20

60
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:45,120
And Laurel founded one of them

61
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:51,264
My name is Laurel son I'm one of the co-founders of catchword where a naming from here in the Bay Area and cats word

62
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,080
Comes from those guiding words at the top of the dictionary

63
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:55,872
Those are the cats words

64
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,664
Most people don't know it doesn't matter

65
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,688
It just is

66
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:01,504
What we do so we're about words

67
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,296
And where about where they're catching

68
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,088
She and her team of worked on everything

69
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,392
Align of yogurts for Chobani

70
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:10,464
The Palm Pre gaps customer rewards program

71
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,488
They have named

72
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,512
As they put it

73
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,048
Everything except

74
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:14,816
A car

75
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:20,448
You might think hey I need my dog or my kids or my band or my

76
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,216
But

77
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:24,288
There are a number of things to consider when designing the name

78
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:27,616
Just think of all the associations with every word

79
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,896
Take for example

80
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:29,920
Photoshop

81
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,480
Sweet name Photoshop

82
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,016
But we did

83
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,552
Come up with the elements

84
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,856
And that word

85
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:41,440
Took a lot of work because Photoshop was looking to Market a lesson

86
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:46,304
Expensive version of their software that had all the same capabilities as regular Photoshop

87
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:48,096
Just without all the bells and whistles

88
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:54,752
You would think that that would be easy but it wasn't so they didn't want to use Photoshop template for Photoshop basic or anything that sound

89
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:55,520
Founded compromise

90
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,824
So we went through a really large

91
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,848
Operation of

92
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,128
All the different ways that we could

93
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:02,176
Say just as good but

94
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,200
Not as

95
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:03,968
Full

96
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:04,736
Pledge

97
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:07,296
And with the essentials wheel

98
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:10,624
Just every word elements

99
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,904
For its subtlety

100
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,952
Elements are the most basic

101
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:14,720
Parts that

102
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,768
Can have but they're essentially have anything

103
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:20,351
So that's the word that we eventually chose

104
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,143
And that's why you hire that

105
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,191
To consider this stuff

106
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,983
And they don't come cheap

107
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:26,751
The

108
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:30,335
Vast majority of naming companies like us

109
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,615
Are pretty expensive

110
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,431
Maven companies don't just make up names

111
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:38,271
They also check what names are available for URLs in for trademark

112
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:41,343
And they see which names mean bad things in other languages

113
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,367
We can take

114
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:45,695
I need list of names and check them in any language in the world and say

115
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,719
Is it pronounced

116
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:53,631
Does it have negative meaning and outside of the u.s. is it is there a brand already existing in your country or

117
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:57,471
Some of like a TV show that has the same name that we should be aware of

118
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:01,823
And you can't underestimate the importance of linguistic checks

119
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,127
Once they were naming a little Gadget toy

120
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,431
And one of the names that we could come up with

121
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,455
For them

122
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:13,343
Turned out in Japanese to be a word that meant a small device that doesn't work

123
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:19,743
But more than anything else Laurel and her team at catchword Just Produce 8

124
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:25,887
Con of names as Laurel see that there is a direct relationship between quantity

125
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:26,911
And quality

126
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:33,311
You know the first 500 names that you come up with are going to be really obvious things are already taken or not going to be that in

127
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,079
Interesting

128
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,359
You kind of have to get that out

129
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,639
So catch word

130
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,663
Will generate

131
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:40,223
Over 2000 names

132
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,503
And they present

133
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,039
3252 the client

134
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:46,111
Because

135
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:49,439
They come up with names across the naming Spectrum

136
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,487
Spectrum

137
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,279
Because we're talking about languages

138
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,583
So at one end of the Spectre

139
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:56,863
You have descriptive

140
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,911
And those are names that absolutely just

141
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,447
Describe what the thing is

142
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,983
Classic example

143
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,775
Raisin Bran benefits of

144
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,799
Descriptive names

145
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:10,175
They are self-explanatory that's what that stuff is right it's a box its brand and it has raisins in it

146
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:11,967
You would never

147
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:15,295
How to explain to anybody with this stuff is Shredded Wheat

148
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:19,647
That's what that is it's weird and it's been shredded

149
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:26,047
They are hard to own normally you can't trademark names like this in fact Raisin Bran and shredded we are not trademark

150
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:32,447
Anybody can have cereal and call it Raisin Bran or shorted me so a lot of descriptive names tend to get modified

151
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,751
International Business Machines

152
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,287
Freedom descriptive

153
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:38,079
Overtime they've convinced that

154
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:43,455
IBM the other big drawback is that descriptive names can be limited if you remember there were companies called things like

155
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,223
Like

156
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:44,991
Stamps

157
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:45,759
Right

158
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:48,575
If you ever want to do anything but sell electronic stamps you're screwed

159
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,623
On the other end of the spectrum

160
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,647
You got so-called

161
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,671
Arbitrariness

162
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,487
And apple is a great example of

163
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,791
It doesn't tell you anything about what they do

164
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:58,559
Which allows

165
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:02,399
For flexibility they used to just make computers now they do media

166
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:08,799
They could do anything under that I mean they can make cars

167
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:15,199
Associations maybe Apple implies learning

168
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:19,551
I don't know but it doesn't apply to me

169
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:22,623
Arbitrary names can also just be completely made up

170
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,927
And these kinds are called empty vessels

171
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:31,327
Some examples of Hulu or Exxon or Xerox or Kodak Kodak has absolutely no meaning

172
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:36,191
They only chose it because that great hardcover sound is very

173
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:42,591
Acoustically relevant that is it really cuts through we tend to say that things that start with that hard k sound

174
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:45,151
Are strong things that start with T

175
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:51,551
Also the same way it's kind of a strong or aggressive sounding name whereas an F sound is very soft

176
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:57,951
Too harder to hear it and people just don't respond as well to it the benefits of arbitrary names and empty vessel name

177
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,487
They're easy to trademark

178
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:05,887
Easy to get the domain name for and usually good in languages around the world

179
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:09,727
Explaining to people even get a lot of money behind these kinds of names.

180
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,263
Tell people what they mean

181
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,799
Right okay so you've got this

182
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,847
Descriptive on one end of the spectrum

183
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,383
An arbitrary on the other

184
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:19,967
And most names fall somewhere between the two

185
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:23,551
And Laurel called all these names in the middle suggestiveness

186
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,391
They're not exactly arbitrary and they're not exactly descriptive

187
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,671
Like Microsoft

188
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,695
Microsoft

189
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:36,351
Software for micro computers right it kind of says what it does but not really because it's those two words that

190
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,119
Taylor Swift together

191
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,655
Microsoft

192
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,959
Is an example of a coined word

193
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,775
A word that doesn't exist in the English dictionary

194
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:46,847
But it's made up of familiar words word parts

195
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:51,967
Or sounds Spotify and Nescafe and Netflix are also coin worth

196
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:58,111
They sound like English words but they're not in Laurel and her team generator

197
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,135
A root words

198
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:04,255
You try to find the right vocabulary for the client and what they trying to convey in this name make a list of vocabulary and then you

199
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,023
Okay

200
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:08,607
How can I modify these words and then we have lists

201
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,679
Prefixes and suffixes in English

202
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,983
And then you just start pairing them up

203
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:16,543
For example take the route name

204
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:23,199
From there you can get name Ling namely rename name spot name proprof name

205
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,759
But okay let's be honest

206
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:32,159
There are lots of websites that can match prefixes and suffixes to words and generate big long list for you

207
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,719
But websites are not linguist

208
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:41,119
They can't tell you what names are actually good that's where the skill and the creative Talent comes in is

209
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,655
Figuring out what's a good word

210
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:43,935
And you wouldn't think it

211
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:46,495
But suggested names are really difficult to create

212
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,543
Because you want them to have meaning

213
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,079
Walmart Aiken

214
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:52,383
Taken for domain names and trademarks

215
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,687
And as Laurel sees it it doesn't hurt to have

216
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,967
2000 option

217
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,015
But it doesn't have to be this way

218
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:00,831
There are other people who do a very differently they do

219
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,111
10 names at a time

220
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:06,207
That works for them I think it depends on whether you come from

221
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:10,815
More strictly an evening background or whether you come from an ad agency background

222
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,863
Didn't you do it that way

223
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:16,191
We tend to present around

224
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,727
12 names

225
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,751
Because

226
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:21,823
To present too many in the value of any given name

227
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,871
It's drastically reduced

228
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:27,455
Eli Altman is the creative director at a hundred monkeys

229
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:33,855
Another name a company only a few miles away

230
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,647
Riders you're bound to get a good name

231
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,439
It's kind of a joke about the process

232
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,743
They give their client a list of 12 names

233
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,303
It's not like a hundred monkeys produces

234
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,095
Fewer names because they're lazier

235
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,399
You guys just have a really different philosophy

236
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,167
Safita Nae Nae

237
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:50,239
Some people think that naming is about linguistics

238
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,287
We are not of that philosophy

239
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:55,359
Names are all about the stories that they begin to tell

240
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:58,943
Eli and his team do not make coin words are empty vessels

241
00:10:59,199 --> 00:10:59,967
I just don't think

242
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,735
That's

243
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,807
Think about names

244
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,415
Things like that

245
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,463
We're much more interested in

246
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,511
History of a word

247
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:13,791
Backstory

248
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,655
Really these guys are very intimate ology and narrative

249
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,191
At the meeting I said in on

250
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:24,031
What name was the small town in Europe where a famous mathematician was born

251
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:27,359
Others were inspired by anatomical charts and constellations

252
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:32,223
100 monkeys has the dinner party in mind names that lead to conversation

253
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,247
And in this way

254
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:36,831
Eli and his team have named front porch senior living communities

255
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:37,599
The lot

256
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,391
Which is the Rhode Island state lottery

257
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,951
Start here the Microsoft Windows tutorial

258
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,743
Yeah their names a lot of different things

259
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:46,047
Company's product services

260
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:46,815
Mysterious

261
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,863
Slim series

262
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:52,447
Yeah it's true it's called condition diaper eating

263
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,471
Theory for

264
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,495
How

265
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,519
Fast food

266
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,543
Companies

267
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,359
Design food to make it irresistible

268
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:02,943
Okay condition type reading was kind of a departure for a hundred monkeys

269
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:05,247
Normally that go for more poetic names

270
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,295
It's just really about

271
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,087
Finding as many

272
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,135
Interesting words as you can

273
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,951
Secret Service codenames 2

274
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:14,719
Rundown

275
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,255
Theaters to

276
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,791
Types of wind

277
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,839
Ocean currents

278
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:22,911
And so where is Laurel season naming Spectrum

279
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,471
Eli Envision sort of a name taxonomy

280
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:28,543
And the classifications breakdown

281
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,823
25 species

282
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,383
25 categories of names

283
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,919
Which he listens book

284
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,199
Don't call it that

285
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,479
Names that are

286
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,247
About people

287
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,271
Tesla

288
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,575
Invented characters

289
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,879
Jolly Green Giant mr. clean

290
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,487
Crown Royal

291
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:51,071
And it's not like some of these categories are good and some are bad

292
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,351
They're just a lot of option

293
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:59,007
It mostly comes down to what kind of story if any you want behind your name some clients really want

294
00:12:59,263 --> 00:12:59,775
I'm meeting with name

295
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:05,663
Remember made up names are easier to register domains are trademarks for and are less likely to offend

296
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:11,295
And if it's a meaningless word if it's just a completely coined made-up word you can make up any story you want around it

297
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,087
Anemic Hulu for example

298
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:19,743
As far as I know doesn't actually have any real meaning I know that Hulu the the inventors of that have a story around

299
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:23,583
And that name I don't think it's true it's a cool name because it's short it's easy to remember

300
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,375
Visually it's very interesting looking

301
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,935
So now you don't need to have a story around

302
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,983
Is this

303
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:33,311
If you got enough money you could pick any old name to do it

304
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:37,663
You could pick a name as meaningless as hello yep moneytalks

305
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,199
If you have a ton of money

306
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,247
Basically the name could be any

307
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,551
Remember when the iPad was about to come out

308
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:49,951
Everyone thought it was the silliest and you heard all kinds of sanitary napkin jokes but now do cheer

309
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:52,255
Force of will and advertising dollars

310
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,047
You don't think twice about it

311
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:57,119
But with a name like iPad at least you can pronounce it

312
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:00,703
Can you imagine reading Xerox for the first time

313
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,495
X0x

314
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:05,823
Sirope

315
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,359
Fair Oaks

316
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:15,295
Before they get their new name companies and products usually have little internal codenames or nickname

317
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,575
Like Project X

318
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,855
Store they get named after someone

319
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,135
Cat or something like that

320
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,415
Sometimes

321
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,695
Unfortunately

322
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:25,279
With the companies will often happen they will have a code name

323
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,607
That someone internally has chosen which is actually pretty good

324
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,655
And people get buried

325
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,423
To it

326
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:35,007
And then we have to convince them that they can't use it

327
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:35,775
Because

328
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,823
It's probably not available as a trademark

329
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:38,847
So

330
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,383
Sometimes we have a little

331
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,431
Ceremony

332
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,711
Like a grave

333
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:47,551
Seriously we've actually done this where we we have

334
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,831
In our briefing

335
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,623
Will put up a little slide

336
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,647
Where it shows

337
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:57,791
A grave and then we'll have the code name on there almost okay now we could have a moment of silence for your code name because you can't have it

338
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,327
So you have to let it go

339
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,375
We also there for

340
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,983
Name

341
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,359
So what should we name this episode

342
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:15,199
Was going to call it what's in a name

343
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:18,271
I will I will slap you so hard if you call it what's in a name

344
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:22,111
I really will so yeah apparently everybody's use that title to talk about naming

345
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,671
And then I thought I'd go for something you know settler

346
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,439
Like

347
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:28,511
A rose by any other

348
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:34,655
90% of the articles that we've been quoted in have either been what's in a name or a rose by

349
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,423
By Any Other Name

350
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,311
So I don't know what to call this episode

351
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:44,895
Help with recall I don't know I don't know

352
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:48,479
I'd have to give it some thought I can't name on the flashlight

353
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,271
Title TK

354
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,855
Wait I don't get it what

355
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:54,879
Ytk

356
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,159
Title TK meaning

357
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:59,231
Title yet to come like it will fill it in later

358
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:04,095
You working in a newsroom you know like you don't know what the headline has or some little piece of resurgence of stopping and

359
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,119
Figuring it out

360
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:08,703
Is stipend TK and then your editor knows he's going to go back and fill it in later

361
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:15,103
China PTC taste it out better on the page so that you won't miss it when you're going back and

362
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:15,871
Remind

363
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,455
Mexican train
