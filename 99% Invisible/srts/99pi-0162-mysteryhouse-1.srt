I'm Roman Mars

34
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:34,464
What say you lived sometime before 1860 and you wanted to fire a rifle

35
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,352
First you need to pour gunpowder into the powder charge to measure the amount of gunpowder you need it

36
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:45,216
And then you pack down your gunpowder and then bullet into the rifle with a ramrod

37
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:51,616
Can you pull back the hammer and take something called

38
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:54,176
Pull the trigger

39
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,736
That was one shot

40
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:03,392
Then you going to reload wichman pouring out new gunpowder stuffing the gunpowder and the new bullet down with the ramrod

41
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:06,976
Pulling back the hammer

42
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,768
And then you could shoot again

43
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,888
The whole process took at least as long as it just took for me to describe it

44
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,240
And as you can imagine this was all really inconvenient if someone

45
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,264
Was shooting at you

46
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:22,336
But then came the Winchester repeater rifle

47
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,896
That's reporter and then against their dads

48
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:30,016
The Winchester 1866 repeater rifle was a thing of beauty

49
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:35,136
Nickname the yellow boy for its bright brass receiver the gun was sleek

50
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,672
Gleaming and deadly

51
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:40,512
You could fire off 15 shots in just over 10 seconds

52
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:48,192
In the Winchester repeater arrived in the market just in time for the rise of western expansion

53
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,728
The huge

54
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,288
Sweep of manifest destiny

55
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,592
And people migrating

56
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,128
To the western part of North

57
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:56,896
America

58
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,432
That's Mary Jo ignoffo

59
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:02,528
A California historian at deanza College in Cupertino

60
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,296
Weapon

61
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,832
Became a source

62
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,624
Of survival

63
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:07,648
Sun protection

64
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,416
4 people

65
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:11,744
The next iteration of the Winchester repeater

66
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,536
The 1873 model

67
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,072
Was an even bigger hit

68
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:19,168
It was lighter more accurate and it became synonymous with Westward

69
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:19,936
Expansion

70
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:23,520
It came to be known as the gun that won the West

71
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:27,104
But probably only by people who think they won the West

72
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:30,432
The Winchester rifle company was very success

73
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:34,016
The most successful Arms Company in America in the late

74
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:42,208
The Winchester family became fabulously wealthy they live together in this palatial Mansion in New Haven Connecticut

75
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,000
They were harmonious

76
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:44,768
Rich

77
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:45,536
And happy

78
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:51,168
And to make matters happier William Winchester the heir to the family business and Fortune

79
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,960
Married the Girl Next Door

80
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:55,520
The beautiful and intelligent Sarah Pardee

81
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,568
In 1866

82
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,360
Sarah gave birth to a daughter

83
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:02,688
And then came with string of parable

84
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,456
Tragedy

85
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:07,552
They found a baby Annie couldn't absorb protein

86
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:10,112
And even with all the money in the world

87
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:13,184
Sarah couldn't stop her daughter from starving to death before

88
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:13,952
For her eyes

89
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,047
Then five years later Sarah's beloved husband William

90
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,839
Passed away from tuberculosis

91
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,399
He was only 43 years old

92
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,191
After losing her husband

93
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:28,031
Sarah Winchester then lost her father-in-law and her eldest sister

94
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,335
Sarah was not alone

95
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:36,991
Half a lifetime of loneliness lay ahead of her iconic black and white

96
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,271
Film actress Lillian Gish

97
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:42,111
Generating an old documentary about Sarah Winchester

98
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:48,767
With plenty of dramatic flight 1881

99
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:54,399
So Sarah advised her to seek the services of a well-known Boston median

100
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,447
Mr. Adam Coon

101
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,495
And as the legend goes

102
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,543
Through this medium Sarah was able to

103
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,567
Contact your deceased

104
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,335
Husband William

105
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,407
But William had some bad news

106
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:12,063
Her husband's voice told her that she always be haunted by the spirits of those who had been killed

107
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,599
By the Winchester rifle

108
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,671
Someone please give this poor Widow a break

109
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,207
Instructed her to

110
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:21,791
Duplicate them by building a structure that would never be completed

111
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:22,815
A house

112
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:25,119
Which rooms would constantly be added

113
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,399
Provide shelter

114
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:30,239
For the ever-increasing number of Winchester rifle victim

115
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:31,775
Finally

116
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,591
He told her that by doing what he had prescribed

117
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:37,151
He would gain immortality

118
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,967
Winchester rifles had killed a lot

119
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:40,735
The people

120
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,271
Is there a way to appease Argos

121
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:46,111
She would need to build a very very big house

122
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:48,159
And she had the money to do it

123
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:51,487
Having inherited her late husband stock in the rifle company

124
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,279
She was now one of the wealthiest

125
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,047
People in the car

126
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:57,631
And where better to build an ever-expanding structure

127
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,423
Then in the Wide Open West

128
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,471
California

129
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,823
Sarah Leff New Haven to begin a new in California

130
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:11,199
She bought an eight room farmhouse in San Jose and dove into the remodeling project head

131
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:15,295
At any given time there might have been a dozen people working on the house

132
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,575
Carpenters

133
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,855
Kyle Siders painters

134
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,879
Electricians

135
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:22,975
Some reports estimate their house wild from 8 to 26 rooms in the first

136
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:23,743
6 months

137
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,815
And others claimed there was no end to the construct

138
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:31,167
That Sarah Winchester's crew worked on the house in rotating shifts

139
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,959
Twenty-four hours a day for

140
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:34,495
38 years

141
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:42,687
As the construction March forward the house became a tangled Maze of halls and a mash-up of turrets and stained glass

142
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:46,271
You know it has a kind of Haunted Mansion quality

143
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:49,087
That's architectural historian Mitchell Schwartz

144
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,391
Doors that lead nowhere you know

145
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,159
Staircases

146
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,439
Is it stop halfway

147
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:59,839
And because she built over so many years the house was also a wild combination of architectural styles

148
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:03,423
You know every five years or so there was a kind of New Movement

149
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,471
Ainu types of ornaments

150
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,263
Curves are introduced in the 80

151
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,031
90s

152
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:11,103
But for a long time no one was able to see the

153
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:11,871
Hodgepodge

154
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,663
Styles in ornaments in this house

155
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,455
Except Sarah Winchester

156
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,783
Well Sarah and her staff of 18 house servants

157
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:23,135
13 Carpenters 8 to 10 gardeners and to private chauffeurs

158
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,695
Because Sarah Winchester kept to herself

159
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:31,839
Mrs. Winchester did not entertain and she did not open her doors to visitor

160
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:35,935
Supposedly Sarah Winchester was also always shrouded in a veil

161
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:40,287
And she never spoke to strangers or members of the press who inquired about her odd

162
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,311
Building in Denver

163
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:45,919
And because she didn't respond they started formulating their own suggestions

164
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,967
Maybe she's superstitious

165
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:51,807
Maybe she feels guilty that all that money came from guns

166
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,391
Maybe she feels like if she keeps Building she'll never die

167
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:58,719
And so those little stories BK

168
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,487
Came

169
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,535
Factual

170
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:02,815
Analysis

171
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,351
Winchester

172
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:09,215
It's unclear how much of the Sarah Winchester legend is true

173
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,031
We don't know whether she commune with ghosts

174
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,311
At least

175
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,591
She was communing with ghosts

176
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:20,735
What is she built a huge house to placate them or whether she felt guilty about her Fortune coming from guns

177
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:24,063
But after her death those Legends and rumors about her

178
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,343
I lived on

179
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:31,487
After Sarah's death and entrepreneur named John H Brown saw the possibility in the old decrepit estate

180
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:37,375
In 1923 he reopened mrs. Winchester's property as the Winchester Mystery House

181
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:40,703
And ever since it's been the subject of all kinds of

182
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,751
Sudo documentaries on haunted house

183
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,799
Said to be inhabited by ghosts

184
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,847
Inspired by Madness

185
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:49,919
It has the deranged design of a carnival Funhouse

186
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:57,087
When I walked in my my head I get tails

187
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:57,855
The workers

188
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,671
They're still building it on the others

189
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:07,071
For $33 you can buy a ticket and tour Sarah Winchester's house

190
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,119
Maggie and I will be your guide

191
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,399
Today on this day

192
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,167
65 minutes

193
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,239
Beautiful bird and

194
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,031
Hebrew Victorian man

195
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:22,943
I brought my family there we drove an hour we waited in line Michelle. A whole lot of money for tickets because we've never been there and some

196
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,223
Bay Area landmark

197
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:27,039
And if California historical landmark number 8

198
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:28,575
88

199
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,599
If you have a look at

200
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:34,207
The tour points out all the bizarre things about the house

201
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,743
Like the staircase

202
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:40,351
Is that lead to nowhere

203
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,119
Nowhere

204
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,679
And even a door to nowhere

205
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:50,335
I know I can point out that Ms Winchester had the number 13 all around the house

206
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,103
Account search

207
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,127
13 stone

208
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,967
You are going to see a lot of 13th on your tour here today

209
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:59,295
But the highlight of the tour is definitely the Seance room

210
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:03,647
This is the day on shrooms in the middle of the house

211
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,975
This is where Sarah supposedly received directions

212
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:07,743
From the spirit

213
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:11,583
Legend has it mrs. Winchester would come up here every night

214
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:12,863
To speak to the spirits

215
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:15,423
Winchester rifle

216
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:19,775
They seem to be selling the story of the haunted house

217
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,823
And of the haunted mrs.

218
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,639
In a lot of people seem to be buying it

219
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,431
But not everyone

220
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:29,247
The mythology about her

221
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,807
It's not only insulting to her

222
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:35,391
It's insulting to me as a consumer of

223
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,415
Popular culture

224
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,207
Insults

225
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,487
A person's intelligence

226
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,535
That's Mary Jo ignoffo again

227
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,351
And she doesn't believe the haunted mrs. Winchester

228
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:48,703
She wrote a book about Sarah Winchester the challenges of the myths

229
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:52,287
Sarah herself didn't write a memoir or speak to the prize

230
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:57,919
The Mary Jo did find documents that helped her understand who the real Sarah Winchester may have been

231
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:02,527
There were incredible original sources that hadn't been used by anybody else

232
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,575
Letters that she wrote

233
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,623
Correspondence with her attorney

234
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,903
Property records

235
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:14,815
After pouring through documents Mary Jo has come to believe that a lot of the really strange things

236
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:19,423
That we see today and that are emphasized in the mythology about Sarah Winchester

237
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,471
Are completely explainable

238
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:28,127
The stairs to Nowhere for example they probably did lead somewhere once rooms were constantly being tweaked and Ramon

239
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:31,199
Plus the 1906 earthquake had a major effect

240
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:33,247
There are no original blueprints for the house

241
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:37,855
But we do know that the earthquake destroyed the front of the mansion and the third and fourth story

242
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,391
She felt like

243
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,183
The defects of the house

244
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:41,951
Really

245
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:45,023
Came to the fore in the 1960 earthquake

246
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:50,143
And so she kind of was chagrined at her own workmanship that this would happen

247
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,423
Instead of rebuilding

248
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,447
Sarah had workers

249
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,751
Clear away the rubble and make the place safe

250
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:57,055
And then just boarded up the front of the house

251
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:02,431
It's very possible that the stairs led to a room that got destroyed in the quake

252
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:06,527
As for all those thirteens Mary Jo doesn't put a lot of stock in them

253
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:10,367
And she believes that some of them might not be from Sarah Winchester

254
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:13,183
Couple of the man who worked on the house

255
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:19,583
They stated in the 1920s that those references to the number 13

256
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,607
Where added

257
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,631
After her death

258
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:27,519
As to whether Sarah Winchester conducted seances in her supposed Sam's room

259
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,799
It's possible

260
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:33,919
Spiritualism in Santa's we're actually fairly common practice in Sarah Winchester's time

261
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,735
But still Mary Jo find it unlikely

262
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:40,319
Partly because of the location of the room in the middle of the house

263
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:46,207
Anybody who knows about spiritualism or seances know that those are really public

264
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:46,975
Affairs

265
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:49,279
Social Affairs at the very least if not

266
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,071
Public and you would have that in your front

267
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:51,839
Parlor

268
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:56,447
Then again Sarah was a very private person so maybe she did her seances alone

269
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:58,239
The ranch Foreman also

270
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:01,567
Stated that he had actually stayed in that room and it was

271
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,847
Not related

272
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,639
Spiritual

273
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,919
Or superstitious

274
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:12,575
Events at all and lastly in the popular legend about Sarah Winchester her whole building Endeavor was set in

275
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:18,719
Lotion after seeing a medium by the name of Adam Coombs when supposedly put her in touch with her dead husband

276
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:25,119
But Mary Jo gained access to a list of mediums and spiritualists that would have been practicing and New England during

277
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:25,887
Sarah Winchester

278
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:26,655
Does lifetime

279
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:32,287
The name that usually associated with having seen Winchester is not there

280
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:35,103
Adam Koontz may never have existed at all

281
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:38,175
There's some things we'll never know about Sarah Winchester

282
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:43,807
But with Mary Jo does feel like we can know for sure is that Sarah wasn't out of touch with reality

283
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,087
On the contrary

284
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,879
She was rational and savvy

285
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:50,463
This is a woman's so far ahead of her time in financial math

286
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,999
And her real estate invest

287
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,023
And her

288
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:53,791
Bond Park

289
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,559
Portfolio

290
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:55,839
It's

291
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,375
It's really remark

292
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,703
So why does a financially savvy

293
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,751
Forward-thinking woman build such a

294
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,543
Crazy never-ending house

295
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,359
Mary Jo has a different Theory

296
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,151
No ghost involved

297
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,687
She was an architect

298
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,455
Want to be

299
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,759
Sarah Winchester wanted

300
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,039
To be an architect

301
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,111
She loved doing

302
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:18,879
Building

303
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:19,647
Experiment

304
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,951
I love that Arie

305
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:26,303
Sarah Winchester lived at a time when it was highly unusual

306
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,863
To have women architects

307
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,399
And she wasn't license

308
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,447
So her own house was the

309
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:34,495
The perfect place the only place

310
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,287
For her to practice architecture

311
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,335
And it became her playground

312
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:42,943
Sometimes in the middle of a project she lose interest and move on to something else

313
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:48,063
From all this emerging odd and frenetic Confluence of architect

314
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,343
Butter house

315
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,111
Isn't

316
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:52,415
Only a collection of Oddities

317
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:55,231
There's some legitimately Innovative elements to

318
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,023
There's a Solarium with a zinc

319
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,559
Floor it doesn't rest

320
00:14:59,071 --> 00:14:59,839
Hilton for the water

321
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,119
To run off and be used in

322
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:01,887
In the garden

323
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,959
There are also these amazing zigzagging stairs

324
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:07,263
But instead of going up a steep pitch

325
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,055
Rise and shallower in Chrome

326
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,127
Sarah Winchester had debilitating right

327
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,687
And these fairs made it possible for

328
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,967
Her to move about her

329
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:23,135
The legend says that Sarah and her crew worked on her house 24 hours a day for 38

330
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:23,903
Years

331
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:30,303
And that upon hearing of her death or work crew finally sat down there Hammers and walked off the job

332
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:33,119
This is most likely an exaggeration

333
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:38,239
The house was certainly a project that consumed mrs. Winchester's attention

334
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,263
Predict games

335
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:43,615
Finally he told her that by doing what he had prescribed

336
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:46,175
He would gain immortality

337
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,223
And of course

338
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:52,063
She didn't gain immortality from all of her building as a spirited

339
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,087
Supposedly promised

340
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,391
But she did live into her 8

341
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,183
In the end

342
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,719
Whatever her motivations were

343
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:02,815
Sarah Winchester built a house with over 150 rooms

344
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,351
2000 doors

345
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:06,143
47 fireplaces

346
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,167
40 bedroom

347
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,447
40 staircases

348
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,983
17 chimneys

349
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:14,335
13 bathrooms 6 kitchens three elevators to basement

350
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,615
In one shower

351
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:18,687
And spent nearly all of her life

352
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,711
Being
