30
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,672
There's an old story and it goes something like this

31
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,512
A visitor arrives at the Pearly Gates in St Peter

32
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:39,072
If you can meet the greatest General who ever lived

33
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:42,144

No way

37
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,544
That's not the greatest General I mean

38
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,640
That guy isn't even a general I knew him on Earth and he was a cobbler

39
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:53,920
I know

40
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,200
Respond Saint Peter

41
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:57,248
But if he had been a general

42
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,552
He would have been the greatest of them all

43
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,344
The Bitcoin Essure

44
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:04,160
But the story raises some interesting question

00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:21,056
Or maybe if you have the training you could have changed the course of modern dance or particle physics

52
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:23,104
You know I've been a great General

53
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,872

59
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,424
But this idea that you can study something as elusive as creativity and learn step-by-step how to be more

60
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,192
More creative

61
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,728
It was unthinkable

62
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,008
Back in the 1950s

63
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,544
Creativity

64
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,336

66
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,152
Magical about it

67
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,432
Unexpected

68
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,456
It's surprising

69
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,248
That's why people

70
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:04,064
Thought that you couldn't study creativity it was

71
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,928
Nebulous and unconscious and not accessible to

72
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:09,952
Scientific

00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:10,720

What what else shall I say

77
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:22,240
Ravenna helson is a very prominent personality psychologist

78
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:27,104
And she got her start in an unusual department at UC Berkeley in 1949

79
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,688
It was called The Institute of Personality assessment and research

80
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,968
Also known

81
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,992
As I par

82
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,016

00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:39,136
I-4 was was a Institute with procedures for studying

00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:45,792
Personality in a fairly new complicated way we thought we were working

King on something really unique and good for Humanity the scientist a type are attempted what many

86
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,984
People thought was impossible

87
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:58,848
Set a time when creativity was thought to be this kind of magical inexplicable Force

88
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,640
The tie bar set out

89
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,408

00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:10,624
Creative

96
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,976
Ipar invited a whole variety of creative people to come to Berkeley and be studied

97
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:21,375
Authors of fantasy for children women studying at Mills College

98
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:23,679
And writers including some real Heavy Hitters

99
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:26,239
Like Truman Capote in William Carlos Williams

100
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:31,871
But one of the biggest and most successful studies that I parked conducted was with architects

101
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,175
It's always important with architecture

102
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,199
Joe Nichols

103
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:39,039
Play where the largest sample and clearest in some ways

104
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,599
Over the course of four weekend

105
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:44,159
In 1958 and 1959

106
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:48,511
Ipar brought together 40 of the most famous and important architects in the world

107
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,559
Observe them gave them test

108
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,607
And ask them all kinds of questions

109
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:53,887
Including

110
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,679
Some fairly ridiculous one

111
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:58,239
Next 45 minutes

112
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:00,543
We would like to discuss this notion

113
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:03,615
That is what man had developed the Third on

114
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:06,687
Where am I

115
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:10,015
That is an actual recording from the actual study

116
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:13,087
IPod got really famous architect

117
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,623
Richard Neutra

118
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,415
IM Pei Louis Kahn

119
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,975
All the big names of Modern Art

120
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,535
And I love that at one point

121
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,583
They were asked to discuss where

122
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,119
A third arm should go

123
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,143
On the human body

124
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:30,495
I would suggest that the most effective place would if it came right out of the top of your head

125
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,031
I disagree with that

126
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,335
I think it all to come

127
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:39,455
Straight Outta This back between the shoulder blades

128
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:46,623
Ipar scientists observe the Architects if they filled out questionnaires made mosaics out of colored tiles

129
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,183
And discussed hypothetical problems together

130
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:53,279
And what they learned help transform the way people think about creativity today

131
00:05:56,863 --> 00:06:00,191
It all started with one of the first personality psychologists

132
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:04,031
The man who founded ipar and led the charge on the architect study

133
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,335
His name was Donald MacKinnon

134
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:11,199
McKinnon like to start his speeches with that story about the visitor to heaven in St Peter

135
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:17,855
Which makes sense McKennan himself had a vested interest in finding the secret great General hiding within the cobbler

136
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,903
Because during World War II

137
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,463
Kids served in the office of strategic services

138
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:25,023
What was the precursor to the CIA

139
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:31,423
McKinnon's job was to assess the personalities of American troops to see which of them could perform well in,

140
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:38,335
When the war was over he joined the faculty at Berkeley and founded ipar in 1949 to continue his personality

141
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,103
Research

142
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:43,967
But in the mid-fifties ipar switch from studying combat Readiness and efficiency

143
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,247
2 creative

144
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,527
In large part

145
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,551
Because of

146
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,319
Sputnik

147
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,855

Launched the Sputnik

149
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,159
And.

150
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,695
Gave us a huge priority

151
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:57,279
The study how can we make our

152
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,559
Folks

153
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,583
The Americans

154
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,887
More creative so that we can be

155
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:02,911
The Russian

156
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:06,751
The space race was part of why I par embark

157
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:07,775
On this mission

158
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:11,871
They wanted to study the personality that particularly creative people

159
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:18,271
Play categorized a group of analytic creative like scientists and mathematicians and the second group of artistic creative

160
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:19,551
Like painters and writers

161
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:24,415
But then it was just hybrid where it was neither one nor the other

162
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:30,047
They was both and they put architect in. Group

163
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,583
Architect himself

164
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,631

Mathematician and artist

170
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:50,015
Architects were also interesting study subjects because understanding their creative habit

171
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:53,087
Potentially apply to a lot of different kinds of people

172
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,415
Successful Architects have to master numerous rules

They have to be businessmen artist

188
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,831
Everybody will come up with some names then they were raped

189
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,463
Ipar rally to selection of architectural magazine editors and Museum curators and professors

190
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,255
Help select the most

191
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,535
Creative architects

192
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,583
Alive and working in the United States

193
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,119
So they came up with HR

194
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,167
And out of that

195
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,471
The circuit is write letters of invitation

196
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,263
So some folks

197
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,543
Never return

198
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,335
Buy Frank Lloyd Wright never answer

199
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,871
But they actually did convince

200
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,663
40 of The Architects on their list

201
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,711
Come down on four separate weekend

202
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,503
And they warned them

203
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,295
This is not going to be easy

204
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,575
Uses the grueling

205
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,367
United furnace

206
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,671
McKinnon said this is not going to be a relaxed

207
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,439
The Weeknd

208
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,743
The test began pretty much right away

209
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:08,351
As soon as the Architects arrived at the fraternity house that I par had borrowed for the study

210
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:11,679
They had just 15 minutes of introduction before they took their first test

211
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:14,495
It was constant over the course of the weekend

212
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:18,847
The Architects would be asked to make mosaics to assess their aesthetic sensibilities

213
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:21,151
Good in-depth interviews about their childhood

214
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,455
And even see if they could be hypnotized

215
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:28,063
And during the downtime they were still being observed by researchers with clipboard

216
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,111
Even cocktails and dinner is it

217
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,391
It's the time of study

218
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,415
It's a very very tights

219
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:35,487
But my favorite test The Architects did

220
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:38,559
Was one I park called the ethics problem

221
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,351
The ethics problem

222
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:45,727
Groupon I like it because it deals with a question that comes up all the time or I could

223
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:47,263
Enter creative

224
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,543
People all kinds actually

225
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,103
It's about whether a creative person

226
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,919
Should be willing to sacrifice part of their Vision to

227
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:54,687
Please

228
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,455
Client

229
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,759
At one of the test Type R did

230
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,039
Were they actually work

231
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,063
Where did the architect

232
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:00,831
Having this

233
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,367
Discussion in the course

234
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,647
Without you

235
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:04,927
Realize

236
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,719
Self-absorbed

237
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,511
Collegial

238
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,279
Architect

239
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,815
Group number for

240
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,095
April 25th

241
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:17,727
So in this discussion group on April 25th 1959 we're going to focus on three characters

242
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:21,567
And to keep them all straight we've got a musical cue for each one

243
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,151
The first and foremost is architect Eero Saarinen

244
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,711
Who designed St Louis Arch

245
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:33,343
The Dallas airport Dynamic soaring structure that blend sculpture and architecture

246
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:36,415
He is Iconic today and was a superstar then

247
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,975
It was a huge deal that he participated in the study

248
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:41,535
The second character we're going to talk about in this group is

249
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:47,935
Philip Johnson the minimalist architect responsible for Lincoln Center and The Glass House

250
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:54,335
Work is very Square their tithing actually the selection committee described Philip Johnson as

251
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,639
Perfection of certain limited aims

252
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:59,199
Very disciplined all of his work

253
00:10:59,455 --> 00:10:59,967
Completely destroy

254
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,503
Regards human beings

255
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:04,319
And the Third characters will focus on

256
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,879
Was a promising up-and-coming architect

257
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,671
Victor Monday

258
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,463
36 years old

259
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,999
He was the youngest and least

260
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,023
Established in the group

261
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,071
The very small but very impressive

262
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:15,839
Portfolio

263
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:19,935
Okay so the virtuoso Eero Saarinen

264
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,215
The perfectionist

265
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,495
Bill Johnson

266
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:25,311
The young upstart Victor Lundy

267
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,615
Along with two other architects

268
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:32,735
Reserve cocktails and given a hypothetical situation concerning a hypothetical architect

269
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,015
Mr Brown

270
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,807
Mr Brown is faced with a

271
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:36,575
Difficult decision

272
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:37,855
Is just finished

273
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:40,415
The preliminary drawings for very challenging and important

274
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,183
Structure

275
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,487
His client has told him that he likes me

276
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,023
Nebraska postal very much

277
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,071
I will accept it if he will change

278
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,863
One fairly important aspect

279
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:55,519
Basically the client would like to design altered in a specific way and says he will have to reject mr. B

280
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,799
Brown's proposal if

281
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:57,823
The changes made

282
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,127
Brown really hates this alteration

283
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,407
But

284
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:04,223
This commission is highly prized and prominent

285
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:07,551
Coarse Brown want the client to be happy with the building

286
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:10,111
And he has to support himself and his practice

287
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,159
Factors

288
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,183
Phone ring

289
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,511
If you were Brown

290
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,047
What would you do

291
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:18,815
The architect

292
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,095
Then had to decide

293
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:22,655
Should Brown accept the change

294
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,191
What is the project

295
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:28,287
No I would like you to discuss the issue candidly among yourselves and rejoin

296
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,591
35 minutes

297
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:38,527
This archival audio has never been heard in any public way before like maybe only 10 people have heard it

298
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:42,111
So just sit back for a second and listen to the architect

299
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,391
And the ice

300
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,927
Clicking in their glasses

301
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,535
Discerning the Visionary

302
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,327
Starts the discussion

303
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,679
Sean should I dissipated

304
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:03,615
Concerning says that since Brown doesn't have any other solution prepared

305
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:06,431
You should walk away

306
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,199
The job at this

307
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,207
Let's fill up this regard to human beings Johnson butting in

308
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:21,023
It's a problem that's contrary to experience

309
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,839
It sounds very much like you've been reading iron rack

310
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:26,655
It sounds like you've been reading I am round

311
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:29,471
Johnson is referencing the book The Fountainhead

312
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:32,287
Where the main character is a fiercely independent architect

313
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:35,871
To blows up his own building rather than compromise with a client

314
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:39,967
Make no mistake Johnson would also refuse the clients changes

315
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,015
But he just thinks this whole scenario is it

316
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:42,783
Absurd

317
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,063
No good architect

318
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,343
Would let this happen with a

319
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:48,671
I answered there that I would

320
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,375
And I never heard of it happening

321
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:03,007
Have you actually seven and has been challenged by a client on a recent Commission

322
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:03,775
And

323
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,055
Is threatening to quit

324
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,895
Monday I have to get to

325
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,199
Quit

326
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:14,015
You expect to win by quitting

327
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,039
I say that

328
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,575
The only part

329
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:19,903
Yes

330
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:28,095
Would you say that the case is

331
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,887
Hopeless as intended

332
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:32,959
Victor Lundy the Young Gun piping up

333
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:36,287
I confess that I have to admit the possibility of the

334
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,871
Maybe there is a

335
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:40,895
Something

336
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,943
And what the client is leading to

337
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,759
Result in a better thing

338
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,295
The work of architecture

339
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,575
Really really good

340
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:49,855
Well then

341
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,135
The owner will say it

342
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,415
Sam dubs

343
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:03,167
Well know I'm young but I've seen some old thing

344
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:14,175
You Givin now the design can only get worse and worse than you worse for your reputation because of the function represented by

345
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,967
What is the future look

346
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:22,367
At the end of 35 minutes the group concluded that Mr Brown should reject the clients changes and walk away from the broad

347
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:27,487
This was the conclusion that all of the different architect groups ultimately came to

348
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:31,071
Having this option is for the luxury of being a very famous architect

349
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,375
I hope in all of this that

350
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,655
John brown was right

351
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:43,359
After 3 grueling days of tests

352
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:47,455
After all the Architects went back to their respective practices all over the country

353
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:49,503
The state still wasn't quite over

354
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,575
The Architects were mailed surveys and questionnaires

355
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,135
To rank each other

356
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:58,463
Some Architects refuse to rank themselves and their peers

357
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,231
Others

358
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:00,255
Jump Right In

359
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:03,071
Philip Johnson rated himself number one

360
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,607
Not surprisingly

361
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,423
But Saturday and Brady Johnson number 2

362
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,703
After himself

363
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,239
Frontier number one

364
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:13,567
But the fact that people put themselves number one also talks about

365
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,591
The conception of

366
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,127
Clearly

367
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:23,551
And The Architects conceptions of themselves messed with the findings from a lot of the other studies that iPod

368
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,831
Far had done over the years

369
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,135
The researchers began to notice

370
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,159
Certain patterns

371
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:30,463
Cross creatives of all professions

372
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,487
All genders

00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,279
Funding

375
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:37,375
But we got the same characteristics associated with a

376
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:41,471
People who were rated highest whether they would chemists or artists

377
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,007
Another feels

378
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,359
It turns out all different kinds of creative people met similar descriptions

379
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:50,431
Has an interesting interesting personality

380
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:55,039
Is non-conforming and has high aspirations for self

381
00:16:55,807 --> 00:17:00,159
Also creatives preferred complexity and ambiguity over Simplicity in order

382
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:03,487
Creative had the capacity to make unexpected connections

383
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,279
Easy patterns in daily life

384
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:06,559
But

385
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,863
Creative people didn't necessarily

386
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,911
Have to have high IQs

387
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:13,215
Intelligence isn't as important

388
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,751
The creativity is

389
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,543
People thought it was

390
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,639
So I guess that's another thing we found

391
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,687
Average intelligence will do

392
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:28,575
And it's not as if this is directly related to intelligence but the school grade point average for the architect

393
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:29,855
What's a salad

394
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:30,879
B minor

395
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,927
So I par found that creative people

396
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:35,743
NTB non-conforming interesting

397
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,559
Interested independent courageous

398
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,839
And self-centered

399
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:46,239
Pretend to be they don't have to be a certain traits and they come up over and over again unless the creative person

400
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:49,823
But it doesn't mean that they're going to be exactly

401
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:52,639
I feel like I kind of couldn't guess all those right

402
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:55,455
I think it's a lot easier to

403
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:58,527
So we should have known that all along after weave

404
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,295
Found it

405
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:03,903
This idea of the creative personality was remarkable at the time

406
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:06,719
Ivar's findings were lauded and spread

407
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,999
But over the years

408
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,559
People began to think about personality differently

409
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:13,887
In the seventies an argument with emerging but maybe

410
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:16,191
Personality wasn't something innate within us

411
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,471
Maybe

412
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,775
Personalities are the results of our environment

413
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:20,799
Social expert

414
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,871
I part and their mission work

415
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:24,895
Called into question

416
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:27,199
The 1970s

417
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,223
Was it

418
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:31,807
Durable. For personality psychologist

419
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,879
I should tell you about that

420
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:37,951
We had trouble getting grants we had trouble

421
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:40,255
Getting Papers accepted and

422
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:43,839
And we had this horrible empty feeling ourselves

423
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,887
Ipar ended in 1990

424
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,703
Became what is now known as Apes

425
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,775
The Institute of Personality and Social

426
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,639
Which is expanded focus a lot more on social and cultural context

427
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:59,199
Beyond analyzing individuals

428
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:04,319
But just because people aren't using ipart's methods does not mean the study was all for not

429
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:08,927
I parred did proof that creativity wasn't this mysterious Untouchable thing

430
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:14,047
The study

431
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,839
This is ocean vartanian

432
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:21,471
At the University of Toronto his area of expertise is creativity and Aesthetics research

433
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,263
You take any kind of course

434
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:25,823
Creativity

435
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,175
Because they're considered to be the

436
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,199
First place

437
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:33,247
The scientific study of creative personnel

438
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:38,623
Today researchers don't study creativity as a complete concept like iPod tried to

439
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:41,183
Instead of studying it as a whole topic

440
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,719
It kind of break it up into

441
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:46,047
With a chunk that I'm particularly interested in is

442
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,071
The neuroscience

443
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:49,631
What

444
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:50,911
Rainbow

445
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:55,007
Ocean also studies architect

446
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,287
And their creativity

447
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,823
Rather than using

448
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,871
Say hypothetical discussion questions

449
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:02,687
He will put them into an fmri machine

450
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,479
To look at blood flow in the brain

451
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,247
Biggest northern

452
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,063
People design

453
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,111
As a person

454
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,647
Coming up with the room

455
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:12,927
And pasta

456
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:13,695
Braintree Mall

457
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:19,583
But even though oceans techniques are really high tack his research has its roots

458
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,119
Cine type-r studies

459
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:23,423
He thinks that they were really significant

460
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:25,727
Major countries

461
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,287
Backstreet show that

462
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,311

465
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,639
If you want to understand create

466
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,431
And if nothing else

467
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:36,991
The lasting Legacy indeed ipar studies

468
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:39,807
Maybe these recordings of these great architect

469
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:42,111
Is a discus essential creative problem

470
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:44,159
Like where

471
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,183
In the body

472
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:46,975
To put up there in arm

473
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:49,791
Then it would be rather unsymmetrical

474
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:53,375
And I I don't think it would be as pleasant as if we could have could we have four

Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices

503
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:35,008
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

504
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,032
