33
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:12,352
Looked up at this building the Hancock Building there's the Sears Tower

00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,376
Willis Tower

35
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,936

In the South Loop

38
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:22,080
A couple days ago I was at the cultural center

00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,480
How is everything

43
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,528
And this building is not on it

44
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:35,136
Even if a building is designed by a prominent Architect by this guy everywhere

45
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,672
Who made the DC Metro

46
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:43,072
He's a big deal and even if that building has only three sides like a triangle from above

47
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,352
Like a grilled cheese sandwich

48
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46,400
Cut in half diagonally

49
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:50,752
Irregularly Place long vertical window slats to like a

50
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:54,336
Punch card or a Scantron car it's still hard to stand out

51
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,128
As a skyscraper

52
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,152
In Chicago

53
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,968
I remember the first time I noticed

54
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,528
What is that building someone there was like

55
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,392
My name is Jack heart rate

56
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:09,696
I was the project manager

57
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,232
Campbell

58
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,256
Correctional Center

59
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,424
Which most people know at the Metropolitan Correctional Center or MCC Federal Detention Facility

60
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,192
Stay

61
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:22,752
When you're waiting to go up on trial in the federal courthouse

62
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:29,152
Just like two blocks away when it was built nobody much like the idea of a federal jail downtown

63
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:33,248
Didn't want this building built in the loop right across the street

64
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:37,088
The club called the Union League club which is one of the kind of fancy Elite

65
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,112
Clubs

66
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:38,880
In the city

67
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:43,488
If it were like we don't want prisoners you know mooning us front the windows of the jail

68
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,280
And it doesn't seem like it's going to be really good for

69
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:48,096
Property values so there was a lawsuit actually

70
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,888
Did they are legal misfortune

71
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:53,472
Had to bring the suit in federal court to the only people who are going to hear the suit

72
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,288
We're also the only people in Tonawanda being built

73
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,056
Are federal judge

74
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:00,896
And I think it took them about

75
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:07,552
12 minutes to get things kicked out of the Court it was impossible to get a judge that was

76
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:08,576
Favorability

77
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:14,720
The Architects and Harry Weese is group or tickled by the prospect as well in the building said

78
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:21,119
I think everybody in the office figured that you had a certain number of unindicted criminals in the city

79
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:26,239
Some did it got caught the MCC was just the people who have got caught

80
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:32,639
And because the Architects took it seriously that the inmates were innocent until proven guilty they thought

81
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:36,991
Places we can you know somebody look at this problem how do you make a a really small space

82
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:37,759
Cozy

83
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:43,135
Harry startup view this from the standpoint of the accommodations on sailboats

84
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:48,255
Furniture was all built in so you could really do pretty nice furniture

85
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:52,607
Built-in hardwood Furniture has he's really clean line the bed

86
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,167
CVS pictures

87
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,191
You know tonight

88
00:04:56,447 --> 00:05:02,591
We built rooms to scale in our office and my chill

89
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:08,991
Used to come down and take naps and that they loved the Interior Space it was you know kind of

90
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:12,319
Manomet Pleasant the Cozy

91
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:15,647
And those narrow slit windows I mentioned earlier

92
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:19,487
Those are floor-to-ceiling windows to let in as much light as possible

93
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:23,327
But they're also built just narrow enough at 5 inches

94
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:26,399
So that they were within the federal guidelines of the time

95
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:32,799
And not need bars

96
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:36,383
It's not a bad Flex Tuesday

97
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,735
Hotel

98
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:43,807
Well we were doing a hotel at the same time and

99
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,087
This was better than

100
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:51,231
The hotel as far as the building furniture and all of that

101
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,279
Show me the hotel

102
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,863
Dan is a reporter tenacity like you wouldn't believe

103
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:03,263
But he just couldn't get the warden to let him into the MCC to see if all these beautiful Harry Weese Interiors

104
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,799
And Designs were still intact

105
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,335
So I called around

106
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:08,127
Thinking like who gets inside is

107
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,431
And I ended up talking

108
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,967
To a guy named Phil Kerrigan

109
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:15,039
If you would into the facility and talk to a random

110
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,831
Bunch of the tdz

111
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:17,855
They would be

112
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,135
I guess that that

113
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,159
Description

114
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,439
Or

115
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,207
Would it be one

116
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:22,975
Wolverine

117
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:23,999
Cut your throat

118
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,815
That is not the case

119
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:31,935
Phil Kerrigan has been going to the MCC for over 10 years

120
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:32,703
CC

121
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,263
And he goes and visits guys who don't have anybody else to visit them

122
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,335
Got to stop

123
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,103
It's

124
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,383
Very drab

125
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,431
Gunmetal Grey

126
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,223
You know the physical

127

131
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:50,879

But none of them have

147
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,671
Are the timed and talk with Robert brugman who wrote a book about hearing

148
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,463
He was pretty bummed out

149
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,999
There's something about

150
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,535
Despacito

151
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,119
Harry Weese

152
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:34,911
Brilliant

153
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:35,679
Architect

154
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,471
And it seems like it's one of his signature

155
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,031
His concept

156
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:44,127
Exist but you know

157
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:47,199
He's going down all of the country

158
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:50,783
And that's true of them almost all Arkansas

159
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,087
Is a minor matter

160
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,623
The inside of a place

161
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,159
It was never meant to be public

162
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,439
Changed

163
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,255
It is after all not Hotel

164
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:06,911
Even if the warden had let Dan into the MCC it wasn't the MCC that he wanted to see

165
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,447
That matter

166
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:11,263
Wasn't the MCC that Harry Weese wanted either

Before we go I want to tell you about the body genius a five-part series from fellow radiotopia show the truth

176
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,199
The body genius is a dark

177
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,223
Comic mystery

178
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:27,807
That whines through a treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

179
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,087
We're looking the part

180
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,879
Might cost you your life

181
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:35,999
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

182
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:40,351
Or lose a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

183
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:44,703
