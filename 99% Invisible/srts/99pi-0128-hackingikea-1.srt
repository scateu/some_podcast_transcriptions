24
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:19,360
And this is friend of the show Sean Cole and yes he said Ikea Hack

Feel good about it

26
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,432
Feels

27
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:24,736
Subversive

28
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:27,808
And a little bit bourgeois

29
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:30,112
It's like being a

30
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,136
Hunk member of

31
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:32,160

You are audience

34
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,072
You probably heard like you had came

35
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:41,632
It's the practice of buying stuff from Ikea

36
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:45,728
And then re-engineering a packing it into customized

37
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,520
More functional than often just

38
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:49,312

00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:57,248
Sean has decided upon the calyx variety

43
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,832
Plus two very heavy wooden doors from Home Depot

44
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:07,232
All of which he is drooling and screwing and folding together into one big beautiful queen

To become experts Hollis assemblers

55
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:32,320
The locus of the Ikea hacking movement is a website called Ikea hackers. Net it's a showcase for those who would trick

56
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,856
Work out there calyxes

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,120
Guide to how they made them

61
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:47,936
Ikea hackers. Net has been in the news a lot lately

62
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:50,240
And not for happy reasons

63
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,544
You might have read the stories online

64
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,592
We're going to get into all that later

65
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:55,360
But first

66
00:02:55,616 --> 00:03:01,248
I wanted to introduce you to my hacker partner-in-crime Jonathan Bean for bolts

67
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:08,928
He's an assistant professor at Bucknell University back in 2009 he co-wrote a serious academic paper

68
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:14,816
About Ikea hacking with Daniela rossner who now teaches design at the University of Washington

69
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:19,680
And I got interested in part because of how bendable the term Ikea hacking is

70
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:20,960
Here's Jonathan

71
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:21,984
There was so much fun

72
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,288
Nervous about what Ikea hacking

73
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,336
Could be it could be anything from

74
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,640
I bought the Shelf at Ikea and it was an inch

75
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,408
To long for

76
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,176
My closet

77
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,456
So I cut an inch off of it

78
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,480
Orbitz

79
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:35,808
Will you just take us a salad bowl and make it into a light

80
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:38,624
And this is Daniela right that's not even actually

81
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,440
Changing the object itself it's just changing it

82
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,488
And at the other end of the spectrum

83
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,256
An artist

84
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,280
Sandra Vaughn boots

85
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,072
Did a very provocative

86
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:48,864
Work of art

87
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,400
Is an Ikea chair

88
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,680
Reconfigure

89
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,216
To look like a

90
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:53,984
Stirrup

91
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,264
Oregon college

92
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,824
And both of these things

93
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,360
Fall under the rubric of

94
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,128
Ikea hacking

95
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,432
That's a really wide rubric

96
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:05,760
And now please put your hands over your children's ears for 20 seconds

97
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:12,928
I really like the Ikea love toy is another example where you take I love toy made of

98
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,208
Are the Orem song

99
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:19,071
Shoe trees and Ikea product the milk frothing device

100
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,655
So taking us together and making a little vibrator

101
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:27,263
This is a much racier interview than I was expecting it

102
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:34,943
And the hat karate aren't just diverse and turn to their sensibility their diverse in the most basic way pause

103
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,271
Possible UC hack posted from all over this country and from

104
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:42,111
Australia Russia Israel Dubai

105
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,135
Posted a hack

106
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,951
That's a French country house Library

107
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:48,511
Hunan actual French country house

108
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:53,375
60 billion Venom bookcases and he has these before and after pictures and

109
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:59,007
Explain know how he did it because everything's exactly the same at Ikea and no matter where you are

110
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,287
It makes it

111
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,823
Assertive lowers the barriers

112
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,359
To recreating something

113
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,383
Is this is the thing

114
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,967
Say I wanted to teach you Roman how to build a

115
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:08,735
Workbench

116
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,527
But you live in Germany

117
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:13,343
And I live in the US if you go in bio

118
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,111
Stud

119
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,927
I would start at Home Depot in the US

120
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:21,791
It's going to be an inch and 1/2 by 3 and 1/2 inch if you go and buy a wood stud at Bauhaus

121
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,327
German home improvement stores

122
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,351
It's going to be a

123
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,143
A different different size

124
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:32,543
Waited to tell me I'm not dreaming and he just said there's a German Home Improvement store called about yes but it's actually Swiss

125
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,079
That's so fantastic

126
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:34,847
I know

127
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:37,407
Ikea in spite of itself

128
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,199
Is the great leveler

129
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:44,575
And it's that very homogeneity that McDonald's like sameness from place to place to place

130
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:48,927
That's what allowing This Global community of hackers to thrive

131
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,207
So if I posted

132
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:52,255
And Ikea Hack in Boston

133
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:56,095
And someone in the Netherlands saw that they could probably reproduce it using this

134
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:59,423
You know the pieces at their local store much like a Lego kit

135
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,447
Make a mistake

136
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:04,031
The actual post themselves of showing your work

137
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,591
That's a huge part of this whole thing

138
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,127
I think that there is something to this

139
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,663
Feeling of recognition

140
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,991
You're not creative unless you're right

141
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,527
Nice is being creative

142
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,295
Yeah

143
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,063
If if

144
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,623
Ikea is hacked in the forest does it

145
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:21,183
Make a sound

146
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:28,095
8oz is Theodore here and I have officially done my first Ikea Hack

147
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:32,959
My first Ikea Hack an Ikea piece I will be modifying

148
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,007
And as you might expect there's a lot of this kind of

149
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:38,079
Hacking and showing and telling on YouTube to

150
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:44,991
By now the search term shouldn't be too mysterious

151
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,527
Transformation pieces which I like

152
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,295
To call them

153
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,319
You call them

154
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:55,231
I'll show you how to customize your hair measure how far my elbows are

155
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,023
Population of this desk

156
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,559
Dallas the only mammal contact

157
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,583
Paper onto the

158
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,887
Top of the table and there we have our

159
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:02,655
Installed

160
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:09,055
6 inch cabinet

161
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:15,455
Parts for my Kia why aren't they I mean if they're good enough to do some frankly pretty remarkable

162
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,223
Things

163
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,271
With these

164
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,831
Materials like why aren't they just

165
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:21,855
Going in

166
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:25,183
Lumber and screws and nails and

167
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,231
Hammering together something

168
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,791
Maybe more lasting and less pressboard

169
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:33,887
Well they're not just hacking and materials right there hacking Ikea

170
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,447
They're hacking the brand they're hacking

171
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,983
What that what that

172
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,543
Brand actually symbolises Beyond

173
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:41,823
Stores

174
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,383
Put another way to quote Danielle and Jonathan

175
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,455
They're mocking the modularity of Ikea

176
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:52,319
Sing this stuff is so tinkertoy I can mix and mashup the hell out of it

177
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,111
It also goes back to that

178
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,903
Homogeneity right that if

179
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,951
This is the McDonald's in furniture

180
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:00,767
I'm going to go against the grain and make a double

181
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:07,167
Triple extra pickle Big Mac with no middle bun in it right is part of your identity you're saying I'm a

182
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,703
Person who transforms things

183
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:11,519
But this is where it gets even more complicated

184
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,799
According to Jonathan

185
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:13,823
Within that group

186
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,847
People who wanted to

187
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,151
Completely transform something

188
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,479
Some of them really wanted to maintain the icky aesthetic

189
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,527
So they would say about this is something we want

190
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,063
That could have come from

191
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,343
I didn't

192
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,879
So there's a sort of

193
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:27,647
Sense of

194
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,719
Sure you want express yourself but you're also trying to see

195
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:34,047
Outdo the door to outwit Ikea right

196
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,583
Write out Ikea Ikea

197
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,935
All right now we're going to lay the

198
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,983
Is shelves down on there

199
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:42,751
Scythe

200
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:44,799
I did not intend

201
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:48,639
We now we're doing this Ikea Hack already in progress

202
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:49,919
Because everyone up

203
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,943
We have built

204
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:53,503
Alex show

205
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,295
WebMD

206
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,599
On their side

207
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,463
It's like my bed is a whale skeleton

208
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,255
Lying on its side

209
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,535
And you're going to be putting

210
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,303
Stuff in the

211
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,071
Rib cage

212
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,935
Door is really heavy doors on

213
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:13,983
Michelle's

214
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:21,407
You sound like an insane person doing

215
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,687
I know

216
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:29,087
You're like Aquaman standing on top of a wild Marine return this is but this is what it's like it's like

217
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:35,743
Taming you know the most plastic in the known universe and Ikea Shelf

218
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:42,143
Onyx side it's us that is usually the Plaza

219
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,983
This is the best part

220
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:48,799
We're about to drill unsanctioned holes

221
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:01,599
So why is this your favorite song

222
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:07,743
I mean I think that's it's just like for the longest time you know you're told that drilling holes where they're not supposed to go

223
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,279
Is destructive

224
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,047
And

225
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:11,583
Wrong

226
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:19,007
And we were doing that and it still transgressive in Deer Crossing a boundary but it's not the destruction anymore

227
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,823
Creation and you know it felt like for once

228
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,615
I wasn't just saying

229
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:29,759
What's out there you know which which one on the menu do I want I wish we were making what we want

230
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:32,575
Yeah but you were still shopping at Ikea

231
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:38,207
True well it's interesting ideas response to that's right it's not

232
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:38,975
The shutdown

233
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:39,743
Ikea hackers

234
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:43,583
Again this is Daniela rossner who co-wrote that Ikea hacking paper

235
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,607
There's a lot

236
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,143
More

237
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,423
Oma support for

238
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,959
For a hiking Within

239
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,495
The corporate world that never was

240
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,055
You're 5 or 6 years ago and I think

241
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,335
Part that is is

242
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:57,151
Corporation seeing that this adds to the

243
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:58,943
Buying in bulk

244
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:04,831
Products and yes this is the moment in the story what we do the ironic tape to tape a juxtaposition

245
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:05,599
Maestro

246
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:14,559
Earlier this week Swedish flat-pack furniture manufacturer Ikea Delta massive blow to the long-running fan

247
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,863
Ikeahackers.net

248
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:23,263
According to a blog post published by founder Jules Yap the site was issued a cease-and-desist order in March

249
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:29,663
This is the news that we alluded to at the beginning around the same time that Sean and Jonathan were hacking together his bed

250
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,199
Unbeknownst to them

251
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:35,039
A brand protection company wrote to the queen bee of Ikea Hack them

252
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:38,367
The woman who runs ikeahackers.net Jewels yeah

253
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:40,159
Jules isn't her real first name

254
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:43,487
The letter basically said that Ikea was not amused

255
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:47,327
And that if Jules didn't stop operating her website the way she was

256
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,375
She could be in big trouble

257
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,399
Hey Jules

258
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:56,799
Hi how are you

259
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,335
Jules agreed to talk to me

260
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,639
She was in Malaysia we talked by Skype

261
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:04,479
Before we get down to business I was just curious how she thought up the side

262
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:07,295
So I was checking out a few

263
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:10,367
Home decor websites and I found

264
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,159
IQ

265
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,463
They're scattered around on the internet

266
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,767
That was when I thought

267
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,863
How great it would be blow if I could see all these Heights in one place

268
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:25,983
No and that was when the light bulb

269
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,263
I knew I had to start it

270
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,311
So that was in 2006

271
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,871
And for some reason only this year

272
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,151
2014

273
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,943
March 12th to be precise

274
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:38,271
Did Jules get an email with the subject line

275
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:42,111
Notification of violation of trademark rights

276
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,391
Wow

277
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:48,255
So I stopped my blood drain literally no I was

278
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,535
It was

279
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,303
Scary

280
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:54,399
Did they want her to do I'm Hanover the domain name

281
00:12:54,655 --> 00:13:00,799
Stop using the Ikea trademark or anything trademarks by Ikea which I think means even pictures of the furniture

282
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:06,175
And she'd have to close down her Twitter and Facebook accounts to another social media staff

283
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:10,271
The thing that's ironic about this thing that I didn't understand right away

284
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,295
Wisdom

285
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,319
Jewels

286
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:16,159
Love's Ikea banshees just

287
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,951
Huge fan

288
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:21,279
I am I guess

289
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,095
Superfan

290
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:30,751
It strikes me that it's like meeting a celebrity that you've always really loved

291
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,567
And like that celebrity

292
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:36,895
Is really mean to you

293
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:40,479
Yeah yeah yeah that was fast close

294
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:46,367
Been given a restraining order celebrity

295
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:51,743
After Jules announced on her website that big changes might be coming to Ikea hackers

296
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,279
The story went viral

297
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,327
People are pretty pissed off

298
00:13:56,095 --> 00:14:00,703
Cory doctorow who blogs on boing-boing famously called the cease-and-desist letter quote

299
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,751
Steaming Bull and quotes

300
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,079
But at this point Jules it was pretty much resigned

301
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:09,151
She thought the best thing you could do is just to comply and then

302
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,455
Transfer the tax over to another site which

303
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,223
Didn't have

304
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,247
Like his name on it

305
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:18,367
If nothing else she was just grateful that so many people reacted so strongly to the news

306
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:23,743
So it was on that Friday night to that I made the announcement at the following week

307
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:27,071
I received a call from

308
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:27,839
IQ

309
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:32,959
From whom at Ikea guy named Anders Westney

310
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,495
He's with the business side of things is

311
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,263
Supposed to be

312
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,383
Legal side

313
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:43,199
And she also took a look at the

314
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,479
The letter

315
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,039
The scientist

316
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,063
Letter and

317
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,623
She said that

318
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,927
She didn't recognize Ikea in it

319
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,743
Really he said that

320
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,303
Legend

321
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,095
You didn't have the

322
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,631
Spirit of the brat

323
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,471
Which is to make life better for everyone

324
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,031
And to that end

325
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:14,175
He told jewels that they wanted to find another way forward and try to figure out how they can resolve things

326
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,223
To come to some agreement

327
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:21,343
I seriously when you called me I was totally speechless I was like yeah

328
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,695
And inside me I was like

329
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:27,999
Screaming

330
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:33,119
Jumping you know if I could

331
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,399
Doing the Ikea dance

332
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,191
Was I crazy

333
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,727
And get this

334
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,775
As we're releasing this podcast

335
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:43,103
Jules is visiting Sweden and Holland

336
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,431
Meeting face-to-face with representatives of Ikea

337
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:50,015
Restoring the concept Center where their products are developed and then

338
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:53,855
Visiting the very Homeland Where it All Began

339
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,135
It's like she's

340
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:58,207
Charlie Bucket live in Willy Wonka's chocolate factory

341
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,487
Yes

342
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,023
I am

343
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,583
ET go home

344
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,887
I mean you get a sense that

345
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:12,031
Thank you would ever truly partner with jewels and make her some sort of minister of hacking in or whatever

346
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,335
We would have been saying is like

347
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,383
And I can't imagine Ikea could

348
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,919
Possibly endorse

349
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:25,087
Any individual hacker hacking on the whole it's just too risky you know I mean if something goes wrong I mean it it would basically be sanction

350
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:28,159
Channing what amounts to a misuse of their products

351
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,975
Even though I will say

352
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:32,255
That misuse

353
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:36,607
Feels wonderful I have to tell you Jules

354
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,423
The feeling of

355
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,215
Hacking together Maya

356
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,239
IKEA bed

357
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,775
Well I am

358
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:44,799
Jonathan Bean

359
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,591
It was really mostly hand but

360
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,615
We

361
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,151
Do you know

362
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,175
Reiterated

363
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:52,223
Something it in that thing that we

364
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:52,991
Create it is

365
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,527
Now something that I

366
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:55,295
Sleep on every

367
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,135
It's just such a

368
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,159
Powerful feeling
