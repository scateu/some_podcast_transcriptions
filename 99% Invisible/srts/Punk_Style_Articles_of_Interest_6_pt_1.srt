They are got the college

25
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:17,056
I was in line at the bakery

In the town in the woman pulled me outside

27
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:22,944
I just want to talk to you because

I'm a Christian woman

29
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,576
And I worry about

30
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:30,624
People like you

31
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:35,232
And your relationship with Satan

32
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,512
My boss

33
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,536
Roman Mars

34
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,328
What were you wearing that day

35
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,096
I was

36
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,376
I might think it was

37
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:43,424
I must have been a band t-shirt in the

38
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,984
Final or something from nothing

39
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,824
Like a band t-shirt one particular shirt

40
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,848
So if you met me

41
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:52,896
From the age of moon

42
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:57,504
14219 I was probably wearing

43
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,808
This one hooskerdoo t-shirt

44
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,112
By the time I stopped wearing it

45
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,024
You know went from basically white to gray to almost kind of clear

46
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,864
It's hard to keep it all together

47
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:15,424
I put little safety pins across the top

48
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,216
To keep it to keep it all together

49
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:21,056
Other people doing that so I remember

50
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:21,824
In

51
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,104
High School

52
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:25,152
There was a

53
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,944
There's very little punk present

54
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,992
You call a skater

55
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,016
If you wore

56
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,344
I will tell her listen to the bands I listen to

57
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,696
This that doesn't sound so weird this quizzical look on your face

58
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,000
It's just put in central Ohio

59
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,536
In the late 80s

60
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,352
There wasn't a concept of what

61
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46,144
I like hardcore punk was

62
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,216
It was there was no you I would call a skater and Rock

63
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,776
Autonomy

64
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:55,104
People throw rocks at you this is

65
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:57,408
Yad skaters were hated by everybody

66
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:58,944
So why bother

67
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,528
The standout especially if people are like actively throwing rocks

68
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,064
Are you like why bother

69
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,344
Yeah it's weird

70
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,368
Because

71
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,672
I don't know

72
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,976
I don't know why I want to have that fighting all the time

73
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,512
But

74
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,328
I had to

75
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:25,056
Articles of Interest a show about what we wear and so maybe their ideas about quote

76
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:31,456
Ideas about class that I do home to a piece of cloth

77
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:39,392
But if you ain't got the attitude install the current off

78
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:42,208
Manual defect clothes.

79
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,000
There is this myth

80
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,816
That's frivolous or unproductive.

81
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,352
Care about how you look

82
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:51,680
Clothing and fashion get trivialize a lot

83
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:54,240
But think about who culturally get

84
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,288
Associated with clothing and fashion

85
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,824
Young people

86
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:58,848
Women

87
00:03:59,104 --> 00:03:59,872
Queers

88
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:00,896
And people of color

89
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,736
Groups of people who historically haven't been listened to

90
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:07,040
Express themselves on their body

91
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,320
Tudor style

92
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:10,880
Their hair their tattoos or piercings

93
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:12,416
And what they wear

94
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,440
You gota understand

95
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:18,303
Black working-class get that tool the only way we had to express ourselves so through the music release

96
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:21,375
Listen to and the clothes we walk this is Dunlap

97
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:23,679
A legendary DJ and filmmaker

98
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,215
And creator of the documentary

99
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:25,983
Punk attitude

100
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,775
I've always engage with the Lord

101
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:34,431
Because you know in Black Culture we've been. Express ourselves in a very punk rock weigh and what is a very white

102
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,199
World

103
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,479
We've only been left

104
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,015
The fringes to operate with

105
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,575
Search for stuff to do

106
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,623
With things like come up with

107
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,391
Reggae

108
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,159
Princeton

109
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:44,927
Which is actually

110
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:49,023
Phone by a lack of Technology not because you've got it in a minute

111
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,047
Definition of punk

112
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:50,815
Hip Hop

113
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:55,423
Two turntables and a microphone I mean if that ain't a phone with black punk rock what is

114
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:56,703
Punk rock

115
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,983
In the classic sense

116
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00,031
In the way it sounds in the way it looks

117
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:03,871
Emerged from a place of disenchantment and dissolution

118
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:04,895
I already was

119
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:10,783
Black alien

120
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,135
I want you talking specifically London Society

121
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:19,231
You going to set the scene a little bit

122
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:25,631
What social crisis economic political jobs accommodation

123
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:32,031
I'm Financial you know what about three days a week so very concerned about unemployment

124
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:38,431
Unemployment

125
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:47,903
And we don't like it

126
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:54,303
And then I just felt like it was constantly f******

127
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:59,167
I mean I was lucky I had a soundtrack to ease my pain I had the reggae

128
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,727
What makes not so lucky

129
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:06,847
Now there are a lot of different opinions as to where punk music came from

130
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:09,151
And what its roots and influences were

131
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,991
And whether it started in Detroit or New York or whatever

132
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,551
Wide-leg read that punk music

133
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,575
Came from

134
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,367
Somewhere in the United States

135
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:20,671
Everybody thinks England England invented Punk

136
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:24,511
The look

137
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,279
A punk

138
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:26,559
That

139
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:29,887
Started in London

140
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,423
Which is not to be sniffed at

141
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:35,263
Is that music install combinations a deadly combination

142
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,031
And the look

143
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:36,799
A punk

144
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:39,871
A traditional 70s British Punk is so iconic

145
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,175
Think the green mohawk

146
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:45,503
Safety pins leather jacket the Plaid mini skirt

147
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,807
And look that iconic

148
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,343
Not specific

149
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,647
I didn't just happen by axe

150
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,695
Someone design.

151
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,559
Hi are you okay

152
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:00,863
Yeah

153
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:04,447
On 430 Kings Road in London

154
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,983
There's a little shop

155
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,031
It looks like a little Shack

156
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,055
Tiny

157
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,871
Don Letts remembers the first time he went in there

158
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:17,759
I found myself wondering up and down the Kings Road Chelsea which back in the day in the early 70s

159
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:21,087
Which is like the major fashion High Street in the UK and under

160
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,391
And I wandered into the store

161
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,415
Cool.

162
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:28,255
Xenical too fast to live too young to die or Let It Rock

163
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,815
Cricket changing the name of the store

164
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:33,887
I walked into what was kind of Aladdin Cave of

165
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,167
Subculture

166
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:40,287
Mountain was there and Vivian was there in Westwood and Malcolm McLaren

167
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,847
The couple that owned the shop in the 70s

168
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:49,247
They started out selling records and then moved into clothing

169
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,039
Probably one of the most food

170
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:53,087
To assist meetings I've ever had

171
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:55,391
Vivienne Westwood was in her early thirties

172
00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:00,255
Primary school teacher and mother of two who sewed all the clothes in her living room

173
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,303
She had no formal training

174
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,375
But she had grown up sewing her own clothes out of necessity

175
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,935
Malcolm McLaren was in his mid-20s

176
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:10,495
And lived in this kind of world of ideas

177
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,287
The counterculture

178
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:15,871
B a Paris Grosvenor Square you know Kent State

179
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:20,735
Situationist movement in Frosty

180
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:25,087
The situationists were really important to Vivian and Malcolm

181
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,391
As early as the 1950s

182
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,439
Situation of spirits declared

183
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,207
The artist

184
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,231
And thinkers

185
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,279
Morally obligated to break

186
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,071
Down The Divide between art

187
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:35,839
And like

188
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,911
Diffuse art with everyday existence

189
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,447
So that art could not be

190
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:43,775
Cleaved Wade etherized and put into Galleries and Academies

191
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:45,823
The way to do this

192
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,359
The situation is said

193
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,663
Diffuse art and life

194
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,943
Artist

195
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:51,967
Activist

196
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,015
The provocateurs

197
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,319
To create dramatic

198
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:59,135
Outlandish Interruption the everyday

199
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:02,207
To expose the absurdity of the status quo

200
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,487
Art

201
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,767
I protest review

202
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:05,535
On the street

203
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,071
What do you know barriers

204
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,607
For everyone

205
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,375
In there

206
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,655
Faces

207
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,191
Whether they wanted it or not

208
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:14,239
Yeah the whole idea of being subversive

209
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,287
Thinking Out of the Box

210
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,823
Punk

211
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:18,591
But

212
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,127
The look of punk

213
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,919
Still wasn't quite born yet

214
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,223
In the pursuit of testing limits

215
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,271
Emerging art and life

216
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:30,623
Vivienne Westwood and Malcolm McLaren we're constantly changing the shop

217
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,415
In the style clothing sold within it

218
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:38,047
They closed it down Renee Mission reopen it again as long as they were closing the stores down cuz they were failures

219
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,607
They were changing the face of 430 Kings Road

220
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:41,887
Because they wanted to

221
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:48,031
And he wants to move on and sit if this is Claire Wilcox

222
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,591
Senior curator at the Victoria and Albert Museum

223
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:54,175
By the way Vivienne Westwood herself declined to be a part of the story

224
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,223
But Claire Wilcox interview Westwood

225
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,247
Cuz they were failures

226
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,807
They were changing the face of 430 Kings Road

227
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,087
Because they wanted to

228
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:03,135
Maximum term

229
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,695
And he wants to move on and sit ophidian

230
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,231
This is Claire Wilcox

231
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,791
Senior curator at the Victoria and Albert Museum

232
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:13,375
By the way Vivienne Westwood herself declined to be a part of the story

233
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:16,703
But Claire Wilcox interview Westwood and curated and

234
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,519
Credible exhibit of the many faces of her work

235
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,567
This is not avoid without running

236
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,383
The rodents is there always one step ahead

237
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,431
They never arrested on the Lord's Day

238
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,967
Moving changing

239
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,015
Gathering momentum

240
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,807
You're kind of like anthropologist

241
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:34,623
It really intrigued by certain subculture

242
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,159
And they build the shop around it

243
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,975
430 Kings Road had an iteration where it's sold

244
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,767
Dandy-Walker clothes

245
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:44,351
Another making more leather biker inspired stuff

246
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,911
And then in 1974

247
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,727
Vivian Malcolm turn 430 Kings Road

248
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,751

00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:59,199
All caps what Vision said about being interested in clothing

252
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:01,247
Used in the sex industry

253
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,271
The latex

254
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:06,879
She appreciates it fit strength Honda Beauty

255
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:07,903

00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,927
Just Had Sex

257
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,207
A big pink

258
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,487
Plush letters

259
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:15,071
The clothes inside were leather and rubber and cover.

260
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:15,839
Straps

261
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:18,143
Skin tight and androgynous

262
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:23,007
And she said that you had a Mexican tile coming to the shop when it's cooled sex range from

263
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,543
She said

264
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,847
SunTrust in

265
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,639
These types of governments

266
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:32,735
Kids off the street just wanting to be fashionable soap

267
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,343
Malcolm and Vivian new had a shock

268
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,391
No one had stuff like there

269
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,927
Snow in the moment

270
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:45,023
Some of a t-shirt

271
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,303
Sears

272
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:50,143
I didn't put the talcum powder thing on nobody told me about that s***

273
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,935
A Navy diver

274
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:54,239
Thing wrapped around my neck trying to get it off

275
00:11:54,751 --> 00:12:00,895
On trips to New York Malcolm and Vivian discovered the burgeoning American punk music scene which was blooming in inter

276
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:01,919
Trust in NuWave

277
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,199
ISO

278
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,735
Upon his return to London

279
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:08,575
Malcolm decided that he would like to manage a band of his very own

280
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:13,439
Ian Didion gathered some kids who worked at and hung out around 4:30 Kings Road

281
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:15,231
Inform them into a group

282
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,023
Named

283
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,815
The Sex Pistols

284
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:22,399
But it's not like the Sex Pistols were just like a clever ruse

285
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,167
Sell clothes

286
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:27,007
No I mean listen to it was a fortuitous combination for the restie

287
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:30,335
Things to watch together but that wasn't anything weird I mean

288
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,103
Style of

289
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,151
The music in this country

290
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:33,919
It's so important

291
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,527
There's any shame in that

292
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:41,599
Malcolm and Vivian wrote some of the lyrics for The Sex Pistols

293
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,135
Which were about

294
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:43,903
No

295
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,719
Anarchy in the UK in bad-mouthing the queen

296
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:49,023
It was not your mother's rock and roll

297
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,047
It was

298
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,327
The Andy band

299
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,607
The Andy music

300
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,375
Built

301
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,143
To shock

302
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:57,471
Kind of her politics but also kind of just to shock people

303
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,775
Like a situation is happening

304
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:03,103
Although maybe that's getting knocking too much credit I don't know how planned out this

305
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,383
Malcolm

306
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:06,175
When I scrape Malcolm will

307
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:08,479
What is endgame was I have no

308
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,783
I think Malcolm

309
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,831
Good makeup looks

310
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,367
La things that kind of

311
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,647
And jumping chaos

312
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,439
She pretended that you orchestrated

313
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,743
What was your question

314
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,047
This new movement

315
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,583
Demanded a new look

316
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,375
A new store

317
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:29,727
Sew-in 1977 430 King's Road was reincarnated again

318
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,007
This time

319
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,287
It was called

320
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,311
Seditionaries

321
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:36,895
And this is the iteration of the store in which

322
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,175
Punk fashion

323
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:42,527
Would truly emerge

324
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,295
Because hair

325
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,831
Female gymnast

00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:48,159
Music McLaren's to Humane labs

327
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:51,999
The chapters of 430 Kings Road all compounded on each other

328
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:58,399
Elements of Edwardian Dandy and rocker and biker and sex-worker all combined and key

329
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,167
How do eyes work

330
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:02,239
Hardbass music and political imagery

331
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,031
Top

332
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,567
Union Jack

333
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,895
Put together with safety pins

334
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:11,199
This is style icon Michael Costa

335
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:14,015
A longtime neighbor of 430 Kings Road

336
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,831
Over the years Michael and his wife gerlinde about

337
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,623
Somany Westwood clothes

338
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,647

00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:24,255
Copper trousers

Big wide belt little bit hipster almost

343
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,471
Michael is showing me a pair of his old bondage trousers

344
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:34,751
Which look like

345
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,543
Straight jacket for your legs

346
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:40,639
Are loaded down with zippers and chains and straps hanging off them

347
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:43,455
And there's even a strap that ties your knees together

348
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,991
Which Michael assures me was

349
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,527
Less limiting than you think

350
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:50,111
The legs are connected

351
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,135

00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,095
With your knees tied together

356
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,911
These bondage trousers of Michaels were black

357
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:05,983
But they were virgins and plaid and some had killed that you could

358
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:11,103
Clip on the front and back or little towels and other things that would hang off them

359
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:15,967
A conversation with Bob Marley argument about the bug that trousers I was wearing

360
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:20,063

Strange sculptures

363

She played with the human form

364
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:30,815
Finding the legs together extending sleeves down to the floor and pushing the body into new angles

365

Pull the fabric in different ways it was all wrong fabulous

00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:45,407
Photorealism movement it was resolved it was

369

Well-crafted

370
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:47,967
It's not cheap

371
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,271

00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:01,279
Those first punk clothes Warrant dirty grungy sloppy

377
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,559
You are fabulous

378
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,583
Estranged

379
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,911
Vivian's closes they would closes

380
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,447
You could understand.

381
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:12,543
Always taken great pride in Crossing how close right calf

00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:16,383
You got this extraordinary sort of marriage crafts in car

383
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:19,967
You know damn right outrageousness

384
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,247
So outrageous

385
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:24,063
Just that other shop started the copy Vivian's designs

386
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:26,111
Lots of people call Paige as look

387
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:28,671
Once that you knew about the pothole then

388
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,207
Pumpkins ride with selling

389
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,743
Variations on a theme

390
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:36,607
Would love to go with you know you got studying and wristbands

391
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,655
L'homme

392
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,959
Ephemera

393
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:44,543
The people of China

394
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,567
Have a business

395
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,871
Hunk was easy to rip off

396
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:52,223
Michael showed me some imitation bondage trousers that used to belong to his wife

397
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,271
They were made by another shop

398
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,551
Called boy

399
00:16:55,807 --> 00:17:01,183
These four countries that boycott pedo Vivian's things ended the much cheaper and cheaper

400
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:04,255
Barbrix System of a Down The King's Road

401
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,023
Which Wich

402
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:09,119
Kind of cool cuz it gave more people a chance to wear the clothes

403
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,423
Fabulous Heights boy

404
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,959
Shuttle migration

405
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:16,031
Set my shop on fire cuz they have to do the same

406
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:24,735
But the other side of the coin was that individuals could imitate these looks very easily as well

407
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:31,391
Elaborate on them

408
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:37,791
Dial lexicon that anyone can play around with large featuring yourself

409
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:38,559
Novak fake

410
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:42,399
I mean you could go into your own wardrobe right now

411
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,703
And rip stuff up and put it back together

412
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,983
And make it Punk

413
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:48,799
DIY Park

414
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,591
That Vivian love

415
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,383
MacGyver transfer

416
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:56,479
The kids with no money to developer do it yourself

417
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,759
Version of God

418
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:01,343
Vivienne Westwood after all didn't have any training as a seamstress

419
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:03,391
She just figured out how to do these things

420
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,951
So anyone could and should

421
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:06,975
Follow her lead

422
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:08,255
It was part of this

423
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:14,911
Shad movement of rebellion but these clothes to be adopted in customized and adopted by

424
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:21,311
Wherever you came from have Rachel pull you all have I told you I would have sex you while you could take these clothes on

425
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,335
Cups you might save up

426
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:26,175
To buy Paris bondage trousers but you to customize your own t-shirt

427
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:28,735
Punk became Grassroots

428
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,039
As Vivian herself has said

429
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:33,087
It wasn't invented from the street

430
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,391
It was the other way around

431
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,951
It turned into a movement

432
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:40,511
So I think in a way it was cut so joyful

433
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,559
Expiration of

434
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,607
Take possession of your own identity

435
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:48,959
Before the internet this look was cross-pollinated between New York and London

436
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:52,031
By touring bands like the sex pistols and the Ramones

437
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:55,615
It's either started to be this back-and-forth dialogue a little bit

438
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:58,943
Between the two scenes but they were visually really different

439
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:02,015
Monica sklar fashion historian and author of the book

440
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:02,783
Punk Style

441
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,575
She says the New York look

442
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:07,647
Was based in functionality with New York being

443
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:13,023
Jeans t-shirts using safety fence for functional purposes but the London look

444
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:16,863
Thanks to Vivienne Westwood was rooted in art aesthetic

445
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:19,935
Advanced word and cultures mix

446
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:23,007
Spheres of influence spread across the US

447
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,031
And then it would

448
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,311
Go around the country

449
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:28,127
At around the globe are there scenes wood

450
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:31,711
Come to fruition and take on their own bed of influence

451
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:34,783
Depending on bands on the weather on the local culture

452
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:38,623
Hulk became reinterpreted

453
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:43,999
See whether to Troy London York Minneapolis had a large series of

454
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,791
Bain & Style leaders

455
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,119
And then as those individuals and their stuff

456
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:54,751
Whether it's been personally traveling around or as their Z makes it around or their music

457
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:56,543
Dallas gets to the next place

458
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:57,823
The style ghost

459
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,103
Note

460
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:01,407
Harmonica score said their Style

461
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,175
Went with them

462
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:06,015
Not their fashion this goes Way Beyond

463
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,831
Conquer subcultures in the United States

464
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,879
Fashion is associated

465
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:12,927
With entire groups of people

466
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,231
That are often relegated as

467
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:18,815
Secondary women queers people of color and Youth

468
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,143
Fashion is the realm of the historically powerless

469
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,191
And so people don't want

470
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:27,007
To talk about things that are associated with them

471
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,079
But they do have this huge awareness

472
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,103
Style

473
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,895
How important style is

474
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:38,015
Style according to sociologist Michael break is a combination of

475
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:38,783
3 elements

476
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,831
Image image

477
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:44,927
So what are we looking at demeanor

478
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,975
And this concept called Argo

479
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:49,279
Argo this French concept of

480
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,607
Swang and secret language

481
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,887
Kind of like jargon

482
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:59,519
Special words or phrases that only insiders in a group would know

483
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:03,615
And so being able to have image demeanor and Argo is awesome

484
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,175
Is true Punk Style

485
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:07,711
In other words

486
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:10,015
It's part of what makes you authentic

487
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,551
Or a poser

488
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,343
You have the right

489
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,111
Dial

490
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,976
Emperor Punk's it was a

491
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,000
Vizslas hunt

492
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:22,304
To sniff out true Punk Style

493
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,096
Looking for little Clues

494
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,632
Hints of authenticity

495
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:26,912
Try to figure out

496
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,192
Who was on your side

497
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,472
It was a sell-out

498
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:30,752
Wisconsin

499
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,544
It was exhausting

500
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,080
That

501
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,640
Only shortly after seditionaries open

502
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:37,920
In the late 70s

503
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,968
Vivienne Westwood herself

504
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:40,992
Got tired of it

505
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,528
In hindsight

506
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,296
She said

507
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:47,136
I got tired of looking at clothes from this point of view of rebellion

508
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,928
I found it exhausting

509
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:52,512
After a while I wasn't sure if I was right

510
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,120
I'm sure that if there is such a thing as the anti-establishment

511
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,912
It feeds the establishment

512
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:03,520
If you give something a label in that tool that can be in the whole thing about Punk is it

513
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,312
Ever-evolving

514
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:10,688
Early definition

515
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,736
Not a man that was just like one

516
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:13,760
Screaming shout

517
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,296
Through the door

518
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,832
You weren't supposed to get

519
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,904
You know you get on this letter

520
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,952
Smoke to keep climbing

521
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:25,280
Into the eighties a lot of London punks kept climbing

522
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:29,120
Members of punk bands killed off to learn how do you actually play their instruments

523
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:30,400
Experiment with lights

524
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,424
Sympathizers

525
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,984
An interesting about postpone his own people

526
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,032
Honest about what they really like

527
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:38,848
And Vivienne Westwood taught herself how to

528
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:39,616
To Taylor

529
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:42,944
Like give herself a real formal training

530
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,968
Sochi

531
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:47,552
Bumped on this mission to self educate yourself

532
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,320
Through

533
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,600
Locate 17

534
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:55,488
18th Century Century dress and this is not DIY these are not garments but anyone could copy

535
00:22:56,256 --> 00:23:00,352
Vivian played with corset tree ball gown suits

536
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,376
Evening clothes

537
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:04,704
Using nicer materials and toying with elements of History

538
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,496
Even nostalgia

539
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,288
Stuff that was not Punk

540
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,568
Replacing

541
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:12,384
Two dimensional could be laid flat

542
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,432
Weather when she learns

543
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,968
How to tie a tie

544
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:19,040
And this is a very difficult process that she told herself

545
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,064
The clothes

546
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,344
Sycamore Mall

547
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:22,624
Three dimensional

548
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,720
As her views of authority and establishment became multidimensional

549
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:29,280
Her garments Gaines Dimension as well

550
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:32,608
You see the development of Pasco running alongside

551
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:36,448
It's up to her interest in history and also

552
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:41,568
No projection of poem is at the lowest a part of her but her

553
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,848
I'm moving on

554
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:44,640
Wei Zhang

555
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,688
Underpants toys

556
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,736
Being insulting some kind of

557
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,016
Conflict

558
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:53,088
It's cool sartorial conflict with the wild

559
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,184
Yeah

560
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:58,976
Majority

561
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,768
Are you awake

562
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,816
Earth's gravity

563
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,680
That store on 430 Kings Road

564
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,472
It still belongs to Westwood

565
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:11,520
Ever since 1980

566
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:13,312
It's been called World's End

567
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:17,152
Add a giant clock on the front with its arms spinning backwards

568
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,200
I did go there today

569
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:22,528
Not really a band of Misfits that hang out there anymore

570
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,600
But there are a lot of Japanese tourists to come to pilgrimage

571
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,792
Vivienne Westwood is one of the most famous clothing designers in the world now

572
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,888
I mean she is huge she doesn't have the time to speak to me for this podcast

573
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:42,496
But she is the reason why I wanted to talk about clothing

574
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,800
Because in 2009

575
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:47,360
I heard her say this thing to the New York Times

576
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:49,920
I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since

577
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:52,480
The Paradox is that

578
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:56,064
People sing this if they wear something simple

579
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,088
UNAM

580
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:58,112
Say it

581
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,720
That somehow

582
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:05,024
Stunning them beautiful from it

583
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:05,792
It's not

584
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:09,888
Truitt Christy Turlington

585
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,448
I don't want to see

586
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,752
Chuggington in a T-shirt and jeans

587
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,080
Chicken why not if you're bored

588
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,152
Somebody

589
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,176
Free calls

590
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:23,456
Beauty

591
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:33,184
I think everyone knows that feeling when you're dressed in an outfit you really like

592
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,208
You look good

593
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:35,232
And you feel good

594
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,304
That is an essential power of clothing

595
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,840
Aside from

596
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:42,144
You know covering your body or keeping you warm

597
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,192
Has the power to give you confidence

598
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,520
It's why Roman dresses up when he goes to do a life

599
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:48,288
Performance

600
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,360
I have lots of options and ties and I have lots of options in

601
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:54,432
Pocket squares and stuff like that in that I have fun with that

602
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,712
2

603
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,576
Form and actually show respect that I care about these things to an audience

604
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,136
That's what that signals to me

605
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:05,184
I don't feel like it I think I look up

606
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:08,000
And the sing Punk did

607
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:10,304
Was pushed the boundaries of what

608
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,328
Looks good

609
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:14,144
It's not about looking perfect

610
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,168
McLean

611
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:15,936
Or Rich

612
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:21,824
Incorporated people of all ages and bodies and backgrounds and ideas

613
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,872
And gave them that confidence

614
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:28,224
It pushed our ideas of beauty

615
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:31,296
And Professor Monica's flower knows this firsthand

616
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:34,368
Beauty standards were pushed and pushed and pushed

617
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,904
I was fired

618
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,952
From a record store

619
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,488
A record store

620
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:45,632
Does a use for having an eyebrow piercing and now I'm a professor and curator and vice president of the national

621
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:47,168
Society of my profession

622
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,704
And I have it

623
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,592
And really this is the power of what fashion designers can do

624
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:00,480
Something that appears strange or scary or expensive at first can trickle down through the cycle of trends

625
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:01,504
Maybe

626
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,528
In time

627
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:03,296
Come to

628
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:05,344
Expand Notions of what's acceptable

629
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:08,928
Send more people can feel comfortable expressing their own style

630
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,512
Their own cocktail of image demeanor and argot

631
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,792
However it manifests

632
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:15,584
Anna Smith

633
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:20,192
But it's frivolous or unproductive to care about how you look or what you wear

634
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,728
Is completely bunk

635
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:24,544
I have to think about how you present

636
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,128
Or to assume that you can somehow dress in a way that is neutral

637
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,408
Anon saying

638
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:30,688
That

639
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,224
Is a massive

640
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,248
Massive

641
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,016
Privilege

642
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:38,624
Whether we like it or not we are all speaking with our clothes

643
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:41,696
And we might as well give a good hard think

644
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:42,976
About what we want to say

645
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:52,448
The piece of paper

646
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:56,544
Words for me

647
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:03,456
Support

648
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:04,224

649
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:11,136

651
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,432

Between the beats

664
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:24,000
Bongs and chatter of our devices

665
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:24,768
We're immersed

666
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:27,584
In a cluttered World a man-made sound

667
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:28,608
If

668
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:35,008
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife isn't

669

Technology

671
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:40,640
You talk to us

672
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:42,944
It is a creation of Sonic trash

673
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:46,016
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

674
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:49,600
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

675
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,392
To make them more human

676
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:55,488
Turn the living room lights on

677
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:57,280
Okay

678
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:58,816
Dim the living room lights

679
00:30:59,072 --> 00:30:59,840
50%

680
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,632
Okay

681
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:08,032
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

682
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:10,336
Makes for a much more natural

683
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,104
Experience

684
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:12,896
Turn the living room lights on

685
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,992
Dim the living room lights to 50%

686
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:24,672
We're presenting to special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

687
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:27,488

00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,048

E9pay

692
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:39,520
We need to talk about something

693
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:45,920
Constipation abdominal pain and bloating yourself it's not that bad you take laxatives you modify your diet

694
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:48,736
Does routine but thinking about it all the time is frustrating

695
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:55,136
It doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again and you don't know why

696
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:57,440
Then it may be time to seek help

Flask podcast

701
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,872
The history of clothing is not a linear one

702
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,456
Circles back around and around on itself

703
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,040
Styles weave in and out through the decades

704
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:25,856
Each time reincarnated a new material

705
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:27,392
New associations

706
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:29,952
The history of clothing

707
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:32,000
The history of subversion

708
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:36,608
Whether it's bringing bondage we're into the light of day or jeans in the workplace

709
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,656
Are Pockets into womenswear

710
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:45,568
It's a dynamic that puts our bodies and conversation with all the many many political societal and

711
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:48,640
Economic forces that have determined the Fashions before us

712
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:50,688
As a cycle trends

713
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:51,968
Goes around

714
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:54,016
Around and around

715
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:58,368
And that's it

716
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:01,696
That concludes articles of interest thank you for listening

717
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:08,352
By the way this gorgeous music box theme that you're listening to was composed by the great Sean real r

718
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:10,144
99 Pi staff composer

719
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:16,544
And we're back to regular 99percentinvisible programming after this and all these episodes will be archived on a separate feed

720
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:19,616
We're thinking about whether or not we want to do a second season of this

721
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:20,896
Let me know your thoughts

722
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:26,272
I'm on Twitter at troubleman 1f and at articles of interest on Instagram

723
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:31,904
And a final thought we're celebrating this podcast with a big clothing swap

724
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:38,304
If you've never been to one of these before it's where a bunch of people gather somewhere and everyone brings their clothes that they don't want anymore

725
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,352
And then trade them all up with each other for free

726
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:44,192
I find it's the most sustainable and most interesting way to dress

727
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:47,264
Consider throwing a clothing swap with your own sometime

728
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,056
If you have to wear clothes anyway

729
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:49,824
Right

730
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:56,480
Radio 2

731
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:05,440
Before we go I want to tell you about the body genius

732
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:09,280
A five-part series from fellow radiotopia show the truth

733
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:11,840
The body genius is a Dark comic mystery

734
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:13,376
That whines through a

735
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:15,168
Treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

736
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,704
We're looking the part

737
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,240
Might cost you your life

738
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:23,616
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

739
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,968
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

740
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:32,320
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like a dad

741
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:36,672
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

742
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:38,976
Actually if I'm being honest

743
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:41,024
I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that

A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

745
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,032
Was found dead in my private gym

746
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:55,360
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

747
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:59,712
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

748
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:00,736
Now

749
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:03,040
I need to clear my name

750
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:09,184
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes to find them
