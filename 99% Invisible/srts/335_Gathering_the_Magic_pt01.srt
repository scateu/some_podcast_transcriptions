Eric molinsky has reported a few episodes for us over the years and he has his own right podcast called imaginary world

26
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,792
A picture of a couple of times

27
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:41,120
Imaginary worlds has a very special place in my heart because

28
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:43,424
It is the podcast I listen to the most

29
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,472
With my boys Maslow and Carver

30
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:50,080
Because it covers all the sci-fi and fantasy subjects that they love like

31
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:52,896
D&D in Doctor Who and LARPing

32
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:55,456
In a really thoughtful and entertaining way

33
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,992
And like every great show

34
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,272
It's about those things

35
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:03,648
But it's really about who we are as humans through these worlds that we create and share

36
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:07,744
How early this year imaginary world produced the story about the thing that is most

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,304
Near and dear to my boys hearts

38
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,840
And that's the card game

39
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,632
Magic the Gathering

40
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:19,008
I just called Magic a card game but if you spent any time around someone who loves magic you know

41
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,592
It is way more than a guard game it is a way of life

42
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:25,408
I'm pretty sure it rewired my son's brains

43
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:32,064
I wanted to cover Magic on 99 Pi for a while now but Eric did such a great job with it it made more sense to share his

44
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,160
Persian and introduce you to another great podcast that you might not know already

45
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,464
Enjoy

46
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,560
You're listening to imaginary worlds

47
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:45,376
And why we suspend our disbelief

48
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,656
IMac Gilinsky

49
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,448
And this is not

50
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,264
My name is

51
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:57,920
Nat is teaching me how to play Magic the Gathering at the Brooklyn strategist which is the same game shop

52
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:00,480
Copperline play Dungeons & Dragons Fierce ago

53
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03,296
What were DND is role playing game

54
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,600
Magic is very much a card game

55
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:08,928
And by the way magic is the shorthand that most people called Magic

56
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,512
Mostly call it magic in this episode

57
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,352
Simplest level there are two basic types of cards in magic

58
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,448
Enterprise magic is like any card game

59
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,520
You need a combination of luck and skill to win

60
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,568
And it's usually played with just two people

61
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,616
But it is not a generic

62
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,384
Deck of cards

63
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,176
Each of the cards

64
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,200
The creature

65
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,480
Or spell

66
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:36,576
Or magical artifact on it that you can use to attack your opponent

67
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:40,416
And some cards represent the source of your magic which our lands

68
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:46,304
The more land cards that you have the more magic you can wield against the person sitting across from you

69
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,584
And your goal

70
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,888
It's a knock your opponent from 20 points

71
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:50,912
20 points

72
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,448
Danceable

73
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:53,984
It's not

74
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:57,312
It's really really not

75
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:02,432
So when you play you always have 7 cards in your hand that you're taking from a deck of 60 card

76
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:06,784
But that deck of 60 cards or something that you custom make

77
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,344
Because the company that makes Magic the Gathering

78
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,624
Wizards of the Coast

79
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:12,672
Has put out over 10

80
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:15,232
Thousand possible cards to choose from

81
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,280
Over the last quarter-century

82
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:22,399
And there is a central mythology that unites those thousands and thousands of car

83
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,727
Because Magic the Gathering takes place in a Multiverse

84
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,775
And some of the cards represent

85
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:32,895
Plane Walker's the main characters of the game can jump from one parallel universe to another

86
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,223
No I always do that magic the Gathering

87
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:36,991
Was huge

88
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,271
But

89
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:41,599
I had never done an episode about it because I was kind of intimidated

90
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:45,439
Like when I used to go to the Brooklyn strategist to play D&D

91
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:50,047
We'd all be role-playing are characters like we're in some kind of medieval improv troupe

92
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:53,887
And then I look at the table where these people playing Magic the Gathering

93
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:56,447
And it was like they were speaking a whole other language

94
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:00,799
Now this year is the 25th anniversary of Magic the Gathering

95
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,639
And it amazes me the game is still so popular

96
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:11,039
Notice anything wrong with a game itself but he was developed by this mathematician named Richard Garfield in the early 90s

97
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:13,599
There's very little competition from video games

98
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:18,463
And now so many analog games and toys that used to be pretty solid

99
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:23,071
Are struggling to compete against PlayStations and iPad apps

100
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,119
In Magic does have an app

101
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:28,703
But the handheld card game is still the main focus

102
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:35,615
And they are not struggling to compete I mean magic the Gathering has been on an epic run each year is more Pro

103
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,639
Profitable than the last

104
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:40,223
Soy two questions about the game I was really curious about

105
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:45,087
First why has it survived the onslaught of Digital entertainment

106
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,135
And secondly

107
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:50,719
How do you create a sense of story and World building

108
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,023
Hidden non-sequential card game

109
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:57,631
Indus all that mythology in world-building make for better card game

110
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,471
Or is it something the players ignore when they just focus on winning

111
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,799
Well to answer those questions

112
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:05,567
I went

113
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,359
Straight to the top

114
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,431
The head designer for Magic the Gathering

115
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,223
Mark rosewater

116
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:15,551
I'm pulling out of driveway we all know what that mean

117
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,343
It's time for the drive to work

118
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:24,255
Okay by the way that is how he starts every episode of his podcast as he drives to the office outside Seattle

119
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,303
Talking about different aspects of the game

120
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,095
He doesn't get to a podcast

121
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:32,447
Mark is out there on every media platform talking about magic

122
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:34,239
Answering questions from players

123
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:37,055
He is a force of personality

124
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,615
Demarcus been with a companies

125
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,383
Mid 90

126
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:43,455
Just a few years after Magic the Gathering came out

127
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:47,295
And I have to say in all of my years of interviewing people

128
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,831
I don't think I've ever met anybody

129
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:53,183
Whoso unabashedly loves their job

130
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,719
As much as Mark does

131
00:06:55,743 --> 00:07:00,607
My job is to come up with a really cool things that will make players really really excited

132
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,911
And then I could not talk about it for

133
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,191
16

134
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,727
24 month usually

135
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,263
Example

136
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:10,335
Last December we put out a particle unstable

137
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,895
Which is kind of like a humorous take on Magic

138
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:16,223
I've been working on this project for 7 years

139
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,271
And I did not talk about it

140
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:24,415
First seven years at the one I finally got to talk about people like while you're so excited I'm like

141
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,975
I've been waiting to talk about it for 7

142
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:34,655
Now what are the reasons why magic has stayed popular all these years is because the game never stops evolving

143
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:37,727
As I mentioned earlier the premise of the game

144
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:40,543
Is a 30 parallel universes called planes

145
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:47,199
In the frequency in which Wizards of the Coast has introduced new plants gone from every couple years to every year

146
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,503
Denounce sometimes twice a year

147
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:56,415
And you know in the beginning magic was relying and all the standard fantasy tropes that you would see in a game like Dungeons & Drag

148
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:02,047
But is it kept introducing New World more and more quickly they kind of ran out of those fantasy tropes

149
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:07,167
They've also had to be more creative in terms of what they bring into the fantasy genre

150
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,727
Like in one of these parallel universes

151
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,007
Everything's made of metal

152
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:16,127
Or another one of these parallel planes is like a steampunk version of India

153
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,431
But as Mark says

154
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,479
Set of cards

155
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:23,039
It's a very challenging way to tell a story

156
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:26,367
Not everybody sees every card and they don't see them in the same order

157
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,207
So what we've done is we tend to use our cards

158
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,999
To build the environment

159
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,279
To build the world

160
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,815
The Flash out the world

161
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,607
And kids at the story

162
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,911
And then we tend to tell the story through other means

163
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:45,311
Like on the magic the Gathering website there's a lot of extra material explaining what is going on in these different worlds

164
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,871
But eventually they decided to up the ante

165
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,407
On the design of the cards

166
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,199
So when you encounter a new deck

167
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:53,503
You automatically feel something

168
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,527
About this world

169
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,087
Without having to read the backstory behind it

170
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:01,439
We want to figure out what the emotional core of the experience is going to be

171
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:06,047
The mechanics aren't just about doing something throat making you feel something

172
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:08,095
And I really got into the idea of

173
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:13,471
We're going to go to a Gothic horror world and we're going to make you afraid cuz it's a Gothic horror world

174
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:19,871
Are we going to go to our Greek mythology world and you're going to be a hero and goat adventures and mix

175
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:20,895
Something of yourself

176
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:26,015
Now there are three basic elements each card

177
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,295
First

178
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,319
There's an illustration

179
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,367
Which is about 2 by 2 in

180
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,159
But there's so much drama

181
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:35,231
In the story going on in those little paintings

182
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:38,303
Men looking at them I get sucked in like it's a movie

183
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,631
The second element every card is the statistics

184
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,911
How old is creature

185
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:43,935
Spell

186
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:46,495
Artifact will function as a card

187
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,287
Didn't realize

188
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:51,359
How many different ways a card could behave in a game

189
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:56,223
I mean it is endless in terms of how many points you gain or take away from your opponent

190
00:09:56,479 --> 00:10:02,111
Whether this card is better used on the offensive or the defensive how many times you can use the card

191
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:04,415
And the game mechanics aren't random

192
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:07,487
They reflect the personality of what's on the card

193
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:11,583
In the third major element debit card is something called

194
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,351
Flavor Tech

195
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,655
A few lines of

196
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,191
Poetic description

197
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:20,031
But even the flavor text got more ambitious over the years

198
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:23,359
How many words that can cram into a card

199
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,151
But how succinctly

200
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,711
I can paint a picture of a broad story

201
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,503
Beyond that one card

202
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:34,367
Back when I used to write flavor text one of the things was it was a lot like poetry

203
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,647
It was a lot like

204
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:39,487
How can I convey as much as possible in the smallest amount of space

205
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,791
And one of my favorite pizza flavor tax

206
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:44,607
There's a card at insect called

207
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,399
We went with I SeaWorld

208
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,679
Apple Ice Age

209
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,471
And there's a cardinal called lord wife

210
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,519
Which was this horrible monster

211
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,287
Abase

212
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:55,871
Loosely based on some North stuff the flavor text on it was

213
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:59,455
Hans run it's the little boy

214
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:02,271
Last words of saffi eriksdotter

215
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,599
And somehow just like this idea that

216
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:12,255
Did poor of this poor woman that like the last thing we learn about her is she scared to death cuz she knows how horror

217
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,559
And she is right

218
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,327
Because

219
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,119
That's the last thing she ever says

220
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:24,799
And as much as Mark loves to talk about the game there's one aspect that he's actually the most

221
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,079
Passionate about

222
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,383
It's called the color pie

223
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:34,527
And when I first read about the color pie just seem like that of an esoteric part of the whole game mechanics

224
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,575
But then I realized

225
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,623
It is the lifeblood of the game

226
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:42,719
It is the thing that makes you feel like you're actually wielding Magic

227
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,999
You play with the car

228
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,303
Because all of the cards

229
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,839
The Gathering

230
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,887
Are divided into five colors

231
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,679
Card reader White

232
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:52,447
Black

233
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,215
Blue

234
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,495
Red or green

235
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:58,335
In each color represents a different philosophy of magic

236
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,127
To white magic

237
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,407
It's about control

238
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,431
Order

239
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,479
And whatever works for the collective good

240
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:08,063
Blackmagic promotes ruthless individualism

241
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,367
Red magic is fiery and passionate

242
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,415
Blue Magic is brainy

243
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,439
Intellectual

244
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:14,975
Green Magic

245
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,255
Is in harmony with nature

246
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,327
One of the neat things about

247
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,631
The color pie that I love is

248
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:26,239
It explains motivations in a way that doesn't demean the motivations

249
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:30,591
Like what I think is really interesting the man that has made me think about life a little differently is

250
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:37,247
Nobody's right or wrong they just have a reason for doing the things the way they do them and it's like oh what is their motivation

251
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,551
What's you're motivated by this

252
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:42,623
Going to make sense you coming conflict with motivated by that

253
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,671
I can argue and I have

254
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,975
I can argue any color from any perspective

255
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:53,375
Like one of these I did for fun at cuz I'm a writer is I did an interview and in my article is where I spent a whole column

256
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,399
Each of the colors

257
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:57,215
Interview with the colors having the color explained

258
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,751
From their perspective

259
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,287
Why they do what they do

260
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:07,455
So how did this all play out back of the game shop when I was learning how to play for my instructor Nat

261
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:11,039
Each hole has a very distinct personality and gameplay

262
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:14,367
What do the colors you use tend to Define what does

263
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,207
Now it's my first game I played with a deck of cards where everything is red

264
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:21,279
The magic I was using was fiery and impulsive

265
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:24,863
That's my natural instinct when I play games

266
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,655
Which is why I often lose

267
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,191
Because going on impulse

268
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:32,031
Is my downfall whenever I'm supposed to be thinking strategically

269
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:35,615
Meanwhile Nat was playing with a deck of black magic

270
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:39,967
It's all about sucking away your opponent's energy and using it for yourself

271
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:45,343
They're going to take one damage

272
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,927
Brady dommermuth

273
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:51,231
Is a lead writer in the creative team of magic

274
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,815
Any says when he would work on developing a new set of cards

275
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:58,399
He always thought about how the story they're telling with the cards

276
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:01,727
Should reflect the experience of people playing with a car

277
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:03,519
Magic

278
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,311
Defies one of the most common

279
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,127
Ethos prescriptions

280
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,151
In fantasy

281
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,943
And by that I mean

282
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,991
With the basic moral messages

283
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:15,295
I love the story in Fantasy A lot of times is

284
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:19,647
Sure you're the chosen one and you're destined to save the world

285
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,439
But you're going to need

286
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,463
Your friends

287
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,743
Help you out

288
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,279
In doing so

289
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,583
Button magic

290
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,607
I felt like

291
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:32,703
In terms of the story in the world design that form needed to follow function

292
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,495
And in magic

293
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:37,055
The vast majority of games are played

294
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,591
1 vs 1

295
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,127
It's you versus me

296
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,919
Is my deck versus your deck

297
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:44,223
And either you're going to win or I'm going to win

298
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:47,807
Which to me suggests a different ethos which is

299
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:50,111
Sure of course you have to have friends

300
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,135
That's super important

301
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:51,903
But

302
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,183
In the final fight

303
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,207
When it matters

304
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,743
You're going to have to fight alone

305
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,023
In fact

306
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,839
He thinks that magic is often misrepresented

307
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,119
Is a fantasy game

308
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,911
Because traditionally

309
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:06,239
Fantasy has been pretty black-and-white and its morality

310
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,799
But when you play Magic the Gathering

311
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:11,103
You're not automatically a villain

312
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,383
If you use black magic

313
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,407
And you're not

314
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,943
Automatically the hero

315
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,223
If he is white magic

316
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:19,039
Magic the Gathering

317
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:21,087
Action reflects science fiction

318
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:24,159
Is a long history of being morally ambiguous

319
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:27,999
Mark rosewater have talked about that many times about how

320
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,279
Star Wars

321
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:31,839
A fantasy story in sci-fi clothing

322
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:33,887
Where has

323
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:34,911
Magic

324
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,679
Is

325
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,727
Sci-fi story in fantasy clothing

326
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,031
Right now

327
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,311
Baxter game shop

328
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,591
I use red magic

329
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,407
Richard using a deck of blue car

330
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:48,223
Spells and creatures are brainier

331
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:48,991
Trickier

332
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,015
And by the way

333
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:54,367
When you play the game you can play any combination of colors but since I was a newbie

334
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:56,671
Nat felt that I should just play one color.

335
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,999
I switched from red magic - Blue Magic

336
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:02,303
I couldn't believe how differently the cards work

337
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:05,631
And I felt like I was relying on a different part of my brain

338
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,679
And my teacher Nat

339
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,703
It also sweats

340
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:13,311
Black magic white magic and I felt like I was playing against a different opponent

341
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:19,967
So overwhelmed right now

342
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:22,527
So many every card has so many like

343
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:26,111
Levels to it

344
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:29,695
It's a very very complex game

345
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:33,023
But that's when I realized how story can come into the

346
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,839
Because to be a good magic player

347
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:39,679
You need to know why your cards behave the way they do

348
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,471
And to do that

349
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,775
Really helpful to go on the magic website

350
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,591
And read the lore behind your car

351
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,895
What are the personality disorder

352
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:51,455
5 years or so I believed was to

353
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:55,295
Make the cards reflect story events more aggressively

354
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:59,391
Cards do

355
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,951
You can effectively learn how the story went

356
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:06,815
In fact I'm lying I found us some magic players have created fanart

357
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:07,839
Or they imagined

358
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,631
What if Harry Potter

359
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,935
Or the Marvel Cinematic Universe

360
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,495
Rare cards in Magic the Gathering

361
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:18,335
Chinese characters that we know so well like Harry Potter

362
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:23,455
Worth or it's kind of cool to see how they could be condensed into a single card

363
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:25,759
Summarized with an illustration

364
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:29,087
A bunch of statistics about their strengths weaknesses and Powers

365
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,903
In a few Choice lines of flavortown

366
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,231
But when he was working on a creative team

367
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:38,303
Pretty dommermuth always kept in mind that magic

368
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,887
It's not a movie or book reverse-engineer to be game

369
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,935
It is first and foremost

370
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:44,959
Again

371
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:50,591
One of the challenges for me and designing Magic World the reasons why undervalued plot

372
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,663
It's because I think that plot and games

373
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,687
Are not friends

374
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,479
Your ability to self Direct

375
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:01,855
Your ability to make the choices that you want to make your ability to explore the world how you see fit

376
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:04,159
Or to choose the cards for your own deck

377
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:04,927
Or

378
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,975
Decide how you want to win the game

379
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:07,743
History of finesse

380
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,535
Perforce

381
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,583
Those are super powerful things

382
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,863
Plattsburgh

383
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:13,887
Tommy

384
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:20,031
And I learned in my second round of playing the game that this blue intellectual magic was a good fit for me

385
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:22,591
I avoided all my worst impulses

386
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,895
And I became a better strategist

387
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,431
In fact

388
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:32,575
Wheels with this issue of I take stinks of a damaged from swings of magosi to my to life

389
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,855
That little bit

390
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:39,743
So game over then

391
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:43,839
Oh my God I can't believe it

392
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:49,471
Yeah I'm definitely quitting at the Thai I'm not going to go for 2 I'm going to go for the best-of-three

393
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:57,407
There is more to the magic Saga including some growing pains and the strange pitfalls

394
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,943
Intense fandom

395
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,759
You're going to hear from a couple kids

396
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:06,623
When imaginary worlds on 99percentinvisible

397
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,391
Continue

398
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:16,351
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices

399
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:19,935
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man made sound

400
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:20,959
If

401
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:27,359
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife isn't

402
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,991
Technology talk to us

403
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,295
It is a creation of Sonic trash

404
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,367
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

405
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:41,951
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

406
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,999
To make them more human

407
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,839
Turn the living room lights on

408
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:49,631
Okay

409
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:52,191
Dim the living room lights to 50%

410
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,239
Okay

411
00:19:54,751 --> 00:20:00,383
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

412
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:02,687
Makes for a much more natural

413
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,455
Experience

414
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:05,247
Turn the living room lights on

415
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,575
Dim the living room lights

416
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,599
50%

417
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:17,023
We're presenting to special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

418
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:19,839
About how are soundscape is impacting our health

419
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:22,399
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

420
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:25,215
Look for them Friday is May 17th and May 24th

421
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:25,983
Right here

422
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:32,639
From imaginary worlds here again is Eric molinsky

423
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:36,479
This Leo used to work as a graphic designer on Magic the Gathering

424
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:39,295
And this was a dream job for her but

425
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,087
It also meant a lot of scrutiny

426
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:48,255
When I had you know millions of people see my first expansion symbol are my first card frame design and then consequently

427
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:52,351
Complain about what they didn't like about it I'd remind myself that Millions

428
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:58,751
The people were playing with this thing I designs and see a some people R&B focal and not like it but it just shows how much they care

429
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,031
About the

430
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,055
They're playing

431
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:01,823
But

432
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:07,199
I can't sugarcoat it either I mean there are certainly some toxic players and wizards has

433
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,223
Bantam

434
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:08,991
Or at least

435
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:12,575
Been working on their terms of service in terms of what they can do

436
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:13,855
No overall

437
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:16,159
Liz loves the magic community

438
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:18,720
She even went on a Magic cruise once

439
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,024
Just moments like this

440
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:24,096
What she wants went to an event and sat down to play a game

441
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:26,912
The guy across from me while we're drafting ass

442
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,776
How I got into magic and I thought that was a nice question and you responded and told him

443
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:32,800
The answer

444
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:37,152
The answer is that she learned to play from an all-female group called The Lady planeswalker

445
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:37,920
Society

446
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,224
But the guy didn't seem to care

447
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,760
He just said

448
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,296
I didn't think girls are into Magic

449
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:45,600
And that was the end of the conversation

450
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:48,416
What is small innocuous comment

451
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:51,488
Like in his head he probably didn't even think it was anything

452
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:55,584
Play so remember it because it just made me feel even more a little bit like

453
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,608
Wow

454
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:58,400
Should I not be here

455
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,424
And

456
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,520
Back it went when you're already playing Cambria to 100% on your

457
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:06,080
A game in terms of your mind and strategy

458
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,360
It can

459
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,408
Be a hurdle to overcome

460
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:15,552
Is sci-fi fantasy spaces have become more inclusive over the years

461
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,856
It's been an ugly backlash

462
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,648
And video games

463
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:22,208
The Hugo book awards cosplay

464
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:24,000
Star Wars fandom

465
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:28,608
Any huge Community like magic the Gathering stop being immune to this problem

466
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,400
That's sad

467
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,192
The game is always gotten price

468
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,472
Since the beginning

469
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,776
For having diverse characters on the car

470
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,896
But over time the creative team realized that they needed to be even more inclusive

471
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:46,784
Alli medwin is an editor and designer who mostly Works in Magic digital division

472
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:49,344
And a few years ago an intern

473
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:50,880
Came up with an idea

474
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:53,440
What if they created a trans character

475
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:55,488
For new deck that they're working on

476
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,280
Realized

477
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:58,560
This is

478
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:01,120
What we want representation to look like

479
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:04,704
This is a pretty natural flow like this is

480
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:05,984
Not

481
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,288
Shoehorned and this is not

482
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,872
Tokenize this is a natural extension

483
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:13,664
Of already established

484
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,688
Things about

485
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,968
The setting

486
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:19,040
They brought the idea to James Wyatt

487
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:21,856
It was a senior creative designer on the story team

488
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:24,928
Turn out to be a personal project for both of them

489
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,976
Ali is trans

490
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:29,280
Although she wasn't out at the time

491
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:30,816
That's for James

492
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:35,168
My daughter is trans so I send I need to write this story

493
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,704
For her sake

494
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:40,032
Allie and James really wanted this character

495
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,312
It's called Alicia

496
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:43,104
To be a fierce Warrior

497
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,384
Impact

498
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,920
The car's official title is

499
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,968
Alesha who Smiles at death

500
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:50,016
An illustration on the card

501
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,808
Shows Alaska in full armor

502
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,624
Leading the charge with her Army of the maardu Clan

503
00:23:55,392 --> 00:24:00,512
Want to thank the magic that I love about our game is that we don't tend to put boobplate

504
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,536
Honor women

505
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,304
So

506
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,584
You can't really tell

507
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,888
Water physiology looks like

508
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,448
James Rowe the backstory for the website

509
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,240
And the biggest plot points

510
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,264
They argued over

511
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:13,056
Was whether an antagonist

512
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:15,616
Should confront A Lash about her identity

513
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:20,992
There was some sense and I've heard some people say this since the story was published that

514
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,784
Maybe it would have been better if

515
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:27,136
Unless it was just accepted for who she is with no question at all

516
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:31,232
But we did end up with a character in the story who

517
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:35,072
Challenges her and says you're just a boy with doesn't know who he is

518
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:39,168
Which is a terrible awful thing to say

519
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:43,008
To my daughter it was really important that that was there

520
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,288
Because she wanted

521
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,080
Jehovah character

522
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,616
Come to realize

523
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:49,152
Eyelashes

524
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:51,456
Worth and value and identity is who she is

525
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,552
Funny little thing I remember discussing early on is

526
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:02,464
That Alaska was a good fit for the Marty for two reasons than one is that idea that they claim a war name and the other is the fact that

527
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,000
They don't use Blue Magic

528
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:07,328
Because in the World of Magic the Gathering

529
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:09,632
If you have access to Blue Magic Lewis

530
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,728
Personally about transformation and so it would actually be really easy to

531
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:15,008
Change your identity

532
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,312
Change your appearance change your body

533
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,592
And we wanted

534
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,384
Her experience to reflect

535
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,456
Better the experience of real trans people in this world

536
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:25,248
Without access to Blue Magic

537
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,552
I'll tell you what if I had Blue Magic

538
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:32,160
My life might have gone a little differently a lot of people size might have gone a little differently

539
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:36,000
My daughter has actually designed a D&D spell that will allow that

540
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,536
As a permanent transition

541
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:38,560
Nice

542
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:41,120
When they finally put the card out there

543
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:44,960
They were a little nervous but how the magic Community would react

544
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:46,496
But

545
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:52,128
There was so much positive reaction that I still cry

546
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,688
It was it was overwhelmingly positive

547
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:56,992
Yeah maybe one comment in 50

548
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:57,760
Was negative

549
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:03,904
The overwhelming majority overwhelming majority was positive

550
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:06,464
The creation of his character Elijah

551
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:08,512
Also had a big impact on Ally

552
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:10,304
I lived

553
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:13,376
I was going to call a stealth

554
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:14,400
For a long time

555
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,168
It is

556
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:18,240
I didn't talk about being trans I didn't let people know I

557
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,776
I kept it a secret without

558
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,312
You have to lie lying about it

559
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:23,616
I came out

560
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:24,640
About

561
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,176
Halfway through the process

562
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,712
And

563
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:31,808
It was that it was incredibly rewarding I was incredibly relieving

564
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,344
Without a Lusha

565
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,160
I would still probably be stealth which

566
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:39,232
Look I'm not going to say doesn't work for some people cuz it does

567
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:41,024
But it was a I felt

568
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,608
I hope it doesn't burden and the less she was able to save me from that

569
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:49,728
But Alexa isn't just a character in the story she's a character in a game

570
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,776
Inner game mechanics are cool

571
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:55,616
Michigan help you resurrect other cards that you've already used up

572
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,944
And that's something that Allie really appreciates about magic

573
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:02,272
The way game mechanics Inspire character development

574
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,040
Vice versa

575
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,880
It it takes to design and directions that

576
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:10,976
We wouldn't necessarily ever get to without

577
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:13,024
The desire to

578
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,328
Figure out how to express an idea

579
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,376
Through the mechanics of the game

580
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,680
I think that it would be possible to put

581
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:21,728
Different stories on all the way

582
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:26,080
I really love the stories that we've got but if you didn't have any story on on these cards

583
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,872
You'd be missing

584
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:28,896
Solve

585
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:29,920
Really

586
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:36,064
So I came into Magic the Gathering wondering two things

587
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:39,904
Why is this game still so popular 25 years later

588
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:42,976
What is the role of Storytelling in a card game

589
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:50,144
And I think the reason why magic has been so popular isn't just the story within the cards or the story about the cards

590
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:52,960
The brand new story that emerges

591
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,008
Every time someone plays the car

592
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:58,080
The real story of a game as what happens

593
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:58,848
Player

594
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:00,896
Embrey Dahmer muses

595
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:02,688
That is increasingly rare

596
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:04,480
I mean so many video games today

597
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:07,040
Behaving like 5 Hour movies

598
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:09,344
Give the player very little autonomy

599
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,392
In an era where

600
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,928
So many games are played

601
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,744
Alone in front of your PC or in front of your console

602
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:20,096
Magic requires this community requires the semen presents its

603
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,888
It's compelling enough in it

604
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,936
Mechanic Smith gameplay and systems

605
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,728
That it wants to

606
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:28,288
Hold onto your brain wants you to explore

607
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,056
It's

608
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,336
Complexities

609
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,872
But in order to do so

610
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:33,920
You have to interface with other humans

611
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:34,944
And

612
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:37,248
Because of that it ends up being this

613
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,784
Naturally viral thing

614
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:40,320
Where

615
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,600
If I want to

616
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:43,136
See if my new deck works

617
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:45,184
I'm going to have to find somebody to play it

618
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:50,560
In other words the magic of the game is real world human interaction

619
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:53,376
Real world human interaction

620
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:55,168
Is in short supply these

621
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:01,824
Well that's it for this week thank you for listening

622
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:06,432
Special thanks to Nat Bale Mark rosewater Alli medwin James Wyatt

623

Brittany dommermuth and Liz Leo

624
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,064
Magic has some of the best fantasy art

625
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,648
Out there and I am saying it

626
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:17,696
I asked Liz if she's any favorite car

627
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:20,256
I love the card hydradoodle

628
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:24,096
It's this Hydra but it's also a poodle and

629
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,144
All the heads

630
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:32,544
Are off doing weird crazy things and the flavor tax is less housebroken than housebreaking

631
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,360
That's good

632
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:37,408
Is it your car is really cute

633
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:46,880
Imaginary world is produced by Eric molinsky and Stephanie Billman you can find it at imaginary worlds podcast

634
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:47,648

635
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,440
Global Link in the show no

636
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:54,560
So when it comes to Magic in particular

637
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:57,120
My boy Carver and Maslow always

638
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:59,168
Always have something to say

639
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,448
What do you say boys

640
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,216
Hello

641
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:02,240
My name is carver

642
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:04,288
And I play Magic the Gathering

643
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:08,128
My favorite thing to do is to try to find a combo

644
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:09,664
Or something like that

645
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,968
That is so good that it will end up

646
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,784
Destroying the four battle just to unbeatable

647
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,320
Princeton the copycat

648
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,880
The copycat combo

649
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:22,976
The person who found a way to make incident little cat

650
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:27,072
To attack for damaged by around Turn 4 and it was

651
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:32,192
It was ridiculously consistent as a tattoo and everytime you want it turned out

652
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:34,752
Said no one could beat it no one can find a way to beat it

653
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:37,312
And everyone lost

654
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:43,712
And eventually they found out it was so good that both cards need to be banned and taken out of the phone

655
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:44,736
Charlie

656
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:47,040
So that it wouldn't go on like this

657
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:49,856
Until your goal is to find another one of those

658
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:54,464
My name is Maslow and I also play Magic the Gathering

659
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,048
I prefer playing the izzet colors which are red and blue

660
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:04,960
I'd like to play a lot of instants and sorcery cards and I normally play a little too many creatures for

661
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:05,984
For that type of deck

662
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:11,360
The great thing about instance is that you don't need to wait around while the other people's turns

663
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:12,128
You can

664
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:15,456
Do stuff as long as you have enough Mana for it you can

665
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:17,760
Play instances on other people's turn

666
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:19,808
What's an example of

667
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,856
A type of innocent party

668
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:23,136
You can play

669
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,928
For instance

670
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,464
Get it

671
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:28,768
There is a

672
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,560
A card called Sonic

673
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:36,192
Assault and I normally would play this on the phone it's turned when they're attacking and I'd say

674
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:38,496
Before attacks results

675
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:41,056
Itap user creature named here

676
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:44,896
And that packs and is an added bonus

677
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:49,248
Take control of that creature takes to damage cuz that's another feature of the car

678
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:57,184
That was for a few old school Die Hard fan

679
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:58,976

690
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:51,968
Before we go I want to tell you about the body genius a five-part series from fellow radiotopia show the truth

691
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,760
The bunny genius is a dark

692
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:54,784
Comic mystery

693
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,368
That whines through a treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

694
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,648
We're looking the part

695
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:01,184
Might cost you your life

696
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:06,560
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

697
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:10,912
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

698
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:15,264
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like a dad

699
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:19,616
I'm having I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

700
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,920
Actually if I'm being honest

701
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:23,968
I'm one of the main guys who know how to do that guy

702
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:30,368
I think a few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an act

703
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:31,648
Movie called Immortal cop

704
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:34,976
Was found dead in my private gym

705
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:41,376
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine even worse the cops think that I had some

706
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:43,680
Nothing to do with it now

707
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:45,728
I need to clear my name

708
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:52,128
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes to find them

709
00:33:54,944 --> 00:34:01,088
Final episode of the body genius drops on May 30th Bend all 5 Parts on the truth podcast. Com
