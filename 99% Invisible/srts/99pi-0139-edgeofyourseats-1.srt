00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,936
The chair is a difficult object

22
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:14,240
Skyscraper is almost easier

23
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:19,616
Those the words of mise van der rohe architecture of also design chairs

24
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:20,896
Eaves

25
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:21,664

00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:30,880
If they've designed a big building chances are they've designed a thing on which to set

31
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:34,720
And this makes sense the chairs will be signature design pieces for Ark

32
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:39,584
Because chairs are almost like teeny tiny buildings for one person

33
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,376
Producer Avery trufelman

34
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:46,240
And of course it's not just Architects designers of all Stripes have this love affair with

35
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,008
Chairs

36
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,800
Well I think every designer

37
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,848
Really would love to design a chair

38
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,896
I mean there's so many interesting things about yours

39
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:56,224
This is designer Bruce Hannah I'm a teacher

40
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,248
Pratt Institute

41
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,272
In Brooklyn New York

42
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,808
And

43
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,856
Design things for know for years

44
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,648
Including plenty of chairs

45
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,696
Free office for everything

46
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:06,720
Cheers

47
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,000
Exist

48
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:10,816
They kind of look like placeholders for human beings

49
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:13,888
Are you going to a restaurant that's empty and there's a little place hole

50
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,960
Yet when the people sit in the chair

51
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,240
It disappears

52
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,288
The person replaced

53
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:24,896
And so there's this distinct challenge for chair designers

54
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:27,968
To make this thing look fantastic when empty

55
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:30,784
And remain comfortably invisible when in use

56
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:34,880
And Hannah's pursuit of seating Innovation actually led to something else

57
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:37,184
When he was experimenting with foam cushioning

58
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,232
Hannah accidentally invented

59
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,000
Dinner

60
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:42,048
Well actually it's called the phone

61
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:45,376
Still really cool if it did it come out of Designing

62
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:49,984
Are you a much more interested in the chair yes those designer sure do love chair

63
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,008
Love them

64
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:53,312
They keep turning out new ones all the time

65
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:56,384
Which brings me to one of my favorite headlines from The Onion

66
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,152
Quote

67
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:00,992
Report confirms no need to make new tears for the time being

68
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:02,528
Because yeah

69
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,064
There are already a lot

70
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,368
I think you could say that about anything don't have enough cards

71
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,416
Personally

72
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,696
I wouldn't be against it

73
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:11,232
But new chairs are out

74
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,000
Who is coming out

75
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,816
The fit our ever-changing needs

76
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,632
Because chairs determine how we use

77
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,400
The space

78
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:20,448
Anna brought up this great example of

79
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,728
Seating in cafes

80
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,520
Cafes used to be places for

81
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,312
Another places

82
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,080
Is 4 working

83
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,616
So people are sitting

84
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,896
Interacting different

85
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,688
And so the furniture

86
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,456
The vault

87
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:32,992
Space

88
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:33,760
In the action

89
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,552
Throughout our lives

90
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,832
We have been told

91
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,112
Sit down

92
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:41,696
In school in the office and the Plate Company of a dinner party

93
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:45,280
In a car or plane or bus or movie theater sitting is the default

94
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,840
We spend a lot of time in chair

95
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:54,496
But I'm sure you heard all the talk lately about how unhealthy tears are especially if he was in public radio which I bet

96
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,264
You do you feel

97
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,312
First we'll talk about chronic

98
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,336
Sitting

99
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:03,200
Are you sitting down well you might want to stand up

100
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:07,296
You can be bad for your health and those who were sitting more worse

101
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,576
Substantially more likely

102
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,344
Play today

103
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:13,696
I think I sound like five articles with the headline

104
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:15,232
Sitting is the new smoking

105
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:19,583
The absolute number of hours that you sit is directly correlated

106
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,631
With mortality from all causes

107
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,423
Cancer heart attack

108
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:26,751
And it doesn't matter how many hours you

109
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,543
You spend in the gym as compensation

110
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,335
This is Professor Galen cranz

111
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:33,407
You come in in the secretary says have a seat

112
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,687
She doesn't know she's

113
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,455
Wishing you

114
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:37,247
Death Note the death wish

115
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:44,159
This research along with those scary headlines has led to a new market for medicine ball chair

116
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:44,927
Adjustable

117
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,463
Standing desks

118
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,231
Treadmill.

119
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,767
The chair back

120
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:49,791
Is upon us

121
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:53,887
And Berkeley architecture Professor Galen cranz totally nailed it

122
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:58,495
Way before anyone else it is nice to that people are

123
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,543
Yeah saying that I was prescient

124
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,567
I wasn't present

125
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:02,591
Everybody else

126
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,407
In 1998

127
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:07,711
Can't publish the book called The Chair

128
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:10,271
Rethinking culture body and Design

129
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:14,367
In the argument of the chair is that we should stop sitting in chair

130
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:19,231
At least we should stop sitting in them for so long after 3 hours

131
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,023
Doesn't seem to have much concert

132
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:25,375
But Professor Kranz takes Innovative chair-sitting to another level

133
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,679
I try to eliminate

134
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:30,495
All conventional tears in my own life

135
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:33,823
Which presented a challenge when I went to go interview her

136
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,591
I wonder if it's

137
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,359
See how should we say

138
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:41,759
Professor Kansas house was full of floor cushions tatami mats and lots and lots of unconventional

139
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:42,783
Hybrid chairs

140
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,855
Like a medicine ball on an office chair chassis

141
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,391
And one that looks like a sleep

142
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,927
Pared-down horse saddle

143
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:53,023
And when she's not in her home feeding Oasis and out in public

144
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,583
Versatrans does a lot of standing

145
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,631
Instead of sitting when she gets tired

146
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,911
Cheops Tennille

147
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,679
Or Squad

148
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,215
Or lie down

149
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:05,567
I laid down in a bank and somebody came up and asked me if I was having a heart attack

150
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,127
I just kind of them you know I understand

151
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,759
But I said no I'm fine I'm just resting cuz the line is so long

152
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,063
Got2b

153
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,391
Gutsy to actually avoid the chairs everywhere

154
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:23,231
So how the rest of us gets suckered into the seated position

155
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:26,047
Well it all started when we got off the farm

156
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:31,423
In the twentieth century we moved from being an agricultural economy or most people worked on farms

157
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,471
Then we move into

158
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,799
A manufacturing economy were a lot of people worked in factories

159
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,591
And some sad

160
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,615
Some stood

161
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,663
To work the machines

162
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,967
In the longest conveyor belt

163
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,527
Not to over romanticize life on the farm

164
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,575
They were still doing back-breaking work

165
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:54,207
They just probably had better posture and less carpal tunnel syndrome and then we moved into a service economy

166
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:58,303
And that seems to be where the chair really took off

167
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,095
And became the dominant

168
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:01,631
Redis

169
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:02,655
Our Lives

170
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:05,471
And then when we settled into the service economy

171
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:08,543
Sitting became the way to type in file and fill out paperwork

172
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,591
You could do that standing but

173
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,383
For reasons I don't

174
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,663
Fully understand

175
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:19,807
We did it sitting until office chairs become V chairs the chairs that people spend most of their dad

176
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,367
And until very recent history

177
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,647
They were not made

178
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,671
Fit your body

179
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:25,951
They were made

180
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,231
To fit your job

181
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:29,023
So you had a managerial one you had a

182
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,655
Bruce Hannah had to design a few of these kinds of office

183
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:38,239
The status oriented chair design meant then some cases

184
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,007
You had

185
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,799
320 lb

186
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,847
Executive sitting in a gigantic

187
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:45,663
Because it really was about his presence when he was

188
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,199
For her price

189
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,503
And then you had

190
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,271
The

191
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,039
100

192
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,063
The pound

193
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,855
Assistant secretary sitting

194
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,135
Tiny little chair

195
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,463
The most part status Trump organize emacs

196
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,743
And then Along Comes now

197
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:01,791
The Aeron chair

198
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,583
Where it's

199
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,863
The same chair

200
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:05,631
Precise

201
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,727
Everybody

202
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,519
All of you just

203
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,287
Wii guitar

204
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,311
They get everything they need

205
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,079
Need to work

206
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,359
Because everyone

207
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,151
Equally

208
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:17,919
Hard

209
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,991
The Herman Miller Aeron chair

210
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,783
You've seen an Aeron chair

211
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,575
It got this mess looking back

212
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:27,391
And you probably heard it mentioned on public radio

213
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,415
You Beautiful nerd

214
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:31,487
Support for NPR comes from set for life in Herman Miller

215
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,279
Featuring The Aeron chair

216
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,071
Including the true black color

217
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,095
They're usually black

218
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,631
For True black

219
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,935
There's one of them everywhere I was surprise when I woke

220
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,703
The studio today

221
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,543
Because you're everywhere

222
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,311
Do you think

223
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,591
Did the ubiquitous

224
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:51,455
An Aeron chair brought on the sage of ergonomic office chairs that look like little robots

225
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:54,015
They display their Technologies of selling point

226
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:58,111
And they show off their swivels and their adjustments and there are ergonomic technology

227
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,391
The Aeron chair

228
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,951
Define what an office chair ought to look like

229
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,767
Right now I think it's what society says

230
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:05,791
That will make me

231
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,583
The piece of machinery

232
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,887
And no one guessed that these are

233
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:10,655
Expensive

234
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:13,471
Pieces of machinery would sell like hotcakes

235
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:17,567
No one except guilin cramps first came out people said well

236
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,871
You know nobody's going to pay for

237
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,663
An ordinary Clerk

238
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:22,687
To have

239
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:25,759
An adjustable chair with all the bells and whistles

240
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:28,319
Oh that's way too expensive that Will never happen

241
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:32,671
Well then there were repetitive strain injury in a whole lot of lawsuits

242
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,439
Spend

243
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:37,023
Insurance companies suddenly thought it was a lot cheaper to buy those

244
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,071
Fancy adjustable chairs

245
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,887
Then to pay for medical bills

246
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:45,215
Cranes is a fan of what she calls body-conscious design

247
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:48,799
And considers any chair that takes the human figure into account

248
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,847
Is a vast improvement over

249
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,383
Bean bag chair

250
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:56,991
But Krantz argues that some of those bells and whistles on office chairs actually don't help that much

251
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:00,063
Specifically those ergonomic chair backs

252
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,855
Because in all likelihood

253
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:04,415
You are probably sitting in this chair

254
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,951
While working at a desk

255
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:07,999
And the desk

256
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:08,767
It turns out

257
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:11,583
Is the chairs devious accomplice

258
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,911
The True Villain is the table

259
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,935
Flat surfaces

260
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,471
Force you to lean over

261
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:20,031
So you never really take advantage of the chair back

262
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,847
The chair in particular

263
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:26,431
Asks us to sit at this right angle position

264
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,991
Most of our work is forward oriented

265
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:35,391
Clerical work reading writing checks and eating even drinking tea and coffee and all the

266
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,159
Everything's

267
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,951
Forward

268
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,487
Or more likely slump

269
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:40,767
Even if you have

270
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:41,791
Excellent posture

271
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:46,143
It's hard to avoid leaning over your keyboard or your dinner or your book

272
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,167
So the hand

273
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:50,239
Gets seduced into coming forward

274
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,287
And then the spine turns into a

275
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,567
Big C shape

276
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:57,407
And Galen Krantz says that when you curve your spine into the sea shape

277
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:00,991
It's bad for the spine of course but it also compresses your organs

278
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,271
What does really bad

279
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:05,599
Especially for hours on end throughout the day in an office

280
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,135
And because of this

281
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:10,207
Horrible chair desk Dynamic chair designers

282
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:12,511
Solve much by adding economic elements

283
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,279
Put the chair back

284
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:17,375
Actually Professor Kranz thinks we should do away with back support entirely

285
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,167
I think back support is a

286
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,983
Big mistake and it's it's weekend are back

287
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:25,055
If you support something you usually weaken it

288
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,103
So if you're in a situation

289
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,639
Where you must must

290
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:29,663
Sit in the chair

291
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,967
Karin says it's best to ignore the chair back

292
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:34,271
Back and sit yourself right at the edge of your seat

293
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,807
Write out to the edge

294
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,879
That way you don't get seduced to using the chair back

295
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,671
If you're on torso strength

296
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,695
Keep you upright

297
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,767
With the strategy of getting your sit bones out to the edge of the chair

298
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,559
You turning it into a stool

299
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,607
Tools princess

300
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,655
Are good alternative to jerez

301
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,679
Because they don't have

302
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:54,495
Back support can they get your body out of the sea shape

303
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:58,079
It positions the body halfway between sitting and standing

304
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:58,847
And if you take

305
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:02,431
That body position and lean it backwards what do you get

306
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,455
A lounge chair

307
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,759
And that's how I'm

308
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,295
Position right now

309
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,063
Yeah

310
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:12,415
Dylan Krantz was reclining in a lounge chair for this interview I'll be in the lounge

311
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,463
And I'll have you in the rocking

312
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:21,375
And she put me in a rocking chair because unlike a normal chair it allows for more fluidity and movement

313
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,679
This all sounds great and healthy and fun

314
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,471
But in practice I was sitting

315
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:29,055
All the Way Forward rocking right to the very front

316
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,871
Retching my microphone out to Kranz

317
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,663
She was lying back in her lounge chair

318
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,199
And it hurt

319
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:39,807
I just wanted to chairs in a flat desk to rest my arm on

320
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:43,135
But I don't know maybe I just wasn't used to this alternative world yet

321
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:45,183
Maybe I need to get acclimated I don't know

322
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:48,255
I mean Professor Kranz looks pretty comfortable in her lounge chair

323
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,351
4 people got so into standing desks and treadmill desk

324
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:55,935
Professor Krantz was sure that lounge chairs and lounge chair.

325
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,215
Who replaced Harrison

326
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:03,615
Of all the solutions to the seating problem the lounge chair is the solution that requires the least physical effort

327
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:06,687
Will still supporting the human body in a healthy way

328
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:12,831
But it's not like there's one single piece of furniture that will correct all the problems of chair-sitting no

329
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,879
Lounge chair is not the answer

330
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,415
There's no the answer

331
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,695
What we need

332
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,719
Is variety

333
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,255
The best posture

334
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,279
Is the next

335
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:25,631
Bruce Hannah agrees the more variation in your day

336
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,399
Better off

337
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:28,703
But he's not chair avoidant

338
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,751
Sitting is the new smoking

339
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:31,519
Really

340
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:34,847
We should be up and running everyday I run run run run run run run run

341
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:38,431
Set mean that all restaurants will be will be running in place at restaurant

342
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,967
Toby treadmills

343
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,015
Will do nothing be safe

344
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,551
I like to see it

345
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,087
I want to sit down

346
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,647
And ideal space to live or to work

347
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:52,511
Could be full of unconventional mismatched chairs for you to try out and cycle through

348
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,559
Lichen Galen Kansas dining room

349
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,095
People say

350
00:13:56,351 --> 00:14:02,495
Wow you have a lot of chairs I say yeah to cheer Museum and I say old truck be sure to try them all and people do they like

351
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:06,591
I said in that one can I go try that one if we threw the dinner you know

352
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:09,663
The middle-class thing is you want everything to match

353
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,199
And

354
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:16,319
It's fun that these don't match everybody loves it trying outfit all the different attitudes

355
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,343
Towards

356
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,623
Seating reform

357
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:22,207
But the solution isn't just alike only in Berkeley kind of thing

358
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:25,023
So maybe in this one case this one exception

359
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,815
The onion is wrong

360
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,863
We don't need fewer things to sit on

361
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:29,887
It turns out

362
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:30,911
We need more

363
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,191
In all different kinds

364
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,727
Stool purchase

365
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:34,751
Lounge chairs

366
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,823
Throwing some desk redesigns while you're at it

367
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,639
Ones that rise up to meet us like drafting table

368
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,919
Design more

369
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,455
Much much more

370
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,551
All That Jazz

371
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:59,583
I can make the most
