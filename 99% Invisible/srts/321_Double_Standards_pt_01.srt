And when it returned for its fourth season premiere in 2013

31
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,760
They came up with this.

32
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:27,040
Called Secrets week

00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:29,600
Over the course of the week each of the five co-hosts

34
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,904
Took turns revealing one of their deepest

35
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,928

Metro State secrets

43
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:49,824
More interesting was a secret from one of the other co hosts

44
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:50,848
Julie Chen

45
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:54,176
My secret dates back to when I was

46
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,456
25 years old

47
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:58,016
And I was working as a local news

48
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:58,784
Border

49
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,064
In Dayton Ohio

50
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:02,368
Wait Chantel.

51
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,928
She been paying your dues as a reporter

52
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:07,488
But what she really dreamed about

53
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,024
Becoming an anchor

54
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,960
But when she approached your news director about the possibility

55
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:18,752
He gave her some

56
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:19,520
Be back

57
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:24,640
Because of your heritage because of your Asian eyes

58
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:27,456
Sometimes I've noticed when you're on camera

59
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:29,248
And you're interviewing someone

60
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,040
You look disinterest

61
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,576
You look bored

62
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,368
Because your eyes are

63
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,928
Art are so heavy they're so small

64
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:39,488
I hate people

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,512
Yeah

66
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:44,864
But Chen who's Chinese Americans found herself wondering if

67
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,656
Maybe he had a point

68
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:49,984
Reached out to a prominent talent agent for some career advice

69
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,288
And he actually took it a step further

70
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,568
He said

71
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,592
I

72
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:55,616
Cannot represent

73
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:58,944
You got

74
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,224
Plastic surgery

75
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,760
To make your eyes look

76
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:02,784
Bigger

77
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:06,112
And then she admits to the audience that she did it

78
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,392
She got the surgery

79
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,696
A procedure called blepharoplasty

80
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:14,048
For people who are not of east or Southeast Asian descent

81
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:19,680
Blepharoplasty is usually done to lift loose or sagging skin around the upper eyelids

82
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:20,960
Is caused by aging

83
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:24,288
Just Google Kenny Rogers before and after 2003

84
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,848
But for a lot of people of Asian descent

85
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:29,408
The surgery is more commonly referred to as

86
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,688
Double eyelid surgery

87
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,480
About having visions

88
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:33,504
Included

89
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:34,784
Are born with with

90
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,088
Called a monolid or a single eyelid

91
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,184
Which means that there's no visible crease on the eyelid skin above Lashley

92
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,488
This is what Julie Chen had before

93
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,048
The double eyelid surgery a decreased

94
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:51,168
So instead of the skin of the upper lid running smoothly from the bottom of the eyebrow

95
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,960
Straight down to the eyelashes

96
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:56,288
There's now a small indented fold in the skin

97
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,824
Just a few millimeters wide

98
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,152
That runs in a horizontal Crescent above the Lash line

99
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:05,504
This crease suddenly changes the eye shape in a way that makes the eye itself

100
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,040
Appear slightly larger

101
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:11,648
The simplest method doesn't even involve any Cuts just a few stitches along the eyelid

102
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,672
How to create the crease

103
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:16,000
John got the surgery in the mid-90s

104
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:19,583
But she kept it hidden from the public up until 2013

105
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,119
And that day

106
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,655
Which tells the audience about it

107
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:26,239
It was surprising to me to hear her sounding so

108
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:29,311
I didn't want to show you what I'm really demonstrate like

109
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,359
What my news headshot

110
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,895
Look like before I have this

111
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:33,919
Elasticsearch

112
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,991
I mean if you look at the app

113
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:37,759
After

114
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:38,783
That

115
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,063
The eyes are bigger

116
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,855
I look more

117
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,623
Alert

118
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,207
More Express

119
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,047
What's the name of that response

120
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:52,095
Sharon Osbourne saying fabulous

121
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,143
What is a serving to me

122
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:58,751
Double eyelid surgery is one of the most popular procedures for Asian-American

123
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:03,103
And hearing such a positive reaction it really is no wonder why

124
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:09,759
The hopes of looking fabulous or more expressive for the same reasons why people in my own family have had the procedure

125
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:10,527
Done themselves

126
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,623
In this ethnically specific surgery may have its roots in Asia

127
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,439
But it wasn't Asian doctors who popularized

128
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:20,511
It was popularized by a white guy

129
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,535
The US

130
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:25,631
He thought he was doing Asian people a favor by helping them look

131
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,911
West Asia

132
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,263
But before we get to him

133
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:34,079
The origin of double-eyelid surgery itself

134
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,359
Dates back much further

135
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,919
19th century Japan

136
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:43,551
Beauty standards will always vary from culture to culture and even within the same culture overtime

137
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:48,159
Double eyelids are seen as a beauty preference for a lot of Asians and asian-americans today

138
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,463
But that wasn't always the case

139
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:57,119
There's actually little to no record of double eyelids as an aesthetic preference until something called the Meiji restoration

140
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:02,239
Before the 1860s Japan practiced a policy of isolationism

141
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,543
And limited their contact with other Nation

142
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:07,103
But during the Meiji restoration which

143
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,151
Took place from the 1860's

144
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,687
Do the early 1900s

145
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,223
Japan opened up

146
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:18,879
Begin incorporating a european-style banking system new kinds of Scientific Technology and western style

147
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:25,279
It was also around this time that the first double eyelid surgery was performed by Japanese surgeon

148
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:28,095
It's easy to find like woodcut images or pictures of

149
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:33,471
The 1880s 1890s of a limited number of Japanese female patients are having I changes

150
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,751
This is John demoya

151
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:38,079
Professor of medical history at Seoul national university

152
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:41,919
He says that as Japan's contact with Western Nations increased

153
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:45,503
So did an appreciation for double eyelids over monolids

154
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:48,831
And it seems to be the case with a lot of Asian countries

155
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:53,695
Pretty places in Asia where there was a heavy contact either with the British Empire or with

156
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:54,719
Broader

157
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:57,279
Basquiat use the word American Empire

158
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:00,095
Tanabe places where blepharoplasty has 10 to pop up

159
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,887
It's these moments

160
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:04,703
Where Asian countries begin developing relationship

161
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,239
Swith Western Empires

162
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:12,639
At Double eyelid surgery becomes more visible

163
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,687
Prior to and during the Vietnam war and post

164
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,455
Korean War

165
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:19,551
But while blepharoplasty may have already existed in Asia is here and there

166
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:22,111
It didn't really take off in popularity

167
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,647
Until the Korean War

168
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,863
Korean war is technically still ongoing

169
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:37,471
But the actual fighting between northern and southern forces lasted from 1950

170
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,751
Pizza 1953

171
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:44,127
By the time the Armistice was signed dividing the peninsula into North and South Korea

172
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:46,431
The impact of the war had left South Korea

173
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,735
Pretty relying on help from Western Nations

174
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:54,879
What happened obviously created a certain path dependency in the sense that much of the aid was coming

175
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,927
From Western countries

176
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:01,023
This came in the form of food construction and importantly

177
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,047
Medical Aid

178
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:05,375
Which is how an American doctor named David Ralph Millard

179
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,167
Ended up in South Korea

180
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,703
He's a military doctor he's gay

181
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,543
He doesn't arrive into Korean till the war is winding down or just after

182
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:18,943
Millard he graduated from both Harvard and Yale then served in the Navy before settling on reconstructive surgery at this

183
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,967
Specialization

184
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,015
He studied under Harold Gillies

185
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,807
Father of modern plastic surgery

186
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:29,695
Who's known for repairing the bodies and faces of World War 1 and World War II soldiers maimed in battle

187
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:35,071
Where does the word I don't wanna say normalcy but he wants to restore some sense of a face that actually resembles a

188
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:35,839
A human face

189
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:43,519
Millard was stationed in Seoul in 1954 where he served as Chief plastic surgeon for the United States Marine Corps

190
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:49,407
It was his job to provide reconstructive medical assistance to those suffering from disfigurement caused by War

191
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,223
Burns or simply by lack of medical access

192
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:59,903
Millard was a fan of old Westfield grown up riding horses and learning to tie knots

193
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,183
Spinning ropes

194
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:06,047
Idealizing manly Western Stars like Ken Maynard and Buck Jones

195
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:12,447
He ended up bringing this kind of cowboy Goodguys savior mentality to his work in some strange and very little

196
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,215
Federal Way's

197
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:17,311
The first became well known for doing cleft palate surgeries on children

198
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:23,711
It is autobiography which he titled saving faces he tells the story of his first cleft palate patient

199
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,735
In South Korea

200
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:31,135
Millard I've been looking for someone to test a new method on but he was having a hard time finding a willing subject

201
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:35,487
We couldn't find a volunteer you decided to rustle up one and sell

202
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:38,303
This is before institutional review board exist

203
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,351
He's largely self authorized

204
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:47,263
Millard brag that he spotted a 10 year old South Korean boy with a cleft lip and ran back to grab a lasso that he kept in the foot

205
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,031
Foot Locker

206
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,079
Yes you heard that correctly

207
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:53,151
Lard-butt a lasso over 6000 miles

208
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:53,919
South Korea

209
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,479
I do not like where this is heading

210
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:59,807
He lassoed the ten-year-old and perform the surgery on him

211
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,599
And in case you were wondering

212
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:04,415
No he did not have parental permission to do this

213
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,207
Backing away historically

214
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:09,279
Probably today could not do

215
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:11,071
Medi the things that he did

216
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:15,167
Where someone else looking in and actually reviewing his work from professional stamp

217
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:19,263
As crude and horrifying as Millard methods could be

218
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,543
Is work in class

219
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:24,639
Pallet repair did get him respect in the field of reconstructive surgery

220
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,431
But he would soon become famous

221
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,967
Or maybe infamous

222
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,759
Another procedure entirely

223
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,295
Blepharoplasty

224
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,343
Or the double eyelid surgery

225
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:37,439
Millard was the first documented surgeon to perform this procedure in South

226
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,207
Korea

227
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:38,975
On a translator

228
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:42,559
Covetous in an essay that he wrote about his time overseas

229
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,607
Called oriental peregrination

230
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,399
Meaning Oriental Journeys

231
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,983
Depicts a Korean male translator

232
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:50,751
Who is

233
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,823
Coming to him because he wants to look different than he looks

234
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,103
Millard recounts

235
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,127
Quote

236
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:02,271
A slant-eyed Korean interpreter speaking excellent English came in requesting to be made into a round eye

237
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,295
Unquote

238
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,855
Interpreter then tells Millard that has

239
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:08,159
Does translation work relies on his relationship

240
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:08,927
American

241
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,207
Similar traits

242
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,231
Quote

243
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:14,303
He felt that because of the Squints and a slant eyes

244
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,351
Americans could not tell what he was thinking

245
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,631
Consequently

246
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,911
Did not trust him

247
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,703
As this was partly true

248
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:21,727
I can send it

249
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:22,751
Quote

250
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,543
Which sounds

251
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:25,823
Familiar

252
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:30,175
It's basically the same feedback that Julie Chen got 40 years later

253
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,967
People couldn't read her

254
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:34,527
Russians and audiences wouldn't relate to her

255
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:38,879
Stereotype of the inscrutable Asian has a long history in West

256
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:41,951
People from Asian Nations as

257
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,743
Perpetual foreigners who are just

258
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,535
Two different to assimilate

259
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:50,143
He shows dramatic before and after pictures of the translator

260
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:56,543
It is clear that he thought the work he was doing was more than just cosmetic caption

261
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,079
Backwards I said something like

262
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:01,407
Now he's frequently mistaken for Italian or Spanish

263
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,711
Morgana say that the translator

264
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,039
Kidspace totally transform now and European looking

265
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,831
Plans to go to the United States

266
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,367
Study for the ministry

267
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,391
Swimming

268
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:15,487
This is where people get angry at Millard not only enough for whatever his ethics are in terms of

269
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:18,303
The medical stuff but the cultural assumptions were you thinking

270
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,607
Completely transform this man's life

271
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,143
And his body is react

272
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:22,911
Surgery

273
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,959
Over the course of his year in South Korea

274
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:26,239
Mark continued

275
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,263
Performing blepharoplasty

276
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,031
Christian others

277
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:33,151
Specifically South Korean sex trade workers who are trying to appeal to American GI

278
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,991
Describe a woman's desire for eyelid surgery to be for

279
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,271
Economic reasons

280
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:44,415
Millard blepharoplasty offered a solution to a cultural disconnect between east and west

281
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:49,791
It was only those with Asian features who were expected to change their bodies

282
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:54,143
What's the population of East Asians growing in the United States

283
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,007
Millard speculated that double eyelid surgery might be useful at home in the US to

284
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,335
Gi's were bringing home Japanese and Korean Brides

285
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:07,199
And Millard thought that plastic surgeons could help them integrate into American society

286
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:11,551
He definitely saw himself in like to see himself as a

287
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,343
An advocate of the surgery

288
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,135
I don't think you could possibly though I've been to

289
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:15,903
Dissipated Howard

290
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:16,927
Will get picked up in different ways

291
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:24,351
According to the American Society of plastic surgery more than 12,000 Asian-American

292
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,911
Inside double eyelid surgery in 2017

293
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:30,751
Procedure has become completely normal for both women and men

294
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,311
And given the racist history behind the person

295
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,407
It makes sense that some people in the US are vocally critical about it

296
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:39,455
Who says look eyelid surgery

297
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:42,015
It's fake it's anti-asian you're erasing

298
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,807
Ethnic markers

299
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:49,183
It's not so much about necessarily just a droopy eye it's also about wanting to look more Caucasian

300
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,231
10 story has prompted a backlash

301
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,023
Some critics accused her of selling out

302
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:57,375
But not everybody buys this Narrative of selling out

303
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,447
The Western media pretty much

304
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:05,055
Distantly has a pitying or condescending attitude about

305
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,591
How Asians

306
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,359
Do plastic

307
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,127
Surgery

308
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,663
This is euny hong

309
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,711
A journalist and author of

310
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,247
The birth of Korean cool

311
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:19,903
She says that the reaction to Julie Chen double eyelid surgery was a perfect example of this condescending attitude

312
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,463
People are accusing her of being ashamed of

313
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,487
Erase

314
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:27,583
I've been ashamed of having Asian eyes and I was kind of gobsmacked

315
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:28,863
Because

316
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,423
You know I can a person's body should be there

317
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,191
Business

318
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:36,799
Calling can speak from personal experience because she's had the surgery done herself

319
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:37,823
She says

320
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,103
It was no big deal

321
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:43,967
The procedure doesn't take very long at all and might even be something like 20 minutes

322
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:49,855
Punk says that stigma around double eyelid surgery is distinctly American

323
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:54,719
American Media tends to assume that Asians are getting plastic surgery to look

324
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,487
Caucasian

325
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,535
And in a multicultural

326
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,815
Society like the US

327
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:01,119
Where racism is a daily reality

328
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:04,959
It could be hard for us not to interpret people's motivations through that lens

329
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:11,615
But Hong says the attitudes about plastic surgery are different in South Korea where blepharoplasty was first

330
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,383
Popularized

331
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:16,735
Will the procedure might have originated with the desire to look more Western

332
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:20,831
That isn't necessarily why South Korean people get it anymore

333
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,135
The history of double eyelids

334
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,439
Surgery might have been motivated

335
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,975
In kind of

336
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:30,815
Racial hegemony or something like that wanted to impose

337
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:33,631
Western beauty standards on Asian Spot

338
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,935
As with a lot of things including

339
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,983
Cuisine and art

340
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:40,543
It can have a certain origin but it always

341
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,335
Gets adopted and localized

342
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:43,871
And

343
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,663
Friends of completely

344
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:49,247
Taking the ball and run with it

345
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:51,807
The surgery has taken on a new meaning

346
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:57,951
Now we are a really focus all we really focus on making Beauty

347
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:04,351
Instead of making Western faces

348
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:10,751
Dollar South Korean plastic surgery at Seoul national university

349
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:15,103
Change the same reason they did back in the 1950s when Millard was around

350
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:19,711
Today they're aspiring to their own uniquely South Korean standard of beauty

351
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:21,759
Which has been shaped by complex

352
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:22,783
Cultural factors

353
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:27,135
The late 1990s South Korea suffered through a financial crisis

354
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:30,463
And the international monetary fund or IMF

355
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:34,303
Stepped in and completely restructured and modernize the economy

356
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:39,167
The country has since recovered and is now the 11th largest economy in the world

357
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,983
But the job market has become so competitive

358
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:44,799
But getting a job can still be incredibly hard

359
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:47,615
People do whatever they can to compete

360
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,407
So you're your appearance

361
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,199
Is 1

362
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,223
Of your

363
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,247
Thesaurus

364
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,807
So you have to kind of develop

365
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,087
Your appearance

366
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,135
You have a better job

367
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:01,439
And better future or better Park

368
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:04,511
And the South Korean government has also

369
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,535
Fully embraced

370
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,303
And encouraged

371
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,839
What's the plastic surgery industry

372
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,399
Governmental effort

373
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,679
To promote

374
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,471
Korean plastic surgery

375
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:14,751
So

376
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,543
Plastic surgery

377
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,591
Israel as

378
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:21,919
Korean culture has been kind of

379
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,711
National income

380
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:27,039
Sorry for the Korean government

381
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:33,439
The South Korean government has lifted a ban on medical advertising and revised immigration rules to make it easier for

382
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:36,255
Foreign patients to get long-term medical visas

383
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:41,375
And now medical tourism makes up a huge portion of the plastic surgery industry

384
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,935
People come from all over the world

385
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:44,959
Have work done

386
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:46,239
And South Korea

387
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:47,519
And

388
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,335
Of course many South Koreans get plastic surgery to

389
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,895
Eyelid surgery is still the most popular

390
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:58,783
Procedure it's so common that a lot of young people in South Korea will get the surgery as soon as they're old enough to

391
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:03,647
Like a gift when you graduate high school before you go to the college it's

392
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,671
Carnival

393
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,463
Laptop

394
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,487
Gift set

395
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:13,631
This is Geo a photographer who spent time documenting the healing process of South Korean plastic surgery

396
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:18,751
She's witnessed many of the recent Trends in Korean beauty culture affecting both women and men

397
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:19,775
So

398
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:23,615
Basically you have to have a chips on my baby looking face

399
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,151
Which is lighter

400
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,807
And you says that many people also want a sharp

401
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,087
Narrow chin

402
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:35,647
The overall effect they go for isn't necessarily

403
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,415
Caucasian

404
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,439
It's almost

405
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,463
Pixieish

406
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:41,023
You definitely have to have a very sharp

407
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,047
V Line

408
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,655
Chin with no jawline we slept very straight in there which outlines

409
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:49,215
But they tend to cut out those

410
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,543
The cheapest complete look

411
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,359
Requires a lot more than double eyelid surgery

412
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:57,407
Which is fairly easy and low-risk

413
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:01,503
Jaw reduction surgery is much more invasive in dangerous

414
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,807
Of course any surgery has its risks

415
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:07,647
But this one involves slicing out a significant amount of jaw bone

416
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:11,743
I could lead to complications like nerve damage or chronic jaw pain

417
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:17,119
One in five South Korean women have gotten some form of plastic

418
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:17,887
Surgery done

419
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:20,959
And if you look at women ages 19 to 29

420
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:23,007
That number shoots up to 1 and 3

421
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:27,359
Uses women face such immense cultural pressure to conform physically

422
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,151
It can be hard to resist

423
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:31,199
You should 5/4

424
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:35,551
Your own Beauty you shouldn't follow the idealized beauty you shouldn't be

425
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,343
Scrutinized by the culture

426
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,623
But it is

427
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:39,647
So hard

428
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,439
Nearest Summit

429
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,463
Easier and peace

430
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:44,511
To be popped

431
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,279
The car charger

432
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:51,167
What is critical as your feels about some aspects of the plastic surgery culture in South Korea

433
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,727
She does wish the rest of the world

434
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:54,495
But just stop

435
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,519
Being so

436
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,287
Judgy

437
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:59,103
Because whether you're a Korean woman

438
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:01,663
Trying to meet your cultures exacting beauty standards

439
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:04,991
Or an Asian-American woman like Julie Chen

440
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,807
When the choice between changing your appearance

441
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:09,855
Or hobbling your career prospects

442
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:12,415
You're basically damned-if-you-do

443
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,439
Damned if you don't

444
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:24,703
The art of making metal facial prosthetic

445
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:27,263
4 soldiers injured during World War I

446
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:28,543
After this

447
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:38,527
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices were immersed

448
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:41,087
In a cluttered World a man-made sound

449
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:42,367
If

450
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:46,719
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexa

451
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:52,095
Is talking to me and my wife is in another room and a kid is in another room and we're all hearing.

452
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,399
Voice technology talk to us

453
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:56,191
It is a creation of Sonic

454
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:56,959
Trash

455
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:59,519
Mets Joel Beckerman he's a sound designer and composer

456
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:03,103
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

457
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,151
To make them more human

458
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,247
Turn the living room lights on

459
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:10,783
Okay

460
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,575
Dim the living room lights

461
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:13,343
50%

462
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:15,391
Okay

463
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,952
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation

464
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,232
But taking away the fake

465
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,792
Human and adding and some thoughtful sound

466
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:24,608
Makes for a much more natural experience

467
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:26,656
Turn the living room lights on

468
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,240
Dim the living room lights to 50

469
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,008
80%

We're presenting to special episode

471
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:41,248
What's from 99percentinvisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation about how our soundscape is impacting our health

472
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:43,552
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

473
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:46,624
Look for them Fridays May 17th and May 24th

474
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,392
Right here

475
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,672
NPR

476
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:53,024
We need to talk about something

477
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,584
Constipation abdominal pain and bloating

478
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:01,984
You tell yourself it's not that bad you take laxatives modify your diet and exercise routine but thinking about it all the time is free

479
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,616
Frustrating but doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again

480
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,896
And you don't know why

481
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:11,200

Oh my God. Info / podcast

Oh my God

486
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,184
Dot and Bo

487
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:21,952
Flat pocket

488
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,096
So we talked a little bit about how War accelerated the development of medical field

489
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:30,400
Like reconstructive and cosmetic surgery

490
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,192
It also drove the growth of

491
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,216
Aesthetics

492
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,264
A field at the intersection of

493
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,288
Medicine

494
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,824
Art and Design

495
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,664
NPR producer Vivian Lee is back to talk a little bit more about

496
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,432
That feel

497
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:43,968
Lake with reconstruct

498
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:45,760
The surgery the development of

499
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:48,576
Prosthetics really Advanced during World War but

500
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,880
Specifically a branch of medicine called Annabelle

501
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,416
Pathology which deals with

502
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,696
Customized Prosthetics

503
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:56,768
People with missing or malformed parts of the body

504
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:57,536
Especially for the

505
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:00,864
With a really rough time to be a soldier be

506
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,888
Because technology like

507
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,168
The machine gun

508
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:04,960
Had advanced

509
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:07,264
To make killing people and injuring people

510
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,288
So much more of a

511
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,592
Yeah you hit the nail right on the head

512
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,640
And you're given the nature of

513
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:13,664
Trench warfare

514
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:14,944
Soldiers with needs

515
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:16,992
Pop their heads out of these trenches

516
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,528
Sapphire off rounds or two

517
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:19,296
Dance

518
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:22,112
Making their faces vulnerable so

519
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:24,160
It's made facial injuries really common

520
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,696
But it was also this moment

521
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:28,768
History where medical treatment was starting to get a lot better which is

522
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:29,536
Good

523
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,328
But you also had men suffering from

524
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:33,376
Terrible headphones and then surviving

525
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:35,168
So you have a lot of soldiers

526
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,472
They're literally getting shot in the face

527
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,264
But they could now survive

528
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:41,568
Really horrifying in of itself

529
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,592
It also made it hard

530
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:44,640
For soldiers to come home and have

531
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:45,920
Normal life

532
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:46,944
Nudist

533
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,480
Figure meant exactly

534
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:50,272
And reconstructive surgery was

535
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:52,576
Beginning stages so you had things like

536
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:53,600
Skin grafts

537
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:55,648
But there really was nothing

538
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:56,416
Do in terms of

539
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:58,464
Surgery for someone who had

540
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,488
You know their jaw

541
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:00,256
Take it off

542
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,304
Keeping cold with her

543
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:03,328
Used to be

544
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:07,168
So anaplastology picked up in an aesthetic way where we can see

545
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:11,008
And this is a really interesting intersection between

546
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,288
Art in medicine

547
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,384
Rate so you need to be able to recreate a human face

548
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,664
Which takes a lot of artists

549
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,992
Talent and that's where artists like Anna Coleman Ladd came in

550
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:24,832
Should an American sculptor who lived in Boston at the time a lot of her

551
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:27,648
Pre-World War 1 artwork involves making like

552
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,184
The bounding nymph

553
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,256
And happy baby sculptures that you'd find in fountains

554
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:35,584
And she founded something called the studio for portrait masks

555
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,120
In France which made

556
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:37,888
Facial masks

557
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,680
For veterans with severe injuries

558
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,448
To the face

559
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,728
So how did an artist

560
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:42,752
From Boston

561
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,032
Go on to found this

562
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,312
Studio in France

563
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,104
Really locked ignition

564
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:49,152
She moved to France with her husband because

565
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:51,712
Cuz he was a doctor with the American Red Cross

566
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:56,320
And while she was there she right about this other sculptor and London who's making these facial

567
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,600
Pieces for veterans

568
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:59,904
So she got funding from the Red Cross

569
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,184
Do something similar in France

570
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,208
Not so cool

571
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,512
So what type of work goes into making

572
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:06,816
Each mask

573
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,352
Would take about a month now

574
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:10,144
To make ladwood

575
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,728
ACH look off of pictures of veterans before their injuries

576
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:15,008
To try to match his clothes sleep

577
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,312
Possible what they look like originally

578
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:19,616
I'm in the process involves you know taking a

579
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:21,152
A plaster cast of their face

580
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:21,920
Basis

581
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:22,688
And then she

582
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:24,736
Shape the mask itself out of the things she

583
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:27,296
Sheet of galvanized copper and B Skagway

584
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:29,600
You up to half a pound depending on

585
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:31,136
How large the injury was

586
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,416
And they were held

587
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:35,232
Face usually using in a string or wire

588
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,512
Sometimes they would use

589
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,280
Eyeglasses

590
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,304
Keep Monica

591
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,864
They wanted eyeglasses

592
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,144
Copper

593
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:43,424
Amazing

594
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,216
It seems like it takes a lot of

595
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:47,776
Krave interpretation to make the right type of mask

596
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:50,336
Can a metal right yeah that's what made these

597
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:51,872
Specifically so special

598
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,152
She would have to

599
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:53,920
The hand paint

600
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:55,200
Each of the mass directly

601
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:57,760
On their faces to make sure that their skin tones match

602
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:00,064
And matching the skin tone is

603
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:00,832
Especially tricky

604
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:01,856
Because you know

605
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:03,392
When you're outside

606
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,952
Healed your skin will change depending if you're in this

607
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:07,744
The sign or if you're in the shade

608
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,280
So she would basically need

609
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:10,304
To split the difference

610
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,608
Between the two colors to make sure it wasn't

611
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,144
Extreme in either condition

612
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:20,032
And she'd also you know either use real human hair or slivered tinfoil to create the eyebrows

613
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:20,800
Or a mustache

614
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,384
And my favorite detail that you would do is

615
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:25,664
You know it's the mask

616
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,688
Had to cover

617
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:27,456
The mouse

618
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,736
Of the recipients

619
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:29,760
She would leave

620
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:31,552
Modafinil it's just wide enough

621
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:33,088
4 of a cigarette

622
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,928
Guess at that point

623
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:43,584
Smoke up enjoy life

624
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,960
They do anything they really were just cosmetic

625
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,776
Chew food or see again

626
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:54,848
But you know for someone who had already suffered a massive

627
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:57,408
Facial injury that you can really mean a lot

628
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,456
It's such an interesting work

629
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,480
I mean in the pictures

630
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:02,016
Really stunning

631
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,808
It's hard to describe these

632
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,856
Because when you think of a half

633
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:06,624
Pound

634
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,416
Copper mask on someone's face

635
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:11,232
Probably doesn't sound like it's going to be very realistic

636
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:14,304
But there's this video Vlad fitting these masks

637
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,584
Veterans and it's

638
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,144
It's amazing how transformative they are witches

639
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:18,912
I see them in

640
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:22,240

666

Series from Bellow radio TV show the truth

667
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:44,672
The body genius is a dark

668

Comic mystery

You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

675
00:28:57,728 --> 00:29:01,824
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

676
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,152
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like

677
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,176
A dad

678
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:10,528
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

679
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:12,832
Actually if I'm being honest

680
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:14,880
I'm one of the main guy to know how to do that

681
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:15,904
Nothing

A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called immortal

683

Was found dead in my private gym

684
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:29,216
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

685

687
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,592
Now

688
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:36,640
I need to clear my name

689
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:43,040
