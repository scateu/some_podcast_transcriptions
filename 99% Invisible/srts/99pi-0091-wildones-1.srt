This is 99% invisible

29

I'm Roman Mars

30
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:36,000
We have one cardinal rule on 99percentinvisible

31
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,536
No Cardinals

32
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:40,864
Meaning we don't deal with the natural world only the built world

33
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:43,424
So when I read John wellons brilliant book

34
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,776
Call The Wild Ones a sometimes this Mane weirdly reassuring story

35
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:51,104
About looking at people looking at animals in America

36
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,712
I didn't think I'd ever do an episode of 99% invisible about it I just read it for fun

37
00:01:56,224 --> 00:02:01,600
But then I saw John perform stories from the book live with musical accompaniment and I thought

38
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,672
I need to put this on the radio

39
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,720
Phil Collins radio

40
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:11,328
Anyway what you need to know about Wild Ones is that it isn't a book about nature

41
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:14,912
It's a book about how we fit nature into our modern lives

42
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:17,984
Wild Ones is about the QT stuffed animals

43
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,776
BP Go tours

44
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:23,104
In the Byzantine methods of conservation that involved

45
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,432
When our experience with Wildlife goes from something natural

46
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,712
Do something

47
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,480
Design

48
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:32,576
Human-animal interaction has become a designed experience

49
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:36,160
In the story of that transition as the title of book suggest

50
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,208
Is sometimes this may

51
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,488
And also

52
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,280
Weirdly reassuring

53
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,656
John William is friends with the band black prairie and as he was writing the book

54
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:50,496
They can talk to this idea of the band creating a soundtrack to the book

55
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:56,640
And the result was an extended EP called Wild Ones the music in your head

56
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:59,200
When you reflect on certain characters and incidents

57
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,736
That you read in the book

58
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:07,136
The writer and the band then went on a short tour with the song and story Extravaganza that I'm going to play for you today

59
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:10,208
When I saw them perform this live in San Francisco

60
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:14,048
I freaked out it was so good and I costed them in the dressing room

61
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,072
And said

62
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,632
You have to let me share this with my audience

63
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,424
So here it is

64
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:20,704
And here we go

65
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,639
It happens every summer

66
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,687
Small turtles

67
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,015
Call diamondback terrapin skidder out of the water

68
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,063
Around JFK Airport New York

69
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,599
They start moving West

70
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,159
They're heading for a patch of sand

71
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,695
Where they like to lay their eggs

72
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:21,023
NAFTA crossover one of the airport's Runway is to

73
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,559
Runway

74
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,327
4L

75
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:24,863
Sometimes

76
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,423
There's so many turtles on the move at 1

77
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,215
The control tower

78
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,239
Has to delay

79
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:35,615
The Press loves doing stories about how funny this is

80
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:38,431
Fleet a giant airplane

81
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,455
Can be held up

82
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:41,247
I just a few tiny turtle

83
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:46,367
The hold that picture in your mind and think about the Caribbean Sea in 1492

84
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,647
They were almost

85
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:48,671
Billion

86
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,463
Sea turtles living in the back then

87
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,279
Columbus has been anchored in the Caribbean

88
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:59,423
Rude about being kept awake at night by the flagging of so many turtle shells against the sides of their ship

89
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,751
Notice how that scene

90
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,287
Is the exact opposite

91
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,079
Of the scene at JFK

92
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:10,687
It's not a fleet of giant airplanes being held up by a few tiny turtle

93
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,271
It's a giant Fleet of turtles

94
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,575
Bombarding just a few

95
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,367
Relatively tiny ships

96
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:31,935
So I wrote this book about people and wild animals in America and it only really started because

97
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:36,031
I wanted to show my daughter endangered species in the wild before they did

98
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:36,799
Disappeared

99
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:40,127
Like a lot of people I think I felt this Pang

100
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,919
I knew that all around us

101
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,991
Beautiful parts of the world are expiring

102
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,527
And I also knew that

103
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:49,087
People in the future they might not even notice

104
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:54,463
Shut down a world without whales or Wilderness might feel normal

105
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,743
Wanted to counteract

106
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,023
That forgetting

107
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:57,791
That's bound

108
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,839
To take hold over time

109
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,863
This forgetting

110
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:01,887
Has a name

111
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:05,471
Scientist called shifting Baseline syndrome

112
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,751
It means that

113
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,287
All of us except

114
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,591
The version of the world we inherit

115
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,615
Is normal

116
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,151
Over the years we watch

117
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:15,967
Forest get louder animals disappear but

118
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:18,527
When the next Generation comes along fix

119
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,599
That depleted version of nature is there normal

120
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,391
Chart zoom out

121
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,183
Really feel the changes

122
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,463
Better stacking up

123
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,743
Across the generation

124
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,047
I can't even imagine

125
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:33,631
What an ocean filled with a billion sea turtles must feel like

126
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,167
Last winter

127
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,215
I was in Hawaii

128
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,263
And I saw three sea turtles

129
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,567
And I flipped

130
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,615
I felt like I was in

131
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,383
Eden

132
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:09,471
It wasn't so long ago that America was a kind of eating when people could be dwarfed and engulf by wow

133
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:14,847
Wild animals in a way that feels almost impossible now in the late 1800s

134
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:18,431
Trains would sometimes have to stop for four or five hours

135
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:21,503
Extremes of Buffalo moved across the tracks

136
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:27,647
Occasionally I Stampede would batter into the side of a train derailing it

137
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,951
The witness describes one of these scenes

138
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,999
1871 in Kansas

139
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:35,071
Each individual a buffalo without it

140
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:41,727
What the desperation does paraplegic mean green locomotive cars just as blind Madness Chester directed

141
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:48,127
After having dreams thrown off the track twice in one week conductors learn to have a very decided respect for the idiosyncrasies

142
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:54,527
The Buffalo this man's name was William Temple hornaday

143
00:08:54,783 --> 00:09:00,927
He was at bombastic mid Westerner with an elaborate mustache

144
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:07,327
Taxidermist at the Smithsonian and he traveled the globe hunting exotic animals and stuffing them for the museum

145
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:13,727
In India after he took down an elephant climb to top the carcass and popped open a bass ale

146
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:20,127
Once he trapped an orangutan named did little man gave it to Andrew Carnegie as a pet

147
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:24,223
It sounds weird but for hornaday

148
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,759
Killing these animals with

149
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,527
The kind of cons

150
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,295
Motivation

151
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:28,831
He believed

152
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,367
By stuffing them

153
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,159
He was preserving endangered

154
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:32,927
Speciesism

155
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,743
For the future Generations that might not know them out

156
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:36,511
After they were gone

157
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,559
Do taxidermy

158
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,839
You can make them immortal

159
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,399
In 1886

160
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:43,935
Hornaday looks wet

161
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,215
Saw that American

162
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:46,751
So many buffer

163
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:47,775
So rapidly

164
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,567
The Prairie was almost

165
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,359
You figured

166
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,383
They were maybe

167
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,663
Less than 300

168
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,431
Buffalo left in

169
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,479
And so we did

170
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,503
What he thought

171
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,271
Was the motel

172
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,295
Helpful and logic

173
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,855
He lit out for Montana

174
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,391
And several dozen

175
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:10,207
They shot 25 buffalo in Montana and they built the best looking ones into an exhibit at the Museum

176
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:14,559
Gather them around a pic Watering Hole looking for Lauren

177
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:19,679
But from there his thinking of all of you realize he was basically just a funeral director

178
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:25,055
Embalming the species that America was Exterminating it occurred to him

179
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:28,127
What if we actually tried to keep these animals alive

180
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:34,783
And so he became one of America's first real wildlife conservationists and activist the lobbyist ASL

181
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:41,183
Liberty America was killing every conceivable kind of animal in their way and hornaday sit up

182
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:47,583
For all of them from icons like the grizzly to lowly or less Majestic things like the squirrel

183
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:53,983
A live squirrel in a tree is poetry in motion we have Perry American to lend a hand to save

184
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:59,359
Silvertail there was really only one animal on the continent that Hornet it wasn't worried about

185
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:05,503
It would seem to Mighty to be brought down by men with guns and it lived in a cold and brutal wilderness

186
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,807
Batman couldn't possibly take over

187
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:11,903
Polar bear is the king of the Frozen North

188
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,975
It's not very probable that the polar bear

189
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:15,999
Attributes

190
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,023
Terminated

191
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:20,863
That's hornaday writing a 1914

192
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:21,887
Back then

193
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:25,983
No one could have imagined the problem is abstract is climate change

194
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:31,359
But think about how quickly climate changes change the polar bears reputation in our minds

195
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,431
Scan from bloodthirsty mankiller

196
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,735
The delicate drowning victim

197
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:41,599
200 years ago Arctic explorers wrote about polar bears

198
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,135
Leaping into their boat

199
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,671
I'm trying to eat them

200
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,207
Even if they lit the bear on

201
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:46,975
Bonfire

202
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:50,559
I recently when I went to the tiny Northern Town that calls

203
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:53,375
Itself the polar bear capital of the world

204
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,679
Martha Stewart had just arrived

205
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,703
Film The Animals

206
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,751
For her daytime show

207
00:12:59,263 --> 00:12:59,775
The Hallmark show

208
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:14,111
The town is called Churchill Manitoba it's on the edge of Hudson Bay and every fall right before the bay freezes over

209
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:20,511
Silver Churchill gets overrun with about 900 polar bears and 10,000 polar bear tours

210
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:26,911
Bears routinely wander into town they like hanging out at the elementary school

211
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:33,311
Especially

212
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:39,711
Chase the animals back run to the tundra and their trucks bears that won't budge or tranquilizing

213
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:46,111
Shipped out to a quonset hut near the airport once this so-called polar bear gel fills up each animals

214
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:52,511
Drugs again and airlifted one at a time to an area north of town crowds of Taurus

215
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,047
Come out to watch these bare lifts

216
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,583
And I went to one myself

217
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:11,455
There was

218
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,759
Something just a little ceremony

219
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,295
About the bare lifts I went to

220
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:19,391
How the uniformed Wildlife officers arranged

221
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,415
Sleeping Bear

222
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,439
On a net

223
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,975
Epicenter of the crowd

224
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,535
But I checked its paws

225
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:26,815
Carefully across

226
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,583
Chess

227
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:31,167
Like some drunk and Uncle after Thanksgiving dinner

228
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,471
It was so careful

229
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:34,495
Beautiful

230
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,031
Confusing

231
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,079
A couple of people tried

232
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,383
It was like the opposite

233
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,687
Of an animal sacrifice ritual

234
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,223
To save the bear

235
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:47,295
To show how far out of our way we'd go

236
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,319
Not to kill it

237
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,135
I stood there and watched

238
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,159
Geneza did

239
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,207
Martha Stewart's the next

240
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:54,975
Tumi

241
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,815
Her crew is there filming everything

242
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:13,407
Honestly it's a breathtaking thing to watch

243
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:19,807
Polar bear flying away all of a sudden the helicopters started to turn the edge

244
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:26,207
Images of the net lifted the furry shape inside contracted it to you

245
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:29,791
You and then the entire package was off the ground

246
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,607
The helicopter client or the cloudbank

247
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:39,007
The bear twirling slightly underneath it like a tea bag and then finally

248
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:45,407
Polar bear was gone

249
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,751
Yeah I know

250
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,543
Airlifting polar bears

251
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,615
Strange no one could have imagined it would come to this

252
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:21,503
The way we help animals now has evolved into a surreal kind of performance art

253
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:25,855
We carry migrating salamanders across busy highways

254
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,415
We monitored pygmy rabbits with drone

255
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:34,815
Is Cornell a scientist breeding endangered peregrine falcons were specially made receptacle

256
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:41,215
They called the copulation hats Coates the bird named beer-can to ejaculate on their head

257
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,007
Several times a day every day

258
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,031
For much of the

259
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:50,431
This is another Baseline that shifts

260
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,199
Overtime

261
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,247
The links were willing to go

262
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,527
Each generation

263
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,063
Does what would have looked like

264
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,111
Fighting for a purpose

265
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:00,671
Just lost cause to the one before it and then

266
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,695
Generation

267
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:04,767
Comes along a new and does a little bit more than that

268
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:07,327
Nanako's Humanity

269
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,911
Strapping on the proverbial population hat again

270
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,191
And again

271
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,471
And again

272
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,775
Consider the story

273
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:16,799
George

274
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:33,951
In the late 1970s there were only a handful of whooping cranes left in the wild

275
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:37,279
No sew a small number at a government lab in Maryland

276
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:42,911
Scientist there were doing their best to ring as many new Offspring as they could from those Captain for

277
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:51,103
But the lab had one problem child a female crane named text has a newborn text have been

278
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:57,503
Raised in a cardboard box in the zookeeper's living room and having never seen another Train sheet

279
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:03,903
Imprinted on the one animal she did see the Zookeeper basically she wound up sex

280
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:06,975
Attracted to people but not other grains

281
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:13,631
The scientist kept trying to parietex off but text wasn't interested she wanted a man has specifically

282
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:18,495
Amanda looks like her old zookeeper a dark-haired white man the medium build

283
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:25,151
Now there was a young trained conservationist named George Archibald and

284
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:31,551
George happened to be a dark-haired white man of medium build he took text to rule Wisconsin putting mattress

285
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:37,951
Senator pan and moved in has Texas companion Forge together build a nest

286
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:44,351
And they dance George doing deep knee bends and springing up with arms out like wings

287
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:50,751
Kid Wolf Pen holler come on text come on

288
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:57,151
Just like wild cranes do during courtship this would get text aroused and it just the

289
00:18:57,407 --> 00:19:03,551
Right moment to assistance with Richard from a hiding place and artificially inseminate her with green semen

290
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:16,351
George did all this for 3 years living with text for months at a time

291
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:22,751
Time because the eggs she kept playing where infertile the man and crane would start out after Dawn

292
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:29,151
They go for a walk and they dance they dance and they dance send it down

293
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:54,239
George didn't enjoy any of this he was miserable actually miserable

294
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:59,871
But in the spring of 1983 text finally laid an egg that hatched and George was right there when I did

295
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:02,175
He was invited on The Tonight Show.

296
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:02,943
Celebrate

297
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,479
When headline Redman

298
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:06,783
Crane godparents of chick

299
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:13,695
George name the chick she whizzed by now g-wiz as 44 grandchildren and great-grandchildren

300
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:18,047
Today there are more whooping cranes in the wild than there have been

301
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,583
In almost a hundred years

302
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,743
William Temple hornaday

303
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,535
The taxidermist died in 90

304
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,303
1037

305
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,351
At his funeral

306
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,375
Fuglers

307
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,143
The local Boise

308
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,191
Surrounded the coffin

309
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,471
Played Home on the Range

310
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,031
20 years later

311
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:01,823
Estonian words

312
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,615
Killing Hornet is Buffalo a

313
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:04,895
The one he built.

314
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,271
They found a rusty box

315
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,295
Buried

316
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,111
Inside was a letter

317
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,159
It was from Hornady

318
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:17,440
Written

319
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:19,744
At the Museum

320
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:23,584
Dear sir

321
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,120
But I'm just an ass

322
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:28,448
I beg you

323
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,472
Protective specialist

324
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,264
Deterioration of Destruction

325
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:32,800
At last

326
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:33,824
The game butcher

327
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,672
My name is

328
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,000
Please

329
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,752
I write this letter to

330
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:03,520
To you

331
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:09,408
Google

332
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,176
Do

333
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:22,720
I am happy not to be

334
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:39,616
Enjoy their beauty

335
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,016
Trinity

336
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:57,536
I have protected them now to the

337
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:10,336
I have no Stop The Killing

338
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:12,800
Youku

339
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:14,752
You can move faster

340
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:22,688
How to download

341
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:55,200
Of course

342
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:59,040
Hornet is written that pessimistic letter in 1887

343
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,832
When he was still just a young tax

344
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:01,600
Dermis

345
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:02,880
Turns out he

346
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:03,648
What's wrong

347
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,696
The Buffalo we're not all day

348
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,744
And in the years to come

349
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:10,816
He actually played a big role in helping to save them

350
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,096
Lots of other

351
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:17,216
But it was hard for him to focus on those two

352
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:20,800
He lost so many more battles anyone

353
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:23,360
By the end of his life

354
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,128
Bitter

355
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,152
Disillusion

356
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:27,456
I tried

357
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,224
To inject

358
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:29,248
The Croods

359
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,832
Into the hearts of men but today

360
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,368
I think that speaking generally

361
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,952
Civilized man is an unmitigated ass

362
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,256
Like all of us

363
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:43,072
His imagination was hopelessly trapped

364
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,608
And its own moment

365
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,936
It only see the world

366
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,984
The tiny keyhole on

367
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,752
Present

368
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,120
So

369
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,400
Where does that leave us

370
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,216
Maybe

371
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,752
All anyone of us can

372
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:23,520
Can do is

373
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:25,568
Push against the Baseline

374
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,896
We can be a tiny counterweight

375
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,944
We weigh almost nothing

376
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,480
Generation after

377
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:33,248
Regeneration

378
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,064
Sometimes it

379
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,344
In some places the bass

380
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:39,648
The other girl

381
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:42,208
The direction of mortgage

382
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:44,768
But that happens in

383
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:46,048
Incrementally tuvan

384
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:47,072
Can be hard to notice

385
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,120
So

386
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,144
Picture that

387
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,704
Seen at JFK again all those Turtles

388
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:54,496
When hornaday was born

389
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:56,032
They were close to

390
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:56,800
Extinction

391
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:57,824
Being hunted

392
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,616
They tasted so good in soup

393
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:02,432
We're like those Turtles

394
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:09,344
The race of stubborn little things that barely notices is the Wilderness it migrates through filza

395
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,392
Sup with villages and lights

396
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:17,792
And swells into an Airport runway just keep migrating across that anyway talking into

397
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:20,096
Legs of the Next Generation into the sand

398
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:26,496
We're like the airplanes to cuz we have changed we change into something that

399
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:32,896
Hornaday could never have imagined species that can at least try to slow down try to stop

400
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:39,296
I like to think about those airplanes powering down the lines of them partying like a

401
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:45,696
Shiny metallic see so this Tiny Tribe of turtles can pass through I get it

402
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:52,096
It looks funny in the present the Squints into the hazy Panorama of history and

403
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:58,496
Who's airplanes idling in place that little moment of not moving forward

404
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:04,896
Looks unmistakably to me like progress

405
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:40,128

Bongs and Charter of our devices

417
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,088
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

418
