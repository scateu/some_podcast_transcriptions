1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:01,792
This is 99% invisible

2
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:02,816
I'm Roman Mars

3
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:07,936
All over open right now people are wearing Warriors shirts

4
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:10,496
Find their Warriors flags on their cars

5
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:16,896
As much as we like our hometown team here at nine NPI we've been following these NBA finals

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:24,064
When you watch the games and Toronto the whole stadium is filled with people wearing red Raptors jerseys and t-shirts that say we did

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,856
North on them but every now and then

8
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:28,160
Easy little flashes of purple

9
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,208
Those bold fans

10
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:34,048
Wearing one of the most polarizing jerseys in sports history

11
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:40,448
The Jersey Messi did a whole episode about last year in honor of the Toronto Raptors and the beautifully ugly.

12
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:41,728
Jersey they gave the world

13
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:47,872
Booking rerun that episode for you today plus an update from our newest 99 PR team member Chris Berube

14
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:49,920
Who was raised and currently reside

15
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:50,944
Lights in the great North

16
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:52,224
He is very

17
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:52,992
Excited right now

18
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:54,016
Stay with us

19
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:00,672
On a March afternoon in 1996

20
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:04,512
Toronto Raptors a brand new team in the NBA at the time

21
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:06,304
Playing the Chicago Bulls

22
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,864
Jordan fadeaway jumper from the base

23
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,168
The Bulls were the best team in the league

24
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:12,448
And the Raptors

25
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,728
We're pretty terrible

26
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:16,288
36000 fan showed up that day

27
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,336
And the Raptors actually beat the Bulls

28
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:20,896
But it was a mostly meaningless game at the end of

29
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:23,456
Season this is reporter Whitney Jones

30
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:27,040
What's the weather is going to be about this game isn't who won or how the teams play

31
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:28,576
But the way they look

32
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,904
There's the Bulls were just classic NBA

33
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,464
I've had the same logo since 1966

34
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:39,584
They're wearing the red away jerseys that looks basically like every Chicago Bulls jersey ever

35
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,424
It's red with the word bull was written across the front and black and white lettering

36
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,704
It's simple

37
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,472
Classic

38
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:52,128
But then there's the Toronto Raptors the team is wearing their

39
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:58,528
White home uniforms which have Jagged silver and black Pinstripes as if they were cut by slashing

40
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:04,928
Raptor Claws and then across the whole front there's a giant red basketball playing Dinosaur

41
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:08,512
Who himself is wearing sneakers and a uniform a totally different uniform

42
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:10,560
And he dribbling a basketball

43
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,608
And that was just their home uniform

44
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:15,424
The real jerseys that you're even more fun

45
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,960
They were bright purple

46
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:23,872
All this including the Raptors name had been inspired by the Velociraptors in the wildly successful movie duress

47
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:24,640
Jurassic Park

48
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,944
But these jerseys got compared to a different

49
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:33,600
Much friendlier 90s dinosaur

50
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:42,560
That's now known as the Barney design because

51
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:44,352
Their Road uniforms purple

52
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,144
This is Paul Lucas

53
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:50,752
Uniform obsessive and writer of a column in ESPN called uni watch

54
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:53,056
It's it looks so cartoon Nations / 2

55
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,592
You look at it in

56
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,384
Like really that's a professional

57
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,408
Top-level

58
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:01,248
The Raptors jersey may have been particularly garish

59
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:03,552
But it wasn't the only Jersey of its kind

60
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:07,392
The 90s were this insane decade of NBA uniform design

61
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:10,976
Reduce some of the wildest jerseys that have ever graced a basketball court

62
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:14,816
Design the likes of which has never been seen before

63
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,608
And haven't been seen since

64
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,752
Like the Atlanta Hawks red and black Jersey with a fierce-looking hawk swooping in across the entire front of it

65
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:25,056
Holding a basketball and its little Talent

66
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:29,664
What are Milwaukee Bucks green uniform with a giant picture of a purple stag

67
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,968
Call Lucas called this one great

68
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:33,504
Hemingray in the sense that it was

69
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,784
So awful it was great

70
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,136
They had this you know this purple garish purple and green color patterns

71
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,416
Ridiculous butt

72
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:42,976
It definitely all these designs definitely

73
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,792
They push and extended

74
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:49,632
The idea of what a basketball uniform could be or should be

75
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,216
And many of these designs can be traced back to one man

76
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,008
I'm Tom O'Grady

77
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,848
I join the NBA 1990s League's first creative director

78
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,152
Tom group in Chicago

79
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,736
Sketching and rescheduling the logos of his hometown Chicago Blackhawks

80
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,528
Another classic Pro Hockey

81
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:09,856
Comes love for sports and eye-catching art

82
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,392
May this new NBA gig

83
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,160
Dream job

84
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,976
My first day at the NBA was just filled with excitement

85
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:17,280
I meant I'd always been a big sports fan

86
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,559
And I loved

87
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,095
Design and

88
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:26,751
I studied graphic design here Columbia College back in Chicago and so when I walked in the door and Junior 1990

89
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,799
I kind of had a pinch myself cuz I really didn't

90
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,335
Believe it was happening

91
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:36,735
Before Tom O'Grady join the League most NBA jerseys looks something like that classic Bulls jersey

92
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,039
It's simple two or three color schemes

93
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,831
With the team names across the front

94
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:45,183
There might have been strike here or there may be a cool font but that was about it

95
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:48,767
And they weren't designed by designers

96
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:52,351
The process of Designing team uniforms is mostly left up

97
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,631
The team equipment managers

98
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:56,191
Because they were responsible for getting

99
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,471
The players outfit

100
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,495
To play the games

101
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,799
Most of this consisted of the equipment manager

102
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,079
Flipping through a catalog

103
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,383
Choosing a design they like with the right color

104
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:07,455
It was not a sophisticated business let's say that

105
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:09,759
They were happy just to get Uniforms on the players back

106
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,063
But that was all about to change

107
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,599
Because in 1988

108
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,671
Charlotte Hornets introduce a radical new idea

109
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,463
The color teal

110
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,791
In this archival news footage from 1988

111
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:25,631
Hornets player Kelly tripucka stands on stage in front of flashing camera

112
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:30,751
Any rips off his teal tear-away warm-ups to reveal the Hornets new

113
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,943
Teal was not a traditional NBA jersey color

114
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,479
Not NBA red

115
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:44,831
It's not NBA blue it's not Celtics green it's not Lakers yellow

116
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:47,135
Tom O'Grady had nothing to do with a teal Hornets

117
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:50,975
But he took it as a sign that the league was ready for Boulder designs

118
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,279
It was I was at the kind of a leap of faith

119
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:59,679
Fiddly to say you know this is not really something we've seen before it but as an expansion team will probably let you have this one because

120
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,727
Maybe there's something that we can learn from

121
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:06,079
It turned out fans loved the teal Hornets Jersey

122
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,103
It look fresh

123
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:07,871
Indifferent

124
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,175
It was really very popular they

125
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,199
Soon became

126
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,759
Known as the men of teal and all sudden

127
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,575
The Charlotte Hornets have gained great recognition

128
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,111
Before they never played basketball game

129
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:23,743
When Tom O'Grady was hired as the NBA's first creative director two years later in 1990

130
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,559
He wanted to push Jersey design even further

131
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,839
Not just the colors

132
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:28,863
But the designs

133
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,887
On the uniforms

134
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:34,495
Until the early 90s there have been real limits to how Wild you could get with these design

135
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,287
Because all the details

136
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:38,335
The numbers the names and the logos

137
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,615
How to be sewn on

138
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,919
To do any kind of complicated graphics

139
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:44,223
Would have taken a massive amount of embroidery

140
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:47,039
And all that thread would have added additional weight

141
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,575
I made the Jersey hotter to wear

142
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:53,695
But soon after Tom O'Grady join the NBA he would get some new tools to work with

143
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:56,255
Computer programs like Photoshop and illustrator

144
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,303
Helped him dream up new logo design

145
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:01,887
And it was a new technique to get those drawings onto a Jersey

146
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,935
It was called dye sublimation

147
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,727
Sublimation changed every

148
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:09,823
Sublimation is a process of printing dye directly into the fabric

149
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:12,639
Now for the first time you could design something in Photoshop

150
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:15,455
You can make it big and you could add a bunch of different colors

151
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:19,807
Then with sublimation you can basically print that design straight onto the material

152
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,111
Without any embroidery or extra weight

153
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,135
So

154
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,183
It allowed us to start to take things

155
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,463
We would never normally even

156
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,231
Consider doing

157
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:27,999
On

158
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:28,767
A Jersey

159
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,559
And we started doing more

160
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:33,119
Outrageous uniforms and stuff because we could

161
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,655
We can so we will

162
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:37,471
Comes first big design was for the Phoenix Suns

163
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,775
We're celebrating our 25th year in the league

164
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,847
They were moving into a new Arena and they wanted a new look

165
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,919
Soto met with their team owner Jerry Colangelo

166
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:50,015
Jerry is great he was a fellow chicagoan so as soon as he heard my accent he's like

167
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:54,879
I think we're going to get along you know I think us your car guys kind of get this here's what I want to do

168
00:07:55,391 --> 00:08:01,023
I want to have a logo that's going to last for the next 25 years I don't want to have to change it so I want something futuristic

169
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:01,791
The classic

170
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:04,863
So Tom and his team started on the Suns redesign

171
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,679
They come up with this big basketball that's

172
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,703
Also a son

173
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:12,543
Aziz long red to orange gradient sun rays coming off

174
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:17,151
And then they print this and a bright purple background under their New Jersey

175
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,199
It's not exactly what I would call Classic

176
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,223
But it is born

177
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,015
Definitely both

178
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,367
As luck would have it the Phoenix Suns made it to the NBA finals last year

179
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,695
And the whole country got to see that bright purple jersey

180
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,999
With its blazing basketball Sun

181
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,791
All over national TV

182
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:36,095
We got exposure that uniform that

183
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:36,863
Was

184
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:37,887
Priceless

185
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,447
That changed everything

186
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,495
For us we were able to do

187
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:46,847
Things with uniforms that we could not imagine even two years before that

188
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:53,503
Like a teal Detroit Pistons jersey with a flaming horse head logo or a Pinstripes Houston Rockets Jersey featuring

189
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,063
Cartoon rocket with an angry face on it

190
00:08:56,831 --> 00:09:00,415
Over the course of the decade 2/3 of NBA teams got new uniforms

191
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,463
With new logos and new color scheme

192
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:05,023
There was a lot of teal and purple

193
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,607
3D lettering and oversized Graphics were everywhere

194
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,703
We look back on its a while to some of the stuff is pretty outlandish but

195
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:17,311
That's okay cuz that's what was happening at a time the technology let us go wild

196
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:21,407
Atoms boss NBA Commissioner David Stern

197
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:24,223
Gave him the freedom to keep pushing the designs further

198
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:27,807
He said you know if this is what selling any of your telling me this is what's going to

199
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,855
Work at retail

200
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,647
Count Me In

201
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:34,975
Before the 90s the NBA wasn't doing much with merchandise

202
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:41,119
If a fan wanted to buy a jersey they had to pay the full cost of a genuine stitched NBA game Jersey

203
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,423
Which was sometimes over $200

204
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,471
But with all these popular new design

205
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:48,031
Tom and others at the NBA got thinking

206
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,311
Why don't we

207
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,591
You know have a

208
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:54,175
A jersey that we can sell for about 45 to $50

209
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,479
That looks similar to the game Jersey

210
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:59,295
And we saw this business explode

211
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:02,111
Let me know when five years and went from a almost like

212
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,391
Baseline of nothing

213
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:07,487
A multi-million-dollar business largely in New Jersey

214
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,023
We were designing

215
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:13,887
The era of outlandish NBA uniforms Richards Apex in 1995

216
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,935
Wechat Jersey we talked about at the beginning

217
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,471
That one from Toronto

218
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,775
One that some people call the Barney design

219
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:23,359
We were told directly by the team owner at the time John bateau

220
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:26,431
I would like to Happy Meal box of uniform designs

221
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:30,015
We can't look at him pose like what did he mean by that

222
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:36,671
He said I'm not going to wear this uniform forever I don't you know kids don't eat out of Happy Meal box forever but if you going to get the kids

223
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,439
Insecure

224
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,207
Store

225
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,255
You're going to win him over

226
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:44,351
Happy Meal design isn't a term yet I'm making it one right now

227
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:47,423
The goal was to convince hockey loving kids in Toronto

228
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,215
That they should care about this new basketball

229
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,775
And so we created is purple uniform

230
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:57,151
What these Jagged Edge claw Pinstripes that look like a raptor, drip tip

231
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:00,223
And then I slapped a big dinosaur right in the middle of it

232
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,759
And they made it red

233
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:02,783
Because

234
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,063
Canada

235
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,367
You wanted red wraps up to represent Canada

236
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,159
Which made all the sense in the world

237
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:11,999
I don't know how much sense it made but that Jersey its soul

238
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:16,607
I think it was the top-selling expansion team logo we ever did even today

239
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,399
Sales were through the roof

240
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,983
Before they ever played a game

241
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:25,055
Before the team had even signed a single player

242
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,871
The Raptors were seventh in the league in merchandise

243
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,687
What is the nineties came to an end

244
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,711
Change was afoot

245
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:34,783
And stuff with about to get a lot more

246
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,551
Boring

247
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:40,159
By the early 2000 the NBA I become a booming Global in Des

248
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:43,743
And Wealthy business people were suddenly interested in team ownership

249
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:47,839
People like Howard Schultz who turns Starbucks into a multibillion-dollar business

250
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:51,167
In 2001 Schultz by the Seattle SuperSonics

251
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:54,239
And he came into the league with a whole laundry list of changes to make

252
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:57,823
He wanted to replace the hip-hop you'd here in the arena on Game Night

253
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:58,847
Jazz

254
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:01,407
He wanted his team to stick to the fundamentals

255
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,455
Best flashy dunks in showboating

256
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,247
The favored Team Bass

257
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:07,039
Basketball over individual Stars

258
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:11,135
Who's actually really bad for his team because it pissed off their actual Stars

259
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,415
Also Schultz

260
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,207
Hated the sonics 90s love

261
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,511
It had been designed by none other

262
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,535
Bernard Powelton

263
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:21,119
We were able to take this kind of basketball spinning around

264
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,911
Space Needle and kind of have the

265
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,703
Superman font

266
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,263
And then added for Sonics

267
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,079
In there and they change the colors from green and gold

268
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,895
The dark green red and a metallic bronze

269
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,967
Old Howard jazz instead of hip-hop Schultz

270
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,247
Was not a fan

271
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,807
So we hired Seattle design firm

272
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,623
Completely remake the sonics graphic identity

273
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,415
Jerzees warm ups

274
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,183
Logos

275
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:45,951
Everything

276
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:48,511
I was so damn excited

277
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,047
This is Andrew Wicklund

278
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,839
Who is the lead designer on the project

279
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,375
Hated

280
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,143
What

281
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:56,703
Sonic's look like at that time too and

282
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,543
A lot of other teams frankly that have been rebranded in the

283
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,567
90's show

284
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,615
Yeah it was it was

285
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,151
Can the candy store

286
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,199
The direction they were given was clear

287
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:10,783
Immediately go back to the old classic green and gold color scheme

288
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,831
And do something iconic

289
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:13,855
Howard's words

290
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:16,159
Where I want this to be something

291
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:19,487
That nobody would ever want to change I want it to be

292
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:23,839
The Chicago Cubs the New York Yankees the Green Bay Packers

293
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:27,679
Those are solid shapes simple shapes they are

294
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,471
Simple color palettes

295
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,031
Simplification

296
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,055
Is it strength

297
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,895
By the start of the 2001-2002 season

298
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,431
Everything was in place

299
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,711
Green and gold

300
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:41,247
No 3D anything

301
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,783
No giant logos across

302
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,551
The chest

303
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:47,391
Do uniforms look like an update or the ones that started wearing in the late 70

304
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:52,767
But if Howard Schultz was committed to making the sonics and iconic franchise with an iconic look

305
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:55,071
His commitment didn't last very long

306
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,119
In 2006 he sold the team

307
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,911
The new owners move the sonics

308
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,191
To Oklahoma City

309
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:03,263
But shelters aesthetic Vision Ripple throughout the league

310
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:04,799
Throughout the odds

311
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,079
One team after another

312
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,127
Slowly return to the old color scheme

313
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,431
And lost their big graphic

314
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,199
Jerseys

315
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,479
Even the Raptors look

316
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,759
Has completely changed

317
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,831
This year the two main jerseys were red and white

318
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:20,927
And they just say raptors on the front in the symbol font no crazy claw marks

319
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,207
No dinosaurs

320
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:24,767
And it's like I've seen better intramural jerseys

321
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,815
The college here is Tom O'Grady again

322
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,351
They're just there's nothing to them

323
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:30,143
Zero there lifeless

324
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,423
And I don't get it

325
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,983
Say what you will about Tom Brady's jersey

326
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,263
But they were not

327
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,031
Lifeless

328
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,103
Is designed are mostly gone from the NBA now

329
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:41,919
They live on blog posts listicles

330
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:44,735
A people's favorite jerseys from NBA history

331
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,527
Who are their least favorite

332
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:50,623
And their 2015 list of the ugliest basketball jerseys of all time

333
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,903
Sports Illustrated

334
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,671
Quote

335
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:57,279
The Toronto Raptors cartoon dinosaur logo is one of the worst in all of sports

336
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:58,559
Thankfully

337
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,095
It will soon be extinct

338
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:04,191
Baton doesn't mind when people call his designs garish

339
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,727
Or even ugly

340
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,263
He's proud of that Raptor

341
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,031
Jersey

342
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:11,103
It's meant to be provocative it was meant to be kind of eye-catching

343
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:17,759
We could have taken at start out with you know 72-point a vodka that says Toronto and a big number on the back and call it a

344
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:18,527
Add a butt

345
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:21,343
I think that would not have been a memorable Identity or no

346
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,391
A great way to introduce a new team

347
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,415
Athens for Newmarket

348
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:27,231
And if people are still talking about it

349
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,279
Then he did his job right

350
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:33,375
I'm fine with the criticism about people thinking it's the worst thing ever because

351
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,911
It certainly

352
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,191
Certainly says

353
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:39,263
We noticed that we have an opinion about it we have a strong opinion

354
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,847
We remember it and I think that's that's great

355
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:47,967
And the Raptors original plan to hook kids with the Happy Meal of NBA jersey

356
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,247
Love it or hate it

357
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,783
You could argue that it worked

358
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,343
Today Toronto has a loyal fanbase

359
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:57,439
Head over the past five years I've had some of the highest attendance numbers in the league

360
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,511
And as for those bold 90s jerseys

361
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,559
They haven't actually gone extinct

362
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:06,143
Turn out and tire companies that produce Retro Jerseys

363
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,727
And many of the designs, Grady and his team came up with

364
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:11,263
Are really popular

365
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:14,591
And one of the top sellers it's a bright purple jersey

366
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,639
For the jagged claw cut pinstripes

367
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,175
In a red dinosaur

368
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:22,783
Dribbling a basketball

369
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:31,487
The Toronto Raptors have won their way into the NBA finals and that Barney Jersey

370
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,279
Is more desirable than ever

371
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:37,631
Weather report from 99 VI editor and Canadian Chris Berube

372
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,399
After this

373
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,775
So I'm in the studio with Chris Berube

374
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:50,175
He's our resident Canadian of Special Projects editor and a long-suffering Raptors fan who's buried

375
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,711
Decided that the Raptors are in the finals

376
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:57,855
I genuinely can't believe this is happening. I have been a Raptors fan since I was 8 years old

377
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:00,415
And I'm in my early 30s so it has been

378
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:02,719
A great deal of sports-related suffering

379
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:09,119
What accounts for all that suffering to me why has it been so hard to be a fan of the Raptors

380
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,935
In the early days it was really tricky because

381
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:14,751
The team Camp Toronto nobody in Toronto

382
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,287
Cared about basketball over

383
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,055
Air hockey

384
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:21,407
In like the really early days actually played in a baseball stadium because

385
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:25,503
The basketball team wasn't ready yet so they set them up in this baseball stadium

386
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:29,855
And if you had like 15,000 fans like that's a good number of basketball fans

387
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:32,671
Baseball Stadium seats like 45000 people

388
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,743
So they just had these rows of empty seats with

389
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,023
Harps over the hump

390
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,559
When you go to the game it was

391
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,839
Is really hurting

392
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,655
Players just really did want

393
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:44,703
Play in Canada partly because of

394
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:46,239
You know stereotypes about

395
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:50,079
Too cold to know the taxes are high in Beeville Texas

396
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,103
Russell high in places like

397
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,919
California comparative Libra people didn't want to

398
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,455
Music Arabic

399
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,759
Very famously one player two

400
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:00,063
Just refused to come Alonzo Mourning was like traded

401
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:00,831
To the rafters

402
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:01,855
Keith head

403
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:05,695
Yeah you know what I've decided to do that somewhere else

404
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:08,767
Players kept having these like weird

405
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:12,863
Excuses for not being here like there is this guy Antonio Davis who played for the team

406
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:13,887
2

407
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,935
Said he was actually like worried

408
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:19,775
Is kids learning the metric system

409
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:22,847
There is this like

410
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,383
Fatalism to Raptor

411
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:26,687
It's like nobody wants to play here

412
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,455
It's

413
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,991
A place that

414
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,783
You know player is not seen is like a

415
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,807
Desirable location

416
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:32,831
4 player stand up

417
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:33,855
And then

418
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:34,623
You know we had

419
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,671
To wear this uniform in the really early days

420
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:41,279
With the Raptor on it and the bright purple and lots of players didn't like

421
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:43,583
Lots of players were saying like yeah this is

422
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,119
The only profession where like

423
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,655
You hit the very top of

424
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,935
Your field and then you have to

425
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,471
To wear a purple dinosaur

426
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:54,591
Unifour unless your field is being Barney the dinosaur that's the only other one

427
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:59,199
But it sounds like people kind of like that Jersey now right

428
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,735
It's true I think

429
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:04,063
People have really come around on it especially

430
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:05,343
With

431
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,111
Playoffs

432
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:10,463
Happening now so you know I've had all these friends who have been going up to

433
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:15,071
UPS out the door and all the dinosaurs stuff

434
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,143
For the most part is just completely sold out

435
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,679
And I went

436
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,959
To dispense it store actually

437
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:23,775
Fairly close to where I am called in vintage We Trust

438
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,311
It's run by this guy named Josh

439
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,079
Computer

440
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:29,919
Raptors merchandise forever Auntie is Toronto

441
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:30,687
Born and raised

442
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,223
Mission solar

443
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,247
Torontonians

444
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:37,087
We would say torontonians but you would say Toronto

445
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:42,463
Am I missing something what is the difference between

446
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:47,071
Yeah well torontonians if you hit that last t

447
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,607
That shows that you're not from here

448
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,399
People who are from your sake Toronto

449
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,447
OIC

450
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,215
I say

451
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:56,287
So it's the Toronto Raptors now the Toronto Raptors

452
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,847
Yeah if you want to sound credible the next two days you say that

453
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:02,431
So Josh and his partner Chantelle they run

454
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,455
Vintage store

455
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,479
And he says the last

456
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:07,807
She weeks he's been getting requests like every half hour

457
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:12,415
Some version of the purple dinosaur uniform from the early days

458
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,975
He's like everybody he knows

459
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:17,535
The dinosaur is a pretty ridiculous look

460
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:20,095
It almost makes no sense like

461
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,887
The actual logo

462
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,679
Is a

463
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:25,215
Dinosaur

464
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,239
Turn

465
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:28,543
Full dribbling a basketball one way

466
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,591
He's turning around the other way

467
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:33,407
And his toes are coming out of a pair of sneakers

468
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:36,991
Completely absurd and ridiculous

469
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,527
And not only is it like

470
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,831
A logo on hat as a fan

471
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,135
Players are wearing

472
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:45,951
Literally wearing this logo on their Jersey

473
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:48,511
It's insane

474
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,839
So everyone wants to bar New Jersey but also everyone

475
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:56,447
Terminologies that's a little bit silly so why do people like it now

476
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:58,495
Talking to Joshua came away with tooth

477
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,543
So the first is bad

478
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,823
The team is winning

479
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,871
And nobody wants to look like a bandwagon

480
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:05,919
So nobody wants to look like

481
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:09,247
They heard about the rules of basketball in the last two weeks

482
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:10,527
They just

483
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:11,551
Realized

484
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:14,879
This is something very fast with so everybody wants to make it seem like they've been there since

485
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:17,696
Beginning running

486
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,488
Look credible

487
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,816
A really obscure player like just told me he's been getting requests

488
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,864
People like Oliver Miller

489
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:31,264
To I had to look up I had no idea who that was shared about the feet forever so people are spending like all this money

490
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,288
To get these jerseys

491
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,312
Of players no Visa

492
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:35,360
The other thing is

493
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,128
Nostalgia

494
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:41,248
Brightness LG does not have to make sense it doesn't have to be something that is pretty or nice

495
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,320
And this is what Josh says vintage is all about it's about

496
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:46,112
What the logo Evoque

497
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:48,416
For people it's what time it sends you back to

498
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,744
When you look at that Raptors uniform when you look at that

499
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:55,072
A purple on the Jersey that is the diet

500
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:58,656
Reminds me of like Space Jam of like this gyro when there was so much

501
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,424
Billy Bass

502
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,448
Football stuff happening

503
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,264
Send you back to that time

504
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,544
The logo

505
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,312
Who is

506
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,592
Cartoonish and it

507
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,128
Very

508
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,176
Reminiscent of a specific

509
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:10,944
Era

510
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,480
And people love

511
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,248
Reliving

512
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,528
Parts of their lives

513
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,576
Tangible items

514
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,368
Things that they can touch you

515
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,648
Feel that's why

516
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,416
People are

517
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,440
Peeing out

518
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,488
To own it original

519
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:26,816
Because they're investing in their path

520
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,912
So obviously the Raptors are not wearing purple

521
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:35,776
Uniform for the night he's in the finals right now they're wearing their current uniform is

522
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,848
Pretty simple it's pretty clean it's like a white uniform

523
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:39,872
With the black

524
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:41,920
San serif fonts the word Raptors

525
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:42,944
Across the front

526
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,992
And then sometimes they wear

527
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:47,808
A red uniform with a white San serif

528
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:50,880
Raptors across the front and then room in this is where it gets

529
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:51,904
Very exciting

530
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,184
Davis third uniform

531
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,464
Which is black

532
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,488
With a white

533
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,512
San serif Raptors

534
00:22:56,768 --> 00:23:00,864
It gets really exciting mix it up

535
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:05,472
But I have seen this one that's like it says North

536
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,496
Sonic

537
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,032
Describe that one for us

538
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,568
Yeah they call that the

539
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:13,408
City Jersey it's a red jersey it has like a white Chevron

540
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:15,712
So it's like this white arrow pointing up

541
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:22,368
And it says North on it I actually think that one's pretty stylish like I like that one

542
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,904
With all of them it's like
