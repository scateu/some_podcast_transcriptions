This is 99% invisible

19

I'm Roman Mars

20

Metaphorical anecdote coming in three

21
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:18,080
2

22
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:21,664
Years ago we were asked to do resign for a school

23
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,456
A school that will remain anonymous

24
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:25,760
It was further sports bra the new mask

25
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:32,416
That's Christopher Simmons my name is Christopher Simmons I am the principal and creative director of the design firm mine in San Francisco

26
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:36,000
He also teaches Identity Design at the California College of the Arts

27
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:40,352
We've created some alternatives for a few new mascot

28
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,376
Steering committee

29
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:44,448
They had their favor but they were unsure they wanted by in

30
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,496
From the student body and alums

31
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,312
Seem reasonable but also treacherous Terror

32
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:54,688
So they got like six hundred something responses and overwhelmingly by write-in vote

33
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,992
The original logo was the favor

34
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,016
Not surprised

35
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:04,672
Change is often the hardest of all possible options and people would argue well you know

36
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:07,232
But it was a real problem with the old mascot

37
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,512
The problem was

38
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,840
They were using their original logo illegally

39
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:14,656
It was actually University of Notre Dame's

40
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:21,056
Logo and the reason 8th and Gage. The change it was because they would know they realize they did not have the right to do that

41
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:24,384
Of course the constituency of the school all the people who love

42
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,664
The original logo

43
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:29,504
Didn't know anything about that they didn't know the reason

44
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,552
Why there needed to be a new logo

45
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,112
But the public dialogue continued

46
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,136
Santa Portugal

47
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:40,768
It's a Well the reason we don't like the new and you had to pick up the new one why is it a white

48
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,304
Person right where

49
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,072
A diverse

50
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:46,144
School so it should be any more ethnically ambiguous

51
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,936
Why is it a male wear coed

52
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,728
So maybe I could be more androgynous

53
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,800
He's so aggressive I know it's a sports program but you know

54
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:55,104
We are a Catholic school could you

55
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,640
Make it less violent

56
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,432
And so they wanted a

57
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,224
Ethnically ambiguous

58
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,504
Androgynous

59
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,784
Nonviolent

60
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,552
Mascot

61
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,344
And are the Fighting Irish

62
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:10,976
There are factors at play that guy that design of which not everyone

63
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,256
Is aware

64
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:18,656
But that doesn't stop everyone from having an opinion and I like people having opinions about the time I think I'd design awareness is that a no

65
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:19,680
All-time high

66
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:23,520
And this has by Lord help designers of all kinds

67
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,080
People have cottoned on to the idea

68
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:31,456
That their interaction with the built world and they're hidden communication with the people who designed it

69
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,736
Really matters

70
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,784
It's really important

71
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,064
And like I said

72
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,624
This usually works out

73
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:39,904
Pretty well

74
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,952
But sometimes

75
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:42,976
It's a

76
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,256
In Trainwreck

77
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:48,096
This is the biography of a logo

78
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,120
Debrief

79
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,400
And tumultuous life

80
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,936
The new logo

81
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,472
The University of California

82
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,552
So if you're not from California or miss this bit of news the University of California

83
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:08,576
Kinda

84
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:13,696
Or rather had a new logo

85
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:17,791
What is the kind of entirely accurate but completely wonky description

86
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:22,143
Think it's Matt with sarcastic eye rolls from anyone who isn't a designer

87
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,679
But there it is

88
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,471
But they don't have a new logo anymore

89
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,775
Because of a massive public backlash

90
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:31,359
Do UC system actually suspended the new monogram logo

91
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,919
While we were reporting this story

92
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,967
And the creative director of the UC office of

93
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:37,503
The president is not happy

94
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,855
About how it turned out I would say that it was use of the rhetoric of democracy

95
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,391
The tyranny of the minority

96
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:49,791
That's Vanessa Curry I will hear more from her in a minute and the fill you heard before

97
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,839
Having reported about Bonn Germany

98
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,631
And amazing Belgian beer

99
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,935
But now he's back home here in the Golden State

100
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:56,703
California

101
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:01,567
Alright so before we get to why people hated this new logo

102
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,103
We need to tell you what it look like

103
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:07,199
It looks a little like a shield with a mostly flat top and a rounded bottom

104
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:13,087
Superimpose on The Shield is the letter c it was first presented in the

105
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:17,695
Was in Gold these are the historic colors of the University system

106
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:20,255
Stream reversal and almost any color

107
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:26,655
So just to be clear this was the new symbol for the entire UC system as a whole

108
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,959
UC San Diego open campus

109
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:36,383
What are the reasons the public backlash surprise the in-house team color scheme

110
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,663
Associate icons

111
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:42,527
Is that it's all been around for nearly a year it was part of a massive

112
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:47,647
Onward California public marketing campaign to build awareness of the University system as

113
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:50,207
Part of what makes California great

114
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:53,791
In fact that they took it on tour to Alton camp

115
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:58,399
Where they drove around a huge truck with the logo and all the new colors and everything

116
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,423
Around 2

117
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,727
Show it to the faculty and students

118
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:02,751
No one said a word

119
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:08,127
The design team at the UC Office of the President probably thought they done a good job and they were ready to move forward

120
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:13,247
Then in early December these Shield like you see monogram hit the block

121
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,551
And two things happened that set the stage

122
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:18,879
Three burning torch reaction that I got from the pub

123
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,415
Beyond the aesthetic

124
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,207
I do recognize that there

125
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:28,351
Completely valid criticism that can be made about the design itself but this first error on the part of the press

126
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,399
Really doomed it out of the gate

127
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:34,239
There were lots of articles in the media nearly all of them actually

128
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:37,055
That put the classic University seal

129
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:40,639
Side by side with the new UC logo

130
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:44,991
It's so strongly implied I think to the most people in reasonably so

131
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,551
That the seal was the before

132
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,831
And the monogram was yeah

133
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:52,159
That's Christopher Simmons again are you heard from at the very top the show

134
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:58,559
He had nothing to do with this UC logo redesign but he waded Into The Fray with a blog post on his own website

135
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:01,887
Called why the ussuri brand is better than you think

136
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:04,191
And that therefore the Demonic and will be replacing the

137
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:08,031
And of course that wasn't the case it to frame the conversation

138
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:08,799
Completely wrong

139
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,335
The second missed up

140
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:13,151
And this one actually got to me as a UC Berkeley graduate

141
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:19,807
Was that the UC Office of the President released a video online that show the graphical Evolution from the old seal

142
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:22,879
Deal to the new logo which is produced by the University of California

143
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,159
Kind of show

144
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,719
Some of the thinking behind the Genesis of the new

145
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,487
Monogram

146
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,767
And how it related

147
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,559
To the c a Heisman took some of it

148
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:35,423
Excuse women in the video hands pulled design elements from the seal to create the new design

149
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:37,983
I literally sweep aside the old seal

150
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:40,287
Brushing away and tossing it out

151
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,823
The video reinforced

152
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:44,895
Everyone's greatest fear about the new brand

153
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:51,039
From the get-go

154
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:53,855
And change is understandably very hard

155
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,391
NSU University logo

156
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,671
It was really

157
00:07:57,183 --> 00:08:00,255
Standing out all on its own it's really easy to criticise

158
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:04,095
The UC alumni in the California public-at-large saw it

159
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,375
In the reaction

160
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,167
Was Rome really negative

161
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:12,543
Roman that is actually an understatement a lot of people felt that this new logo with two modern

162
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,311
Too cheap

163
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:16,895
I'm really denigrated the gravitas and that was the word that was used

164
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:19,199
The gravitas of the University

165
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,271
In fact lieutenant governor Gavin Newsom

166
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:25,343
The former mayor of San Francisco sent an angry letter

167
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,623
On December 11th

168
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,647
WC president

169
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,671
Quotes

170
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:34,303
The overwhelmingly negative response to the recent change to the University of California logo

171
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,095
Demands immediate attention

172
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,375
Yunnan

173
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:41,215
Perhaps now it is time to return to the use of the old logo

174
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:46,079
It allow the university community a cooling-off period to concentrate on the long-term health

175
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:46,847
The universe

176
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:50,687
Instead of being creative with the University of California logo

177
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,991
We should be searching for Creative Solutions

178
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,295
For funding the University of California

179
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:58,879
He's wrong because the logo there is no logo to restore

180
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:02,719
There was no old logo and again it's a classic case of the misinformation

181
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,255
Reaching the very very top

182
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:07,839
That's Vanessa Correa the creative director of the UC Office of the President

183
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:11,935
Vanessa led the team that came up with this logo in the new visual brand

184
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:17,823
She says that a lot of the negative reaction was because the media imply that the classic CEO was being replaced

185
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,871
But there were no such plans

186
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:23,455
Paseo which UC has reassured everyone will stay on diploma

187
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,991
Is more of a classic

188
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,015
Collegiate icon

189
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,063
It's circular with the words

190
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,623
Seal of the University of California around the edge

191
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,415
An image of an open book

192
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,463
In the motto let there be light

193
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,231
At the bottom

194
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:40,607
An earlier version of a sealed dates back to when the University was founded in the 19th century

195
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,887
In its current form

196
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,679
That seal has been unchanged

197
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,959
Since 1910

198
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,775
So UC Berkeley my alma mater

199
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:50,335
Has the UCC law on its official communication

200
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,871
It's what's on my diploma

201
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:53,919
It was on my aunt's my grandparents

202
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:54,687
And yes

203
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:58,015
And it's earlier form it was on my great-grandparents diplomas

204
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:01,343
I'm the fourth generation in line of UC Berkeley graduates

205
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:10,047
Like the cows crip logo that's on the UC Berkeley football helmet and every tenth person sweatshirt in downtown Berkeley

206
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:12,607
Or the Sea Bear Claw logo that's on a baseball cap

207
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:15,423
SoCal UCLA and lots of other universe

208
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,959
Please have this distinctiveness

209
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:19,007
Between a more official seal

210
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,543
Animal casual logo

211
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,567
What do you see

212
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,591
System as a whole

213
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,359
Did not

214
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,383
Bastille

215
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,943
For all the good things that it does represent

216
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:30,015
Can't carry all of that symbolic

217
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,063
Wait

218
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:32,831
Why not

219
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,879
Because it's already

220
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,951
Interacting in a sort of rhetorical space

221
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,231
That is

222
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,511
Much more

223
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:42,815
It's institutional

224
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,351
Too stuffy

225
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:49,471
You can say that if you want but how you feel about it like a zit

226
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,031
Is Santa

227
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,079
Because when we need to have the weight

228
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,615
Weight and gravitas

229
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,383
City University

230
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,919
Behind a budget book

231
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,943
Or behind

232
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:03,039
Proclamation by the president or whatever that is that still gives us that gravity

233
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:06,367
But we don't always want that gravitas tok gravitas

234
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,391
It has a place

235
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,415
In communication

236
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,183
It's like

237
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,207
Having a tick

238
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:12,511
Tuxedo and be forced to wear it every single day

239
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:17,119
In other words with a team of designers at UC intended to do

240
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:23,519
Was to create an icon that could be used as part of a broader campaign to more dynamically and more casual

241
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:26,335
Explain the university system to people

242
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:32,991
Kree explained that the logo would never stand on its own as it was depicted in media reports would almost always be presented with the words

243
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,527
University of California next to it

244
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:36,575
Or the motto let there be light

245
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:40,671
He would have all these other visual cues that would help you see sell itself

246
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,207
You talked about

247
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:45,279
You know expressing dynamism and light and you start to think

248
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:49,375
Do you feel like that the that the logo should be able to

249
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,935
Stand on its own I mean I think that

250
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,215
Again for me

251
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:59,615
I feel like when I look at this and you say well you know what is part of a larger thing there's text that goes with it there's other contextual information that would help me to

252
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,639
Understand what it is

253
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,175
Because when I just see it

254
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,711
This does not scream

255
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,247
Scream to me you see

256
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,015
Like I don't

257
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,319
What time today it doesn't but it will

258
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,343
Okay

259
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,903
So you know you need the ecosystem

260
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,927
To build the meaning in

261
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:13,695
Into the object

262
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,999
You need people to begin to identify it with

263
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,279
The good works of the University

264
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,559
For them to you build them

265
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,607
A logo on itself is nothing

266
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:21,887
It's a thing

267
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,935
You know you a logo doesn't come

268
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,983
Fully formed with the meaning baked in

269
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,007
The meaning is

270
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,031
Accrued overtime

271
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,055
The Nike Swoosh

272
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,591
Looks like a giant check mark

273
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,615
I mean if

274
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:34,943
People had social media inside into a date today

275
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:35,967
Only one

276
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,247
Why is it so plain

277
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,527
By the looks like a check

278
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:42,623
You know what that supposed to be a wing I don't get it I don't see it

279
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,927
The meaning has accrued

280
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,719
Through years of

281
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,999
Quality products

282
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,535
Thorne on quality products

283
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,095
An athlete's associating with it and

284
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,119
And the interaction

285
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,143
Can you have with the brand

286
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:54,911
Writ large

287
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:57,471
The same thing for Apple can you imagine I mean

288
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:58,495
It's an apple

289
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:02,079
The computer company while you have an apple is this a grocery store I don't understand you know it's

290
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,895
It's the same kind of thing the meeting is not baked in

291
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,663
You build mean

292
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,431
That's what the

293
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,199
Brand is

294
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,503
People's emotional resonance

295
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,039
With something develops over

296
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,087
The only reason why

297
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,623
So many other using moms

298
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:17,439
Have such a strong bond with the seal

299
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,719
Just because

300
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:20,511
It's been around for over a century

301
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,815
And that bond is further strengthened

302
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:25,631
Buy every other seal in the world

303
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,655
Really

304
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,447
Not all that distinct

305
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:33,567
Feels now kind of naturally communicate a history and tradition and indeed

306
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,895
Vanessa says she gets all that

307
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:39,967
And while she herself may have attended another UC

308
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,991
That would be the universe

309
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,015
Cincinnati

310
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,295
She thinks that

311
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:49,183
Part of why there's been so much negative attention for the logo is because it's become a lightning rod for other issues

312
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,463
I think that

313
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,023
There are other things going on here

314
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,047
And the outcry

315
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:55,839
Part of what's going on

316
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,887
Become a very simple

317
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:58,655
Way

318
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,423
2

319
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,471
Express a lot of other fresh

320
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,031
I mean I receive that

321
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:04,799
I'm a lot of different

322
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:08,127
They are frustrated because they feel like the mystery

323
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,151
Inaccessible

324
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:09,919
Frustrated

325
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:10,943
Is there tuition score

326
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,479
They're frustrated for all these things

327
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,783
They're frustrated about the privatization of University

328
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,063
Rightly so

329
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,343
I'm frustrated too

330
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:20,159
That's part of the reason why I'm sitting here trying to get people

331
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,183
Bolt actually care about it

332
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,719
Because I want them to go and vote for it

333
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:27,071
Describe the purpose of the logo and the uphill climb and had head of it

334
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:30,911
How do you spell to talk about the actual graphic design that a lot of people both

335
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,959
The lay public in several designers

336
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,239
Had huge

337
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,007
Problems with

338
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,335
One common complaint was the back of the sea part of the design

339
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,895
Wasn't totally solid it was a gradient

340
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,199
The bottom part of the sea was lighter than

341
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:48,063
And while the intention was to convey movement to luminosity

342
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:51,135
That's not what a lot of people saw in it

343
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,951
The first time I saw the logo I immediately thought of

344
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,743
Computer icon of something loading

345
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:58,815
I spent a lot of time in front of my computer maybe you do too

346
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:05,471
This sea looks exactly like a circle indicating a loading browser tab or Skype opening or any other

347
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,519
Number of loading scenarios on a computer

348
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,311
Vanessa told me this was

349
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,079
Pure coincidence

350
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,383
Expressed a little bit of regret over

351
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:15,455
This particular color combination

352
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,223
Is

353
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,503
One that really

354
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,527
Pops out that

355
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,295
Lodebar

356
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:21,855
Reference

357
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,903
In a way that is again I mean

358
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:30,815
Nuc website where the identity was introduced you could actually see other versions of the logo with differ

359
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:31,583
True colors

360
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:37,983
They were black and white and blue and white versions The monogram that didn't have a great-aunt at all I personally prefer those but I don't

361
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,007
I think those were very widely

362
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:44,383
Vanessa also told me that what's gotten drowned out in all the noise a journalist like me wanting to talk to

363
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,687
Is the fact that people in the design world

364
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:47,711
Do you like it

365
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:51,039
There was an op-ed written in the San Francisco Chronicle by Rob Duncan

366
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,319
Formerly pentagram

367
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:54,111
He's now an art director at Apple

368
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,671
He also runs his own Design shop in San Francisco

369
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,975
He called the new UC logo quote

370
00:15:59,231 --> 00:15:59,999
One of the freshest

371
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:03,327
Sandra's Creative Education identity schemes in a country

372
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,607
Full of boring

373
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,887
Institutional logos

374
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:13,311
But the much more common and widely publicized response was very

375
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,079
Very nice

376
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:17,919
An online petition called stop the new UC logo

377
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:20,223
Received over 54000 signatures

378
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:22,015
Earlier

379
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:27,135
On December 14th a few days into the extremely vociferous public reaction to the logo

380
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:30,975
Puc director of marketing Communications release a statement

381
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:32,767
Saying that the new UC monogram

382
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:41,215
In the past week it has become clear that the University of California system wide monogram recently created

383
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,007
Is a source for great debate

384
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,543
Dialogue and Division

385
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:45,823
Insured

386
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,639
It's too much of a distraction from our broader effort

387
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:51,199
Communicate uses value in vital contribution

388
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:51,967
California

389
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:55,039
Intent to suspend use of the demonic

390
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:57,855
You will begin to take steps required to do so

391
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:02,463
I certainly had an initial negative reaction to the monogram when I first saw it too

392
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:05,279
I still think the gradient is just not quite right

393
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:07,839
But overall after talking to Vanessa

394
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,887
Even a skeptic like me is

395
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:12,959
A little bit more convinced of its usefulness and of its quality

396
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,495
You don't have to

397
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,263
Like

398
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,543
Designed to recognize that

399
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,335
It's good design I don't like Led Zeppelin

400
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,127
Sing about it I don't

401
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:24,735
I have no opinion on Led Zeppelin one way then understand

402
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,271
What they've done and wiped

403
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:30,111
People think they're good and why they are good and where they fit into rock and roll history

404
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,671
It's fine not to like it

405
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,975
Do you need understand what it's trying to do

406
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:35,743
And

407
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,535
And go from there

408
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,351
You know I would say I hate the IDM logo but doesn't matter

409
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,375
Doesn't matter

410
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:43,423
It does what it needs to do and

411
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,727
So from that perspective I would say you know I would

412
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:49,567
I would hope that people think about design and in the way that one should be thinking

413
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,591
How to sign rather than a

414
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,639
Purely subjective

415
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:53,919
Response to one thing

416
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:54,687
Badly

417
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,223
Post it on the internet plot

418
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,271
Is enough to the basement

419
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:03,903
I talked to my 91 year old grandfather about the new UC logo to

420
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:06,463
He graduated from Cal in the 1940s

421
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:08,255
And he said he didn't like it either

422
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:10,303
For many of the same reasons that we talked about earlier

423
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,607
It wasn't clear what it was supposed to represent

424
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,631
Leprosy

425
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,423
And you see look weird

426
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,983
And when I explained what Vanessa had told me

427
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,519
He chewed on that for a while

428
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,823
But ultimately I think came away on convince

429
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:27,199
Taqueria and mini designers have spoken out in support of her and her team's efforts

430
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:29,247
They continued to say that their work was bold

431
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:32,063
Daring and does represent modern California

432
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,855
Paragon is Christopher Sim

433
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:36,159
I think the role of

434
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:37,695
An expert

435
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:40,255
An expert to me is to someone who is

436
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,535
Trained in

437
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,303
Particular

438
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,583
Field and has

439
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,119
Some perhaps

440
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,911
Hopefully deep experience

441
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:47,679
Skin the practice

442
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,471
Is

443
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,031
To see the world through a different

444
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:52,799
Flatso

445
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:53,823
For example

446
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,103
When

447
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:55,871
We had our

448
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:56,639
Kitchen renovator

449
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,687
I don't know anything about

450
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:01,247
Architectural nothing about engineering I don't know anything

451
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:02,783
Not really about

452
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:03,551
Interior design

453
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,575
I have my opinions

454
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:06,879
And so

455
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:09,439
When a designer tells me why I think this

456
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,463
Would work best

457
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,743
I defer to that app

458
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,791
When a mechanic tells me that

459
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:14,559
The thing is

460
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,327
My car

461
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,351
I trust

462
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,375
That pure she is

463
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:18,911
That when I go to my doctor

464
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,191
They're telling me

465
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,471
How to understand my own body

466
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:22,495
And

467
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:25,055
I don't know how to interpret what's happening to my body so

468
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:25,823
Allow them to do that

469
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:29,407
When it comes to design

470
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:32,223
We don't seem culturally to have that same

471
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:32,991
Trust

472
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,015
And so

473
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,063
Perhaps saying that people are

474
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,367
Are ignorant of design or

475
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:40,159
Not knowledgeable to process

476
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,695
Or short-sighted

477
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:42,719
What is contentious

478
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:45,535
It's probably strictly speaking true

479
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:49,631
But it's not always wise to say the true thing in exactly the way

480
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:53,727
We live in a time when everyone feels that their opinion matters

481
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,007
And the reality is

482
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,287
Does that not all opinions

483
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,079
That's not popular

484
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,871
Because you like to think that your voice is

485
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:02,687
The same as someone else's but when it comes to for example

486
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:03,967
Physics

487
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:06,271
My voice is not the same as Stephen Hawk

488
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,551
Nor should it be

489
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,343
Aesthetic

490
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,391
Is a very easy

491
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,159
Target

492
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:14,719
Because everyone no one understands how Aesthetics works

493
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,743
And they feel that

494
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:16,767
Subjective opinion is

495
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:17,535
The role of the day

496
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,327
I don't like it therefore it must not

497
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,119
So I guess that

498
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:24,703
No one wants to be told how to do their job by rank amateurs

499
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,495
You don't understand what they're trying to do

500
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:31,103
I don't go to restaurants and tell chefs that their Pizza could use more basil in the tomato sauce

501
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:34,175
What's the difference between designers like Vanessa

502
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,711
And the physics world

503
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,247
Is that we the public

504
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:41,599
Are not invited to sit in Stephen Hawking's physics Lab in Cambridge

505
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:43,391
We're not part of that world

506
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,159
.

507
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:50,047
But design in general and this design in particular is about communication and interaction with a public

508
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:54,399
Who are completely unaware of the motivations behind a certain design

509
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:57,215
The logo isn't meant to sit in someone's SketchBook

510
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:59,007
It's meant to be out there in the world

511
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:01,823
Telling the story of the University of California

512
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,103
And right or wrong

513
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:05,407
The people connected to the university

514
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,711
Still feel like they have a say in the matter

515
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:12,831
It's hard to say what the ultimate effect of this whole Fiasco will be

516
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:16,416
I think institutions like University of California which tend to be

517
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:19,232
What are you change averse anyway

518
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:23,584
Will be more gun-shy about pushing new designs and new ideas for work

519
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,376
There will be a chilling effect

520
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,912
If that comes to pass

521
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,704
That will be a real shame

522
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:31,520
I hope the people who really dislike the logo at least

523
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,872
Would also not want to see that happen

524
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,664
I also don't want

525
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:42,784
Designers to circle the wagons and claimed that no design can be criticized and less

526
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,344
The person with an opinion knows the fullback

527
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,880
Story of the design process

528
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:47,904
That just

529
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,440
Seems false

530
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:51,488
And incongruous with reality

531
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,840
I didn't see people making the same defense of the new Gap logo with the little

532
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:58,400
Please square that appeared briefly in 2010

533
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,936
It was divided by

534
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:00,960
Everyone

535
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:01,728
Everywhere

536
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,872
Even Christopher Simmons who has very thoughtfully considered and spoken out against the overreaction to the UC logo

537
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,920
Took some swings at the Gap logo backpack

538
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,456
Someone made some meow

539
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,992
Jerky website where you can

540
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,784
Turn anything into the Gap logo

541
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,576
Besides have generic

542
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:19,136
My Facebook

543
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,160
Profiling

544
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:21,952
My name

545
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:22,720
Squaring the top

546
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:25,536
Panda in retrospect

547
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,840
That was probably mean and

548
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:30,400
Laughing take it back

549
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,424
I what

550
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,360
I think it speaks well of his character that Christopher regrets

551
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:40,640
But I don't know if he's

552
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:41,920
He cared

553
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:42,688
Any comment

554
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:43,456
Fundamental

555
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:45,504
Because of these things matter to him

556
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:48,320
On one level is great that the public is

557
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,088
Engaged

558
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:49,856

00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,904

Every time it happens it's

561
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,488
Typical UC logo

That we don't see people galvanized around you know a great new identity that

567
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:06,240
It's very easy

Signals attitude

575
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:17,760
But it's important to people that sing

576
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:18,784
Culture that it's in

577
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:19,808

578
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:20,832
