27
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:34,208
The laugh track was ubiquitous on television sitcoms

28
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:37,280
But nearly 2000 it began to disappear

29
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:38,560
What happened

30
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:42,400
How do we get from the rock is canned laughter of The Beverly Hillbillies

31
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:44,192
To be silent slide

32
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:46,496
Joke every 20 seconds of 30 Rock

33
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:53,152
The Curious story of the laugh track starts with one man who created the laugh track as a homemade piece of technology that took over the

34
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,432
The sound of television

35
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,200
And then

36
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:58,784
A lot of fashion with the rise of a more modern sense of humor

37
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:05,440
What happened to the laugh track is just one of a cultural Mysteries that are being explored on slates new monthly podcast

Eight-years-old

44
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,312
You come home from school

45
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:27,712
Turn on the TV and watch the Pink Panther show it was 1982 and Paul was watching the show

46
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:30,272
Syndication on WGN Chicago

47
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,368
Some channels are versions of the last track and some are Persians without

48
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,672
I always watch the ones that had the laughter

49
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:37,696
Because it was

50
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:39,488
I guess it's a child of this community

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,536
I said all these people watching with me and

52
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,816
They sound like adults

53
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:43,584
You don't sound like you

54
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:53,312
He left the show so much that you would tape it but he didn't have a VCR

55
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:56,384
Who would use a tape recorder when the only captured the sound

56
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,688
Even though the Pink Panther show has very little dialogue

57
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,480
What you been listening to

58
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,272
That's mostly what the pink panther sounds like

59
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,648
What I was doing was allowing myself to hear the last rather watch the show

60
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,672
Visually

61
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,720
Like watching shows with your eyes closed

62
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,256
Yeah basically start

63
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,048
Who are these people

64
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:14,816
Laughing

65
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,864
Why are they laughing the same Waters

66
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:22,240
Pause early encounters with a pink panther Foster a lifelong interest in last track

67
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:26,336
Paul lives in LA and works as an account manager at an insurance company

68
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,640
These are passionate last track hobbyist

69
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,944
Paul taught himself everything about laugh track

70
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,968
How they're made

71
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:35,296
Who made them the difference between them even how to make them for himself

72
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,576
The Monkees is a great

73
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,880
Show the think of cuz they killed the laugh track halfway

74
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:39,904

75
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,696
One of my goals in life

76
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,232
History of the laugh track

77
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,256
And not just light up

78
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,792
Try to add it as it was

79
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,608
Using those same laughs

80
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,192
It's really a very strange obsession because there so few people use

81
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,984
Until it too but I love Rico

82
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,520
I love Iceland

83
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:56,544
These clips

84
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,592
Putting them on anything

85
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:03,200
What are the shows that Paul Tinker around with is the ABC sitcom Modern Family

86
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,480
It doesn't have a laugh

87
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:05,504
Sepulveda

88
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:08,064
I just never did not like me before

89
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:11,136
Thomas Davis gym teacher

90
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:16,512
She's a teaching what doctor Seuss's to Medicine I think she don't like you

91
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,839
Modern Family premiered in 2009

92
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:24,191
But even had arrived just five years earlier it would have sounded something like that

93
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,799
From the 1950s to the early 2000s sitcoms had laugh track

94
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:29,567
.

95
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:36,223
And then when last tax free shows like Arrested Development and the American version of the office made it to network TV they mostly just

96
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,783
Most it come today don't have one

97
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,319
Except for a few big heads

98
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,879
Like The Big Bang Theory and reboots like Roseanne

99
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:46,463
We talked about last night's now it's mostly to make jokes about them

100
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,767
Phone towers going up and every show have a laugh track

101
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,559
People didn't talk about them very much

102
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,327
They're kind of a c

103
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,143
Secret so few people knew about it were disgusted

104
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,447
Everybody hears that everybody is aware

105
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,239
Why won't anybody talk about it

106
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,263
Today

107
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:05,663
We're going to talk about it

108
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:11,551
Growing up I never thought much about the laugh track one way or another they were just always there

109
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,415
Does a TV critic iWatch laugh tracks become contentious and deeply uncool

110
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:19,999
It's always fascinated me that something we barely notice for so long

111
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,535
Technically maybe even kind of like

112
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:24,095
Become so annoying to so many people so quickly

113
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,631
What changed

114
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,423
Why do they exist in the first place

115
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:31,263
Do we just realize they were really lame and if so what took you so long

116
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:39,455
Translate magazine this is decoder in a show about cracking cultural Mysteries

117
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:44,575
I'm play TV critic Willa paskin and every month I'll take a cultural object idea or habit

118
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,623
And try to figure out where it comes from

119
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,415
What it means and why it matters

120
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:49,695
Today

121
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,231
What happened to the laugh track

122
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,663
Imagine it's the 1950s you've just gotten your very first television set

123
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,271
A waste of time and it's a size of Euro with wood paneling and a couple of tiles on the side

124
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,367
You set it up in the living room and you call him the whole family and you turn it on

125
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,927
Too late now

126
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,719
The ladies and gentlemen

127
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:23,743
I must

128
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,535
The Jack Benny Program

129
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,327
Original hit radio show

130
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:31,679
Is there Easter Bunny a one-time Vaudeville performer and comedian as a version of himself

131
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,447
Radio

132
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:36,543
And now that show from the radio it's on your television

133
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:39,359
Even though you've heard it before you've never seen anything like it

134
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:43,967
Before when you watch a performance it was in public with an audience

135
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:45,759
And now it's happening in your house

136
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,295
Think about how strange

137
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,319
I knew that

138
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:49,855
And then listen

139
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:50,879
You hear it

140
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,671
Something recognizable

141
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,695
Something reassuring

142
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,487
Tells you what you're watching

143
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:01,887
It was my sponsor who didn't have the nerve

144
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:08,031
That's almost early TV comedies recorded in front of a live audience often times and studios in New York

145
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:14,687
By the early 50s as a TV industry moved away from New York and into Hollywood

146
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:20,063
Executives wanted to move away from the traditional approach of broadcasting what amounted to live stage shows

147
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,111
They wanted to shoot comedies on film

148
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,647
Comedies that weren't live

149
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,927
The still sounded like

150
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,743
The solution to this problem

151
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:31,327
And the person who came up with the solution Charles Douglas

152
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,351
Charlie

153
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:39,519
Douglas was a mechanical engineer would work on radar for the Navy in World War II

154
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:42,079
We knew his way around audio and electronic

155
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,663
In 1950 the Hank McEwen show

156
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,967
I mostly forgotten series from NBC

157
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,503
Have used a rudimentary last

158
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:54,111
Dubai 1953 Douglas I developed a better way to insert a laugh into a show

159
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,159
You've ever watched an old

160
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,951
The time is almost certainly heard his work

161
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:00,255
Now we lift up the dryers

162
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:02,303
And see how their hair turned out

163
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:11,775
I asked Ron Simon curator of television and radio

164
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,543
Paley Center

165
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:15,359
Formerly the Museum of Television radio what he knew

166
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,639
Charlie Douglas

167
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:19,967
Took the concept of just adding laughter probably from a

168
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,247
Transcription desk

169
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,807
Create a machine that could do it

170
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,087
Any creative

171
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,111
Little box

172
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,415
Using laughter from

173
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,719
Marcel Marceau

174
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,255
From the silence

175
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,303
And critiquing

176
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,095
That could then

177
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,911
Be injected into film,

178
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,447
Make it alive

179
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:41,727
Experience

180
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:45,823
Douglas and Port over these last and his kitchen table night after night

181
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:51,967
You splice them into analog tape realistic can be played on a patented device Douglas had built himself out of household appliances

182
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:52,735
Oregon Park

183
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:53,503
Vacuum

184
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:57,087
The devices at 3 ft tall the shape of a filing cabinet

185
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,647
Very heavy at slots for 32 rails

186
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,671
Wichita Old Town last

187
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:04,255
It was officially named the audience response duplicator

188
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,047
The became known as the last

189
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,071
And that's life

190
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,887
Spell the goofy 50 style Laff

191
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:14,751
Weird machine that's closer to hefei steampunk that it is

192
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:15,519
2

193
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,799
Modern electronic

194
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:17,567
Technology

195
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:20,383
Like an adding machine where you just press the

196
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,151
Style

197
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,687
And laughter would happen

198
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:25,759
Eventually would evolve into more of a

199
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,551
Typewriter thing where you

200
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,575
Punchkees

201
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,367
Glassbox could chuckle

202
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,695
I could laugh with side release

203
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:40,095
It even had a real controlled by the foot pedal that was just hitters

204
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,887
Tiny little one person last

205
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:48,287
It's most sophisticated the Box head

206
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,567
320 last

207
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:52,383
Play One Life at a time by pressing one key

208
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,711
Pressing multiple Keys together to play a bunch of laughs at 1

209
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:59,807
Sofifa something was remotely funny Tara let's have this guy laugh right here

210
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,367
Any just have that going

211
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,671
Maybe he come back and watch it

212
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:07,231
So you know what that could that wasn't Place funnies or as

213
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:11,071
Is the producers going to want it so maybe he would add a second sound like this

214
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:17,215
And then he would add it all together and mix it together so you hear the full product

215
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:22,335
Three separate Clips overlap

216
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:26,431
What what happened was the producer or the director would come back and see his work

217
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:33,087
And so you know what that could use a much louder laugh can you give it a louder to fall and issei are at Short Hills

218
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:35,391
So you throw supplements just like that

219
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:38,463
Because why foxes were patented and Handmade by Douglas

220
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:41,023
Does anyone can make or use one

221
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,583
There are only a handful of working models at a time

222
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,631
And he basically had a monopoly on the process

223
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:56,383
By the 1960s almost all sitcoms were single-camera shows filmed without an audience and tricked out with a rockstar

224
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,151
Charlie Douglas laugh

225
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:00,735
The boxes apply lacquer for tens of thousands of episode

226
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,503
Set the television

227
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:02,783
Tens of thousands

228
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,807
Even more

229
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:07,647
Everything from The Munsters Bewitched The Beverly Hillbillies Gilligan's Island

230
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,439
Mary Tyler Moore in cheers

231
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:11,487
For decades or sound with ubiquitous

232
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,535
But that wasn't want to talk about his device

233
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,583
Douglas whenever he went to a show

234
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,631
Wood covered over end

235
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:20,447
No one would actually see him at work

236
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:22,751
There is something you know embarrassing

237
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,287
It was certainly part of his

238
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,175
You know not want to talk about it really actually talk about

239
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,223
You know how the last sausage

240
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:32,991
Actually me

241
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:36,063
Douglas Harvey ever gave interviews or spoke about his work

242
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:40,415
1966 piece from TV Guide titled the Hollywood stinks and his last box

243
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,463
What's the Sphinx is Douglas

244
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:45,023
Describe the mystery surrounding the man and his device

245
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,303
The author wrote

246
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,839
It's a laugh box should

247
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:48,607
Start acting

248
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:51,679
Strangely the last boys we lit into the men's room

249
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:52,959
Locking the door behind them

250
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:53,727
So no one can

251
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:58,335
I mentioned the name Charlie Douglas and it's like Cosa Nostra

252
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,615
Everybody starts with

253
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,431
The most taboo Topic in

254
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,455
Baby

255
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:15,231
I want to see hear that every knock on the last track that you've ever heard

256
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:20,095
That it's fake and it's corny that it's cheating that it's not funny that it thinks audiences are dumb

257
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,887
People been saying since the beginning

258
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:24,191
And that's part of the reason for Douglas's silence

259
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,751
But listening to Douglas's wife

260
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:30,079
Kiran Paul try to recreate them it changed my thought about them

261
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:33,407
I've always prided myself on being open-minded about the last

262
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,967
Funny show with a funny show with or without one

263
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:39,807
Even so I always thought of them as automated mechanical

264
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,599
Not at all

265
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:42,623
They're crap

266
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:45,951
Charlie Douglas played his laugh box like it was an instrument

267
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:46,719
Literally

268
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:50,303
But why people think it was just a bunch of laughs thrown into a tape machine summer

269
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,071
Pushing the button

270
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,607
It was an art

271
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,167
He took it very seriously

272
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,703
Cheers on the Charlie's laugh

273
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,007
It was used in the late 60s and 70s

274
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,543
Including in the pilot for math

275
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,479
You hear the laughter telling off at the end

276
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,247
I love that

277
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,551
It tells a story in a single laugh

278
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,599
There's a joke but one guy in the audience

279
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,879
He doesn't get it right away

280
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:17,951
He does Split Second late and then he last a little bit longer

281
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,487
Hear it listen to it again

282
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,167
Charlie Douglas wasn't at the sound engineer

283
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,959
He was a psychologist

284
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:36,383
Dropping the last track is that it's fake laughter from a fake audience

285
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,919
But that's not quite right

286
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:40,479
Doesn't represent a bogus body

287
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,527
It represents an audience of one

288
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,551
Charlie Douglas

289
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:47,647
He definitely Goose laugh a producer's instructions

290
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:51,231
Large extent he and the people who work for him follow their guts

291
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:57,631
It's incredible that one man's taste and sense of humor or so important and pasting an entire type of Television comedy

292
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:02,751
But it's true

293
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:12,223
So how did the last active in Era of TV come to an end

294
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:15,039
How did the laugh track go from being a tittering companion

295
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,623
I think we need to think about the laugh track

296
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,415
Not just a habit or an object

297
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,439
But an idea

298
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,975
An idea about why we laugh

299
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,815
I'm going to get you another idea about laughter later on but this first one

300
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:29,119
I think it makes the last track of the 50s and

301
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,143
Take these make a lot more

302
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,959
Here I want you to listen to something

303
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:35,007
How many people wants that was really funny

304
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,087
That menacing sequences from the okeh laughing

305
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,391
Okay okay eh

306
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:54,719
Is the name of the record label that released it in 1922

307
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,535
It was recorded a few years earlier in Germany

308
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:01,375
As the sound of a cornet being interrupted by a hysterically laughing woman

309
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:03,935
Was joined by hysterically Laughing Man

310
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,703
That's it

311
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:06,495
It goes on for 2 and 1/2 minutes

312
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:09,055
2 1/2 creepy creepy minutes

313
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,151
Play 1922

314
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,431
People thought it was hilarious

315
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,503
The okeh laughing record was a huge novelty hit

316
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:20,063
There's speculation that sold over a million copies

317
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:23,391
It's bonded in tyermanii genre of novelty laughing record

318
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:27,231
Blastrac it's a version of the okeh laughing record

319
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,767
Trying to make you laugh

320
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,815
Just by listening to other people laugh

321
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,607
What's funny must be the laughter

322
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,887
Because it's not the joke

323
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,167
There is no joke

324
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:39,007
But this particular approach to humor it's not that popular right now

325
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,079
Define someone to defend it I had to talk to one of Paul's friends

326
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,103
10 Glen

327
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,895
He's an art historian by training

328
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:47,199
But he's also a devoted laugh track enthusiast

329
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:49,759
Kampala in the same Charlie Douglas Facebook

330
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,999
It just wouldn't be funny

331
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:04,095
And it was

332
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:04,863
Scratch

333
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:13,055
Yes yes parley

334
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,151
It's not funny

335
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:18,687
Right

336
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,271
That's funny

337
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,551
I found this

338
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:28,671
What does a tree falling in the forest make a sound send Cohen a sitcom laughter a genuinely perplexing

339
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:31,487
Is a pie in the face funny if no one laughs

340
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:34,303
Is an episode of Friends funny

341
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,863
That's what I wondered after coming across this video

342
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:40,703
Posted on YouTube a friends without a laugh track

343
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:42,751
Where is the waitress I'm starving

344
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,359
Buffet man

345
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,455
Here's what I went all my money back

346
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:54,527
You can hear what the rhythm of the show was supposed to be

347
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,575
How the pacing depends upon their being laughed

348
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,391
Without it friend sounds weird and unnatural

349
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:04,767
If there's no audience laughter it suddenly starts how hot it is that the characters are trying to make each other laugh

350
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,559
Friends need to slap

351
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,607
To be funny even if some of them are fake

352
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,655
Has anyone seen Richie

353
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,959
She's upstairs not doing the dishes

354
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:15,007
I'll tell you something you don't I'm not doing them this time

355
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:28,063
The transition away from the Laff trakk started slowly

356
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:31,647
In the seventies with Norman Lear sitcoms like All in the Family

357
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:34,975
Comedy started to be taped in front of a live studio audience again

358
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:38,559
The audience is last would be smoothed out edited or boosted

359
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:42,911
This is a process called sweetening which Douglas had done a lot of and still happens all the time

360
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:45,983
But already it was of the last sound borealis

361
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:53,407
In the eighties and nineties some shows like The Wonder Years the Larry Sanders show and the days and nights of Molly Dodd

362
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,967
Started to experiment with dropping the laugh track

363
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:57,503
The TV's biggest hits

364
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:00,063
Shows like Jerry Seinfeld and friends still had them

365
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:05,183
By the late 90s with the rise of cable and on Laff tracks animated series like The Simpsons

366
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:08,511
Even the network started contemplating making different kinds of comedies

367
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:13,119
Setting up a collision between the old idea about comedy and the typical way of doing things

368
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,655
And a new idea about comedy

369
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,447
A new way of shooting a TV show

370
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,495
Cotton a collision

371
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,287
Aaron Sorkin Sports night

372
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:23,615
You're watching sports night on CSC so come on back

373
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,383
We're out

374
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:27,967
1997 Sports

375
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,247
His first TV show

376
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,015
ATC

377
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,295
It was a comedy

378
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:34,111
Behind the scenes of an ESPN style Sportsnet

379
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,159
Sorkin and the director

380
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,183
Tommy schlamme

381
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,975
Wanted to shoot it like a single-camera

382
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:41,535
If I had four walls the camera moves

383
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:43,839
And they wanted to shoot it without a laugh track

384
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,119
ABC

385
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:45,887
Not so much

386
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,679
They wanted to do something different

387
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,703
But not that differ

388
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:49,983
Here's Mommy

389
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:53,823
The economics of television and certainly half-hour television

390
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,103
Was so massive

391
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,127
4

392
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:58,175
Shows that I've had traditional

393
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:58,943
Laugh tracks

394
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:03,039
If they were really very nervous about giving that up

395
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:08,415
What did you feel like the last recommend about your show

396
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,207
Base town of a

397
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:12,255
Situational comedy is the laugh track

398
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:15,071
I think we're familiar with it I think it sort of

399
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,863
Resonates in a certain way

400
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:22,495
But I think it is kind of establishing a conceptual idea about a show

401
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:29,151
That is saying it's not real this is a theatrical presentation I'm there with this group of people were all laughing it's fine

402
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:35,295
That was not the idea of the way I think Aaron wrote or what I think Sports night was about

403
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:37,599
Here's a clip of the laugh track from the sports night

404
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:43,743
Yeah but the point I'm making is but I can't who is this I'm Jeremy Goodwin

405
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:50,143
Are you here for the associate producer job or I could really feel

406
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,191
Filled with the laugh track was holding the show back

407
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,983
Sportsnet is fast

408
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:56,543
He doesn't want to pause to wait for the audience's laugh

409
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:01,151
The last have to be shoehorned into the rear brakes and Circumstance dialogue

410
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:03,199
Play sound even Faker than usual

411
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:05,503
Dispatches from a whole other Sensibility

412
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:10,111
Will you be here starting to happen with sports night is the last track changing from background noise

413
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,391
Impediment

414
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:14,463
It's actually keeping Sports night from being is funny and fast

415
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,743
Swimming is good

416
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:16,511
@the could be

417
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,815
After its first few episodes

418
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:21,887
Sports night stop being taped in front of an audience at all

419
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,679
And the laughter got even fainter

420
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:26,239
Here's a clip from an episode at the end of season 1

421
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:27,519
Yes

422
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,823
Hello

423
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,847
You're breaking up

424
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:35,455
That you're not there. There's nobody there at all yet I'm still talking

425
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:36,991
All right

426
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:40,831
First second season ABC let the show dropped a laugh track entirely

427
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:43,903
What was canceled at the end of that season anyway in mm

428
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,951
Just ever so slightly ahead of its time

429
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:51,071
The last track free British version of The Office premiere in 2001

430
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,119
In 2003

431
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,423
Arrested Development started airing on Fox

432
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:57,215
In 2005

433
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:02,335
American adaptation of the office started airing on NBC the first huge hit without a laugh track

434
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:03,871
That same here

435
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:05,919
Everybody Loves Raymond won the Emmy for best

436
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,711
Comedy that's the last time I said

437
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:08,991
Sitcom with a laugh track has done

438
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,783
The end of the last track

439
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:15,903
So what changed

440
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:22,560
I want to talk about another Siri about laughter that's different from the pie-in-the-face theory I mentioned earlier

441
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:26,912
Isn't a fundamentally social activity

442
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:29,216
Because everyone else is doing it

443
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:35,360
Something deeply wonderfully individual and idiosyncratic reaction to the quality of the joke itself

444
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:38,432
Representing is a TV writer Andy secunda

445
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:43,040
Any songwriter on the current ABC sitcom The Goldbergs which doesn't have a laugh track

446
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:46,880
What is fresh out the 2004 UPN sitcom love incorporated

447
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:48,928
About modern-day matchmakers did

448
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:51,232
But that's not fair I have a dream too

449
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,000
What's your dream

450
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,792
Top ten thousand more dollars

451
00:21:54,304 --> 00:22:00,448
I'm talking about $10,000 to help improve The Human Condition

452
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,984
Condition very much

453
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:08,384
Before working on love incorporated Andy has been a writer for Conan and a teacher and performer at The Improv Comedy Powerhouse up

454
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,408
Upright Citizens Brigade

455
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,968
Alternative comedy snob

456
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:14,272
And coming out of the New York scene

457
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,808
Already was

458
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,880
Show with a laugh track

459
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,928
Other than Seinfeld

460
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:21,696
Is

461
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:22,464
You know

462
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,488
Passe

463
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,024
A dinosaur

464
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,352
But it didn't have the clout to keep love incorporated from having a laugh track

465
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,912
The show is performed in front of a studio audience

466
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,192
And hatsune real life

467
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:34,496
Dennis sound editor came in to sweeten it

468
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,544
Boosting and manipulating all of them

469
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,592
Is a relapse replaced by Alaska

470
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,920
But anyone use that last track in the typical way

471
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:43,456
So I guess my take was

472
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,224
Well

473
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,528
Since we're doing this anyway

474
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,832
Why don't we just decide what

475
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:53,184
Give me I was with like if we'll it's going to be

476
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,720
This creation

477
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,768
This false thing

478
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,328
Why go half way just make the whole thing of

479
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:04,192
Train the audience that's watching at home

480
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:10,592
How much attention anyway in my head in other words anyone the last track to reflect what was really funny

481
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:12,384
He understood how the laugh track is

482
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,152
Supposed to work

483
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:16,224
It is supposed to make people laugh at what other people are laughing at

484
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,552
What do you want to retrofit it to account for the secondary of laughter

485
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,344
Tell audiences hey

486
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,160
Some jokes are funnier than others and you should laugh at those

487
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,744
In 68 his boss wouldn't have it

488
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,280
But even so you can see

489
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:33,632
He may be skeptical of the laughter of the crowd but he believes in the objective quality of

490
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:36,448
The joke you may be able to get a big laugh

491
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,752
Ativan audience and B

492
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,544
Not that great a comic

493
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,360
I mean a lot of comics with argue well if you get a let get the laugh

494
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,920
Then you are a great time at

495
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:48,992
Cuz I'm a snob

496
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:51,808
Any may be a snob but his perspective has become White

497
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,368
This is how a lot of people think about comedy Now

498
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,392
Me included

499
00:23:55,904 --> 00:24:00,512
Some jokes are better than others and you can't tell simply based on what got the biggest laugh

500
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:02,560
Especially when that last comes from Alaska

501
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:09,728
For decades TV was ruled by the idea that laughter is socially contingent

502
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:14,848
Debackers idiosyncratic and individual

503
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,640
This is a big transition

504
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:20,224
For some viewers the last act into stop encouraging laughter

505
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,248
Started inhibiting

506
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,040
The last track

507
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:23,808
Broke

508
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:30,464
Play shows of artifacts have been almost entirely cut out of the crib.

509
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,232
Conversation

510
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:33,536
Do they still have their modern-day Defenders and uses

511
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:36,608
Especially in the revivals of beloved shows that have laugh tracks

512
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:37,376
Like Will & Grace

513
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:45,568
Netflix's 2017 reboot of Norman lear's one day at a time a show about a divorced cuban-american better

514
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:46,848
Urine with PTSD

515
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:50,432
Raising her son and teenage daughter while living with her mother is great

516
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:53,760
It's smart it's Charming it's clear and it has a laugh track 2

517
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:54,784
She has to

518
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,064
To have a quinceanera

519
00:24:56,576 --> 00:25:00,160
How else would we know the day that our little girl becomes a woman

520
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,440
You missed it

521
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:05,280
Well I was in gym and ironically happened at first.

522
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:09,888
So I'm just

523
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,936
Podcast for doing about the last rocket

524
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,496
I'm wanting to talk to you guys

525
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:20,896
Because you do a great job as laugh track

526
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:25,504
That's Gloria Calderon kellett in microwave

527
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,296
The showrunners of one day at a time

528
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:30,112
There right there shows filmed in front of a live audience

529
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:31,136
I was the

530
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:34,720
Mike and Gloria say they're sound editor cuts down on the Oz

531
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:38,560
And the more excessive whoops Rita Moreno and even trims down to laugh

532
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:40,608
But they say there's no sweetening in their show

533
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,400
I said it was a laugh track

534
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:43,168
Like

535
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,704
Why does that bother you so much

536
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,496
Some people just don't like

537
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:48,288
To hear other people laughing cuz

538
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:50,336
It feels like they're being told what to do

539
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:52,384
But part of that comes from

540
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:56,480
I think feeling like the laughter is somehow fakely adidon

541
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:59,552
Mike is right that is how some people feel about the laugh track

542
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:01,344
That is a false advertisement

543
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,624
Trying to sell you a bad joke

544
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,648
As I was a good one

545
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,696
And sometimes that is what the laughter

546
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,024
So I asked why it was worth risking that kind of reaction

547
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:11,328
Police about a shared experience

548
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:17,984
So I feel like it's an opportunity to experience a play in the comfort of your home but you're experiencing it as

549
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:20,800
You are a part of a community

550
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:23,872
We want them to experience the emotions audibly

551
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:25,408
You know like it's there

552
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:29,760
There is something about that that's the crying too by the way

553
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:33,344
For Gloria and Mike last night as a reminder that other people are there

554
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,904
Watching with you even when you're all alone

555
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:38,464
Just like it has been from the very beginning

556
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:51,264
I want to go back to that scene from earlier when you turn on the TV for the first time and saw the Jack Benny Program and it was so new

557
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,032
Strange

558
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:56,384
When you heard the audience laughing it was a cue that you should laugh to

559
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,688
Yeah but also it was a sign

560
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,992
Sign that you weren't watching alone

561
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:06,112
Blackhawk was trying to bridge the bazaar new distance between the audience and the performers

562
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,416
Between the audience and other members of the audience

563
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:12,256
The thing you have to remember and this is so different than now

564
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:15,584
Did the lack of trying to overcome a defective television

565
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:19,424
Which of the unlike Vaudeville in the movies you watched it all by yourself

566
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:24,288
Now that the fact that you don't have to go anywhere or interact with anyone while you watch it

567
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:27,360
That's one of TV's biggest selling points

568
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:31,456
Unlock Rocket help us to get to that point

569
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:35,808
For a long time the laugh track seemed permanent but it was really more like training wheels

570
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:39,392
Something that taught us this new scale of watching and laughing in solitude

571
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:43,232
Mother stuck around way too long but it did its job really well

572
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:49,632
The late 90s and early aughts

573
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:52,448
When the numbers of shows on cable start to Skyrocket

574
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,240
The TV audience began to fragment

575
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:57,824
We were totally ready to move from one theory of laughter to another

576
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:02,176
To embrace the idea of ourselves as individuals with idiosyncratic comedic taste

577
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:06,016
Who did not need or even want the Laff tracks lame chortled approval

578
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:06,784
To know it was

579
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:12,416
These days it's the last track that seems weird and vestigial a sound from another time

580
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:18,048
Unless we're specifically after the theatrical communal throwback experience of a show like one day at a time

581
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:20,096
Black is always been a tool

582
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:23,424
I'm nearly 70 years after it was invented there's nothing to fix

583
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:27,264
Watching TV alone isn't the weird activity watching together is

584
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:30,848
A multi-camera comedies with laugh tracks of faded out

585
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,944
Single-camera comedies without last I've only gotten more and more adventurous

586
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:37,504
Bingohall upheaval in what constitutes a

587
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,784
The comedy.

588
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:42,368
Most well-regarded comedies

589
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:45,696
Like Atlanta and girls and transparent are more funny a JC

590
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:46,976
Laugh out loud funny

591
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:49,280
Thereafter that big big laugh

592
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:52,096
Making people laugh is really really hard

593
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:55,424
One shortcut from decades ago was the fake that laughter

594
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,264
It's not to worry about whether audiences are laughing at all

595
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:01,056
My littlest

596
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:02,592
Probably be my IBS

597
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,200
I medium baggage should be that I truly don't love my grandmother

598
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,480
You don't love her at all

599
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:11,552
Start with your biggest baggage Bay

600
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:12,832
Converging

601
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,392
How do you say

602
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:20,512
You know they're not laughing

603
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:23,328
Audiences are finding makeshift ways to watch community

604
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,912
You're looking for the present-day technological equivalent of the laugh track

605
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:27,936
Look at social media

606
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,216
Sitting on your couch

607
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:32,800
Reading Twitter while you watch Atlanta or a football game or The Bachelor

608
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:35,616
Those tweets are signal about what's good and what's interesting

609
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:37,920
Sometimes they're just the shows best joke

610
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:38,944
Books tweeted verbatim

611
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:40,992
Often those people make you laugh

612
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,016
Spell definitely

613
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,296
I'm feeling like you're watching

614
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:48,928
Learning history of the laugh track

615
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:53,280
Thinking about it as a way to foster a feeling of togetherness it really made me wonder

616
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:58,144
Solo binging with headphones on or the person in the very same room as you watch as something else

617
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,960
Really better than gathering around one of three channels

618
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,008
Politely putting up with canned laughter

619
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,592
And one of these experiences that you definitely get to decide what's funny fears

620
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,896
But you really are doing it all alone

621
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:14,272
I think this is part of what drives laugh track aficionados

622
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:19,904
Tinkers with laugh tracks and add them back into old episodes of The Pink Panther or the Monkees

623
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,208
Recapturing the spirit of a different time

624
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:24,000
A different way of watching television

625
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:26,816
Icompanion

626
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,888
I asked how his favorite Charlie Douglas last was

627
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:30,912
He had one of course

628
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:32,704
He got right to the heart of it

629
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,752
It was basically a deep man's laugh

630
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:35,776
That was used

631
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:38,336
Sparingly and then it started to get used more regular

632
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:39,872
Sounds like this

633
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:50,368
Let me hear that with my sister would say there's your friend

634
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:52,672
Even listening to decoder ring

635
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:54,208
Hosted by Willa paskin

636
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,512
Decoder ring is a brand-new podcast

637
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:57,280
Translate

638
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:59,840
It was produced and edited by Benjamin fresh

You don't like it

642
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:16,992
One of the shows in radiotopia is The West Wing weekly and the co-host that show with Joshua Malina who starred in the show

643
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:19,552
Fortnite one of my favorite television shows of all time

644
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:24,928
And excited as the Tipping Point moment of the laugh track so I asked him what it was like to act in TV show

645
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:28,768
I was slowly turning down the laugh track over the course of the series

646
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:30,048
Wechat conversation

647
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,072
After this

648
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,424
Between the beats

649
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,728
Bongs and chatter of our devices

650
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:41,312
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man made sound

651
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:42,336
If

652
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:48,736
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife isn't

653
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:53,600
Technology

654
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,368
He talked to us

655
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:56,672
It is a creation of Sonic trash

656
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:59,744
That's Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

657
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,328
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

658
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:05,120
To make them more human

659
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:09,216
Turn the living room lights on

660
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,008
Okay

661
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,568
Dim the living room lights to 50%

662
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:15,616
Okay

663
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:21,760
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

664
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:24,064
Makes for a much more natural

665
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:24,832
Experience

666
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,624
Turn the living room lights on

667
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:29,952
Dim the living room lights

668
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:30,976
50%

669
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:38,400
We're presenting to special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

670
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:41,216
About how are soundscape is impacting our health

671
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:43,776
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

672
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:46,592
Look for them Fridays May 17th and May 24th

673
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:47,360
Right here

674
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:53,248
We need to talk about something

675
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:59,648
Constipation abdominal pain and bloating yourself it's not that bad you take laxatives

676
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:00,416
Routine

677
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:02,464
But thinking about it all the time is frustrating

678
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:08,864
It doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again and you don't know why

679
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:15,264
Then it may be time to seek out go to oh my God. Info podcast we can learn more

680
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:19,616
More about your symptoms but oh my God. Info / podcast

681
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:20,384
Oh my God

682
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:22,176
Black podcast

683
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:28,832
Joshua Malina is the co-host of radiotopia is The West Wing weekly podcast

684
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:30,112
With risque Sherway

685
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:34,976
Joshua is also an actor on the side he recently wrapped up a 7-year run on Scandal

686
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:36,768
He was also on The West Wing

687
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:42,656
Because big break in television has Jeremy Goodwin on another Aaron's working creation Sports night

688
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:47,520
It was a strange and beautiful half hour comedy with strong dramatic elements in

689
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:51,872
The rapid-fire dialogue that people would Embrace more fully on The West Wing

690
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:54,176
But as was mentioned in the documentary you just heard

691
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:57,760
Sports night marked the beginning of the end for the laugh track

692
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:01,344
I asked Joshua if he was aware of that Dynamic at the time

693
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,416
It was always my understanding that Erin

694
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:06,464
Objected strenuously

695
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,792
To the inclusion of a laugh track on Sports night

696
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:13,120
And for that matter to the inclusion of a live audience

697
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:17,728
In the studio as we filmed what was essentially

698
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:18,752
Single-camera

699
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:21,568
Comedy so it was kind of being forced

700
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,104
Into

701
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,128
A hybrid

702
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,920
Of which iron did not approve

703
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:30,272
And did you feel the tension of it be neither fish nor fowl when you are

704
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:31,296
Acting in it

705
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:35,904
Yes I think as a performer and that somebody coming from a theater background

706
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,208
And perhaps somebody is a little bit

707
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:42,560
Oven 1/8 ham it's hard to ignore

708
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:45,120
The presence of 90 people

709
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,912
In a room where your

710
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:51,264
Making a show hopefully for millions of people to watch at home and there is

711
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,592
Something different between a performance

712
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:55,872
Four camera

713
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:58,176
And a live performance

714
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:59,456
And so

715
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:04,064
While be priority ought to be be home viewing audience

716
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,160
I found it difficult not to play to the people who are in the room with me

717
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:10,976
Flight very happy with my performance in the pilot

718
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:12,512
It's large

719
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:16,096
It's possible one can detect

720
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,376
My playing

721
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:24,032
To be live audience and perhaps I should have toned it down a little bit

722
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:30,432
Sophisticated and I sense that you are

723
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:31,712
At least 20 minutes

724
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,624
As the

725
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,160
Laugh track itself

726
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,208
Was slowly muted

727
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:43,488
I think

728
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:47,584
Maybe my performance got a little bit smaller little more finally realized

729
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:52,448
So I think I need to go back up a little bit understand so there is a live audience

730
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:56,544
For the first season or what was the setup actually

731
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:58,848
There was a live audience

732
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:01,152
For I think as long as there was a laugh track

733
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:07,552
Tommy schlamme and Aaron Sorkin finally outwitted ABC simply by dialing it down a bit

734
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:10,368
Episode-by-episode until it was gone

735
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:11,648
So they never

736
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,184
They never

737
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:18,560
One of the explicit argument about a laugh track ABC never said fine get rid of the laugh track

738
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:24,960
They just got rid of it so slippery you know it's that thing I guess where you boil a frog

739
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:29,568
It was a you know de facto they have gotten rid of these laugh track by the time

740
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:35,200
ABC you seem to notice up my memory is that that was somewhere around episode 7 or 8

741
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,224
End

742
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,552
Having disposed of the laugh track we dispose of a live audience

743
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:45,696
It was already a weird situation to have the audience there when we were moving around trying to make our

744
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:47,232
Single-camera comedy

745
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:50,304
And so there really was no

746
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:54,144
Existential point to the live audience once the laugh track was

747
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:55,168
Removed

748
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:56,704
It was one of those

749
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:01,056
We're instances why I think that a lot of us who grew up on television the laptop

750
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:02,592
Heart of sitcoms

751
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:05,152
And this was a very different sitcom

752
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:07,968
Did you feel the sense of this tension

753
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,808
As an audience member as well as up as a person crafting this

754
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:13,088
Yes

755
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:14,624
I'm not a big fan of laugh tracks

756
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,648
All together

757
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:22,048
The Golden Age of TV if the shows in black and white and feels like a theater piece anyway like The Honeymooners looks like

758
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:23,840
Like they're putting on a play

759
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,120
It kind of works

760
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,936
And has heard of an old-school resonance for me

761
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:29,728
Certainly for what we were doing

762
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:30,752
Wait

763
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:33,824
Was creating a piece that included

764
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,384
Elements of comedy in drama

765
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,152
It just

766
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:37,920
Felt

767
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:39,968
Felt

768
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,784
Weird as we're making it when I watched it

769
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,320
The that that

770
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:45,856
You know sweetens

771
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:48,672
Super artificial

772
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:49,952
Laugh track

773
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:52,256
I think there's not

774
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:53,792
Elevate The Shadow

775
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:59,680
And so over the course of the first season while the laptop was being

776
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:00,704
Bow Down

777
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,984
Surreptitiously

778
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,264
Did you

779
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:05,568
Intuitively know to change your

780
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:08,640
Performance slightly was that communicated to you in some way

781
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:11,456
I don't think it was made explicit I think

782
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:18,880
I just settled into the natural rhythm of acting for the camera I think the best piece of advice I got as a young actors

783
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:20,416
Learning how to act on film

784
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:21,440
Was

785
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:24,512
I always remembered that the camera can read your mind

786
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:25,792
And

787
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:30,400
That's a very different piece of advice from you to make sure your performance reaches

788
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:36,800
That person in the last row of the balcony and said they're just there are baked in

789
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:38,336
Inherent differences

790
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:44,224
Between a live performance in the performance for Cameron sowinski audience was actually gone I think I just settled into

791
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,272
Okay we're making it TV show

792
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:48,576
You know did that

793
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:50,112
Cameras going to get in

794
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,136
Really close

795
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,672
When it needs to

796
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:53,952
And

797
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,000
Startled let go of the idea of

798
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:56,768
Trying to

799
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:57,792
Project

800
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:58,560
Anyting

801
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:01,376
So what do you think of sports night being this

802
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:03,168
Pivotal moment in

803
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,192
Laugh track history

804
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:07,008
The situation with the laugh track

805
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:10,592
And ABC versus Aaron and Tommy

806
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,616
Reflected

807
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:15,456
Very significant

808
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:19,296
Misunderstanding on the networks

809
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,064
Part

810
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,600
Of what the show was

811
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:23,904
End

812
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:26,208
So I think it's just one

813
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,768
Offshoot of they're not quite knowing

814
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:31,840
What they had or what to do with sports night

815
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:36,448
And I think we're we're very used to sing single-camera comedies and we're used to seeing

816
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,984
Television shows that

817
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:44,640
When might have difficulty classifying as a comedy or drama I don't know why this is such a

818
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:50,272
20 years ago now we're a little bit more sophisticated

819
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:52,832
As an audience and we understand

820
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:58,208
That much like Life TV shows can have moments of drama and moments of Comedy

821
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:59,232
But I think

822
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:03,328
At the time abc didn't quite know how to handle

823
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:05,888
What Erin and Tommy were giving them

824
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,424
And Randy

825
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,960
Dia de la track

826
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,776
Was reflection of that

827
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:13,056
Tension

828
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:15,872
Like a lot of things though the first guy to the wall

829
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:17,152
Gets the bloodiest

830
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:18,432
Right and then

831
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:21,504
We've all benefited from that fight because

832
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,784
Have West Wing in

833
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,064
30 rocking

834
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,112
All these things that I think you could

835
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:27,392
Point of this moment

836
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:28,160
And go

837
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:29,184
The

838
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,232
Pyrrhic victory of sports night

839
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:32,768
Made it so that

840
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:34,560
All this other great TV happen

841
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:35,328
As well

842
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,608
Do you understand

843
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:42,752
I think it's for science is complete to class like I loved it so much I appreciate that this

844
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:45,312
Strange little object

845
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,080
It

846
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:47,872
Fought a battle that really changed

847
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:54,272
A lot of Television that we admire today feels like a platitude to say that anything was before

848
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:55,040
FaceTime work

849
00:40:55,296 --> 00:41:00,416
That's why we didn't do better because we were before our time but I think it's actually an app

850
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:02,720
Phrase here and I do think

851
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:06,048
Aaron Sorkin and Tommy schlamme in terms of

852
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:09,120
The material that Iran is writing in the way that Tommy was

853
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:10,144
Filming it

854
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,728
I think they were truly a little bit ahead of the Curve

855
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:17,056
And did ultimately take a little more time for

856
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:19,872
Audiences to come around for this type of material

857
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:21,408
But I agree with you that we did

858
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:22,944
45 episodes

859
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,272
We got a couple seasons and I feel happy

860
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:29,856
That was part of it and proud of what we ultimately put out

861
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:34,464
Joshua Malina is the co-host of The West Wing weekly and addictive

862
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:40,864
And rigorous discussion of the TV show The West Wing trust me it's great in the community they formed around the pot

863
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,144
Comcast is just like this

864
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,216
Warm embrace so proud to have them Park

Series from Bellow radio TV show the truth

Comic mystery

895

A dad

898

I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

899
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:49,375

908
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:19,583
