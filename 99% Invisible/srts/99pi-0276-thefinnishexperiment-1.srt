12

13
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:36,352

I'm Roman Mars

32
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:30,880
People all over the world

33
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,416
Flirting with an idea

34
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:36,512
Call Basic income

35
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:38,304
The idea behind the basic income

36
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,840
Is that each citizen

37
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:41,888
Receives a payment every month

38
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,936
As of right without conditions

39
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,728
I'm paid individually

40
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,520
Basic income

41
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:52,640
Also known as universal basic income or unconditional basic income

42
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:54,176
Or Ubi

43
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,968
That's producer Avery trufelman

44
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,552
Very very roughly defined Universal basic income

45
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,832
Is this idea

46
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,368
That a government would

47
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,416
Hey all their citizens

48
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:08,512
And everyone will get a flat sum of money every month to cover their basic needs

49
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,560
Whether or not they have a job

50
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:13,376
And this money would be no strings attached

51
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,400
With no conditions

52
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:17,728
And this would hopefully remove any stigma from receiving it

53
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,032
It's free money basically it's free money

54
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,568
The logic behind it is this

55
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,176
A lot of jobs don't pay enough money for people to even make rent or buy groceries

56
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,504
You can work full time and still be below the poverty line

57
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,064
Easy to understand why people on the left

58
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,112
Would advocate for a guaranteed income

59
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:37,696
Throw a version of this concept is popular and Libertarians

60
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,280
They see basic income as a way to shrink the welfare

61
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:45,888
For example you could take away food stamps Medicare and housing subsidies in

62
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,680
Replace all of it with one

63
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,704
Flatsome

64
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,776
People and Tech are also interested in the concept of basic income

65
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,568
And they feel a certain urgency

66
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,336
See about it

67
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,384
Robots are coming for our jobs

68
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,992
They saying and basic income is the best way for humans to maintain a decent lifestyle

69
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,016
When are Libra

70
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,808
What is increasingly obsolete

71
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,600
Our generation is going to have to deal with

72
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,624
Tens of Millions

73
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,696
Jobs replaced by automation like self-driving cars in

74
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,024
But we have the potential to do so much more than that

75
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:18,912
That's Mark Zuckerberg giving a commencement speech at Harvard and what he's getting at is in a world where jobs are scarce

76
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,960
Everyone will need a financial

77
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:21,728
Concussion

78
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,264
And then by his logic

79
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,568
If people don't have to worry about food and shelter

80
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,152
Maybe they feel free to innovate maybe they'd start a new company

81
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,432
Go back to school

82
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:35,296
We should explore ideas like Universal basic income to make sure that everyone has a cushion

83
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,576
To try new ideas

84
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,648
Listen to that Harbor crab that is eating it up

85
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:46,816
Elon Musk has also advocated for Ubi and the startup incubator y-combinator will soon begin his own politics

86
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:51,424
Right here in Oakland to say what happens when I give a group of people a basic income

87
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:55,776
It's actually an idea that's been around for a long time and there are many

88
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,056
Different variations on

89
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,592
But recently

90
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,384
They've been a number of experiments

91
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,200
Forms of basic income happening around the world

92
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:09,856
A non-profit is running an experiment with Ubi in Kenya and Ontario Canada just launched a test in three different

93
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:10,624
Twin Cities

94
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,720
But this recent excitement about basic income experimentation

95
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,512
Is largely focused

96
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:17,536
On

97
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,303
Finland

98
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:23,679
Experiment

99
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:27,519
With universal basic income

100
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,543
Financial

101
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:34,175
In the beginning of 2017 The Finnish government began an experiment with a basic income

102
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:36,735
And this news about the Finland experiment

103
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,015
Was really excited

104
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:41,599
Maybe we will learn what people will do if they can make money

105
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,623
Without work

106
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,415
They just hang out at home

107
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,719
What Society grind to a halt

108
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,767
How do people find meaning in their lives

109
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,047
And how will they evaluate

110
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,095
And that's a quart of dick

111
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:52,863
Question

112
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,655
It's the kind of the acid test

113
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,423
So basically

114
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,471
Will receiving basic

115
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,519
People more or less

116
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,055
Whatever deactivate

117
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,079
Whether it's

118
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,895
Just walking around or whether it's

119
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:05,663
Taking care of

120
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,431
Your neighborhood

121
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,455
Kids are

122
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:10,015
Applying for work this is Robin mocha

123
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,831
Founder of demos Helsinki we are helsinki-based anything

124
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,623
And here's what I learned

125
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,183
Talking to rope and other people in Finland

126
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,231
About this experiment with basic income

127
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,023
To talk about basic income

128
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,071
Fremont started before

129
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,607
The understanding off

130
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,399
What the outcomes of automation

131
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,191
B or the employment Market

132
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,727
The Finland experiment

133
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:30,751
Is not about robot

134
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,799
And it's not to see if people will

135
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,079
Stop working when they get

136
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,383
Free money experiment is to find out

137
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,687
If giving people basic income

138
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:39,967
Well actually help them

139
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:40,991
Start work

140
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,343
In this whole experiment is especially interesting to us here at 99 pi

141
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,647
Not just for what Finland is test

142
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,439
But how they are testing it

143
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:54,559
Finland is trying out a unique design-oriented way of thinking about government

144
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:57,119
Rather than just rolling Outlaws on a massive scale

145
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:00,191
They're trying to craft legislation in stages

146
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,215
With user feedback

147
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,007
Like a piece of design

148
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:07,871
Because every good design is made to fill a need or solve a problem

149
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:08,639
This

150
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:09,919
Is the problem

151
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,199
I hate it

152
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,503
Unemployed

153
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,295
Right now in 2017

154
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,343
The unemployment rate in Finland

155
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,623
8.8 /

156
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,647
Percent and that's about

157
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,439
Double the US unemployment rate

158
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:27,583
And that rate is worse than smaller finished cities like your insu

159
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,631
Is ephelides always being there

160
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,679
Poorest parts of the country

161
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,471
This is Donna leskinen

162
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:37,567
Resident of Yuan Su which is about an hour's drive away from the Russian border

163
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:41,151
She's 39 and she's been unemployed for a little over two years

164
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,431
Unemployment

165
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,967
Has been here

166
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:47,551
That's a in southern or Western Finland

167
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,855
Because we are far

168
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:54,719
From a bigger cities where are more much much much more

169
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,999
Job opportunity

170
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:59,071
Santa has a master's in history and she worked as a researcher

171
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,863
Docker project ran out of funding

172
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:04,191
And all over Finland has been a massive decline in manufacturing

173
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,239
Ever since Nokia was

174
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:08,799
Crushed by Apple and Android phones

175
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:14,175
Nokia's phone parts used to be made by contractors and companies all around the country

176
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:16,991
My mom actually work in that factory.

177
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:19,551
Kenny went down when Nokia started go down

178
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,343
I kind of know

179
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,391
Bottom part of a story

180
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,927
Pretty well in the US

181
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:25,951
Depending on the state

182
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:30,559
You can generally collect unemployment for about half a year after losing a job

183
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:33,631
In Finland you can collect unemployment for about

184
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,655
2 years

185
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:38,239
And then there different kinds of social assistance is an allowances

186
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,007
Apply for

187
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,031
If you still

188
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,311
Don't have a job

189
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,335
But here's the catch

190
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:44,895
If you're collecting unemployment assistant in Finland

191
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:47,455
You definitely cannot earn additional income

192
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,247
Or you risk losing those benefit

193
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,551
And then you have to reapply

194
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,087
Which is a massive drag

195
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,111
You cannot

196
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,135
Take

197
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:55,903
Like

198
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,439
Part time job

199
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,463
Because

200
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:01,023
Then you are gaining money even though

201
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,559
Very very little

202
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:05,375
Then is counted against you

203
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:09,215
As so you lose that little bit of support money you were already gaining

204
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:12,799
So unemployed Finn's don't want to risk that loss

205
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:16,383
They don't want to pick up temporary gig work or part-time jobs

206
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,151
Freelance work

207
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,479
So it's really really difficult situation

208
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:24,575
This actually happened with the person we hired to record sauna

209
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,367
We asked what is rate was

210
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,159
And he said he couldn't charge us

211
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:33,023
Because he's also unemployed and would lose part of his allowance if you took on money from freelance work

212
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,071
So he did it for free

213
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,095
Thanks

214
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:40,447
Basically the government of Finland realize that something had to be done about this cyst

215
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:45,055
That they were accidentally disincentivizing citizens from getting small jobs

216
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:47,359
Or maybe even starting businesses of Their Own

217
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,663
And these are citizens who want to work

218
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,687
Like Santa

219
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,967
Being unemployed

220
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,783
Makes me feel anyway so whatever

221
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,831
I don't know

222
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,623
Unimportant

223
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,415
Doing a job

224
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:03,231
Would make you feel like you're doing something for dinner

225
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,255
A purpose

226
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,815
Is something bad being unemployed

227
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,631
Hanging around and Chestnut

228
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,447
Being very important to anything anybody

229
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:16,031
So this welfare system clearly needs to be changed

230
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,335
This could be done in a few different ways

231
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,383
Like with an Earned Income Tax Credit

232
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,711
But first they wanted to try out something simpler

233
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:24,991
And go from there

234
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,527
And this is where we get

235
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,295
Tattoo design

236
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:33,951
They wanted to design and test policy in a process very similar to the way designers come up with new products

237
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,487
You would design policy

238
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,791
That you would think about policies ass

239
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,583
Kind of design objects

240
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,375
Our Design Services

241
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,191
And that means that you could do alteration

242
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:44,959
And tests

243
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:47,775
That's roping mocha again founder of the think-tank

244
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:50,591
Demos Helsinki and the prime minister's office

245
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,615
Turns to them

246
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,151
Soda prime minister's office

247
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:56,479
Stop roast ask and ask them how can I be employee

248
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,759
Design thinking

249
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,783
On

250
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,807
A national level

251
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:02,623
Now can we do like governments level design thinking

252
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,159
Design thinking

253
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,439
It goes like this

254
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:08,511
First there is a challenge or problem that must be song

255
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,303
Bend designers

256
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,071
Express

257
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,607
Test and cycle

258
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:13,631
Express

259
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:16,959
That means designers come up with a few ideas and prototypes

260
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:17,727
Test

261
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,007
The try those ideas

262
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,799
Maybe with a model or sample

263
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:24,383
Get feedback to Understand what actually happens what are the outcomes

264
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,151
And

265
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:29,247
Cycle incorporate that feedback to make changes and revise the design

266
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,039
Then the process begins again

267
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:33,855
And again and again in different iterations

268
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,135
Couple years ago

269
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:39,487
This is how the Finnish prime minister decided he wanted to design legislation

270
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:43,071
Also the Prime Minister I mean he's not a radical

271
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,399
Ya te vi

272
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,167
Is the most dangerous

273
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:50,239
Fart story through frustration

274
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,775
They don't know

275
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,823
What a particular Lord

276
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:54,591
Hacks

277
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,615
Would cause

278
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:56,639
Will actually

279
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,407
Work

280
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:02,271
So demos helped establish and experimentation unit which is an actual office

281
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,551
Of the Finnish prime minister

282
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,623
At the prime minister's office is experimentation used

283
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,391
The first unit

284
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,415
Bus like

285
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,439
Design

286
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,975
Policies in the kind of design

287
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,767
Meaning of the word

288
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,095
There are other governments that are interested in experimentation

289
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:18,655
But here's what makes Finland different

290
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:19,935
They want

291
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:20,703
To create prototype

292
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:24,543
And then change and scale and update them dynamically

293
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:27,615
As a result of their experiments show what's effective

294
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,383
And what's not

295
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,687
And in order to run these experiments

296
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:35,807
Finland actually had to pass a law to ensure that they were not in violation of their constitution

297
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:36,575
Course

298
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,879
All the Constitutions of

299
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,695
The Democratic countries in the world they say that you have to

300
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,231
To treat people equally

301
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,535
And by definition if you're running experiments

302
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,327
You're not treating people equally

303
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,351
Cathay

304
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,887
People who are part of the experiment

305
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,167
I'm not

306
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,191
Treated equally

307
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:54,239
So they needed to be a special law

308
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,543
That's all fine. Okay how do

309
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,567
The experiment

310
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,615
Fit in the Constitution

311
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,383
That says

312
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,919
That people need

313
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:02,687
Will be treated equally

314
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:05,759
And one of the first experiments The Finnish government decided

315
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:08,063
Do was with basic income

316
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,855
Because the welfare office

317
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:12,415
Is extensive and complicated and rather than

318
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:16,767
Rejigger in one part of it and changing a bunch of stuff around and reworking their normal operation

319
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,071
The basic income experiment just kind of

320
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,095
Chugs Along on

321
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:26,751
We have automated and partly automated are processes so everything is run by computers

322
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:32,383
The money the basic income just gets deposited in participants bank account every month automatically

323
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:35,711
The program is currently overseen by Mario keturunan

324
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:40,319
Who works for government institution called Kellogg

325
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,879
Social insurance institution here in Finland

326
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:47,231
So I was in charge of implementing this basic income

327
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,511
Experiment

328
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,047
Project leader

329
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,607
Stigma about welfare in Finland

330
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:55,679
Everyone goes through this office every now and then in life

331
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:59,007
Because there are 40 different kinds of benefits that students can receive

332
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,615
Including student support maternal care maternal care pension subsidies

333
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,639
And of course

334
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,663
Unemployment

335
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,967
So in January of 2017

336
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:12,063
Kellogg 2000 unemployed fins at random from all over the country

337
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:17,183
In this experiment we have 2,000 people who are getting this a basic income $500

338
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,719
60 Euros per month

339
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,535
And so they have to be at between 25.

340
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,071
The eighth so they are not

341
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,863
Students or young people

342
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:29,471
And they are not those kind of people who will fill out their pension age during the sixth

343
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,775
Experiment so this is kind of like the profile

344
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:35,103
Participants didn't volunteer for the experiment

345
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:39,199
Kelly just told them that they would now be receiving 560 Euros a month

346
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,991
The news came in a letter

347
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,015
I got an

348
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,807
Fat fat

349
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,087
Mail

350
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:45,855
Andis

351
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:49,695
Says that's okay you are chosen to be one

352
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:53,535
It is basic income experiment and I was like out

353
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,815
What's that

354
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:58,143
Sauna the unemployed researcher and Yuan SU

355
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:04,543
I'm really thought about basic income until she read that big fat packet that came in the mail which outlines the experiment for her

356
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,615
And I was going to have the certain amount of money

357
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,407
Did my bank account every month

358
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:12,223
It's not big but it's stable money

359
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:16,575
560 Euros a month would be a little less than sauna would get on unemployment

360
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:19,391
But you'd also be able to work and not worry about losing

361
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,183
So I was happy about it because

362
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,743
Two years that experiments last

363
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:26,303
It's got to be that money every month

364
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:30,143
And I don't have to stress that much because I am a big

365
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,423
Dresser person

366
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,959
I stress a lot

367
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:33,983
Finding a job

368
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:34,751
Is very important

369
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,287
So now

370
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,335
Unable

371
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:40,895
If I find a job and work a part-time job

372
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,175
I could take it

373
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:46,783
And not lose the support of many that usually would if I wasn't part of this

374
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,063
Basic income

375
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:48,831
Experiment

376
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:52,671
Some of the participants have been talking about their basic income with a press

377
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,207
But China has kept it a sin

378
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,255
I feel embarrassed about it

379
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,559
Biggest it feels like I have this

380
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:01,887
Advantaged so I haven't been fairy

381
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,423
I'm excited about

382
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,983
Spreading that information and now us

383
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,007
Participating this

384
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,311
Your post this is like okay

385
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:13,663
I'm not very many people in Finland are probably here in your office.

386
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,455
I can see elephant devoted

387
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:17,503
Sorry to put it this way

388
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,039
I'll have you know we are

389
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,087
Huge in Finland sauna

390
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:26,719
Santa doesn't know anyone else involved in the study and most people in Finland don't

391
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:29,791
Her friends get kind of StarStruck when she tells them her Secret

392
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:33,119
I I get people out of court with that so

393
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:33,887
Oh

394
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:37,215
First one I've ever met

395
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,007
It's kind of funny really

396
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:44,639
When you collect unemployment in Finland have to go to these job training meetings and check-ins every couple of months

397
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:47,967
But these two thousand participants scattered around the country

398
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:51,551
Don't have to do anything at all to get this 502

399
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,831
60 Euros every month

400
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,903
Even though they're part of this experiment they also don't have

401
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,439
How to report how they spent it

402
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,487
And at the end of the experiment

403
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,767
Tell her we'll look and see if

404
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:04,351
This group of unemployed people who got basic income took on work

405
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,655
And compare it with their control group

406
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,471
Which is the rest of the unemployed people in Finland

407
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:15,359
175000 people who are in the same profile than these two thousand people

408
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,919
But they are not getting this basic

409
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:20,991
I'm so we are comparing these two groups of people

410
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:23,039
In this two years.

411
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:28,159
I see what is happening to these how are these people behaving when they get this basic income

412
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,695
And that how are these people

413
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,463
Behaving

414
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:34,047
And then when they compare the results

415
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,583
Basic income my

416
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,423
Just might get one step closer to becoming a reality

417
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:44,799
Play with the idea that these basic income would actually come a universal

418
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,335
I can compare in Finland

419
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,615
Which is kind of like the

420
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:50,431
The idea that I don't actually believe

421
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,479
Is going to happen

422
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,295
The people who

423
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,575
I'm not thinking this

424
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:57,599
A good idea

425
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:01,183
Guess the person currently overseeing the experiment for basic income

426
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,975
Believe that won't work

427
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:05,791
I think that it would be too dramatic

428
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:08,863
So we would wipe out the whole of this

429
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,959
Social security system that he would have been building up for decades

430
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,519
And then just replace it with one

431
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:18,591
Turn in imagines but not everyone would

432
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,871
Prefer a flat income

433
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:23,455
Some people do need more than one base some

434
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:25,503
Like what if you have children or parents

435
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,551
Special needs you have to take care of old

436
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,087
In that case

437
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:31,903
You don't have the capacity to start picking up gig work

438
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,463
The basic income wouldn't be enough for you

439
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,743
And of course

440
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,023
Forward pay for it

441
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,559
So who would Finance it

442
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:42,911
It's really hard to say how much basic income would actually cost

443
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:43,679
The average tax

444
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,215
Where it to be Institute

445
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:49,567
And we don't quite know how it would affect the economy or inflation rate

446
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,383
It's all dependent on a number of factors

447
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,431
And there's no exact math on this

448
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:55,967
If someone truly

449
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:57,759
Planes that they know how much

450
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:58,783
Morris

451
00:17:59,295 --> 00:17:59,807
Basically

452
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:01,855
I think they're lying

453
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,135
Sasha

454
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,159
Systemic shift

455
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:10,303
Decide to start paying everyone a lump sum of money will change the economy in such way that the whole system chain

456
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,095
It's like once again something

457
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,119
Experiment

458
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:17,471
Ropa says yes basic income would save money by cutting back on bureaucracy

459
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:20,543
Blue probably still be expensive to fund

460
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,311
But that's almost

461
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,079
Technical

462
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,383
You know you know if you need money right money

463
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,199
It's like what politicians do they changed

464
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,223
By the way

465
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:30,015
Budgets are arranged

466
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:33,599
If basic income make citizens become more active and engaged

467
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,903
Girl that has faith that governments will

468
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,183
Find a way to pay for it

469
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:41,279
Because I'm excited and activated population is generally good for the economy

470
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,607
He says that's why they have to test before anything else

471
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:46,911
Basic income would really increase productivity and

472
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,447
Improve General well-being

473
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,751
At this point they're testing to see

474
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,543
If it be worth more in there

475
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,591
I really really

476
00:18:54,847 --> 00:19:00,479
Really hope that this will continue. Just spread out that more people are involved

477
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,551
This experiment has

478
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,831
Integrated sauna

479
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:08,671
Even though she gets slightly less money than she would on unemployment

480
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,975
She's free to do whatever she wants

481
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:13,023
I am trying to find a job

482
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:16,863
I meant sending applications and take off

483
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,143
Play a part time job

484
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:20,447
She feels like she's about to start a new chapter

485
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:21,983
Ready for what snack

486
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,287
Tranquility of mind

487
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,823
It brought that to me

488
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:30,431
And if it sounds funny because I'm out of money is not that big

489
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,199
But

490
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,479
To give people hope

491
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,527
Give people a chance to

492
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,807
Take a moment

493
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,599
Away from the stress

494
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,367
As a

495
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,391
Panic

496
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,671
Do we survive

497
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:43,231
It's really important to keep in mind that son is just

498
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:46,047
One participant in a very small study

499
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,375
And basic income may have helped her search for part time work

500
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:52,703
But when I spoke with her she had yet to actually find employment

501
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:58,079
And also you probably noted that this form of basic income is not Universal basic income

502
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,359
Who are Universal

503
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:02,687
It would be money for every citizen employed or not

504
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,711
In this particular

505
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,479
Experiment

506
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:07,039
The basic income is only for unemployed people

507
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:12,159
Yeah I think what we're experimenting that would be cold partial basic income is 8

508
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:15,999
This is a limited experiment I don't know how relevant it is because

509
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,791
A lot of groups are missing

510
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,911
If we want to see what people do when they don't have to work anymore

511
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:28,799
Roper says they should next see what happens if basic income is given to people who are already employed

512
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:31,359
To see if they then quit their jobs

513
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:36,479
Critics of the experiment also argue that 2000 people is too small a sample size

514
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:40,831
To finish Economist published an op-ed in the New York Times called

515
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:43,903
Why finland's basic income experiment isn't working

516
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,719
And said it had the potential to incentivize people to

517
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:49,791
Accept low paying and low productivity jobs

518
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,327
It's an experiment that

519
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,351
Far from perfect

520
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,935
But it's not supposed to be a be-all end-all

521
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,215
Ideally

522
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:58,495
What's a first draft

523
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,031
Weekend which is considered

524
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:05,407
Give this amount to some thousands of people and then we'll know for sure

525
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,431
It's going to be

526
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:10,527
Ultra other experiments before we can find out how to

527
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:11,807
How to renew

528
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:16,672
Basically if this experiment is at all successful

529
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:18,208
Or even if it's not

530
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,256
It should lead to another

531
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,280
And then another

532
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,304
And then another

533
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:25,632
In Finland isn't Justice on the experiments with basic income

534
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:28,704
Dolby experiments for what languages to teach in schools

535
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,240
How to change child care

536
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,008
Everything

537
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,288
According to their website

538
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,360
Experimentation office is working on 26

539
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,640
Key projects National

540
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,944
And slowly

541
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:39,968
Hopefully

542
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:43,552
Finland will use the design process to figure out if it

543
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,320
It's possible

544
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,344
A worthwhile

545
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:48,160
To try radically new ideas

546
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,440
Express

547
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:50,976
Test and cycle

548
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:59,680
Will we ever get a basic income experiment right here in the US

549
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:01,728
It turns out we already had one

550
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,008
Decades ago

551
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,568
Avery explains after the break

552
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,272
Between the beats

553
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:16,576
Bongs and Charter of our devices

554
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:20,160
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man made sound

555
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,184
If

556
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:27,584
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife isn't

557
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,424
All hearing. Voice

558
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,448
Technology

559
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,216
Talk to us

560
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,520
It is a creation of Sonic trash

561
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:38,592
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

562
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:41,920
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

563
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,968
To make them more human

564
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:48,064
Turn the living room lights on

565
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:49,856
Okay

566
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,392
Dim the living room lights

567
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,416
50%

568
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:54,464
Okay

569
00:22:55,232 --> 00:23:00,608
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

570
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:02,912
Makes for a much more natural

571
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:03,680
Experience

572
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:05,472
Turn the living room lights on

573
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,800
Dim the living room lights

574
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:09,824
50%

575
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:13,152
We're presenting to

576
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:17,248
Special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

577
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:20,064
About how are soundscape is impacting our health

578
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:22,624
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

579
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,440
Look for them Friday is May 17th and May 24th

580
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,208
Right here

581
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:27,744
E9pay

582
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:32,096
We need to talk about something

583
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:38,496
Constipation abdominal pain and bloating it's not that bad you take laxatives

584
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:39,264
Routine

585
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,312
Thinking about it all the time is frustrating

586
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:47,712
It doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again and you don't know why

587
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,016
Then it may be time to seek help

588
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:56,416
Go to oh my God. Info / podcast we can learn more about your symptoms that's oh my God

589
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:58,208
Infowars podcast

590
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,232
Oh my God

591
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:03,840
People here in United States are talking about

592
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:06,144
Universal basic income in arguing about

593
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,424
Why is good and wet

594
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,472
That's bad but to me it just seems like

595
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:13,824
It's not on the table at all I just feel like there's something about the US

596
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,664
That makes it so it would never happen here the basic income is basically something

597
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:20,224
That can only be tested in Nordic

598
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,504
Welfare state

599
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,064
Yeah it's it's it's

600
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:28,672
It's the crazy thing about basic income is actually this very American

601
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:29,696
Idea

602
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:30,464
It was

603
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,744
First proposed right

604
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,328
He's kind of first mentioned by American Founding Father Thomas Paine

605
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:37,888
It's like as American as apple pie

606
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,936
And in terms of

607
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:42,496
Basic income experiment

608
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:45,056
We've actually been down this road before

609
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:47,360
For as a nation here in the United States

610
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:49,408
We did some studies

611
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,688
With basic income

612
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,968
Back in the seventies

613
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,296
I shall ask to change the framework of government itself

614
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,392
So we can make it again fully responsible for the needs and the wish

615
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:05,024
The American people wanted to see if you could guarantee a family of four

616
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,816
$1,600 a year

617
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,608
Like $10,000

618
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,376
Is today

619
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:11,680
Any hints at it in this State of the Union Address

620
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:15,008
Let us place the floor under the income of every family with

621
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,288
Children in America

622
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:19,616
Let us provide the means by which

623
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:20,640
More

624
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,664
Can't help himself

625
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:27,808
And so yeah and then he decided to really try and do it tens of millions of dollars

626
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:28,832
We're budgeted

627
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:32,160
So that more than 8500 American

628
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:34,720
Could be involved in experiments all around the country

629
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,256
And their bunch of different one

630
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:39,328
Different people running them and they tested like

631
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,608
Different variations of basic

632
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:41,888
Can come in different ideas around

633
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:44,192
When in Seattle in one in Denver

634
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:46,240
And one in Gary Indiana and one in North

635
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,008
Carolina just like

636
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:48,800
All kinds of places all over the country

637
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:50,336
And so why haven't

638
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:52,128
I heard of these at all

639
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,944
I have no I've known Elizabeth and what do they find out

640
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,528
Well the results were kindness

641
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,808
Screwy because

642
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,344
It wasn't like

643
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,368
In a perfect

644
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,136
Scientific

645
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,928
Bubble there all these variations

646
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,464
All at the same time

647
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:08,000
And some of them were like

648
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:14,144
Different marginal tax rates in like different benefit levels and all the different kinds of stuff which makes it really difficult

649
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,448
Identify the effects

650
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:18,496
Because you were texting so many different versions of it

651
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,032
And then

652
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,056
Actually

653
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:24,640
The really big pitbull like they did find some stuff for the reason

654
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:25,408
That

655
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:28,480
Has been pretty much discarded to the sands of time was because

656
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:30,528
People started analyzing the results

657
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,320
Or did it was a

658
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,368
And so they're like

659
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,136
These rumors

660
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:35,904
Swirling around

661
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:40,768
But people were dropping out of the workforce and just like enjoying this basic income

662
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:43,840
And it wasn't actually a statistically significant Trend it was

663
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,888
Kind of a Rumour which can sometimes

664
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:47,168
Be more powerful than a fact

665
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,216
And they're also all these reports

666
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:52,032
Increase separation and divorce rates

667
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:58,432
And that was considered really scandalous and set off a lot of opposition but then when the data was actually a

668
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,200
Analyzed

669
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:00,992
It wasn't as

670
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,016
Seems that many more

671
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:05,600
Is there a few but this wasn't necessarily A Bad Thing

672
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:12,000
Totally. The economic slavery

673
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:15,584
Akron public didn't have the patience for nuance and they're like this will be the end of the family unit

674
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,352
Cancel

675
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:19,936
Tolerate it and it's all just because like

676
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:24,800
They started chatting about it before they had before they had the numbers

677
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:27,872
It was kind disregarded before we really had a chance to

678
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:31,200
I think that's certainly a challenge

679
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:32,736
Keeping in mind

680
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,016
This is Elizabeth Rhodes

681
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:39,904
And she is a research director of a basic income study that is happening at y combinator research

682
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,952
Which of the nonprofit research lab

683
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:44,512
Can you buy a startup accelerator called y combinator

684
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:47,328
It works like right down the street from our office

685
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:50,656
And she's helping to launch a basic income experiment nearby

686
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,424
Colonel Glenn

687
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,704
We are

688
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,728
In the process of

689
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:57,568
Capri Pilots Mall

690
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:00,384
Protest sticks and work through

691
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:06,016
Questions around that and preparing for a larger randomized control trial that we hope to Launch

692
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:08,064
After that local time

693
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,344
They want to react

694
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,624
Expended actually looking

695
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,904
Do two US states

696
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:12,928
Embroidery

697
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:17,536
They have definitely learned from these early experiments

698
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:18,816
2

699
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,352
Start small

700
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:22,656
Expand slowly and to not

701
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:23,680
Promise to me

702
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,984
Because

703
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,800
You know they want to wait for this experiment to fully play out

704
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:32,128
I'm like Finland they're definitely doing this because of the robots

705
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:35,200
And because they're based here in the Bay Area which is

706
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:36,736
Home of the gig economy

707
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:39,808
Then just want to see if this will make people happy

708
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:42,624
In an era where robots take over all of our jobs

709
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,696
Or jobs are not like jobs that are today

710
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:47,232
Rare a big trout

711
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,000
And therefore

712
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:50,304
Having a basic income would ameliorate

713
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,840
A kind of economy that

714
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,120
A lot of the

715
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:54,656
Silicon Valley is helping to

716
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:59,008
To create exactly

717
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:03,360
Startup accelerator like to help businesses grow and they're like this is what it takes

718
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:07,712
If they need a basic income in order to innovate capital I like

719
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:12,832
Let's let's see if it'll work yeah and they just want to make sure that they don't set expectations

720
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:13,600
Too high

721
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:15,648
The funniest Urban UniFirst several years

722
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:17,184
And so I don't expect

723
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:18,464
Tootsie

724
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,744
No changes overnight

725
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,280
Anyway and so I think

726
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:23,072
We really need to give it time

727
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,608
Sew in

728
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,656
Doing this research about basic income

729
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:29,216
I come across a thousand polarizing thanks

730
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:31,008
Pieces that are either like

731
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:36,640
Ubi is a great idea and we should do this right now or like this is a terrible idea and we need to stop it

732
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:39,456
But realistically it's going to be years

733
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:43,808
Before we know what we can learn from this privatized American experiment

734
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:46,368
Or from The Finnish experiment for that matter

735
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:48,928
Because most of the arguments were having about

736
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:50,464
Basic income at this point in time

737
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:54,816
In all of basic incomes many different definitions and variations

738
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:56,864
It's all based on speculation

739
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:58,912
