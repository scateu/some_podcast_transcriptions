I'm Roman Mars

37
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,440
About an hour east of Oakland the town of Livermore California

38
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:35,744
Hanging in the garage a fire station number 6

39
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:38,560
There's a small pear-shaped light bulb

40
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,352
The light is on

41
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,888
Right now it's glowing

42
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,168
And it's been blowing

43
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:45,728
Just a couple of momentary interruptions

44
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,288
For 113 years

45
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:50,336
Oh there it is

46
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,640
Looking at the longest burning

47
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:54,432
Longest continuously burning light bulb

48
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,736
In the world in the Guinness Book of World Records

49
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:59,296
And was installed in 1901

50
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:06,208
We send our producer Katie mingle out there to see the bulb which is a genuine heirloom from the dawn of electric illumination

51
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,744
Don't buy one of its pioneers

52
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,792
A guy named out of Chalet

53
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:14,400
Probably when you think about the beginning of electric light Hugo Amelia Thomas Edison

54
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:20,800
That's John welham he's a writer from San Francisco he wrote a piece about the Livermore Light Bulb for pop-up magazine earlier

55
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:24,128
What is here but the age of electric light didn't just switch on

56
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,152
All at once you had

57
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:25,920
Tinkers

58
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:31,552
Trying to come up with better designs trying to iterate and innovate something that would burn longer or maybe brighter

59
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,832
Where that would cost less

60
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,136
Socialite was one of these guys

61
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:37,952
It was a great time of invention and innovation

62
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:41,536
All Over America light bulbs were going off over people's heads

63
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:47,936
And some of those light bulbs were being turned into actual light bulbs

64
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:51,264
Take a big light bulb back the kind you'd see on a theater Marquee

65
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:57,920
And it would be one bulb of his own design in the rest of the bulbs from competing Brands then shall they would start slow

66
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:04,320
Slowly dialing up the power and one by one the competitors bulb all explode

67
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:07,136
Chalets would be the last one Shining

68
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:11,744
One of those tenacious light bulbs made it all the way to Livermore California

69
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:15,584
Its origin was in 1901 when a shop owner

70
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,608
Donated it

71
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,448
To the town's volunteer fire department they were called the fire boys

72
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,472
In those days

73
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:25,056
And with the ball hanging in their Firehouse this meant they could now

74
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,592
Gather up all their equipment

75
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,640
Place a call about a fire came in

76
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,176
In the middle of the night in the dark

77
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:35,808
In those Dark Ages there were no fire engines firefighters used hose carts pulled by horses

78
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:39,392
Here's Tom bramel former deputy fire chief in Livermore

79
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:43,488
This type of him is from a documentary about the bulb called Century of light

80
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,280
The volunteers Atwood

81
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:48,864
Got a ride to a twin incident they would come to the station there

82
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,168
Get there there

83
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,192
Postcard

84
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:53,984
Hitch up the horses

85
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:57,568
Look for all of the equipment that they were looking for but this light

86
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:01,920
Lit up the hose cart room so that I could have sent without getting injured falling over and

87
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:05,504
So the light bulb has very significant function

88
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,064
In 1906

89
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,928
The fire station boob just down the street the light bulb on at that point for 5 years

90
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,976
Bed no idea how long it will last

91
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:18,559
It was their only lightbulb so course they brought it along

92
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,839
It seems like people just

93
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:22,143
Stop thinking about the bulb after a while

94
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:24,447
There wasn't really an obvious way to shut it off

95
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:26,239
The way that had been wired

96
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:29,823
But it must have just been dim and unobtrusive enough that no one really

97
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,847
Try too hard

98
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:35,455
Eventually the old-fashioned hose guards were replaced with fire trucks

99
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:39,039
The bulb hung between the firehouses to garage doors

100
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:41,343
And the firefighters were like aware of it

101
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,879
I didn't think much about it

102
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,671
The bald hung down

103
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:45,695
Probably

104
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,719
Countdown app

105
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:49,791
A pretty good distance from the ceiling in a long cord that act

106
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,071
Massachusetts on today the same

107
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:51,839
The same chord

108
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:52,863
But it was

109
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,911
Pretty sure it was low enough that you could walk by

110
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:55,935
To reach open

111
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,471
Tabitha Bolton

112
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,239
Marcus wingback

113
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:00,543
As time went on

114
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,591
Would throw Nerf balls

115
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:10,271
In 1971 the first full-time chief of the Livermore fire department a guy named Jack Barrett got curious about the light bulb

116
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:13,855
Any as a local newspaper reporter to look into the bulbs history

117
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:17,951
The resulting article got resident of Livermore talking about the bulb

118
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,999
The Pride

119
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:22,047
Livermore to own little antiquity

120
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:25,375
The firefighters stop throwing Nerf balls at it

121
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,935
Five years later when the fire department

122
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,471
Was moving into a new building

123
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:35,615
They obviously knew that they they couldn't leave the bulb behind and if I cheat buried insisted that they take it with them

124
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,639
On March

125
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:37,663
XXXI

126
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,199

127
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:39,967
6

128
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,271
It was the day that we moved

129
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,295
The light bulb

130
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,343
From 2360

131
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,111
C5 first

132
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,671
Out here on East Avenue to this

133
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,439
Station

134
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:55,839
That's only the Omens he was the former division chief of the Livermore fire department this interview was recorded for the century

135
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:58,399
Reapply documentary released in 2011

136
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,167
March 3rd

137
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,191
31st of 70

138
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:00,959
6

139
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:01,983
Will always

140
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,263
Special date

141
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,591
The light bulb was escorted with red lights and siren

142
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,383
We had a special box

143
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,151
Built

144
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,431
Not only that

145
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,967
But the box was painted red

146
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,759
Which even made it more special

147
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,063
When they got the light bulb to the new station

148
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,903
The electrician set it up so that the light bulb could be screwed in immediately

149
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,463
Climbed up the ladder with the light bulb

150
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:27,327
Screwed up the wires together so that everything would go on

151
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,095
Anne Frank

152
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,375
And made the connection

153
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,679
The light bulb didn't come on

154
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:32,703
And we

155
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:33,727
Gas

156
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:38,335
Oh my gosh oh my goodness what did we do this world famous light bulb

157
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:39,871
And now it's

158
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:40,639
Gone

159
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:43,199
But then electrician jiggled somewheres around

160
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,735
The light came back on

161
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,807
Everybody made a big sigh

162
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:58,815
Meanwhile as a lightbulb is becoming more more thing as it was impossible for people not to start wondering about what it was made of and how it could

163
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,607
Still possibly be working

164
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,911
The obvious way to solve the mystery

165
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:08,287
Would be the crack of light bulb open and examine it but obviously no one wanted to do that it was just too precious

166
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,567
I am Deborah Katz

167
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:14,431
I'm a physics professor at the US Naval Academy in Annapolis Maryland

168
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:17,503
Dr. Katz did some tests on similar light bulbs

169
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,831
Light bulbs made by the same company in the same time.

170
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:26,975
She measured the thickness of the bulbs filament which is that tiny piece of wire in the bulb that can break really easily

171
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:31,071
And I did that using a laser so I didn't have to break the bulb

172
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:31,839
To get in there

173
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,887
She figured out that the filament

174
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:37,727
In the Livermore Bob was 8 times thicker than a regular bulb

175
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:40,031
And made from carbon instead of tungsten

176
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,311
What I figured out just

177
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,079
Don't tell me

178
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:44,383
Why the filament shouldn't have bro

179
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,151
Broken by now

180
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,711
That's Tuff

181
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,271
Pretty incredible I think it still is a mess

182
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:56,671
Stree what she does know is that in 1924 a bunch of light bulb companies got together and formed a cartel

183
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,695
Called Phoebus

184
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:03,583
The goal of the cartel was for all the light bulb companies that stop making bulbs that lasted so long

185
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,887
So that everyone can sell more light bulbs

186
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:11,519
Members of the cartel were actually charged fines if their bulb is burned for too many hours

187
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,311
And in two years the company

188
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:16,639
Light bulbs went from lasting 2500 hours

189
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,687
Delta 1500 hours

190
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,223
By the 1940s

191
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,527
They actually made their goal of

192
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,551
Bulbs that only last

193
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,575
2000 hours

194
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:30,975
The Shelby company which manufactured Chili's ball pad already gone out of business by the time the Phoebus cartel had been formed

195
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:34,559
But I'd like to think that they wouldn't have been involved with that nonsense

196
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:38,655
I think that I think they were trying to make a quality product rather than a product

197
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,191
With built-in obsolescence

198
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:46,847
And a quality product it was of course the Bold was just hanging there and continuing the glow

199
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:50,175
Turn away at story was taking on this air of magical realism

200
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:56,063
In 2001 a group of locals decided Livermore ought to have a hundredth birthday party for the light bulb

201
00:08:56,575 --> 00:09:01,695
They formed the Centennial bulb committee and started planning what they thought would be a small get-together at

202
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:04,767
The firehouse that June Indian 600 people showed up

203
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,303
Ned cake and

204
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,095
The rock bands playing in

205
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:10,399
Kids dancing on the top of the fire truck

206
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:13,983
Committee members get live interviews to Katie Couric in CNN

207
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:19,871
By then responsibility for the party was the first fireman become interested in

208
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:23,199
To one of the firefighters who served under him Lynn Owens

209
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,479
You heard from them earlier

210
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:30,111
One of the younger guys in the checking their footballs at the light bulb

211
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:36,767
I'll be by this point by the time the Bold turn the hundred he was already a retired division chief he was grinning Asian guy with

212
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,303
These tiny glasses in it

213
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,839
Bruce Lee White mustache

214
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,887
Owens love the ball

215
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,423
Any love to Proclaim is love

216
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,703
Light bulb

217
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,287
That light bulb has

218
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,055
Has been doing the

219
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,639
Night

220
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,663
Teen

221
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:59,807
They was like he was talking about the lightbulb the way James Earl Jones with talk about baseball at the end of Field of Dreams

222
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,087
Reminders

223
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,367
More than once

224
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:10,303
I should not tell a lot of people end up talking about the lightbulb though

225
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,863
People write letters to the committee

226
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:16,191
And they say things like the light bulb gives them hope

227
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:22,591
Or they call it quote a reassuring reminder of faithfulness and service in a letter President George W bush

228
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,127
Bush called the lightbulb quote

229
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:27,967
An enduring symbol of the American Spirit of invention in quote

230
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:33,087
For a lot of people at all so ironically symbolizes another great American invention

231
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,879
Planned obsolescence

232
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,159
I like the label because

233
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:41,279
It's this little speck of continuity you know it's something that started more than a century ago

234
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:44,095
And it keeps going so it sort of connects us to that time

235
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:48,703
You can almost imagine it like these this little Amber of a campfire that was lit back then

236
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,495
How many still going

237
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,543
And it kind of in the same way

238
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:59,199
If you trace that history you see these waves of people coming together around that fire and then slowly leaving the picture and new ones coming in

239
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:05,855
The lightbulb outlive Jack bear the first fire chief who became curious about it and Lynn Owens it's most of

240
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:06,879
Go to the caretaker

241
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:12,255
Chalets lightbulb has seen generations of firefighters come and go through Livermore

242
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:15,327
10 mm one right around the time of the party

243
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,887
The Centennial bulb committee also set up a webcam

244
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,911
I'm in front of the light bulb

245
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:25,311
The camera takes a picture of the bulb every 30 seconds that people all over the world can make sure that it's still on

246
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:28,127
The guy who maintains the camera is named Steve Bunn

247
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:30,175
And he told me he's already had to replace

248
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,991
The supposedly high-tech webcam

249
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:36,319
2 times because the light bulb has outlasted both of those devices

250
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:42,719
The Bulb Has Its Own standby generator something in accurately named the uninterruptible power supply it's on

251
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:45,535
Doubt suddenly in the middle of the night in May of 2013

252
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,559
And when it did

253
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,095
The light bulb went dark

254
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,375
Steve told me that

255
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,399
When it happened

256
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:56,287
People around the world who happened to be watching the webcam at that point saw the bull blink out

257
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,615
And started calling or emailing him

258
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,895
Panic

259
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,943
You know we're just in disbelief

260
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:09,599
The bulb was out for 9 hours and 42 minutes before someone was finally able to get over to the firehouse and Rec

261
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,879
Make up an extension cord

262
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,439
What was turn back on Steve side

263
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,231
Everyone swore

264
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,511

Bongs and chatter of our devices

273
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:40,735
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

274
