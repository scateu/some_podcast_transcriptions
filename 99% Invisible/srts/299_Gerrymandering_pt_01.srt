This is 99% invisible

22
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:08,864
I'm Roman Mars

23
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,032
We wanted to do a story about gerrymandering for years

24
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:18,080
Once you take it as a given

25
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:20,896
We want to live in a representative democracy

26
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:24,480
The next question becomes how are we best represent it

27
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:26,784
We need to divide ourselves into groups

28
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:29,344
From what basis should the lines be drawn

29
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:32,160
Basic geography is a place to start

30
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:36,768
But there are always exceptions and nuances that make defining voting districts

31
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,584
Solium on Geographic boundaries problematic

32
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:41,888
I think of this as a design problem

33
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,704
Maybe the most important design problem of democracy

34
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:51,104
Our friends over at 5:38 recently drove deep into this topic with a six-part series that examines gerrymandering

35
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,152
In different states around the country

36
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:53,920
It's called

37
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,456
The gerrymandering project

38
00:01:56,224 --> 00:02:01,088
It turns out each state that they profile is dealing with representation and gerrymandering differently

39
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,744
The states are really acting as the Laboratories of democracy that US Supreme Court Justice Brandeis said they were

40
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:10,816
We're going to spend the whole episode this week

41
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:14,400
Flooring that series and playing scenes from four different episodes

42
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:17,216
About gerrymandering in four different states

43
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:20,800
Our guide along the way will be the host of the gerrymandering project

44
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,592
And producer at 5:38

45
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,360
Galen druke

46
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,896
Thank you for being here going

47
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,432
Hey Robin thanks for having me

48
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,248
So this might seem like an obvious question but

49
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:31,552
Just laid out for us what is gerrymandering

50
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:34,368
Gerrymandering at its most basic is

51
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:38,208
Drawing district lines to achieve a specific

52
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:38,976
Golf

53
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:40,256
I think the most

54
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:44,352
Common form of gerrymandering that people are familiar with

55
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,912
Partisan gerrymandering which would be

56
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:53,568
Drawing lines in a way that Advantage One party over another but you could also draw lines to protect income

57
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:56,384
Cummins or you could racially gerrymandered

58
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,944
Dilute minorities voting power

59
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,832
So there's more than one kind of gerrymandering but at its core it's just manipulating lines with a goal

60
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,624
To implicit

61
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,392
In

62
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,928
The idea that

63
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:11,488
A gerrymandered district is manipulated

64
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:17,888
Is that there's some natural way that a district should be drawn and that doesn't seem like it's running how do you really determine

65
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,936
Natural state of a district is

66
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,472
Yes you're right

67
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,776
There is no redistricting plan

68
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:24,544
That is

69
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:28,896
Blessed by the grace of God you know there are not Rivers

70
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:31,456
Streams mountains and Reed Ithaca

71
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:36,832
Often times people will just refer to something as gerrymandered when they don't like

72
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,880
The result or if it looks

73
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,928
And who decides how District

74
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:41,696
Rescheduling

75
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,464
General Lee

76
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:45,536
For the most part state legislators

77
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,840
Come up with maps that have been approved

78
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,632
By State Governor

79
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:50,912
And

80
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:56,288
In some cases states have overhauled the process to give the power to an independent Commission

81
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:58,080
But for the most part at State gov

82
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:02,432
The party in control can achieve

83
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:05,504
An advantage over the party out of control

84
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,808
Is my packing and cracking their voters

85
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,112
Which would mean in some instances

86
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:13,440
Putting a lot of that party's voters in one dip

87
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:16,000
So is to make them waste a bunch of there

88
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:16,768
Because

89
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:19,839
Theoretically any vote over 51%

90
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:22,655
Would be a wasted vote it's not helping to elect

91
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,959
And then on the other hand you have

92
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,495
Cracking which would be

93
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:30,847
Dividing up that parties voters so that they can't reach

94
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,127
51%

95
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,407
In any one District

96
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,711
Forcing them to waste votes in another

97
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:43,903
So in the 538 Series game looked at four different states that are either currently dealing with or have recently

98
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,951
With the question of gerrymandering

99
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:49,279
Tape and talk a little bit about each of those States

100
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:51,071
We'll start with Wisconsin

101
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:57,471
So just a little background Wisconsin Republicans one unified control of the state government

102
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:01,567
This was a particularly big deal because it happened to be a redistricting here

103
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:07,967
It was the first time in decades that a single party and had total control of the state government as the state read

104
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:09,503
Andrew is political maps

105
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:12,319
Republicans took advantage

106
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:14,623
They drew maps that Democrats allege

107
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,439
Are very favorable to Republican candidates

108
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:21,023
This obviously didn't sit well with the Democrats and they filed suit

109
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:27,679
For a long time anti-gerrymandering activists have been trying to find cases that they could bring before the spring

110
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:31,775
Court to try to get a ruling that this kind of political manipulation

111
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,311
Is unconstitutional

112
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:36,383
Violates either the First Amendment or the 14th Amendment

113
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:39,967
And one civil rights lawyer in particular a man named Peter oral

114
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:43,551
Started digging into the Wisconsin case and uncovering details

115
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:47,391
He found out that Republicans had drawn these maps in a secret office

116
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:53,023
And that Republican lawmakers had signed secrecy agreements not to discuss the shape of the new districts

117
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:58,143
The Earl didn't know the extent to which Republicans have gone to secure a partisan advantage

118
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,191
Will it Galen take it from here

119
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,983
Earl and his partner

120
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:05,055
Still didn't have a full picture of how the maps were drawn

121
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07,359
A detail that would be key to their case

122
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,663
Should I continue to dig deeper

123
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,967
And I noticed the email records from some people

124
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,551
Didn't match the email records from the people they were communicating

125
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,367
And that raise suspicions and we began to

126
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:20,415
Demand more and more information

127
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:25,023
And the court finally ordered them to turn over that hard drive so we can friends see if we look at

128
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,583
So the attorneys hired a forensic Examiner

129
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,375
He was able to determine that

130
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,423
Hundreds of thousands of documents have been deleted

131
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,703
A wiping soft

132
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:37,823
Prior to that hard drives being turned over to us but they were able to uncover the deleted.

133
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,871
Including a number of spreadsheets

134
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:44,735
And those spreadsheets are what really told the story we were able to see every iteration of the mat

135
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,783
As they went from the Baseline

136
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,575
To the man that they finally adopt

137
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:54,719
The map drawers used years of partisan voting data to design maps that strongly favored Republic

138
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:58,047
We found out that there was a professor by the name of Keith

139
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,607
Daddy from the University of Oklahoma

140
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,911
Who have been hired by the Republicans

141
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,239
To develop a very sophisticated multivariate

142
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:09,055
Regression analysis of partisan performance

143
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:11,359
Based on on boats

144
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,895
In the Assembly districts

145
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:16,479
From 2006-2008 mm

146
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,247
10

147
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,527
And they actually

148
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,087
Downloaded this proxy

149
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,111
Into the

150
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,671
Software that they were using to draw the maps

151
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:30,815
So when the man throws moved the lines on the software they could see how it affected the partisan lean of the district

152
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:31,839
In real time

153
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:35,679
The three Republicans who were responsible for drawing these Maps

154
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,727
Declined to be interviewed on the record

155
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:38,495
And then

156
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:43,871
They think they kept upping the ante and how many republican seats they were guaranteed

157
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:48,223
The map that ultimately came up with was designed to elect Republicans

158
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:54,623
259 of the 99 assembly seats with just 49% of the vote

159
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,671
With a minority of the Statewide vote

160
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,975
They had accounted for in effect

161
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:04,607
The largest swings between Democratic turnout and Republican turnout

162
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,399
During the preceding decade

163
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:11,007
The plaintiffs are now presenting those spreadsheets to the Supreme Court

164
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,799
As evidence that the Republicans

165
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,847
Set out to disadvantaged Democrat

166
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:20,991
The moment that we realize this was like it was like I was Eureka moment and the rage they anger

167
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,527
That I felt

168
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,319
The hours

169
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,087
Bat

170
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:25,855
These

171
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:26,623
People

172
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,719
Would Commit This level of a crime against the Democratic process was

173
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,999
Which is astounding

174
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,791
At that point

175
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,095
We decided we were going to do something about

176
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,399
I mean the sound

177
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,447
Completely pernicious and

178
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,215
COTA bus

179
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:47,871
What is the defense against that's like what is the actual argument that can be made is this a smoking gun

180
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,919
So the most blunt argument

181
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:52,991
That Wisconsin Republicans will make is that

182
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:56,063
Partisan gerrymandering isn't illegal

183
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,623
State legislators have been drawing Maps

184
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,463
That Advantage One party over another for like over a hundred

185
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,231
Year

186
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,255
And so

187
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,303
They're basically saying

188
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,583
This is a bit

189
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,679
Hypocritical you know why are Democrats all of a sudden outraged about

190
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:15,007
Partisan gerrymandering after they've been doing it for years

191
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:15,775
Themselves

192
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:19,103
Democrats in the case will respond and say you know this is

193
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,663
Civil rights issue when it's gotten so far out of hand

194
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,455
That the Supreme Court does

195
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,991
Finally need to step in

196
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,271
And

197
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,575
Then the Republicans will say

198
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,879
Okay if the Supreme Court is going

199
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:31,647
Stop in

200
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:35,487
Then you have to have a very clear standard of what is and is not

201
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,023
Fair in drawing Maps

202
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:41,375
And ultimately that's a really really difficult line to

203
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:43,935
Because

204
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:44,959
Judicial

205
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:47,519
Branch doesn't really want to get involved with drawing

206
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,311
Every line on a map

207
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:53,663
I mean you could see why they be reticent to do this but this is up to legislature

208
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:56,991
For sure I mean for conservatives on the court who

209
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,271
Strongly believe

210
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:00,575
That judicial overreach is

211
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:03,647
A threat to in our governmental system

212
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,951
Yes. That would be terrible if

213
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,487
Courts around the country

214
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,255
Basically

215
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:10,559
Drawing maps that were supposed to be drawn

216
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,327
By mistake

217
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,631
So if they are going to wade into the

218
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:17,471
Issue they want to be able to have like a very clear standard

219
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:21,055
For what is and is not fair and then get themselves back out of the

220
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,847
The process so that State Legislature

221
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,871
And follow the

222
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,639
Guidelines

223
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:27,711
Anthony Kennedy has made it clear in the past

224
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,479
That

225
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,759
He does not like parties

226
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:30,527
Gerrymandering

227
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,807
Keys Radisson however

228
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,855
Awaiting into this for that exactly

229
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,159
He doesn't want chords across the country

230
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,183
Repeatedly

231
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:39,231
Getting involved in this issue and dry mouth

232
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:44,095
It's a weird is that Wisconsin situation currently stand

233
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,375
We are waiting for

234
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,935
The Supreme Court heard oral arguments

235
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,215
Last fall

236
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:49,983
And

237
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,775
We will have a decision in this case

238
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,543
Baijiu

239
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:57,151
You know the decision in this case could be a pretty big

240
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:00,991
If the Supreme Court sides with the Wisconsin Democrats

241
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,295
That could mean that there's a

242
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,087
Whole lot more

243
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:05,855
Court cases

244
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,647
Following the same model

245
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,183
Saying that

246
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,487
The maps in those states are illegal and need to be

247
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:18,911
So Wisconsin is a pretty obvious example of partisan gerrymandering

248
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:24,031
But now we're going to turn to North Carolina where legislators have drawn lines with race in my

249
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:28,127
The Voting Rights Act has been interpreted over the years to mean that

250
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,919
States need to draw Maps

251
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:34,015
That don't dilute minority voters and allow minority communities

252
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,063
To elect candidates of their choice

253
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,343
North Carolina

254
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:40,415
That meant in the early 1990s Maps were drawn

255
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:44,255
So that certain districts would favor African American candidates

256
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,023
It works

257
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:50,399
North Carolina elected black representatives to the US House for the first time since reconstruction

258
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:53,471
This was a huge success for the African American community

259
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,263
It was also good for another group

260
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,055
North Carolina Republicans

261
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,591
Do understand why

262
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,615
Through this

263
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:02,943
Black North Carolinians overwhelmingly vote democratic

264
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:06,527
My packing these voters into a small number of District

265
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,551
For black candidate

266
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,575
Likely win

267
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:12,927
The legislature also diminish black voting power in other District

268
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:13,695
Around the state

269
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:17,279
Alone Republicans to dominate the overall political landscape

270
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,047
Escape the state

271
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:21,375
Different people in North Carolina have very different opinions about this

272
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:25,471
I want to play some tape now from the North Carolina episode of the gerrymandering project

273
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,495
Illustrate

274
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,543
Super complicated dynamic

275
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,079
I have never

276
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:33,151
Personally been one that think that increasing the numbers

277
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,455
The black caucus

278
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,223
And

279
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,759
Congress for example

280
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,831
Necessarily equated to a plus 4th Ave

281
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:41,599
American commune

282
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:42,623
Derek Smith

283
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:45,183
A political action chair for the state NW

284
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:48,255
They can ensure that African Americans get sent to

285
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:54,911
Legislative bodies and that looks good on Election Day when they can stand up and say look look at what we did for you all we help kitties

286
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:55,679
Eva Clayton

287
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,215
And Mel Watt

288
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:57,983
Into Congress

289
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,263
In the 1990s

290
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,055
But on the whole

291
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,591
The effect was

292
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:05,663
But that was when the state began to shift towards

293
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:09,503
All republican-dominated caucus and that happen all throughout the South

294
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:12,063
He's in favor of African-American voters

295
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,599
Influencing various

296
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:17,183
I've always thought that African-American voices that

297
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,463
Numerous

298
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,767
And loud enough and active

299
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:21,535
And

300
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,583
Many different places

301
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,375
Lynn to the likelihood

302
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,911
Policy decision

303
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,959
Will consider after

304
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:30,495
Americans more than they do

305
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,567
And white and black Democrat

306
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:36,895
Can form coalitions to elect minority candidates

307
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:40,223
More easily than they were once able to in North Carolina

308
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,015
Smith Point store famous exam

309
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:44,575
President Obama is a classic example of

310
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:47,903
If we can fuse together on a common interest with your face

311
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,695
The governance for the good of all

312
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,999
Doesn't matter your race

313
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,815
Reggie Weaver of common cause tends to agree

314
00:13:55,071 --> 00:14:00,703
An argument has been made that yes it in in justification of racially packed districts that

315
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,775
Minority candidates would would not be elected any other way

316
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:06,079
There may be some truth that I don't know

317
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,127
To me then the answer

318
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:08,895
Isn't

319
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,431
2Pac districts in weekend

320
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,967
The minority voice in other

321
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:12,735
Area

322
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:15,295
He says that that won't get at the root of the problem

323
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:18,111
What I personally more incident as you know why is it

324
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,391
Yeah why is it that

325
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,951
Kaiser Permanente me I'm going to have a weaker chance in a

326
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:22,719
Purely

327
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:28,863
Better District just along parts of Asia why is it nothing but that gets too deep requested that we are yet resolved

328
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,655
I'm at the country about

329
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,191
I'm about race

330
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:37,311
Less emphasis should be put on race when drawing District

331
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,847
Is not a universal

332
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,639
Again here spam stop

333
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:43,199
Who worked in greensboro's 12th District office

334
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:46,271
What it was first one by Mel watt in 1990

335
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:52,927
Until the playing Ground is level in America than we will always need at Menard to test

336
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:56,255
Insofar the playing Ground is not level

337
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:59,583
Stubbs is unsure that African-American lawmakers

338
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,863
Will maintain their rank

339
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,399
If these districts are dismantle

340
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,935
And academic research

341
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,983
Suggested that could cause a ripple

342
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,543
The presence of minority lawmakers

343
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,847
Can boost voter turnout among minorities

344
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:13,407
You can also increase their trust and engagement

345
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,175
With politicians

346
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,199
One study

347
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:19,807
Done after Democrats began drawing down the black populations in minority districts

348
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:20,831
Mm

349
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,879
Show that Minority members of Congress

350
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:29,279
Are more likely to advocate for their communities priorities than white members of the same party

351
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:31,839
Realize most of those Monarda districts

352
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:35,679
Were created after the 1990 census

353
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,703
When they were

354
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,799
Hardly any minority representation across the country in

355
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,079
In Congress

356
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:46,175
So even though they're safe now you have to understand

357
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,711
Why they were created

358
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,783
Case in point

359
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,319
Visit the Civil Rights Museum

360
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,087
Ingrained

361
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:59,487
My name is Cassandra Williams and I would like to personally welcome you to the international civil rights Center

362
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,767
And Museum

363
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,839
When you arrive at the Voting Rights Act section of the news

364
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,887
There's a striking installment

365
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:12,287
Now we look at this list of the wall here you see African-Americans elected to federal or state

366
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,079
Patricia Locke

00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,871
It's a Florida ceiling list

368
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:18,175
Showing the date African-American lawmaker

369
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:21,247
Elected from each state of North Carolina

370
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:22,783
In the Years

371
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,319
Right after

372
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:26,623
The Civil War during Reconstruction

373
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:30,463
We see that there were four black men elected

374
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,231
2

375
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,791
Represent the state of North Carolina in the house

376
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,815
House of Representatives

377
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,351
But then

378
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,375
We see

379
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:39,167
About a hundred year Gap

380
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,215
Before mrs. Clayton

381
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,239
With select

382
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,263
Did you represent

383
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:45,055
North Carolina

384
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,591
In state after state

385
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,615
Across the South

386
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,407
That 100-year Gap

387
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,943
Persistent

388
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:51,967
Same Gap

389
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:54,015
In South Carolina

390
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:56,063
We said in Alabama

391
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,087
Florida

392
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,111
We say

393
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:01,695
1871 and then another hundred-year Gap

394
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:04,511
Is there we can see it in Georgia

395
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,791
In Louisiana

396
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,911
From 1875 and then not until 1991

397
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,191
In many states

398
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,727
Batgap only ends

399
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,263
In the early 1990s

400
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:17,567
When states were forced to draw

401
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,847
Majority-black District

402
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,431
So it's easy to understand

403
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,991
Why the conversation about majority-minority

404
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,527
Can be so contentious

405
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,295
Unemotional

406
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:30,111
If the law favors unpacking minardi District

407
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:34,207
Could become more difficult to ensure that African-Americans are elected

408
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,231
The same rates

409
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:35,999
But they happen

410
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:40,863
Example North Carolina State Legislative map is currently being redrawn

411
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:43,167
Unpack the majority-minority desk

412
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,471
The chair of the legislative black caucus

413
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,495
Angela Bryan

414
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,799
Is likely to lose her seat in the reader

415
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,591
Actually regret

416
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,663
I losing my district and the coalition

417
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,479
That have been formed in that District I regret that

418
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:59,551
At the same time the gerrymandering is

419
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:00,575
Luther Barnes

420
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,111
She says it's for the best

421
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,391
I'm convinced

422
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:08,767
That even if people like me lose out to have a firm foundation

423
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:13,887
Upon which we are doing this redistricting we will be better off over time

424
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,263
This is the episode that most

425
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:24,639
Broke my brain I think I don't know you putting it together but there is so many

426
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,711
Interest that have to be balanced in so many interests that I

427
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:29,247
Really support

428
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,039
Want to have happen

429
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,831
I know it's it's

430
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,111
Crazy

431
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:37,183
How many values you have to juggle to draw these lines

432
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,975
Yeah and I mean

433
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,511
This is really

434
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,279
Even just

435
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:44,095
The tip of the iceberg when it comes to

436
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:45,631
All of the interest

437
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:47,167
That you have to consider

438
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,239
Drawing a district map

439
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:54,591
This is a really difficult conversation especially for Democrats to have

440
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:55,871
Because on one hand

441
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:59,711
You know they want to have the best shot at winning majorities that they

442
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,479
Can

443
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:01,759
On the other hand

444
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:05,855
If we are going to no longer have majority-minority

445
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,439
That might involve amending the Voting Rights Act

446
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:12,767
And that's a really difficult conversation for

447
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:15,071
Because as a platform Democrats

448
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,351
Support

449
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:19,167
Enhancing the voting power of minorities

450
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:25,823
Can we talk about this in value of competitiveness and and that brings us to the State of Arizona in twenty eleven

451
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:29,407
They tried to give power to draw Maps over to an independent Commission

452
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,759
And a big part of the goal was to increase competitiveness and elections

453
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:38,879
Can you describe what the thinking was an end and why they create commission to preference this button

454
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:39,647
Guitar value

455
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:42,975
Yes if you ask Americans they love competitive

456
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,279
You know of course from their eyes

457
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:51,935
Complicated but in general competition is a Americans value like what's more

458
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,215
Competition

459
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,751
In mm

460
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:56,031
Arizona

461
00:19:56,287 --> 00:20:00,127
Through a ballot initiative meeting that just Arizona's all across the state

462
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:01,407
Voted on this

463
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:04,223
Single item saying do you want to create

464
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:06,783
An independent commission to draw the state map

465
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,831
Take the power away from the state line

466
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:10,367
And

467
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,903
Arizonans voted yes

468
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:18,303
And so for the first time in 2001 an independent commission through the maps and then for a second time in mm

469
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,071
11

470
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,607
An independent Commission

471
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,423
And in doing this you know

472
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,191
The

473
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,215
Drafters of

474
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,007
Ballot initiative

475
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:32,127
Had to basically say these are the criteria for drawing the maps that this independent Commission

476
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,151
Have to follow

477
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,711
And uniquely in Arizona

478
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:38,271
One of those criteria was competitive

479
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,831
In fact it's the only state in the country that

480
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:41,599
Wires

481
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:45,183
An independent commission or even lawmakers for that matter

482
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,463
To try to make this right

483
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,231
What's compatible

484
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:49,279
Invite competitive you mean that

485
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:51,071
I depending on

486
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,351
The candidate

487
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,423
Maybe I don't know

488
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:01,567
Equally likely that a Democrat or Republican to be elected I mean I need to find competitiveness in the kind of

489
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:03,103
Monkey world

490
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:06,687
538 we Define competitiveness

491
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:07,455
As

492
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:11,807
Within five points of the national average in a presidential election

493
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:12,831
Show

494
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:15,391
Basically a district where you would expect

495
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:17,696
And so

496
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,464
VSCO

497
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,792
Very controversial very fast can you tell us what happened

498
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:24,864
So at the time in 2011

499
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,912
Republicans control

500
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:29,728
Both chambers of the State Legislature

501
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:30,496
And

502
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:33,824
You know they were not all that interested in enhancing

503
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,104
Competition because it happen

504
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,968
Mission would mean probably a better chance that Democrats will take some of those seats away from them

505
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:42,016
Then on the other hand of course Democrats

506
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:43,040
Water copter

507
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,088
At the heart of this was

508
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,904
One woman who was the independent charity

509
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,440
The commissioners

510
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:53,536
Five people to Republicans to Democrats and one independent chair who ends up being

511
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,560
The tiebreaker

512
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:58,912
If you listen to the episode you can decide for yourself whether or not that's a good song

513
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:04,032
Ultimately this independent chair calling Mathis

514
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:04,800
Became

515
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,336
The focal point of

516
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,616
All of this

517
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,640
Disagreement

518
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:11,456
Between the two parties over how the district should be drawn

519
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,736
And

520
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:13,504
Things actually

521
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,040
What kind of scary for her

522
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:19,392
Okay so we're going to play a little bit of the Arizona episode of the gerrymandering project

523
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:22,464
Which deals with these maps that were drawn to increase

524
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,488
Competitiveness

525
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,048
And this thing starts in a public hearing

526
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:29,632
About the map drawing company that the independent commission chose

527
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:31,424
Let's all rise for the Pledge of Allegiance

528
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:34,240
I pledge allegiance

529
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,264
To the flag

530
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,568
Of the United States of America

531
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,872
I want to see right now for give me

532
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:41,408
I'm not going to use nice

533
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:46,016
Because I am so upset over this situation

534
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:49,344
The best way to describe it I think is it was like a beehive

535
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,416
All kinds of people were there and

536
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:55,744
The way they were looking at me I could just tell

537
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,024
They weren't happy with me

538
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,560
That's calling Mathis

539
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:00,864
It was June 30th 2011

540
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,960
And she was chairing a public hearing of Arizona's independent redistricting

541
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,336
The group of citizens tasked with redrawing Arizona's political boundaries

542
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,360
It was a packed

543
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,128
Room

544
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:18,528
Standing room only my husband actually was there and he went and stood in the doorway he was concerned frankly for

545
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,576
The safety of all of us

546
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:21,600
Cuz it just seemed

547
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:24,416
Like a heightened level of in

548
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,304
The commission had just decided which mapping company should draw Arizona's new District Lines

549
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,120
What are the boundaries that help determine who you vote for

550
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,400
And Republicans

551
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,752
So slanted have your votes been against Republican

552
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:41,568
If there is no question what the goal this commission is

553
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,664
But what can we expect when the independent is not really an independent

554
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,712
She's married to an activist Democrat

555
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,016
One after another each of the

556
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:53,088
People who filled out the request to speak forms came up and

557
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:55,904
Prettymuch berated me mostly

558
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,184
There are many

559
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,464
Mapping company

560
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,232
He's out there

561
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:02,048
Sorry I am

562
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:02,816
So upset

563
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:05,376
That you could have picked

564
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,680
That are non

565
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:08,704
Who article

566
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:11,008
Why didn't you

567
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:15,104
The mapping company had done work for Democratic campaign

568
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,152
And Republicans blamed math

569
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,944
Choosing a bias company

570
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,064
After attending the last two meetings my feelings are that this is a predetermined process

571
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,600
With one agenda

572
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:29,440
Remap Arizona to improve Democratic representation

573
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:31,232
What were you saw

574
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:37,632
After the the mapping insulting was appointed was a lot of pitchforks and torches here in Arizona

575
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:40,448
Because I think the public really knew at that point

576
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:42,496
That the mapping wasn't going to be

577
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:44,800
You know I told this commission was

578
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:45,568
Supposed to be

579
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,848
Non

580
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:47,616
Partisan

581
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:51,200
Damn it you can't get any more parts

582
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:53,504
It was scary

583
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:57,088
A few weeks after the mapping consultant decision

584
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:59,648
A sitting state senator

585
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,440
Had suggested

586
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:03,488
Reported in the press that

587
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:06,048
There was a Target on me

588
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,072
And

589
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,888
And that was scary

590
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,448
He said quote the gun is loaded

591
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:14,240
And it's just figuring out what

592
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:16,032
2 pointed out and when to pull the trigger

593
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:18,080
According to the yellow sheet report

594
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:20,128
A political newsletter in Arizona

595
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,664
Antinori told the Press

596
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,224
The time that he uses military analogies

597
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,552
Because he was in the military and that he wasn't targeting anyone

598
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:30,368
When people talk about targets and guns it's

599
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,392
Not

600
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,416
Something to mess with

601
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:34,464
Only six months earlier

602
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:36,512
Malthus's congressional representative

603
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,048
Had been shot to the Head

604
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:38,816
At Point Blank

605
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:41,120
I was in Tucson when it happened

606
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,400
And

607
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,960
Anybody who was in Tucson

608
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:48,288
Remember that day very well because it was

609
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,056
Was a dark

610
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,640
During a constituent meeting at a grocery store in Tucson

611
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,176
Congresswoman Gabby Gifford

612
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,200
I need to another p

613
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,224
Rashad

614
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,248
Sex diet

615
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,528
That unfortunate

616
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:02,624
Awfulness occurred in January of 2011

617
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:05,952
And I was sworn in March of 2011

618
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,256
And so this was that summer

619
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,560
After that and

620
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:14,400
It's just

621
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,752
It's hard to talk about it

622
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:21,312
Mathis says she and her husband bought plywood

623
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,080
What at Home Depot

624
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,616
And boarded up their bedroom

625
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:24,896
And I

626
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,432
Ended up

627
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:30,784
Kind of making our bedroom at least a safe Zone because we just felt

628
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:31,808
Kind of like

629
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,856
It'd be nice to be able to sleep at night

630
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:34,880
And not worried

631
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:36,416
Somebody was

632
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,976
Looking in the windows are going to do anything

633
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,512
They also went to the

634
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:41,280
Justice

635
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:44,352
In Washington we talked to some folks at doj and

636
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,376
And they had

637
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:47,168
FBI person sit in

638
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,472
Their safety concerns would continue for years

639
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:53,312
In 2012 with litigation still ongoing

640
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,336
Their house was

641
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,384
A year after that

642
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,408
The commission's office

643
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,176
It was broken into

644
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:00,224
And the computers of all the commissioners

645
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:00,992
Stolen

646
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,016
We don't know

647
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:04,064
If it was related to redistricting

648
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:04,832
But

649
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,880
That did occur

650
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,416
NASA says her mother

651
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,464
But I never

652
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,512
Was going to quit I just knew that if

653
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,280
If you quit

654
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:16,864
You're giving into that's exactly what they want you to do

655
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:19,936
Really intense

656
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:22,240
So what happened with these

657
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:25,056
New competitive maps that were drawn in Arizona

658
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,848
You know the story

659
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,128
It ends up being

660
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,408
The most

661
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,432
Intense

662
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,968
I think redistricting

663
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:32,736
Process

664
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:34,272
Probably the country is

665
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,832
The governor and legislature impeached

666
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:39,904
Mathis then she gets reinstated ultimately

667
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,672
Babe

668
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,696
Pasta Maps

669
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:43,232
And

670
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:45,536
They did end up enhancing

671
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:46,560
Competition

672
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:48,096
In Arizona

673
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:51,936
During the 2016 election there was one District

674
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:53,984
Arizona

675
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,008
That voted

676
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:55,776
4

677
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:59,360
Hillary Clinton for president and voted for a republican in the house

678
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,408
And there was another District that voted for

679
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,944
For Trump as president and voted

680
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:03,968
A Democrat

681
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:06,784
That's pretty rare in

682
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:11,392
Dehydrate these days where we have a very polarized political environment and generally

683
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:12,672
Democrats and Republican

684
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:15,232
Live together so it's very rare that we

685
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,768
See those kinds of voting

686
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,792
So yes

687
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:20,352
The districts that they set out to create

688
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:21,888
As competitive Def

689
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,168
Do function outcome

690
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:24,960
But of course

691
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:28,288
The path to getting there was a very acrimony

692
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:31,104
I mean

693
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:33,664
When you went there and

694
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:38,784
Did this story I mean what did you think of competitiveness as of value when it comes to drawing

695
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:40,576
Soup

696
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:41,856
It's a complicated one

697
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:43,392
When we look in American polity

698
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:45,952
Text because you know we say we want competitive

699
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:47,232
Shenzhen

700
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:51,840
Inferi competitive elections make lawmakers more accountable right

701
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:57,728
If you're basically guaranteed to win your primary when your general election then you're not

702
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:58,496
.

703
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,520
Accountable and

704
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:03,616
If voters don't have options then do you really live in a representative democracy

705
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,920
At the same time

706
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:07,200
Patterns in

707
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:09,760
The ways that American voters have

708
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:10,528
Clustered

709
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:13,600
Make competitive difference really hard to achieve

710
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:16,672
Republicans and Democrats don't live in similar areas

711
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:18,976
And less and less American voters

712
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,256
Switch back and forth

713
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,280
Between parties

714
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,048
From want to watch

715
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,096
And so

716
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:24,864
You

717
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,144
Really have to kind of

718
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:28,960
Work at creating competitive

719
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:29,984
Districts

720
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:30,752
It's okay

721
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:33,568
The last date you covered the gerrymandering project

722
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,592
Is California

723
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:38,688
Lake Arizona they also started an independent commission to redraw District

724
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,248
But they did it for a slightly different reason

725
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,040
Here's a clip from that episode

726
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:45,600
What caused California to creative

727
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:49,440
Did not have to do with the same old partisan type of Jerry

728
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:56,096
It is much more to do with protecting thing Compass the way they draw the district lines is to protect the incompetence

729
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:56,864
That's

730
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,656
Well I'll let him introduce

731
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:02,240
I'm Arnold Schwarzenegger and it was governor

732
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:05,824
Of the State of California from 2003 to 2011

733
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:08,384
He back redistricting reform as governor

734
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,432
And has since continued to advocate for

735
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:12,480
I'm a big believer that you must

736
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:14,528
Terminate gerrymandering

737
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:15,296
America

738
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:20,416
When you look at the district lines the way they're drunk they make absolutely no sense to anyone

739
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,952
But it is all designed

740
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:24,512
To keep Democrats separate from Republican

741
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:26,048
Best strategy for drawing

742
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:30,656
Created an environment in which of lawmakers felt entitled to groups of Voters

743
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,192
They saw it's beneficial to

744
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,032
Without much regard for existing communities or geography

745
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:40,896
In Los Angeles for instance Koreatown was split into three or four districts

746
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:44,224
The Filipino American Community was split into

747
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,528
Kathy Fang is the national redistricting

748
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,320
Of the nonpartisan group

749
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:49,088
Common cause

750
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,136
She's also its executive director in

751
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:51,904
California

752
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:54,208
During the 2001 round of rediff

753
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,256
She testified to the legislature

754
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:58,560
About how the line should be drawn

755
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:00,352
To keep Asian communities hole

756
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:06,752
As we traveled up and down the state we were hearing these stories about people feeling for the first time the

757
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:07,520
Prince of

758
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:09,312
Talking about their communities

759
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,848
Fences during the process

760
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,408
She got a call from a democratic assembly /

761
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,200
I had received a phone call

762
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:18,528
From a legislator from San Francisco

763
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:21,344
And it was my first time talking to

764
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,648
You know assembly person or a senator

765
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:26,976
And as a Young attorney it was quite exciting to receive this phone call

766
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:28,000
And

767
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:29,792
This person called me

768
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:32,096
To essentially tell me Kathy

769
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:34,912
You're not going to put another in Asian in my desk

770
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,984
I asked her to identify the lawmaker

771
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,264
Carole migden

772
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:42,080
She's out of office now so I guess I can say her name

773
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:43,616
It brought me to tears

774
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:45,920
Because it was a realization that

775
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,712
We still have

776
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:53,600
A lot of racism in this country and even in a very blue State like California people

777
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:55,904
Come to power with a sense of entitlement

778
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:58,208
That allows them to

779
00:31:58,464 --> 00:31:58,976
Make

780
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:02,304
Decisions about excluding People based on race

781
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,608
In order to protect their own seats

782
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:05,888
When reached for comment

783
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:08,704
Carole migden said she did not recall the conversation

784
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:12,800
Any idea it was clear that the legislature was not interested

785
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,592
Did in considering public testimony

786
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:15,360
Like fat

787
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:18,688
What we found out was it after 4 months of

788
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:19,712
Public hearings

789
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,552
The legislature went behind closed doors and Drew the line

790
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,320
That

791
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,856
They are always intended to

792
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:30,464
The California Senate passed the maps on September 12th 2001

793
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,768
And the assembly passed them a day later

794
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:35,840
While the rest of the nation was rocking from

795
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:41,216
This terrorist attack but it happened and there was essentially a media blackout

796
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:43,520
Quite honestly there was

797
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:46,848
A real moment of reflection about

798
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,408
Whether or not our democracy is functioning

799
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,992
Their incumbent protection plan was overwhelmingly

800
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:53,760
Successful

801
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:56,320
The deal that was passed

802
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:57,600
In 2001

803
00:32:58,112 --> 00:33:00,672
Made California's map almost impervious to change

804
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,720
Only one incumbent

805
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:05,280
Lost re-election in a general election

806
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:07,328
Between 2002 and 2010

807
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:11,168
California has insulated itself from the political volatility

808
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:12,192
Facing the rest

809
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:12,960
Country

810
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:15,264
Few of the races were even close

811
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,312
Ua265

812
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:19,616
US House races in California

813
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:23,968
Only 14 of them were decided by less than 10 points

814
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:25,504
Just 5%

815
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,808
California's Congressional elections

816
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:28,832
Competitive

817
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:31,904
I always said you know that the Soviet politburo

818
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:33,952
Edward changeover

819
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:36,256
Then our system here in California

820
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:43,168
So what happened in California like how did they combat this problem of income and see them

821
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:44,704
Incumbency bias

822
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:46,752
Californians

823
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:51,104
In the. From you know the early 2000s to 2010

824
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:54,944
As you may remember in California we're very very

825
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:55,968
Chat with the state

826
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,808
I mean at a certain point I think their approval rating

827
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:00,832
Was

828
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:02,368
At 10%

829
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,392
And

830
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,672
So you had

831
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:07,488
Governor Schwarzenegger and activist

832
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:09,280
Really agitated

833
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:10,560
Against the law

834
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:12,864
And so between

835
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,888
Common cause

836
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:16,448
The organization

837
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:19,520
And other non-partisan and partisan group

838
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:21,824
As well as the governor that kind of

839
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,616
Got together and bats

840
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:24,640
A again

841
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,688
A ballot initiative like in Arizona

842
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:29,504
To take the power of

843
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,040
Drawing these different Maps

844
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,832
Away from the state legislature

845
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:34,624
And to give it to an

846
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:39,488
And so what is the basis that they that they independent commission Drew their Maps

847
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,512
Show

848
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:46,144
Where is in Arizona we had one of the criteria was competitiveness that was not the case in

849
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,984
One of the main criteria in California

850
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:50,752
Was

851
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:54,336
To respect and Empower communities of Interest

852
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:56,128
And that relates to

853
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:59,200
Kathy fangs experience with the Asian American community in Kyle

854
00:34:59,456 --> 00:34:59,968
California

855
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:04,320
And the way that she saw them basically being disregarded in favor of it

856
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,344
Combat zone

857
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,624
Electoral priority

858
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:08,928
And so what the

859
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:12,512
Independent commission did in California was a traveled around the state

860
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:16,096
And listen to members of

861
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:18,144
Communities basically say

862
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,704
Basically Define their own communities of

863
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,264
That could range

864
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:25,824
Anywhere from Koreatown

865
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:29,408
To get a one example is

866
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:34,016
You know a group of people who has horses in LA or

867
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:38,368
You know one example was even like the soundproofing Community around LAX

868
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:40,160
The LAX airport in Los

869
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:46,304
That's interesting Enzo how successful were they anyway what did they what did these Maps end up

870
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,400
Resulting in one of the complications with this

871
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:57,056
Way of mapping is that it's hard to tell whether or not people are being sincere about what they can say

872
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:58,592
Center as their communities of Interest

873
00:35:58,848 --> 00:35:59,360
Like

874
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:02,432
Political consultant came in and

875
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:04,992
Basically organized people around

876
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:09,856
Communities that may have been disingenuous in an attempt to influence

877
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:12,672
The map drawing process for partisan reasons

878
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:16,512
There is good reason to believe that they were successful in some

879
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:17,280
Cases

880
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,560
Ultimately though

881
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:19,840
I think California was

882
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,376
Pretty successful

883
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,424
At appeasing

884
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,752
Both sides of the aisle and getting a relatively

885
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:29,568
Fair map I mean if you look at different

886
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,872
Statistical analyses of

887
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:34,432
The vote percentage compared with the seat chair

888
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:38,016
California's maps are pretty fair to Democrats

889
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:45,696
So what are your takeaways from all this reporting you got you were steeped in this for months and months and months and what did you come away with

890
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:47,744
Indeed I was

891
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,024
Trophy

892
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:51,584
If we look at the four different examples

893
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:52,864
That we've just

894
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:55,424
First what you don't realize is

895
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,192
That

896
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:58,240
All of these different priorities so

897
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,520
One being

898
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:01,312
Fairness between the two parties

899
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,104
To being

900
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,408
Fairness in representing minorities

901
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:08,480
Three being competitiveness in elections

902
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:10,784
And for being respectful of

903
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,320
Communities as they exist

904
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:13,088
On a map

905
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:16,928
You'll start to understand that these things do Contour

906
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:19,232
Star situations in which

907
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:23,840
Enhancing the opportunity for minority candidate to get elected

908
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:25,120
Could pain

909
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,936
Republicans add an advantage electoral

910
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,288
So ultimately the people who draw Maps

911
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,568
How to make

912
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:34,336
Difficult

913
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:35,360
Value chart

914
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,176
Often times the people who draw Maps only care about part

915
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:40,224
Right and so you know

916
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,784
That's basically the maps the way that maps have been drawn

917
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,552
For a long time

918
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:47,648
Play for going to reform the process you still have to be

919
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:48,928
Off Lease Auto

920
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,280
About the values that you want to prioritize amongst those for

921
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:56,096
And which of these four states do you think

922
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:57,120
Is doing the best job

923
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:00,960
If you look at California that is the place where

924
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:04,032
You will talk to both Republicans and Democrats

925
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,312
To say that

926
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:07,616
The mapping process overall

927
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:08,384
Westfair

928
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:12,224
And you know they're obviously Democrats Republicans who will disagree with that

929
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,272
But it was a rare example

930
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:16,064
In the months that I spent

931
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:16,832
Reporting on this

932
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:20,672
That you did come to some bipartisan

933
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:22,464
Agreement about the success

934
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:25,792
And is this a function of it

935
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:30,400
Being drawn by an independent commission is this what the success really points to

936
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,496
I think that's part oven times Americans distrust

937
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:36,288
Partisan legislators to

938
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:40,384
Put aside their partisanship in order to do what is

939
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:41,408
Quote unquote

940
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:42,176
Fair

941
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:43,712
Obviously

942
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:45,248
The people who wrote

943
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,808
The ballot initiative in California

944
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,856
Looked at some of these

945
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,648
Examples in other states

946
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:53,952
They you know they're already been around everyday

947
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:56,256
In Arizona the other states to look at

948
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:58,048
As well and

949
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:00,608
Think about where other states may have

950
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:01,632
Gone wrong

951
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,704
Try to correct

952
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,240
You know you said that

953
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:09,056
Of the American states are Laboratories

954
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,080
Democracy

955
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,360
And

956
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:13,920
A result of different states

957
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:17,504
Getting to tryout litigate vote for

958
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,552
Yo draw maps how they want to

959
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:22,880
Is that we get to see the results of a whole bunch of different

960
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:29,536
And I do think the people in California were very thoughtful about the way that they wrote the law.

961
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:33,888
So what do you expect will come out of Wisconsin case

962
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:37,728
The million-dollar question

963
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:40,288
Honestly I have no idea

964
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,312
But I can tell you

965
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:44,896
If Wisconsin Democrats win this case you will read in

966
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:48,224
Plenty of newspapers Supreme Court and gerrymandering

967
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:51,296
And I can tell you right now that

968
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:53,088
That will be sick leave

969
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,368
Ally

970
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,648
Because

971
00:39:55,904 --> 00:40:01,280
If the Wisconsin Democrats win What will what it will actually do is start a very long process

972
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:03,584
Determining what ultimately

973
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,888
Is fair when it comes to

974
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:07,680
Partisan advantage

975
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:08,960
In drawing map

976
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:09,728
Right

977
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,032
I mean unless the Supreme Court says

978
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:17,920
You know you have to use this statistical model and has to be within this percentage of baba baba baba blah blah

979
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:20,224
Which I have no reason to

980
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:23,808
Then it's going to start a process

981
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:24,576
Of a

982
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:30,208
A lot of different lawsuits that litigate this in different ways that ultimately try to land on

983
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:31,232
What is fair

984
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:33,280
And you know what it could be

985
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:36,096
We never really land on anything I mean

986
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:40,448
That's what's happening with the Voting Rights Act right now is that we don't have a strong

987
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:41,472
Conception

988
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:44,288
Of what is fair in how much

989
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,056
The cluster

990
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,592
Minority voters together

991
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:47,872
Right

992
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:49,408
That could end up happening

993
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,432
With partisan

994
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,200
Gerrymander

995
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:55,808
And you can say that's all worth it and we need to have that debate and

996
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:56,832
You know

997
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,624
You know

998
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:04,000
We're happy for all the lawyers that are that they're going to be employed for the coming decade

999
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:07,328
Off of all of these lawsuits but it's a conversation we need to have

1000
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:08,096
But you know

1001
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:14,496
Even if the Wisconsin Democrats don't win I don't think there's a conversation about gerrymandering goes away because ever seen even now in

1002
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:15,264
Pennsylvania

1003
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:17,056
There are a lot of different Avenues

1004
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:17,824
Is to litigate this

1005
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:19,360
And so

1006
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:21,408
No matter what the decision is

1007
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,944
In the Wisconsin Supreme

1008
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:26,784
I can promise you that this is going to be a conversation

1009
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:40,608
So why don't we just have computers draw District Lines

1010
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,144
Will Galen hasn't answered

1011
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:43,424
Fabulous

1012
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:46,240
Between the beats

1013
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:48,544
Bongs and chatter of our devices

1014
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,128
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man made sound

1015
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,151
If

1016
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:59,551
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife isn't

1017
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:03,647
Another remedy for all hearing. Voice

1018
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:04,415
Technology

1019
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:05,439
She talked to us

1020
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:07,487
It is a creation of Sonic trash

1021
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:10,559
That's Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

1022
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:14,143
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

1023
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:16,191
To make them more human

1024
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:20,031
Turn the living room lights on

1025
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:21,823
Okay

1026
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:24,383
Dim the living room lights to 50%

1027
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:26,431
Okay

1028
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:32,575
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

1029
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:33,343
Mix

1030
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,879
For a much more natural

1031
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:35,647
Experience

1032
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,439
Turn the living room lights on

1033
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:40,767
Dim the living room lights

1034
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:41,791
50%

1035
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:45,119
We're presenting to

1036
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:49,215
Special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

1037
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:52,031
About how are soundscape is impacting our health

1038
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:54,591
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

1039
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:57,407
Look for them Fridays May 17th and May 24th

1040
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:58,175
Right here

1041
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:04,063
We need to talk about something

1042
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:10,463
Constipation abdominal pain and bloating you tell yourself it's not that bad you take laxatives modify your diet

1043
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:13,279
Thinking about it all the time is frustrating

1044
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:19,679
It doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again and you don't know why

1045
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:25,311
And it may be time to seek out go to oh my God. Info podcast

1046
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:30,431
We can learn more about your symptoms that's oh my God. Info / podcast

1047
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:31,199
Oh my God

1048
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:32,991
Flash podcast

1049
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:38,879
Tequila told me that when the gerrymandering project came out when the biggest questions they got from listeners

1050
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:40,159
News about algorithms

1051
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:41,695
Why not take this

1052
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:43,999
Whole process out of the hands of humans

1053
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:47,839
And just use an algorithm to draw totally random boxes on a map

1054
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:48,863
In some ways

1055
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,399
You could you just

1056
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:55,263
Write new laws saying that we want an algorithm to draw a nice neat shapes

1057
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,031
On a map

1058
00:43:57,055 --> 00:44:00,895
Probably the area where you run into the most trouble is the Voting Rights Act

1059
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:07,295
Which specifically requires that minorities not have their votes diluted enter sometimes

1060
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:08,575
Just drawing Maps

1061
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:10,367
Randomly according to shape

1062
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:13,439
Could potentially violate the Voting Rights Act

1063
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:16,255
On top of that whether or not we're talking about a minority

1064
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,023
Community

1065
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:21,119
Often times people want their community in one District right

1066
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:23,679
If you're going to have a representative you want them to represent

1067
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:24,447
Something

1068
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:27,775
And so if you have an algorithm that draws the map randomly

1069
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:32,127
People might not feel like they've been grouped together with their community

1070
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:33,663
An algorithm cannot

1071
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:36,223
A hundred different

1072
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:39,295
Community meetings and listen to people talk about

1073
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:40,575
Where their Community is

1074
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:42,623
If you work at

1075
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:43,647
California

1076
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:45,183
Independent commission website

1077
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:46,463
One of those like

1078
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,487
Commonly house Prussia

1079
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:49,279
Why doesn't an algorithm

1080
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:53,375
Algorithm can't listen to community property

1081
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:56,959
Galen is not against using algorithms and redistricting

1082
00:44:57,471 --> 00:45:03,103
But he says they don't change the fact that drawing lines on a map forces you to make difficult choices

1083
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,383
You still have

1084
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:06,687
Program the algorithm

1085
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:08,735
To prioritize

1086
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:11,807
Certain values the same way that you would have to

1087
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:15,135
Construct a legislative body or an independent commission to do that

1088
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:20,511
So you know in the program you have to say we want District to be compact

1089
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:22,303
Or we want

1090
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:25,887
Districts to respect existing Municipal boundary

1091
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:28,959
We want you algorithm to make the district

1092
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:29,727
Competitive

1093
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:34,591
I mean still itches like algorithm time value so I don't understand how it's all that all it really seems to

1094
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:36,127
Potentially solve is

1095
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,431
Calling Mathis doesn't get death row

1096
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:42,783
Right I think there are plenty of people who will tell you that algorithms

1097
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:43,551
Have

1098
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:44,831
A place in this process

1099
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,903
And yes it can make this process

1100
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:50,463
Easier and potentially Fair

1101
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:51,999
But it's not a silver

1102
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:57,887
Galen true

1103
00:45:58,143 --> 00:45:59,679
Post of the gerrymandering project

1104
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:02,239
Podcast mini-series from 538

1105
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:04,287
Chadwick Matlin was the editor of God

1106
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:07,871
Keep bacteria Ava and Alice Wilder contributed to the structure

1107
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:11,967
Did you enjoy this we really really encourage you to go listen to the whole series

1108
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:15,551
Baconator so much more detail and it was completely fascinated

1109
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:19,903
15538 also put together all these incredible maps and Graphics that

1110
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:22,207
You can play around with to try to understand

1111
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:26,047
