This is 99% invisible

24
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:08,864
I'm Roman Mars

25
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,960
There currently more than 31000 post office

26
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:14,240
Citizen United States

27
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:16,032
They're a grand old ones

28
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:17,824
What's the take up entire city block

29
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:20,128
And there are smaller number ones

30
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,480
Hideaway in the backs of General stores in towns across Rural America

31
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,040
But this one in Arizona

32
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:31,136
Maybe the most rural post office in the continental US

33
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:36,768
The Supai post office is located at the bottom of the Grand Canyon

34
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,816
My name is Vivian Campbell

35
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:44,192
And I am the postmaster of Peach Springs Arizona

36
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:48,800
She says there are only a few ways to get mail to the bottom of the Grand Canyon

37
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,592
You either have to

38
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,872
Pipe down there

39
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,944
Ride a mule or Rida

40
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,712
A horse

41
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,528
And so every day rain or shine

42
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:03,392
Male gets packed on 10 rules to make a 2 and 1/2 hour trip into the canyon

43
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:07,488
Post offices there to serve the people who live on the havasupai reservation

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,560
Havasupai meaning blue green water people

45
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:13,120
Name for the waterfall at the bottom of the canyon

46
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:19,520
The Falls are just Magnificent the water is so blue it's not even it's indescribable

47
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:21,824
The opposite 5 receive a lot of food supply

48
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,640
But otherwise there mail is pretty standard fare

49
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:28,736
They get packages from Amazon they get first class mail they get

50
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,784
They get bills just like you and me

51
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:38,208
The Supai post office was established in 1896 and its existence speaks to the links that the US

52
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:41,280
US post office has gone to connect people with each other

53
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,816
Do night outside the country

54
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:46,144
Ever since the service was founded in the late 1700s

55
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:52,032
I was sitting on my back porch in Wyoming one night

56
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:55,104
Sun sank in the Golden West

57
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,664
And I just jumped up out the chair

58
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,224
Like shrieked at my husband's the post office

59
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,504
This created America

60
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,808
That is author and historian Winifred Gallagher

61
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:04,832
And she would have booked

62
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,368
Based on this Revelation called

63
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,392
Appropriately

64
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:09,696
How the post office created America

65
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:10,720
History

66
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:17,376
Gallagher argues that the post office didn't just create an efficient and inexpensive way to send a letter from Oakland California

67
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,656
Into the Grand Canyon

68
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:24,032
The service was designed to unite a bunch of disparate towns and people under one flag

69
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,568
And in doing so

70
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:27,616
The post office actually created

71
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,664
The United States of America

72
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,832
For thousands of years governments have had ways of sending information across distances

73
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,624
But for most of History

74
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,416
Email was limited to correspondence

75
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,952
Dublin's military

76
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:42,976
Eventually

77
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:43,744
Wealthy people

78
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:46,048
Who could afford to pay for such a service

79
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:50,144
And that's what the postal system of early colonize America was like

80
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,288
The crowns post was put in place by the English Monarchy and was mostly used to get messages from England to America

81
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,824
What's the mail

82
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,104
Landed from

83
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:02,688
England into America it would be

84
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:09,088
Circulated by a fellow called a post Rider who just like he sounds he wasn't a man on a horse there were no

85
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:11,136
Road suitable for a wheeled vehicle

86
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:16,512
What's the time the colonies with dotted the eastern coast from New Hampshire Down to Georgia

87
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:19,071
Work. Interested in communicating

88
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:19,839
With each other

89
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:22,399
The colonies were very fractious

90
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,959
Disputatious siblings they were

91
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:31,359
Add very little to do with each other they were a clamoring for the attention of mother England

92
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:37,759
Started to change when an enterprising fellow named Benjamin Franklin became postmaster for the ground

93
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,039
As postmaster

94
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:43,391
Franklin was in charge of making sure mail in the colonies got to its proper location

95
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:46,463
And he was determined to improve the barebones system

96
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:48,767
He actually visited every colony

97
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:49,791
This is back when

98
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,327
What's a real pain in the neck

99
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,375
Establish milepost so you could

100
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:56,703
Charge fairly for the distance the letter was going instead of

101
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,983
Just estimating it

102
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:00,799
What is Franklin work to improve the crown system

103
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:03,103
He began to see the colonies different

104
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,639
I believe

105
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,919
That the process

106
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,479
Going around and thinking about

107
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,015
These 13 colonies

108
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,295
As

109
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,319
Not just

110
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,111
Disconnected

111
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,159
Links in a chain

112
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,439
I think this

113
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:20,255
Started him thinking about ways that they could

114
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,791
To come together

115
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,815
As a people

116
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:28,447
In 1754 at a meeting of colonial representatives in Albany New York

117
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,775
Franklin proposed a plan for uniting the colonies

118
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:38,175
He actually kind of sketched out of federal government where the colonies would elect their own Representatives as opposed to having them

119
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,967
Appointed by the crown

120
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:45,343
England didn't appreciate Franklin's ideas and colonist weren't quite ready for them either

121
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:49,439
Between years later Notions about American Self governance were spreading

122
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:54,303
Revolutionaries in the colonies needed a way to communicate about the growing movement for Independence

123
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,863
And they knew they couldn't use the Ground Post

124
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,911
Because if they use the crown system

125
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:01,983
Their letters would be intercepted and they'd be arrested

126
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:07,359
In 1774 these American revolutionaries created their own system to communicate called

127
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,151
The Constitutional post

128
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,455
Before they fought the revolution

129
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,991
Or had a system of government

130
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,295
For the Declaration of Independence

131
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,575
The Constitution

132
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,855
Americans hat

133
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:18,879
The post

134
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,463
The underground constitutional post

135
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,767
Was crucial in fomenting the revolution

136
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:27,327
Which gave America independence from England

137
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,631
It was still a very limited system

138
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:32,703
There were fewer than a hundred post offices in the entire country

139
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,007
In the system didn't serve that many people

140
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,311
It was basically a tool for political Elites

141
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,079
Communicate with

142
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,383
Founders wanted a better pose

143
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,175
One that would serve all people

144
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,199
And their information

145
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,735
Help them stay United

146
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,759
Under one flag

147
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:49,855
These people who are already spreading over the Appalachians Into the Wild West

148
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:50,623
Tell Ohio in

149
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,183
Founding Father Benjamin Rush especially

150
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,231
We believe that the post office will play a

151
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,279
Crucial role in the new democracy

152
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,303
He was obsessed

153
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,351
With the idea that the post office should

154
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,375
Circulate

155
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,655
Newspapers

156
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,679
To every American

157
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,727
You can have an educated electorate

158
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:09,055
The people weren't literate and they didn't have up-to-date political information

159
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:12,383
But this would be no small undertaking

160
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:13,919
They needed

161
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,455
Roads in the workforce

162
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,295
This government has very little money it was running on fumes

163
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,343
And yet he says we're going to have

164
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,951
This very very ambitious Postal System much more ambitious than anything

165
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:26,719
In Europe

166
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,023
It's really kind of astounding

167
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:32,351
In 1792 Congress passed the post office

168
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:35,167
Under the ACT new postal routes were Savage

169
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,959
Sensorineural stealing mail

170
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,495
Became a punishable offense

171
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:41,823
In all newspapers can be mailed at the same low rate

172
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,359
Promote the spread of information

173
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:48,223
It's about the huge explosion of newspapers from all sorts of political view

174
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,271
The post office was the main way

175
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,807
Sometimes the only way

176
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,087
People got information

177
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,623
It was the media

178
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,487
Wait we were news junkies back then the founders ensured that we would have

179
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:02,815
And an uncensored LiveLeak

180
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:06,399
Contentious political culture because they wanted the people to be

181
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,679
Be exposed to all kinds of

182
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,447
Views

183
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:11,263
And argue it out and then vote

184
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:15,103
We've been arguing and gossiping and spreading information not

185
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,127
All of it true

186
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,663
Since the very beginning

187
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:23,551
In a way you know you could take the attitude from second a source of created a Frankenstein butt

188
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,855
In fact it was by Design

189
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,463
Around the same time in the late 1700s

190
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,535
Stagecoach was becoming a more popular way to travel

191
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,583
And a better way to carry mail than just

192
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,119
Packing a bull rider on a horse

193
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,423
The post office started to contract with

194
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,727
Private Stagecoach companies to carry mail

195
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:45,055
And these companies work with cities and towns to build roads

196
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,335
In this way

197
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,103
The post helped

198
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:47,871
Carve out

199
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,431
The early Transportation infrastructure of the country

200
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,455
Connecting this

201
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,223
Bridge communities

202
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,527
When a group of people settled in a new place

203
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,087
The residents would petition the government for a pokestop

204
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,623
Gave him the address

205
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,647
New place on the map

206
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:04,511
And then that town would be connected to another town down the road

207
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:07,071
He started to have this kind of network as it sits

208
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,375
Develop not just our physical landscape

209
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,423
Apus roads but a social landscape

210
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:16,031
So you could start to talk about this huge country with like some locations

211
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:20,895
In 1831 when the French diplomat and writer Alexis de tocqueville toward America

212
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,431
He was amazed

213
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,199
Aeropostale

214
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:25,759
He's riding in a stagecoach through a

215
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:28,319
Someplace in the Michigan Outback

216
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:32,415
And he sees people coming out of these kind of crude Huts minnow cabins

217
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:36,511
Desperate to get them newspapers and able to talk about not just

218
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,791
American politics

219
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:40,095
Text but what's going on in Europe East flabbergasted

220
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:44,191
At this point the male in the US was mostly about sending and receiving newspaper

221
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,495
People didn't really send letter

222
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,031
Because they couldn't afford

223
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:52,639
They kept the rates for letters Hi and they use that Revenue

224
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,407
From letters

225
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,687
To pay for the

226
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,991
Delivery of newspapers to Alma

227
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:02,367
Most people got like fewer than one letter a year you get a letter saying you know

228
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:06,719
Has died where you get like Aunt leticia's will

229
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,535
And unlike today with a person sending a letter cover

230
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,559
The cost of postage

231
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:11,583
Back then

232
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,351
The recipient

233
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,119
Had to pay

234
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:16,447
You go to the Post Office you'd stand in line see if you had mail

235
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,495
And then pay for it if you want it

236
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,567
It created the Fantastic backlog of

237
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:24,127
Unclaimed mail because so many people

238
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,919
So many people didn't

239
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:26,687
Want to

240
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,455
Hey

241
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:33,343
In the 1840s and 50s the population of the country exploded with new Emma

242
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,903
In all these new people wanted a less

243
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,927
Expensive way to communicate

244
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,999
A movement for cheap posted started to form

245
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:44,863
This movement wanted people to be able to send letters anywhere in the US for one low price

246
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:45,887
Using a new toy

247
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,191
The prepaid postage

248
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,751
They argued that the volume

249
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,799
Of the mail would increase

250
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:55,871
2 degree that would make up for the revenue and they were correct

251
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:58,175
Because the volume of the mail really went

252
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,967
Gangbusters after

253
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,247
Cheap postage

254
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:04,575
Postage stamp allowed regular people to send letters

255
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:07,135
People sent enough letters to fill

256
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:09,695
Thousands of Ken Burns documentaries

257
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:13,279
It was the Victorian era and letter-writing became an art form

258
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:17,631
Even books with advice on how to refine your letter writing style

259
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:20,959
Address your correspondence by his or her title

260
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:21,983
Not the first name

261
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:26,079
Dear husband beloved brother dearest friend on its own

262
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,871
No matter how close you are

263
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,919
Don't address him by his first name

264
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,455
Begin your letter with

265
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,991
I take Pen in Hand

266
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,783
Please pardon the poor paper

267
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,063
Scratchy pain

268
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,599
The ungraceful language

269
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,647
Women especially

270
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,183
David letter-writers

271
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,999
Women's actually started wearing little locket

272
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:44,767
Cats around their neck

273
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:45,791
But there

274
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,071
Stamps inside

275
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:50,911
With more women using the post office the place itself began to change

276
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,959
Post offices historically

277
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,495
Have been off in the back

278
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,263
Tavern

279
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,799
They were men's social

280
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,407
In all there were prostitutes at the post office flying their way or

281
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,943
Pickpapa famously

282
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:05,247
Pockets when women started sending letters

283
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:08,319
Post offices added special ladies window so that

284
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:13,183
Ladies could pick up their letters without coming into contact with these unseemly elements

285
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:17,279
Slowly post offices transition into more professional spaces

286
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:25,983
By 1860 there were some 28,000 post offices in the US

287
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,031
People were sending thousands of

288
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:30,335
And newly invented greeting cards

289
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,103
To each other

290
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,895
But they were also using the post

291
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,687
Just like the founders intended

292
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,479
To disseminate political information

293
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,015
Abolitionist

294
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:41,599
For example were using the mail to spread ideas about ending slavery

295
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:46,975
In the 1860s when the Civil War was being fought over some of those very ideas

296
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,791
American post office would bifurcate for a Time

297
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,607
No mail would be sent between North and South

298
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:57,983
The Civil War brought another big change in America's postal system

299
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,263
Home delivery

300
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,871
Postal employee in in Ohio named Joseph

301
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,639
Briggs

302
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,663
Found it

303
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,711
Heartbreaking during the war because

304
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,479
People

305
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:11,039
Desperate for news of their soldiers away

306
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:13,599
We have to stand in long lines at the post office

307
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:17,183
Often these people would be receiving news of a loved one's death

308
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,719
And they were just scenes of

309
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:22,047
Terrible terrible grief and in public they didn't even have

310
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,071
Privacy

311
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,631
And he found it so heartbreaking that he

312
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:28,959
Ran this pilot program of bringing people to mail

313
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:31,775
Home delivery caught on and by the mid-eighteenth six

314
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,311
Mini cities were off

315
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,103
About 30 years later

316
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,895
People living in rural area

317
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:37,919
This would also get

318
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:38,687
And delivery

319
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:47,391
Do all people in the eastern United States entered a letter-writing boom new settlers in California felt isolate

320
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,439
It was hard to receive mail

321
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,463
On the West Coast

322
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:52,255
South America go by

323
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,815
Train to Missouri but then it had to be hauled by

324
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:55,839
Stagecoaches

325
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:56,607
Through

326
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,399
Really terrible condition

327
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:04,287
The other option would be to send a letter on a 13000 miles six month trip around the tip of South America

328
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,359
Iboats Californians became work

329
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,383
Powerful bite

330
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,407
The Gold Rush era

331
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,943
The succeeding years

332
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:13,247
All became outraged by the fact

333
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,551
That they had this lousy Postal Service and they

334
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:19,135
Demanded to have a reliable Stagecoach mail that would

335
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:23,487
Depart and arrive unpredictable times they got what they wanted

336
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:28,095
By 18/57 post office had a Fairly reliable route from east to west

337
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,631
It took 25 days

338
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,423
Which was better than had been

339
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,959
Still not great

340
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,775
A group of businessmen led by a guy named William Russell

341
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:38,591
Thought they could do better than the US Post

342
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:43,967
Russell thought his little start-up company could get the mail from St Joseph Missouri

343
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:45,247
To Sacramento California

344
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,783
In just ten days

345
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,319
In fact he did it

346
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,599
People didn't think he'd be able

347
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:52,159
What to do it Russell's competing service was called

348
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,183
The Pony Express

349
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,743
Riders on horseback

350
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:58,559
Good race at full speed for about 10 or 15 miles

351
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,583
The relay station

352
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,887
Where they would trade out for a rested horse

353
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,703
This change was supposed to take only two minutes

354
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:08,287
Horses were to carry no more than 165 lb

355
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,823
Including the writer

356
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:12,383
Exhausted horse collapsed on the trail

357
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,407
The writer

358
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,943
What's the run on foot

359
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,223
Tunex location

360
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,247
This bag of mail

361
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,039
It was a very

362
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,063
Expensive endeavor

363
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,343
And it didn't last long

364
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,111
About a year-and-a-half

365
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,927
Which is okay because by 1861

366
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:27,743
The Transcontinental Telegraph Woodridge California

367
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:28,767
Unreal server

368
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,047
Would soon follow

369
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:35,423
Trains would eventually deliver mail all over the US

370
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,703
And I just deliver it

371
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,239
Become moving post

372
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:42,335
Subsidies from the post office allowed the rail system to occur

373
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,615
Expand throughout the country

374
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:47,455
Trains couldn't afford to run on passenger Fair alone

375
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:51,295
The money they got from the post office was crucial in helping them expand survey

376
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:55,647
Years earlier these postal subsidies had done the same thing for Stagecoach

377
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:57,183
And after World War 1

378
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,719
The post would do this again

379
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,743
Abbreviation

380
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:04,863
Plane door not a viable form of transportation until the post office

381
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:05,887
Cord money

382
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:06,911
Into the industry

383
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:07,935
The aviation

384
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,983
Industry wasn't able to pay for itself

385
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,519
But passenger services

386
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,311
Until well into the 90

387
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,079
1840s

388
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:17,663
The industry survived and expanded by carrying mail for the post off

389
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:22,271
Insight before Charles Lindbergh made his historic nonstop flight across the Atlantic

390
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,551
He had another job

391
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:27,391
Charles Lindbergh was a night pilot you know he carried the mail

392
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:34,815
If the post office truly Creed in America and I think Winifred Gallagher makes a pretty good case that it did

393
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:37,119
Is now playing a more supporting role

394
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,911
Unless 40 years or so

395
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:41,727
Congress has cut back considerably on services

396
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:46,335
And if you've noticed longer lines the post office and delays in receiving your mail

397
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,359
That's why

398
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,407
In my opinion no one should be mad at me

399
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,199
They should be mad at Congress

400
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,223
Congress

401
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,783
Has prevented the post office

402
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,831
From modernizing and

403
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,879
Running itself efficiently and

404
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:02,463
Tragically going digital which it should have done back in

405
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,231
The 80s

406
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:06,303
Tell you believe the post office missed an opportunity to

407
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,607
It's what they email and other digital communication

408
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,423
But she argues the US Postal Service

409
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,727
Probably isn't on the brink of death either

410
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:17,567
Conservative talk about privatizing the whole operation but right now

411
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,335
Gallagher.

412
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,359
What's that this is possum

413
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,895
Actually the private

414
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:23,711
Competitors neither FedEx or or

415
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,991
UPS's

416
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,783
Is equipped to handle the volume

417
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,319
They would certainly

418
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:29,855
Risk bankruptcy

419
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:30,879
I tried

420
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:36,511
The post office has an unparalleled delivery infrastructure and employees in enormous work for

421
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:39,327
And we still need the service they provide

422
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,375
Because unlike FedEx and UPS

423
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:45,983
US Post Office cannot pick and choose where they deliver based on profit

424
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,007
It is obliged

425
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,543
By law provide pick up

426
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,103
Send deliveries to every community in the country

427
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,407
Even if that communities local

Bongs and Charter of our devices

442
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:37,695
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man made sound

443
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,719
If

444
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:45,119
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife is

You talk to us

448
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,055
It is a creation of Sonic trash

To make them more human

452
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,599
Turn the living room lights on

453
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,391
Okay

454
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,927
Dim the living room lights

456
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:11,743
Okay

457
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:18,143
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

458
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:20,447
Makes for a much more natural

459
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,215
Experience

460
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,007
Turn the living room lights on

461
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,335

You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,528
Even worse

505
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:45,600
The cops think that I had something to do with it

506
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,880
Now

507
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:48,928
