I'm Roman Mars

23
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:15,008
There's a scene in the buddy cop movie Rush Hour 2 starring Jackie Chan

24
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:16,288
Docker

25
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:17,312
That takes place

26
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:20,384
Las Vegas casino

27
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,784
In the scene Jackie Chan character is in the unenviable predicament of having a small bomb stuff in

28
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,552
Inside his mouth

29
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:28,576
The villain

30
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:35,232
I hate it when that happens.

31
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,512
Thai Dish of

32
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,792
Onto the floor of the casino

33
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:44,192
About to explode fortunately at the last minute Jackie Chan's partner protector

34
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:49,312
Tucker removes the tape from Chan's mouth and transcripts the bomb on to a nearby roulette

35
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:55,968
Where it goes off

36
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,552
I did

37
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:04,160
So in that scene where the roulette table

38
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,952
Explodes money flies

39
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:06,720
Everywhere

40
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,512
Best producer Elizabeth nakano

41
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:14,656
And to create the scene and a bunch of others in the movie filmmakers needed a lot of money

42
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:15,936
Fake money

43
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:19,776
We had produced a billion dollars of $100 bills

44
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:22,080
Which is quite a bit of money in

45
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,872
14 pallet loads

46
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:27,456
Of $100 bill Solid 4 foot by 4 foot Cube

47
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:29,504
That's Greg Bilson Jr

48
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,112
Is the CEO of ISS props that company that provided all the fake money for the movie

49
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:36,928
And he says while we were filming Rush Hour 2

50
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:37,952
Something

51
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,232
Strange happened

52
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:41,536
A couple of men showed up to Dalton's office

53
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:44,096
Well when they showed up

54
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:47,936
They were saying that they were from the Secret Service and provided documents

55
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:54,336
Indicating such and I thought it was being punked I didn't believe that it was a real situation

56
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,688
Just two officers at it got very serious very real very fast

57
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:04,320
The Secret Service was in Greg Wilson's office because during the filming of that scene in the casino

58
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:06,112
Some of the fake cash

59
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:06,880
Had gone

60
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:07,904
Missing

61
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:14,560
Some souvenir speakers and Extras grab some of that money put it in their pocket and it subsequently started turning up

62
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,840
Is counterfeit over the next

63
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:16,608
Few days

64
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:21,472
People were trying to use the fake money as real money up and down the Las Vegas Strip

65
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:24,800
Which meant that Greg was being accused by the Secret Service

66
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,080
Counterfeiting

67
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,872
This is a serious charge

68
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:31,456
People who counterfeit money can face large fines and even jail time

69
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,272
Which is made the use of prop money in movies

70
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:35,552
Really complicated

71
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,320
It's over the years

72
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:40,160
We have pretty strict laws around the reproduction of US currency

73
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,696
Can be traced back

74
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,232
The mid-1800s

75
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,120
Around the time of the Civil War there was a ton of counterfeit currency circulating in the United States

76
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:52,192
Some people say anywhere from 1/3 to 1/2

77
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,216
All money with

78
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:53,984
Fake

79
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,800
The federal government wanted to give people faith in it

80
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:57,568
Currency

81
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,384
It got serious about cracking down

82
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,408
Counterfeit money

83
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,992
Reproductions of US currency became illegal

84
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,528
Including photographs

85
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,296
Money

86
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:12,160
Along with the law that criminalizes reproductions of money and enforcement agency was formed

87
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,696
The Secret Service

88
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,512
Yeah those guys with the earpieces black suits

89
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,536
Tech president

90
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,303
Those guys

91
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,631
Today the agency falls under the Department of Homeland

92
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,399
Security

93
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,935
But I didn't start in 18

94
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:27,263
65 the Secret Service was part of the Treasury Department

95
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,055
And it's only job

96
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,335
Was to fight counterfeit

97
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:34,943
Secret Service agents operating from field offices throughout the country

98
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:39,039
Evan constantly fighting the criminals who make folding money

99
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:41,343
As well as those who passes to the public

100
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:46,207
Asthma film put out by the treasury Department in 1945 called

101
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,743
Doubtful dollars

102
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:51,839
And accepting money it is well to remember that file not Falls

103
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,119
Grainger.com

104
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,447
Counterfeiters are stranger

105
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:01,055
Learn to know your money and train yourself

106
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:04,127
Examine the bills and coins

107
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:06,943
Okay so

108
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,295
The ban on any photographic representation of money was in place for about

109
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:14,623
Century and this was a problem for advertisers and talk

110
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:18,975
By the letter of the law they were specifically barred from taking

111
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:19,999
Pictures of money

112
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:24,351
The law was written before the invention of motion pictures but when movies came along

113
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:29,215
It was generally assumed that filmmakers would follow the same rules as photographers

114
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,519
No money on camera

115
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:36,895
I'm so in the early days of Cinema when money was needed in a film producers had to get

116
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:37,663
Creative

117
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,455
3095

118
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:46,111
That's a scene from the 1943 Hitchcock film shadow of a doubt

119
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,159
And if you watch a movie and look closed

120
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:51,743
You can see that the bills in the scene aren't American dollars

121
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,535
There Mexican pesos

122
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,071
God entails

123
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,119
I'm glad to see that you're a man of understanding

124
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,935
The most important

125
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:00,703
Me

126
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:01,727
Austin Powers

127
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:05,567
I remember seeing it movies all the way from

128
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:08,895
The twenties in the thirties and forties up into the 7th

129
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:12,735
This is Peter Huntoon he's an author and expert on America

130
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:16,575
Concurrency and he says you can see pesos in a lot of old movies

131
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:20,159
The reason for this is that after the Mexican Revolution ended

132
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,439
Around 1920

133
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:25,791
Regional Mexican money that was created during the revolution locked value

134
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,071
And whistle for cheap

135
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,887
The notes from the Mexican state of Chihuahua or punch

136
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:32,703
Sophia Health power or some of the most widely used

137
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,799
They were absolutely gorgeous because they were multicolored

138
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:39,615
They had gold backs black Print

139
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:42,687
But the idea was is that these things look like

140
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,479
Money they were real nice looking

141
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,527
And so the studios bottom up

142
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:51,391
The studios weren't trying to pass pesos off as American dollars it was just all they had

143
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,951
Nobody's ever fooled by it if you see this

144
00:06:54,207 --> 00:07:00,351
Does that money go by in a movie you know whether it's American or not because of course you'd see that a block away

145
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:09,055
In the second half of the 20th century the government began relaxing restrictions on the rules around photographing currency

146
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:12,639
And it eventually became legal to film real money

147
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:16,479
And real money is great for scenes where you need close-up shots

148
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:20,063
Like this scene from the 1995 movie Dead Presidents

149
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,111
But I can forgive me for this one

150
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,671
I'll tell you what man

151
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,207
This kind of money

152
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,767
In this scene

153
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:31,071
Or of the characters have robbing armored truck

154
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,351
And are splitting up the cat

155
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,423
The camera pans slowly over stacks

156
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:44,127
But it can also be risky to have real money floating around on Sat

157
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,919
Especially if you need a bunch of it

158
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:48,735
It's a lot of producers prefer to use fake money

159
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:53,599
These days the government does allow for some reproductions of US currency

160
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:56,671
It's just not very clear how real

161
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,439
Fake money

162
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,207
Can look

163
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:04,351
It depends it's it's very subjective if it's the same size as a current US

164
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,887
Currency note

165
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:11,007
And it's front and back and it's made in the likeness of our US currency

166
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,799
Then we view it as counterfeit

167
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,335
That's Trent Everett

168
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:19,455
I am an assistant to the special agent in charge for our criminal investigative division of the

169
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,223
Secret Service

170
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:24,575
And I currently oversee our counterfeit operation section

171
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:27,647
Over the years prop money and movies has begun to look more like

172
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,671
Actual money

173
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:29,695
Sometimes

174
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,743
Too much like actual money

175
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:36,351
Some companies did and still do turn out bills that run afoul of the law

176
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,887
Because to look good on

177
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:41,471
Screen fake money has to be pretty close to the real thing

178
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:46,591
He's moving companies like to have things look as real as possible and then that's where they start running into issues

179
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:49,919
Some people make bills that are the same size as real money

180
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:55,551
But with one or two small design changes like maybe it's as in dog we trust instead of In God We Trust

181
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,855
What has Benjamin Franklin making a weird face

182
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,671
Order of bills that look exactly like a real thing

183
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02,975
It's up there stamp the small disclaimer

184
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,535
All of these would probably be

185
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,815
The Secret Service

186
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:09,631
Remember Greg Bilson from Rush Hour 2

187
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:13,727
He thought they had made their fake bills look different enough from the real thing

188
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:20,127
There's probably 25 or 26 separate things that are not but a real $100 bill has on it

189
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:23,455
But it was still too close to the reality for them to accept

190
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:27,551
Wilson had to turn over all of his prop money to the Secret Service 2

191
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:33,439
And then They confiscated and destroyed all the electronic files that were used in creating this money

192
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,999
Feel so lost a lot of money

193
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:42,399
Not just a fake money but the real money it took to produce the fake money

194
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:45,215
Thousand dollars just a Paper Stock alone to buy

195
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:49,311
Enough paper to produce a billion dollars worth $77,000

196
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:53,663
In the end all Bilson really lost with money he didn't have to go to jail

197
00:09:53,919 --> 00:10:00,063
These days he mostly trying to avoid using fake money at all it's just too hard to please both the Seeker

198
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,111
Service and the movie producers

199
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:06,975
It's not worth it I'm not going to break the law for a TV show a feature film or a producer that I don't even

200
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:14,143
But movies are definitely not the only way fake money is making it into the marketplace

201
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,703
Is Trent Everett again from the Secret Service

202
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:17,727
That's not

203
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,287
But it's just leaking out of production companies

204
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:23,871
But that's being sold on the Internet or anybody can purchase it

205
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:26,175
You can actually buy prop money right now on Amazon

206
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,223
Steven on Prime free two-day shipping

207
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,247
So of course

208
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:30,783
We ordered

209
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:34,879
The producer Katie mingle opening up the package

210
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,671
Okay so it's a little stack

211
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,975
About half an inch thick

212
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,511
It does look

213
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:43,327
A good bit like money from a distance

214
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:44,607
It doesn't

215
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:47,679
Feel that much like money though it feels like just regular

216
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,447
Paper to me

217
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,519
Benjamin Franklin is making a really strange

218
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,287
Face

219
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,079
It's like they took his mouth

220
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:55,615
Shrunk it

221
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:59,199
And it says for motion picture use only

222
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:02,527
But yeah let me see if I can pull any of my coworker

223
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:10,719
Katie has about ten hundred dollar bills in her hands which she's going to say a fan sent us in the mail

224
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:18,143
Note with all this money in it

225
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,447
Who did

226
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,615
Deer 99ci

227
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:31,455
Love your words

228
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,479
Pictures of summer

229
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,271
Special lion

230
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,551
People

231
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,087
How much money is it

232
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,623
Real

233
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,903
It doesn't

234
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,695
Promotion

235
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,719
Picture use only

236
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,535
Shut up

237
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:50,399
Okay so Delaney could see it was fake as soon as it was in your hands

238
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:54,239
But from a couple feet away the money does look really convincing

239
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:58,847
Antron Everett told me they're actually investigating some fake money that looks

240
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:01,663
A lot like the stuff you guys bought from Amazon

241
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:02,943
Currently we are invest

242
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:07,551
Instigating the motion picture note that has been popping up all over e-commerce sites

243
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:13,695
But it's two-sided it is similar size it is in the likeness of a $100 US

244
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:14,719
Notes

245
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:19,327
And the only difference on it is that says motion picture you saw me

246
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:24,703
So don't be surprised if some secret service agent show up at the 99 Pi office

247
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:29,055
No charges necessarily brought on the person for purchasing it

248
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:32,127
They just aren't legally able to possess it

249
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,151
Okay just for the record

250
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,175
Personal purchases

251
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,455
Katie Mingle

252
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,479
Am I in

253
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,015
GLE

254
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:45,183
Given how difficult it is to make money that looks real but

255
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:49,279
It's hard to imagine who still wants to be in the business of

256
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,583
Creating and applying fake money for the movie

257
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:56,703
But there are a few people still doing it including RJ Rappaport

258
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,983
I'm rich

259
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,519
RJ Rappaport

260
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:02,079
And I'm the president of RJR props

261
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,383
We are a

262
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,663
The props house

263
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,943
4 film

264
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:07,967
Television

265
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,503
Music industry

266
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:12,063
Commercials and the entertainment industry

267
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:16,159
When I visit RJ at work he shows me around a huge Warehouse

268
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,975
There are all kinds of different props

269
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,535
Hospital bed a prison style

270
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:26,911
Futuristic machine with lots of knobs and buttons and control panels like this

271
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,215
Blue light spinning across

272
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,263
Circuit boards and

273
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,567
And flashing LEDs no sportsmanship

274
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:38,687
Hardee's been in this business for years but he still seems so excited by it

275
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,247
It's almost like he's a kid playing pretend

276
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,783
All the perfect toys

277
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,831
Princess if somebody had to

278
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:45,855
Disarm this

279
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:50,975
Is the missile control system

280
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,887
When we step into the room with the prop money

281
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:00,191
It's like seeing a bunch of movie cliches

282
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:06,847
There are Stacks and stacks of bills wrapping paper bands like they just came from the bank

283
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:13,247
So I noticed you also have a briefcase of money is at 1 hole prop that you give out the briefcase with the stacks of cash

284
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,271
Entire

285
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,551
Crop ready to go

286
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,599
And we have other briefcases like this

287
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,879
Just a black leather

288
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:19,647
Briefcase

289
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,951
And this is a brown leather briefcase

290
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,487
Sometimes we feel them

291
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,279
Take drugs as well

292
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:30,911
RJ says it took three years of back and forth between him and the Secret Service

293
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:33,215
Rihanna design for prop money

294
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:36,799
That kind of guidance isn't something the Secret Service normally provide

295
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:37,567
By the way

296
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,871
RJ managed to finagle an exception

297
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:42,175
We work with the Secret Service

298
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:44,991
And we went over all the laws

299
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,783
All the updates

300
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,831
All of the changes

301
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:52,159
It's it's a very tedious process where

302
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,975
You just doing original artwork from scratch

303
00:14:55,487 --> 00:15:00,095
RJ says when he makes bills that are blank on one side he can make them pretty realistic

304
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,911
Otherwise you have to be really careful

305
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,447
John Deere a ton of Hoops

306
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:08,799
And even then sometimes the Secret Service will end up asking you to destroy

307
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,335
Everything you made

308
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:13,919
It's so much hassle that ironically there's no money in it

309
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:16,735
And it's not a big money maker

310
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,271
No joke intended

311
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:20,063
It's not the way that we

312
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:20,831
Make a living

313
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,599
It's really not

314
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,879
This is really just

315
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,647
Hey

316
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,927
Service that we do

317
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:25,951
For clients

318
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,487
And we know that

319
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:30,047
They're going to come back to us for something bigger and better

320
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,839
Then we'll make a living online

321
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:36,191
RJ has supplied money for a bunch of popular movies and TV shows

322
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:38,495
Like the Netflix series Ozark

323
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,031
Okay

324
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:45,919
Money laundering 101 suitcase with 5 million bucks in it

325
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:51,807
In this scene is a montage include cash on the glass table cash running through a counting machine

326
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,343
And cash in a suitcase

327
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:55,647
The IRS won't let you buy anything of value with

328
00:15:56,927 --> 00:16:01,023
TV and movies are full of characters who come across suitcases full of money

329
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,815
It's a fun plot device

330
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:06,399
But behind all this cash is someone like RJ

331
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:12,031
Who is been through a meticulous design process and years of back and forth with the Secret Service

332
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,847
Because for the film producers

333
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,383
There's no such thing

334
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,663
As easy money

335
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,583
You know what's not on US currency

336
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:36,863
A dollar cinema

337
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:40,191
Kurt explores the origin of the S with a line through

338
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,215
After that

339
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:53,759
Between the beeps bongs and chatter of our devices were immersed in a cluttered world of man-made

340
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:54,527
Sound

341
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:59,903
If I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexis

342
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:05,791
Is talking to me and my wife is in another room and a kid is in another room and we're all hearing.

343
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,583
Technology talk to us

344
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,887
It is a creation of Sonic trash

345
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,703
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

346
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,287
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

347
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:18,335
To make them more human

348
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,431
Turn the living room lights on

349
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:23,967
Okay

350
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:26,015
Dim the living room lights to 50

351
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:26,783
80%

352
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:28,575
Okay

353
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:34,975
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

354
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:37,791
Makes for a much more natural experience

355
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,839
Turn the living room lights on

356
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,423
Dim the living room lights to 50

357
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,703
Resent

358
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:51,359
We're presenting to special episodes from 99percentinvisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

359
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,895
About how are sounds gay

360
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,431
Is impacting our health

361
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,735
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

362
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:59,807
Look for them Friday is May 17th and May 24th

363
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:00,575
Right here

364
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,855
IPic

365
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:08,767
We need to talk about something constipation abdominal pain and bloating

366
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:15,167
You tell yourself it's not that bad you take laxatives you modify your diet and exercise routine but thinking about it all the time is free

367
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:20,799
Frustrating but doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again

368
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:24,383
And you don't know why then it may be time to seek help

369
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:27,455

Flat pocket

373
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,207
So I'm in the studio with digital director

374
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,255
Kolstad and as we mentioned earlier

375
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:43,839
Windows really strict anti-counterfeiting laws were on the books

376
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,375
Movies use pesos

377
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,911
What's the standing for US currency

378
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:49,215
But the idea of seeing

379
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:50,239
Circulating

380
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,263
In the United States

381
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,543
Wasn't actually

382
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,823
All that new

383
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,591
Krazybee

384
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:57,151
Yeah in fact from the late 1700s

385
00:18:57,407 --> 00:19:00,991
All the way up to 1857 pieces for legal tender in the United States

386
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:04,319
Around the same time that Congress officially approved their use

387
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:05,855
The dollar sign started to

388
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:10,975
Well nobody's really sure who first designed the dollar sign

389
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:14,047
There's a lot of them about how it came up

390
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,607
Some people have speculated that the s

391
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:21,983
With the double lines those two vertical lines over it is actually a you superimposed on an S

392
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,775
At the bottom of the you remove

393
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,823
Oh so it's supposed to be US citizen

394
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:26,591
US currency

395
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:29,663
Right and that's an appealing.

396
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,431
Theory

397
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:34,783
Makes the dollar sign seem distinctly American like a national symbol

398
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:36,831
Leafly fault

399
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,879
I guess that's one

400
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,671
Hypothesis on what's your

401
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,951
Favorite version of

402
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:42,719
How the dollar sign

403
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:46,815
Well there's this rather epic theory that the dollar sign traces back

404
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:49,887
To the pillars of Hercules on either side of the Strait of Gibraltar

405
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:55,263
This famous Strait is effectively a threshold between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean

406
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:00,895
And according to Legend the flanking pillars were once inscribed with the Latin words non plus Ultra

407
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,687
Translate says nothing further

408
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:03,967
So is in

409
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,759
Once you leave Mediterranean Sea

410
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,551
There is nothing beyond their just

411
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,319
The endless

412
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:11,903
Write this is the end of the world as we know it and that motto

413
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,439
Ended up on old Spanish currency

414
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,023
It was later changed from Christopher Columbus reach America

415
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:20,095
I actually dropped the non part and then it's loose Ultra

416
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,375
Meaning further Beyond

417
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,935
Reflect this new realization that in fact

418
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,471
There was a lot more to the world out there

419
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:29,311
And I'm Spanish coinage the model was shown on banners that rapped

420
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,591
Flanking pair

421
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:31,615
Corny pillar

422
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:34,175
So you have this kind of s shaped Banner

423
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:36,223
That wind down around a vertical column

424
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,551
Turn the words with a pillar and a banner wrapped around it it looks like

425
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,087
Single line

426
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:45,695
Pretty much and it's a fun story but the prevailing theory is actually

427
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:49,535
That the dollar sign was never really about the new world he wasn't something distinctively American

428
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,351
In fact it all comes back to the Spanish peso

429
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:54,655
And their plural abbreviation which is

430
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:55,423
PS

431
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:58,751
At least before the pizza is getting a lot of use

432
00:20:59,263 --> 00:20:59,775
In

433
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:01,567
American businesses in the 1700

434
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,127
And the idea is that

435
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:07,199
As it was getting written down over and over again on documents

436
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,223
Puppy started to order

437
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,247
The s

438
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,271
And the crew part of the

439
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,551
You just got dropped over

440
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,855
So you end up with something that

441
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:15,391
Looks like the single bar dollar sign

442
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,696
That vertical line going up to now

443
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,464
Let me know today

444
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,000
And so that is

445
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:20,768
Thought to be

446
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:26,400
It is thought by many to be the true story and that is what the Oxford English Dictionary Clayton

447

You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

482
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:13,664
Or lose a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

483
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,992
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like

484
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,016
A dad

485
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:22,368
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

486
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:26,720
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that kind

487
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,144
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

488
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:37,472
Was found dead in my private gym

489
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:40,800
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

490

Even worse

491
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:45,152

492
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,432
Now

493
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:48,480
