Infrastructure

22
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,920
Of course some infrastructure is vital and necessary and some infrastructure isn't

23
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:24,224
But it all has to be made right

24
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,528
It's hard work it's dangerous work

25
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:28,832

26
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:35,232
This story is about New York City sandhogs local 147 and they are the urban miners who build every

27
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:38,304
Free tunnel in New York City and many of the bridge foundations

28
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,328
Without them

29
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:44,704
Filipino stores no Subways no tunnels for car no water basically no New York City

30
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,312
Quote the local 147 website without the tunnels built by the 10 Hawks

31
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:53,408

Little number 3 interview scene the third Die Hard movie Die Hard with a Vengeance

34
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:12,352
It's pretty amazing to see in the voices of the sandhogs responsible for building that tunnel

35
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,888
Amazing to hear

36
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:18,496

A challenge to man's Ingenuity skill and courage

43
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,424
60 years ago the challenge was to build another tunnel under the Hudson River

44
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:54,336
The Holland Tunnel in the George Washington Bridge could no longer handle the mounting traffic between New Jersey and Manhattan

45
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:57,408
I'm so the Lincoln Tunnel is starting

46
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,456
It was 1934

47
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,480
The Great Depression

48
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,016
And jobs were scarce

49
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,808
A my day

50
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,600
When you were hungry is beyond easy

51
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:06,880
And to be a Santa

52
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:07,904
My gym Bethesda

53
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,440
You had to work almost

54
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:11,232
Exclusively in compressed air

55
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:14,816
Are that was pumped into small cramped underground Chambers

56
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:15,584
Caissons

57
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,144
To hold back the water and silk during tunnel

58
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:21,472
Under Pressure work is a strain on heart and lungs

59
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,824
There is danger also up infecting an illness called the pain

60
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,640
My early life I had trouble with a bunch of my niece

61
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:33,248
You had a way of curing it at home you get into a hot cup of water

62
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:40,160
And it would disappear and then you'll fall asleep the water would get call it come right back and hit you like a toothache a very very bad

63
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:40,928
Bad toothache

64
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,232
It's the same problem deep sea divers

65
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,024
When they come up to the surface too fast

66
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,560
Severe cramps

67
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:48,352
And in some cases paralysis

68
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,632
They can even lead to death

69
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,424
Around the turn of the century

70
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,728
During construction of the Pennsylvania Railroad town

71
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,800
The bands took the lives of at least 50 sandhawk

72
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:00,128
Initially the men were declared dead of natural causes

73
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,016
Later it was revealed that the death certificates had been falsified to cover up unsafe working conditions

74
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,832
Public hearings led to public outrage

75
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:09,600
Eventually

76
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,392
A sandhogs union was born

77
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,696
I wouldn't have the union would have nothing

78
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:16,000
Believe me when I tell you absolutely nothing

79
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,095
You would think that would be any kind of wages or any kind of conditions

80
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:22,143
It looked the contractor was going to give you

81
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:27,007
Rich man got rich because he was holding onto his money is going to give it away to a bunch of slobs

83
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:37,503
I'm going to read the title of a local but you must remember that we came from an international Union of compressed air

84
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,343
That's why the title is compressed air free at tunnels

Is a former president of the sandhogs Union

89

Local 147

90
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,191
For sure

91
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:58,239
McGinnis is father was a sand hog

92
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,007
A foreman

93
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:03,359
As a kid growing up across the street from the bar where his father recruited his work

94
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:06,943
Young Eddie decided he wanted nothing to do with a business

95
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,991
The banging on the bar

96
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:13,855
And the fights that went on there I was petrified I never thought I would go near

97
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,671
Anybody that was a sad hug never mind waiting for them

98
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,975
But despite his vow to stay away

99
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:19,999
Eddie McGinnis

100
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,279
Like a lot of sandhawk

101
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,351
Ended up following his father down into the tunnel

102
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,911
Economics the size of a lot of Our Lives

103
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:31,519
And it decided mine I know the first time I went into a tunnel in

104
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:35,103
And they set off a blast of about 206 Zapata

105
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,943
I said what in the name of God brought me to this place

106
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:43,295
That was my reaction I'm going home and never coming back

107
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,087
But when I went home I had

108
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,367
Young Sheldon

109
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,647
And I had to come back

110
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,951
Adam jahns everything else is good

111
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,767

You doing all right

113
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:59,423
10 years ago there were twenty-three hundred members of local 147

114
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,983
Ecuador here in a small office in the Bronx

115
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,543
Today there are only about 700 member

116
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,591
And almost half of those are pensioners

117
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,127
All our men

00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:11,455
Richard Fitzsimmons is the business manager for local 147

119
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:14,783

Pretty Woman

121
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,695
And they worked alongside they done the best they could but they didn't come back after lunch it was just the door battuta

122
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,511
I'm a firm believer that a woman should

123
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,607
Do whatever she can in life to support herself

124
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,655
But I don't think that's a noggin

125
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:36,799
Hey is is a place for a woman like to put it this way I would want to see my wife and my daughter's hand

126
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,847

Spacely a father-son union

131
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:54,975
Just about everybody has either had their father or their brother is the saying haga that cousin and

132
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:58,303
It's a small but it a tight-knit union

133
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:01,375
And the union is running in in such a way that the

134
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,423
It's almost like an extended family

135
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:07,007
And local 147 is a union that has long prided itself

136
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,799
When it's racial and ethnic diversity

137
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,359

180
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:48,895
It was all work

181
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,711
It's always been that way since I've sent

182
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:55,039
In New York one of the most important work rules

183
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,319
If not the most important

184
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:59,647
Is that you have to have a union card to work as a Santa

185
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,719
The being in the union doesn't guarantee a job

186
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,255
Tunnel work is scarce.

187
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,839
Several hundred members of local 147 or out of work

188
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,887
Most of those who do have job

189
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,935
So working on City Tunnel number 3

190
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,727
A massive Construction

191
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,007
Edwin finished

192
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,567
Will get much of New York City a brand new water system

193
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:20,127
City Tunnel number 3 is badly needed

194
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,919
New York's existing water

195
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,711
Some of which dates back to the

196
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,479
The turn of the century

197
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,015
Is so antiquated

198
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,551
City officials are reluctant to

199
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,575
Turn off the valve

200
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,599
Apps to inspect the tunnels

201
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:33,951
Because they're afraid the valves are so corroded they won't be able to turn them back on again

202
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:42,655
A small part of City Tunnel number 3 is shaft 21p beneath the heart

203
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:49,055
Part of Brooklyn

204
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:49,823
Monday morning

205
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,847
Approve sandhogs

206
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:53,407
He's about to go to work inside shaft 21

207
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,711
Five hundred feet below street level

208
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:57,759
Are we getting ready to go down the drain

209
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,575
I'm going to be driving for maybe three or four hours

210
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:03,647
And then we get the dynamite donated would be a blast

211
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:04,671
Music

212
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,719
The 300 pounds of dynamite

213
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:08,767
Everlast

214
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,447
The crew is off to a slow start this morning

215
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,983
There's an electrical problem

216
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,263
So it's Pitch Black

217
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,287
At the bottom of the shaft

218
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,311
Don't like status

219
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,407
The problem is quickly fixed

220
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,175
Then the first group

221
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:29,247
Cops and Hawks Reston hard hats and bright yellow rain slicker

222
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,551
Step inside a metal cage

223
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,319
And a sin

224
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:39,231
Give me one kiss and I'll be

225
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:52,031
Next sound you about to hear is Mendon cage going down

226
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:55,103
Men in motion

227
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:59,711
Foremost sandhawk the first trip into a shaft or tunnel was the moment of truth

228
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:06,367
Point at which they knew whether or not they had what it takes to be in the business and you can tell the minute you step on a cage

229
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:12,767
You start going down what do you do when you don't have it any Mike gimenez grew up not too far from his sight words

230
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:19,167
Long as he can remember gimenez says he wanted to be a Sandra what did you do

231
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:22,239
We told we boldly go where no man has ever gone before

232
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:25,823
We come across virgin Rock This Rock has been here since the beginning of time

233
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,615
Nobody's ever done that

234
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:32,223
Not every sandhog shares this romantic view of the work

235
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:35,295
Charlie Cannon is a 2nd generation stand

236
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:41,183
It's more economic than it is anything else

237
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:46,303
For the glory of being the first one to be with nobody else has walked

238
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:52,191
It says basic economic you got to feed your family pay your bills and try to get ahead in this life

239
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,727
That's the whole picture

240
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,799
Where do they work for the glory or the paycheck

241
00:11:57,055 --> 00:12:00,127
Sandhogs work together and extremely close quarters

242
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,759
You're at the bottom of shaft

243
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,807
Tencent

244
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,343
In a battery of heavy equipment

245
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:12,415
Are packed into a space about the size of a large hot tub

246
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,463
The walls are Jagged Rock

247
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,511
Granite quartz limestone

248
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,559
Illuminated by a panel of flood light

249
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:25,215
As you can tell it's cramped sardine but this is what it's like to be a life of a sardine

250
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:30,335
Close to it yeah baby you don't get any better than this stuff

251
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:39,295
It's like working at the bottom of an empty missile site in a rainforest

252
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,575
Groundwater

253
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,623
Pours Down from the rock walls above

254
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:45,183
Collecting in knee deep pools below

255
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:45,951
The sandhogs

256
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:46,975
We're getting ready to drill

257
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,279
They pull out big pneumatic Jack

258
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,071
Attach long drill bit

259
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,631
Start boring holes for the dynamite

260
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,383
The opening at the top of the shaft

261
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,175
65 stories up

262
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,199
Looks like a pinhole

263
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,503
If something were to fall from above

264
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,039
Even a small rock

265
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:11,807
Heart

266
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,087
Could be deadly

267
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:15,135
It's like being in a funnel

268
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,415
Is No Escape

269
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:20,255
Is there a skate for Medicaid at 4

270
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,815
It was into a shaft similar to this one

271
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,607
Jeff 19 in Queens

272
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,143
Did something did fall

273
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,167
Something big

274
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,983
Last November the day before Thanksgiving

275
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,519
16 ton winch

276
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,055
Broke loose from its Mooring

277
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,079
At the top of the shaft

278
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,127
Tom Flanagan and Mike Boyd

279
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,407
R2 of 8 Santa

280
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,735
We're working 450 feet below on a catwalk

281
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,527
About 50 feet from the bottom

282
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,807
When the huge win

283
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:44,831
Plummeted downward

284
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:48,415
You know all of a sudden notice of cable that's like real fast and

285
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:53,279
They looked up and always seems his big snake coming out of the cable coming in

286
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:56,863
Couldn't see the surface due to the fog so

287
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:01,471
Cable Fitness up real bad knocking everybody all about

288
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,775
And at that big

289
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,823
Big ones come through and

290
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:09,407
All hell broke loose everything flying all over and

291
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,711
Had no warning at all

292
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:15,807
Hatteras I seen flashes out of the corner of my right eye

293
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,367
Sound like an explosion

294
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,439
Did that broke loose and I was

295
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,487
Have my foot caught in a cable

296
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:26,047
Put my fingers on a great and hanging upside down

297
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:32,703
I was going to drop in the water or take a break my fall cuz I was slipping in like with all the other guys I thought of my two kids and

298
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:36,287
Turn my hand around in the great and stuck in it again and just let my

299
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,335
Fort Lewis from the Gable

300
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:40,383
Manage my way up to

301
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:43,455
A good cable to pull myself up onto the form

302
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:45,503
I managed to get up to

303
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,063
Flat piece of that condition

304
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,343
Hang on a PC

305
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,135
Post on the guardrail

306
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:56,767
Just hoped and prayed until the dust settled until the tell everything stop calling

307
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,607
We're all very lucky that

308
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,911
That made out of there

309
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,191
I just wish

310
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:07,007
Anthony could have been as lucky as the rest of us

311
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,127
Anthony oddo was the 20th sandhawk to be killed during construction of the water tunnel

312
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:19,039
That averages out to almost one fatality the year

313
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:28,767
You come here today

314
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,583
Pray for the heroic men and women

315
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:34,399
Mesa tremendous sacrifices

316
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:35,935

00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,007
We have water

319
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,543
Life-giving water

320
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,847
All the days of their lives

321
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,639
The generations yet

322
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,407

Each year in memory of the sandhogs

327
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,367
Killed working on the water

328
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:55,903
So now

329
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,695

First guy got killed on water Tunnel construction that killed about 20 feet away from you on a wolf deck

342
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,807

14

344
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,135

Portugalia on a motor

350
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,775
That's going to really have a bad sloping

351
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,311
The great wonder by 4 degrees

352
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,871

363
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,543
Lord

364
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,311
Have mercy

365
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:21,151
For every sandhawk who is killed on the job

366
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,943
There are hundreds maybe thousands

367
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,967
Close call

368
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:27,039
The most legendary took place in 1960

369
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,831
As The Story Goes

370
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:29,855
Marshall Maybe

371
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,391
It was working in compressed air

372
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,927
Are in a tunnel below the East River

373
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,463
It was a blowout

374
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,255
Maybe into other sandhogs

375
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,791
4 shot out through a hole

376
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,071
Enough to the riverbed

377
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:44,703
On a geyser 25ft high they were Mining and they don't have the equipment or not enough to stop at blow

378
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:48,287
And he tried to stop and he went up to the river with two other guys

379
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,311
And he survived

380
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,591
Yellow to red.

381
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:51,615
The stories

382
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:55,967
Seem to catch attention cuz Marshal maybe went back he was in a Long Island College Hospital

383
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:59,295
I think he only spent a couple of days in the hospital

384
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,831
And he was backbiting

385
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:01,855
Quick as you could

386
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:02,879
Okay

387
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,951
Sakamoto sanitizing and they're going to tell you

388
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,743
Are your time's up your time's up

389
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10,815
Buddy walking down the street or working Underground

390
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,607
It's going to go you're going to go

391
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,911
When a man says it's time you're gone that's all

392
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:15,935
Simple Jack

393
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,727
Just One Last Time

394
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,007
Stewart Williams

395
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,799
Thought it was his time a while back

396
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,591
He was working on a subway

397
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:23,615
When suddenly

398
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,895
The tunnel caved in

399
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:25,919
Stewart

400
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,967
He's only five foot three and weighs less than

401
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:29,247
130 lb

402
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,527
Was nearly crushed to death

403
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,575
Damn this feeling ever had

404
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:35,903
I saw those beautiful lights on my wife my kids

405
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,439
Just declared a

406
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,719
And I passed out

407
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,999
I woke up in hospital

408
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,047
A broken leg my back

409
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,863
Head cut open broken collarbone

410
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,143
Shoulder

411
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:48,447
A week later I'm back work

412
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,983
8 weeks

413
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,055
These days Stewart Works above ground

414
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,079
As a supervisor

415
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,639
Tonight he's directing a 650

416
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,663
The pound Dynamite

417
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,199
The chap 22

418
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,735
Part of the water tunnel project

419
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:01,503
Brooklyn

420
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,879
Chapter 22 is wedged between the brooklyn-queens

421
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:07,647
Expressway

422
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,439
And a row of low-income apartment

423
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,719
It looked down on the site

424
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:15,071
It's surrounded by Loops of razor wire and bathed in high intensity flood light

425
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:24,543
Do it blows a whistle once to warn people living in the apartments that an explosion is 5 minutes away

426
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:27,359
Dynamite Blaster an almost daily occurrence

427
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,407
Still Stewart is anxious

428
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,479
He's pacing back and forth smoking a cigarette

429
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:37,855
Nervously pushing the plunger on the empty Detonator in and out and greeting men as they come out of the shower

430
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:44,255
I'm responsible for these men and thank God. That would never hurt

431
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:50,655
Turn my life or had one get hurt working with me and I don't want I don't want to start now

432
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,591
The one minute warning

433
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,615
Fire officials

434
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:01,151
On hand to monitor the black

435
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,687
Moving closer in

436
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,967
Put their earplugs in place

437
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:06,783
After 35 years of Drilling and Blasting

438
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:13,439
Stuart wears hearing aids in both ears

439
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:19,839
Can I pair a rag up or something stick it in your ear the countdown is finally over Stewart hands the Detonator

440
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:20,863
The blast man

441
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,655
Shout out the final warning

442
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:32,127
Sounds good sounds good when we get down

443
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:38,783
Funny things about shooting you never know till you get back down there what you got

444
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,599
Returns on the fan

445
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,135
Clear the smoke out of the tunnel

446
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:45,183
And head for the sandhogs locker room

447
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:45,951
The hog house

448
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,743
Located in a nearby trailer

449
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,279
For some barbecued ribs

450
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,815
The game of gin rummy

451
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,119
18

452
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,143
I love it

453
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:54,911
Weather

454
00:20:55,935 --> 00:21:01,823
I'm riding with Amanda people that I've met I've met some of the greatest people in the world

455
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,103
And

456
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:06,943
Beginning I guess your blood after a while

457
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,735
It's really all you want to do

458
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:12,831
There is a price sandhogs pay for this love of the tunnels

459
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,367
You age

460
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,391
You wage

461
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,159
And a whole

462
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:17,440
Sodus Bay

463
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,976
Many retired sand

464
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,768
Kiwi bar is one of them

465
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,304
Suffer from silicosis

466
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,840
From years of Reading Rock

467
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:24,864
Down in the tunnel

468
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:26,144
And caissons

469
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,960
Deterioration of the bone from working in

470
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:29,728
Compressed air

471
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,520
That puts a hurting on your body so

472
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:36,128
You can ask any of the old-timers that joints hurt

473
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:36,896
You know

474
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,688
El Ricon Del Rey

475
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:41,760
I don't think there's anyone who works as hard as a rock

476
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:44,320
Two men would gloat about a yard of sand in about

477
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,856
The two-and-a-half to three minutes

478
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:48,416
And this because I continuously for 6 hours

479
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,440
What are the stop

480
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:50,976
I don't think there's anybody

481
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:52,768
Stand up with that kind of work

482
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:58,144
But I never go to coming in and I'm I'm never ashamed of being what I am

483
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:01,472
And this is what I am

484
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:08,128
When the ribbon-cutting ceremony is finally held for City Tunnel number 3

485
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,200
Scheduled for completion in the year 2025

486
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:13,760
Most of the sandhogs working on the project

487
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:15,808
Livia retired or have died

488
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:18,880
61 year old Lincoln Richard may not be around

489
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:22,464
But he says there's satisfaction and just knowing he was part of it

490
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:25,024
Every time you know I go down and I

491
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,560
Come out after 8 hours

492
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:29,632
I see what I've made my contribution

493
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,936
I don't know what you doing

494
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:34,496
It's that people would be able to

495
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:39,616
Enjoy it in future years this is something that I thought I'd died and gone it would be still there

496
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,432
Because we're doing something that

497
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:44,736
New York City would always have

498
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,016
Federation

499
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:48,576
Any mechanics that look at another way

500
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:52,160
Eliminate all the tunnels the sandhogs have built over the years

501
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,696
The Lincoln the Holland

502
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:57,024
The Brooklyn Battery the Long Island and Pennsylvania Railroads

503
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:57,792
The subways

504
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,328
And you get an idea

505
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:01,120
Of the extent to which sandhogs

506
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,656
Help build New York

507
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:05,472
What picture of picture New York City if you will

508
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:10,336
What barge is going across bringing people across some fairies

509
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:15,200
And the best ferry system in the world can carry about 80,000 people in a rush hour

510
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:17,760
That's like from 6 a.m. to 10:11

511
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:18,528
I am

512
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,832
A tunnel can do that in

513
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:21,856
20 minutes

514
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,904
Without that

515
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:27,232
Progressive people coming back and forth

516
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,536
Manhattan would be a Dead Island

517
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:35,680
Manhattan would have been nothing you wouldn't why would you build anything for if you couldn't get people in and out

518
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:43,360
3 years and 7 months it took to complete run to by the Lincoln Tunnel

519
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:47,968
It open to traffic December 22nd 1937

520
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,016
Through the Lincoln Tunnel

521
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:54,624
Traffic moves with the speed I'm safety a hundred people over the river

522
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,160
A new link

523
00:23:56,416 --> 00:24:01,024
Joint Base of New Jersey and New York a great engineering Z

524

00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:50,688
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices were immersed in a cluttered world of man-made

532
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,456
Sound

533
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:58,112
If I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexis talking to me in my

534
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:02,720
Wife is another word for all hearing that voice

535
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:04,512
Technology talk to us

536
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:06,816
It is a creation of Sonic trash

537
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:13,472
That's Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

538
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:15,264
To make them more human

539
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,360
Turn the living room lights on

540
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:20,896
Okay

541
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:23,456
Dim the living room lights to 50%

542
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:25,504
Okay

543
