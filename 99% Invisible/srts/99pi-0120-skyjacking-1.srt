I'm Roman Mars

28
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,136
The term hijacking

29
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:33,440
Goes back to Prohibition days

30
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,208
When

31
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,000
Gangsters would

32
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:36,768
Stop

33
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,304
Trucks carrying moonshine

34
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:44,704
And they come up to the guy in the cab with their pistol and pointed their face and say Hold Your Hand hijack

35
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:48,032
And they take all the liquor and then drive off at the truck

36
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:54,432
But in the early days of commercial air travel the thought that someone would hijack a plane was scarcely

37
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,456
Even considered

38
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:00,576
When they created government oversight of aviation in 1858

39
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:01,856
The Congressional

40
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,904
I did that did not

41
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,696
Nick hijacking a crime

42
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,744
Because no one had foreseen

43
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,024
Did anyone

44
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,560
And in a country like America

45
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:13,888
Where are theoretically if you wanted to go somewhere I could just buy it

46
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,168
To go there no one

47
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,704
Assume that any American ever do

48
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:27,200
And Brenda Nike Runner author of the Skies belong to us love and Terror in the Golden Age of hijacking says

49
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:29,760
Feather design of airport terminals

50
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:30,784
Reflected that

51
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,576
It's hard to Fathom now

52
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:35,392
You could literally get out of a taxi at the curb in

53
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,184
Walk to the terminal

54
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,720
Walk onto the tarmac.

55
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,256
The top of the boarding stairs

56
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:42,048
Turning onto the plane itself

57
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,584
Without a ticket

58
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,632
Without showing anyone your identification

59
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:49,472
Sooner than anyone searching your personal or your luggage

60
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,496
In any way shape or

61
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:56,128
So it was a very much similar to getting on a train and that was by design by the airline

62
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:02,272
Then starting in 1961 an epidemic of hijackings began

63
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,808
It really wasn't epidemic

64
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:09,184
And I mean that in saying that the devirus the behavioral virus mutated over time

65
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:11,232
What kind of basic features of

66
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,512
Did hijacking change

67
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:16,608
The first phase of skyjackers

68
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,888
May 1st

69
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,936
61 was the first American hijacking

70
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:23,008
Perpetrated by antulio Ramirez ortiz

71
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,032
He was kind of a

72
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,872
Someone mentally Disturbed electrician in Miami

73
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,664
Got on 80 westbound

74
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,432
White

75
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,456
Announce

76
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:36,832
With a holding a knife to the pilots throat that he had been hired to assassinate Castro

77
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:42,208
Fidel Castro and wanted to go there to warn Castro about this

78
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:51,168
In the second phase

79
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:53,728
The skyjackers broaden their Horizons

80
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,008
Two more distant lands

81
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:58,592
My favorite example is Amanda and Raffaele minichiello

82
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,896
Italian American Marine

83
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:03,712
Who actually went from Los Angeles to Rome

84
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:04,992
Howard Hewett

85
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:09,088
Hell of a hero upon landing and Ashley and up only doing 18 months in prison

86
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:12,672
Extradite him while she charged him with hijack

87
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:15,232
And after that

88
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,327
Signing a contract to start a spaghetti western film

89
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:24,959
Very good-looking guy then skyjackers more than the classic kidnappers demanding Ransom

90
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,239
Tamanna started this was a

91
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:29,567
Mini Mart agates Barkley unemployed truck driver had a

92
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,103
Whiskey with the IRS

93
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,127
And he actually hijacked

94
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:32,895
Plane from

95
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:35,455
Phoenix to Washington DC where he demanded

96
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,759
100 million dollars

97
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:41,343
In cash to be given to him by the Supreme Court

98
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:44,159
Enraged and taken attacks

99
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,463
So that kind of setup is last phase of the

100
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:47,999
People started asking

101
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:48,767
Confirm

102
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,071
Tons of money and gold bars

103
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,119
Creative liquor and cigarettes

104
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,911
Anything your heart desires

105
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,959
100000 in cash

106
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,751
Getaway car

107
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,311
I want the letter m

108
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,079
Stricken from

109
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:02,847
English slang

110
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,407
And all the while

111
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:09,247
Hijacking was never considered that serious a threat by the airlines

112
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,783
Or the passengers really

113
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,575
He was more of an inconvenience in any

114
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:18,463
Assumption of part of passengers was that well we know the airlines will fly is down to Havana

115
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:22,815
The hijack will be taken off a plane will maybe have to spend the night in Havana will

116
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,095
Capital hotel

117
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:30,495
Maybe buy some cigars and rum from relative and go to the 6 show with Fredo and Daniel

118
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:36,127
We'll have a good story to tell the next cocktail party back in the US

119
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:42,527
It was taken lightly because the notion that this could really be something destructive and turn into mass murder

120
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,063
Was not sending people to mind at that

121
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:50,719
And because this guy jackings weren't especially violent and the passengers weren't yet demanding extra security they are

122
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:54,047
Fought to keep things exactly as they were

123
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,583
The airlines were scared

124
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:59,935
They thought that if they treated all their customers kind of like criminal suspect

125
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,471
Because they were merely flying

126
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,751
People wouldn't fly anymore

127
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,799
People with drive-thru destinations

128
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:05,567
Instead

129
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,919
Do the airlines put a lot of roadblocks whenever someone especially in government

130
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:10,687
Mention the

131
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:11,711
Concept of having

132
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,759
Physical screening of all passenger

133
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,295
They would shoot that down

134
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,599
He's all their older lobbyist muscle

135
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,623
Shut that down

136
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:21,183
They really Force the FAS hand

137
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,975
To come up with the weakest

138
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:24,511
That must have been security

139
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,279
Improvements

140
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:31,679
BFA the Federal Aviation Administration is the US government body that is responsible for the safety and regulation

141
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,959
Up civil aviation

142
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:36,287
This is all in the name of well we can put up with some hijack

143
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:40,639
Does Costas however 2030 grand for hijacking

144
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,943
Convenience and whatnot

145
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,319
Or they could pay millions and millions on x-ray machine screenings and security personnel

146
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,855
For the airlines

147
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,391
Smart Financial choices

148
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,159
Is clear

149
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,695
I put up with the tree out of hijack

150
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,743
Reply totally

151
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,815
And keep the customer experience in the ground the same

152
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:02,911
But clearly something had to be done

153
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:07,775
If the airlines were unwilling to consider a mandatory screening and checkpoints inside the terminal

154
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:11,871
Some less intrusive and somewhat Xenia Solutions

155
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,407
Had to be considered

156
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:17,503
So in 1968 the FAA created a special anti-hijacking

157
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,575
Task force to come up with some solution of each

158
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:24,159
Palatable to the airlines actually open it up for public comment

159
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:27,999
Invited to the public to submit suggestions about how this could be done

160
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:31,583
The most common suggestion was complete capitulation

161
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,351
Quote

162
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:36,959
Provide free transportation to Cuba for those persons leaving the United States

163
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:42,335
Another tactic that was seriously considered by the Federal Aviation Administration

164
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:45,151
What's the build a phony Havana Airport

165
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,431
In South Florida

166
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:49,759
Phidias this time all the skyjackers want to go to Havana

167
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:53,343
So you kind of just fly them out over the water and then turn back and

168
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,415
Atlanta Pacific airport in arrested when they got off the plane was

169
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,183
The big idea

170
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:01,535
Try not to be too expensive that it would have cost prohibitive so they couldn't do that solution

171
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:07,679
But there were also a lot of delightful Technical Solutions whose patents

172
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,471
Are so much fun to read

173
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,287
There's a hijacker ejection seat

174
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:15,615
There was also one patent for an injector seat

175
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,151
Which would have a quote

176
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:22,015
Hypodermic injection apparatus arrange for driving the needle of a hypodermic syringe

177
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,807
Ruben seat cushion

178
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:27,391
Into the passenger to instantly kill the passenger

179
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,743
The more you act like Wile E coyote tomorrow

180
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:36,863
There was a trap door that was patented that would go right outside of cockpit and lock

181
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:40,191
The hijacker in cutting plexiglass chamber

182
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,983
Make Me Brave

183
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:44,287
Brought to Justice when a plane landed

184
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:50,687
The public proposed that Pilots depressurize the aircraft or expel sleeping gas throughout the cabin so that

185
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,223
Everyone falls asleep

186
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:56,063
Country would go out with oxygen tanks and disarm the hijacker

187
00:08:56,319 --> 00:09:02,463
One that I loved actually was giving all the passengers boxing gloves and making them wear boxing gloves the duration of the

188
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:05,791
Siri being that you can't hold a gun

189
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,839
If you have boxing gloves on your hands

190
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:13,727
Of course then there would be an epidemic of extremely ill-advised boxing matches at 30,000 ft

191
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:18,079
But the real thing at the end up going with

192
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,103
Was this

193
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,127
Behavioral

194
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:22,431
Profile now sure the one thing about

195
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,735
Cathay Airline terminal there was one

196
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,271
Place you had to halt

197
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,807
General in that was a ticket age

198
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,599
She get a boarding pass or to purchase

199
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,367
Is a ticket

200
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,647
There are many more tickets

201
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,671
Purchase on site

202
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,975
So this is the one choke point

203
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,023
In the terminal experience

204
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,863
TFA solution was to train a ticket agent

205
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,399
In this

206
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:44,191
25 Behavioral

207
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,215
Cues that might indicate

208
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:45,983
It's someone it is

209
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,263
Is a temple Skyjack

210
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:51,103
These were things like not maintaining appropriate eye contact

211
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,895
Not caring about your luggage

212
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:55,199
Wearing Military Surplus Gear

213
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,735
And if you saw any of the

214
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:57,759
Traits

215
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,783
Behavioral traits

216
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,063
A customer

217
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,111
Through to get a ticket or boarding pass

218
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:08,767
You would Dre discreetly are asked if they go to a room on the side and be searched

219
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,303
This was not a good solution

220
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:13,887
And the real problem is that ticket agent or not security personnel

221
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,167
They're dealing with

222
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:15,935
Hundred

223
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,703
Hundred

224
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:17,727
Hundreds of

225
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,031
Often very harried customers

226
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:20,799
Per day

227
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,615
And so they're not the people truly identify

228
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:26,687
Even if you assume these behavioral Q-tip off

229
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:32,319
Work and it turned out to be a bad assumption because plenty of skyjackers pass-through without notice

230
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:37,183
He was meant to be very low impact solution at the one show point that already existed in Arabic

231
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:38,719
Was really a failure

232
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:45,887
But the solution that we all know that eventually came up with screaming everybody and their luggage with x-ray machines

233
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,191
Requiring ID all the things that make

234
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,239
The airport the horrible place it is

235
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,287
Wasn't seriously considered

236
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,847
Until one hijacking changed ever

237
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,407
This is a really forgotten

238
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,687
Really pivotal moment

239
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,711
An American

240
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:03,039
Security history this is on November 1972

241
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:04,831
Kind of tail end of this

242
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:08,671
Really crazy hijackings went after the neck

243
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,439
People asking for

244
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,719
Huge amounts of money

245
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:14,047
Then you have these Three Fugitives

246
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:17,119
From the law who hijacked Southern Airways

247
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,143
As flight 49

248
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,935
Detroit

249
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:22,239
They had a grievance of the Detroit police

250
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,007
And they wanted

251
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,543
10 million dollars

252
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,103
And they said they didn't get it

253
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,895
They were going to crash.

254
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:29,663
Plane

255
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:32,479
Into the Oak Ridge National Laboratory

256
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,015
Senior Knoxville Tennessee

257
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:38,623
At the heart of that Laboratories actually a uranium-235 react

258
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:45,279
All the sudden everyone realized an airplane could be a weapon of mass destruction in this case threatening to turn East

259
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,583
Eastern Tennessee into a nuclear Wasteland

260
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,375
And that's really when the light goes on

261
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,679
For the Airlines and the government

262
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:54,239
That the current situation is no longer tenable

263
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,519
Fortunately they escaped

264
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:59,871
Cataclysm there what happened to the the airline doesn't have 10 million dogs have 2 million

265
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:03,455
Has landed in Chattanooga Tennessee to pick up the money

266
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:08,063
Andy hijacking by that time and actually drunk all the liquor on the planes were completely

267
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:08,831
Be bombed

268
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:11,391
And they bring on a 50 pound of cash

269
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,415
A lot of money in there

270
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:15,231
I think it's $10 and so they actually didn't bother to count it

271
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:19,839
Who is taking forever to count that much money anyway who never takes them into consideration

272
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:24,703
Hijackers eventually landed airplane in Havana or Cuban authorities captured

273
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,495
Crisis averted but

274
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,543
Shortly after that you have the

275
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,335
Executive order mandating

276
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:33,663
Universal physical screen to start on January 5th 97

277
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,199
3 in the airlines put up

278
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:41,087
The airline's really wanted the government

279
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,903
Provide airport security for the government reviews

280
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:50,559
And the airlines hired contractors to do airport screenings and run the metal detectors at the airlines desk

281
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,839
Really trying to avoid

282
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:55,935
And they put them in Jericho 1973 and there's literally not

283
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,471
Single hijack

284
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,007
In American airspace.

285
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:04,895
159 Skyjack in the US from 1961 to 1972

286
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,199
And they really change the nature of air travel

287
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:11,295
Even though most of this history is completely forgotten along with the

288
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,343
Image of the deranged

289
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:16,927

291
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,999
Conception of hijack

292
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,279
Actor change dramatically

293
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:24,351
Any ATM response to specifically the

294
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,887
TWA hijacking

295
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:26,911
In Lebanon in

296
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:30,239
5A hijacking associated

297
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,007
With

298
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,031
Islamic terrorism

299
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,079
A real kind of

300
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,359
Scary Prospect

301
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,383
You know something

302
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,919
People didn't understand

303
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:38,943
Name of the real boogeyman

304
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:43,039
I think once we kind of have that image

305
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,319
Famous image of the

306
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,343

Weeding out of the cockpit

312
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,791
We completely forgot about the

313
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,559
It's kind of more

314
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,583
Quaint hijackers

315
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,863
You want to go to Havana

316
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,655
Get a bad experience in Vietnam

317
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,447
That's what I think about more

318
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,215
It's really

319
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,495
Scarier crime

320
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,031
Crime of kind of a

321
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:07,103
An enemy we don't really understand or know very much about

The hijacker was

326
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,831
And that image remains today

9-11-2001

A date which was preceded by an entire decade free of any commercial airlines carjackings in US airspace

330
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:34,239
After 9/11 the airlines finally got with a lot before back when mandatory screenings were introduced in nineteen

332
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:38,079
The government took over security of our nation's Airport

It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

357
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:02,303
Makes for a much more natural experience

358
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,351
