A very different Kickstarter message written and recorded yesterday

20
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:46,496
We launched the kickstarter campaign for season 3 of 99% invisible on July 11th

21
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,312
In about 24 hours later

22
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,336
We reached

23
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,616
The kickstarter goal

24
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,176
I can't thank you enough

25
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:58,016
It was one of those amazing things I've ever been a part of really stunning

26
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:02,112
I didn't even have time to release an episode announcing the kickstarter

27
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,648
But now

28
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,184
I have a new goal

29
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:06,720
Personal goal

30
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,256
Five

31
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:09,792
I want

32
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:10,816
5

33
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:11,584
Thousand

34
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:12,864
Kickstarter

35
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:16,192
Play did any level the minimum is a dollar

36
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:17,472
A dollar

37
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:18,496
At any level

38
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,848
There are meeting prices at all different kind of levels you can go up to $10,000

39
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,896
Awesome t-shirts and posters and notebooks

40
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:29,504
It's all stuff that I had someone design because I wanted these items myself

41
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,344
But I'm not even talking about those levels necessarily I'm just counting backers

42
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,880
People who pledge

43
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,672
On Kickstarter for the show

44
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:37,696
At any amount

45
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,488
This is my new

46
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,280
Crazily ambitious

47
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:45,376
Personal goal 5000 backers none like the original Kickstarter goal

48
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:48,192
This one will likely fail

49
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:50,752
But if you hit every goal easily

50
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,288
You're not setting them High Enough

51
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:54,592
Fortune favors the Bold my friend

52
00:02:55,104 --> 00:03:01,248
Always remember that. Org to find the link to donate work go to Kickstarter and do a search

53
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:07,648
On the show 5000 doctors that came to me as a number because I want to send a message to the people who

54
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:14,048
Who control the money in public media that if my little show conceited it like little radio station of kalw in San Francisco

55
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:20,448
So can be this successful and get massive widespread support from people online

56
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:26,848
Then they will all learn to take risks and fun people who make things that are personal and authentic

57
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:33,248
I'm talking about thumbing my nose at the man I want to inspire everyone else to be bold and know that if they take

58
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:39,648
Delete and try something great that's maybe a little different like in a regular blank radio show about architecture

59
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:46,048
Well that there are people out there who will help at least 5000 people

60
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:48,096
That will be so bad

61
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:54,496
Any amount 5,000 people I'm going to break Kickstarter across the servers I want one of those

62
00:03:54,752 --> 00:04:00,896
Crazy Kickstarter success stories to be about a little public radio show instead of the high-tech Gadget

63
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,688
Wouldn't that be cool

64
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:06,016
99percentinvisible. Org there just do a search on Kickstarter

65
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,808
Be one of the five

66
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:10,880
Here's the show

67
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,256
This is 99% invisible

68
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,280
I'm Roman Mars

69
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:29,823
The hotel on the very prominent corner of Touhy and Kilbourn Avenue in Lincolnwood Illinois used to be the

70
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,615
Towns most famous building

71
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,175
The first Hyatt Hotel in all of Chicagoland

72
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,711
Premier accommodation

73
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,271
Top Notch restaurant it was Swank

74
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:44,671
Roberta Flack stay there stay there Michael Jordan stay there

75
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:48,255
Find in Chicago every 13 year old boy in the area

76
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:50,047
Had his bar mitzvah there

77
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,447
Hotel was built in 1960

78
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,727
And it looks it

79
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:05,151
So if you're wondering how much potentially anachronistic Lounge music I'm going to cram into this episode

80
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,687
So it's going to be a

81
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:11,551
Then

82
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,087
Slowly over time

83
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:15,647
It became Lincoln Woods most infamous building

84
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,439
It changed hands

85
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:19,231
Got CD and rundown

86
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:23,839
It was the home of the Midwest fetish fair and Marketplace convention

87
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:29,727
There were drug-fueled sex parties attended by Shady Chicago politicians later convicted of things like

88
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:30,495
Torsion

89
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,519
And of course

90
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:34,335
There was the convicted mobster Allen Dorfman

91
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,639
Who was gunned down in the parking lot

92
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:40,479
That's not why everyone in the area knows the building

93
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:43,295
If you know nothing of its history it's still

94
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,087
Pretty hard to miss

95
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,111
Because

96
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:46,879
It's

97
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:47,903
Purple

98
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,207
Really really

99
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,231
Purple

100
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:56,095
Growing up nearby I always thought it was really

101
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,119
Really

102
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:57,887
Ugly

103
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,447
Lots of people dead

104
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:04,031
Lots of people didn't but everyone had an opinion about it

105
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:10,431
Brooklyn Max infl talking to you now by the way nobody SAS public radio host and Steven British sitcom one

106
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,479
She has a secret

107
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:14,015
About the purple Hotel

108
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,807
My father

109
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,343
Designed it

110
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:25,023
My name is John Max I am a retired architect and former professor

111
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:26,815
UIC

112
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,375
I designed a lot of

113
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,399
Just a building

114
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:39,615
I don't have time for the long by Odette okay I designed a lot of apartment build

115
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,151
Things in Chicago

116
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:44,223
We're here to talk about the purple Hotel

117
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:49,087
I need you say I design my name is Jonas. I'm an architect I designed the proposal

118
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:52,415
My name is John XII I'm an architect

119
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,463
And I was the designer of the purple

120
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,255
Finally

121
00:06:56,767 --> 00:07:00,095
Now you have to understand that when I say the building is purple

122
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:03,167
I don't mean the kind of purple of saying Iris

123
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,191
Store a plum

124
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:06,751
It's purple as an lavender

125
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:11,359
Lavender purple glazed brick all over pretty much the entire thing

126
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:14,431
Which needless to say makes it stand out

127
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,223
Depending on how you look at it

128
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,759
Like a prized Jewel

129
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,039
Or sore thumb

130
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:22,367
What are the few buildings if you see it once you know it

131
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:25,439
You single forever you can't feel

132
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:30,815
It is so purple that after it changed hands the new owners renamed it

133
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:32,863
Purple

134
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,631
Hotel

135
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,191
WBEZ architecture critic

136
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:36,959
Wee Bey

137
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:40,031
I think that it's worth looking at

138
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:45,919
Absent the break the brick I like but I wish you could eat also prom glasses I can filter it out so you don't see

139
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:46,687
The Brick

140
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,223
At least in one trip

141
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,295
And really see how the building hold yourself together structure

142
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,831
I think it's really

143
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:56,415
The way the John was able to put those supports on the outside of the hotel

144
00:07:56,671 --> 00:08:01,535
To get larger floor plates in the middle versus what you want what you want big function spaces

145
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:04,607
And then I get a little mix of green space in the way that I'm

146
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:10,239
So the building is going to stick together with a lot of good things going on there

147
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,543
Architecture

148
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:17,151
The thing that everybody notices first including architects

149
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,687
Would be the

150
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:22,783
I mean I think that if anybody saying that it's not the color that they're lying

151
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,575
Because you can't really look at the building

152
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:25,599
Stop noticing

153
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:26,623
Purple

154
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:30,207
So it's the only purple building around but then

155
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:36,351
You know after that initial wave of color hits you you notice really what a great modernist structure it has

156
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,399
Structure is expressed on the owl

157
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:41,471
Side which is also not something you see everyday anymore

158
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,775
I think it's a wonder

159
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:49,151
That was Jackie cool founding principle of the architectural firm coo and Associates

160
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,943
Will get back to her in a minute

161
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:55,039
The first the story of why and how the building got to be so

162
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,063
Purple

163
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,343
My dad

164
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,367
John Maxson

165
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:01,183
It was commissioned by the pritzkers

166
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,743
The Benedict family in Chicago

167
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,535
And it was

168
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:08,351
The first Hyatt Hotel

169
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,887
In the Midwest

170
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,167
It was called

171
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,191
Hiatus

172
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,727
Have nothing to do with it

173
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:16,031
The purple by the way the purple came

174
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:20,639
Because one of the pritzker say and the big man among them

175
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,687
Fiskars in the family

176
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,223
Ask me what

177
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:24,991
Color

178
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:27,039
Play style I want the news

179
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,831
And I wanted to use Gray

180
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,367
Adhesive install

181
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,671
I like something brighter

182
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:35,231
So I made a mistake of showing him

183
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,511
The samples

184
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,303
Books

185
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,095
Kevin Garnett

186
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,143
3540

187
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,191
Color samples

188
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,215
It sure enough

189
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,751
You pick the purple

190
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,311
And you don't argue with a n pritzker

191
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:59,295
My father tells me the story but I suspect differently

192
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:02,623
He's always gravitated toward bold color choices

193
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:08,511
Our current argument is over bright orange balconies on a building that we always passed he loves them

194
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,791
And I hate

195
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,655
When I was growing up his favorite color was blue a color that to me uses

196
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,191
Suspiciously close

197
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,215
To purple

198
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,519
In fact every house we ever lived in

199
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:22,335
Brick bungalow summer house in the woods

200
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,127
Suburban Barn shaped house

201
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:26,943
Mustard colored siding all had bright

202
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,223
Blue front doors

203
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,759
That my father painted

204
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:33,343
My elementary school bus driver used to call me Blue Door

205
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,135
Upon interrogation

206
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:38,207
My father coughed up is strange Hungarian Lodge

207
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:40,255
In the near East

208
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,071
But ultimately I come from

209
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,399
The blue color on the doors blue and green

210
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:49,471
Is to keep the evil spirits away

211
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,519
So that's a reason

212
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,055
I always suspected

213
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,079
The

214
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,615
Entrance Door

215
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:56,639
Houses

216
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,431
Blue to keep the evil spirits

217
00:10:59,199 --> 00:10:59,711
If it did

218
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:00,991
Do you think it works

219
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,015
Hotel

220
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:06,111
So you don't think the purple kept away the evil eye from the hotel

221
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,647
Not really

222
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,671
Because

223
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:12,255
And that was a murder in the hotel actually there were two

224
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,279
But I digress

225
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:17,119
The beauty of that building is the exposed

226
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,167
Concrete strain

227
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,959
How to tell him sorry

228
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,751
Pulled out of the stuff

229
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,031
Showing

230
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,847
It's like a human being

231
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,407
The skeleton will be on the exterior

232
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,431
Especially

233
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:33,503
That would be weird right now that's that's stick

234
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,807
The building is that column set

235
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:36,831
Pose.

236
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,111
The slap site

237
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,647
Slightly pulled out

238
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,927
It's a Building B

239
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,719
Reviews

240
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,999
It's structures

241
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:47,327
And that is architectural

242
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,119
The interesting thing about

243
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,471
Dudley lullaby

244
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,007
It could be green

245
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:55,775
Okay

246
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,847
It would be the same good or bad built

247
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,919
So as an architect I have to ask you

248
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:06,015
This is a perfect example of

249
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,295
What the

250
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,599
But the difference between what the public sees

251
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,135
And what the Arctic

252
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,975
Because the public sees purple brick

253
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:15,999
Ark

254
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,815
Protecta sitting here saying the purple is so

255
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,095
Unimportant

256
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,375
In the scheme of the building

257
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,911
It means nothing

258
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,959
It's just such a tiny thing but to the

259
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,495
Public that's all it is

260
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,311
That's right because the public is ignorant

261
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,175
Truly ignorant

262
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,735
Well you can't really argue with them there

263
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:39,295
But in our defense and account myself is

264
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,343
One of the public in the scenario

265
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:47,743
It's really really purple Smite how far the purple Hotel fell from its original Glory the

266
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:52,351
Dilapidation the murderer the drug-fueled sex parties and a demolition order

267
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,143
It was not torn down

268
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,167
Time passed

269
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,703
Economy fell to pieces

270
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,751
Mid-century architecture

271
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,543
Slowly came back into Vogue

272
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,335
Mad Men was on TV

273
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:08,991
Purple brick was kind of retro cool. However dim was starting to shine on the building and its future

274
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:15,903
Then the purple Hotel was nominated for landmark status a place on the historic registry

275
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:18,975
There was talk of finding a buyer talk of renovation

276
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:23,583
And then while I was searching and interviewing for this very story

277
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,863
Purple Hotel

278
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:25,631
Went up

279
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:29,727
For auction there was a lot of Pomp and Circumstance in the beginning of

280
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:33,567
You know the auctioneer yelling and saying

281
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,103
Are you ready

282
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,943
Booming voice and then and then

283
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:39,711
And then

284
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,247
Really

285
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,783
There was only one bidder so

286
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:52,767
And that bitter was Jake Weiss of Weiss properties in Skokie which happens to be right next to Lincolnwood

287
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,071
He bought the purple Hotel

288
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:59,423
And why why is a shrewd businessman with a Keen Eye and good instincts

289
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,215
This particular purchase

290
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,239
Was also

291
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:06,591
Labor of love when you have some of that really is just not realizing of the value and it's

292
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,359
Potential

293
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,127
That is such

294
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:12,735
Prime piece of property that bothers you you know it it's part of your neighbor as part of your community

295
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:16,575
And it's something that you really want to see be an asset to the community instead of a blight

296
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,623
Here comes the love part

297
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,671
Separately from that when my

298
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,463
And more importantly I think

299
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:25,023
We almost lived at the purple hotel for a period of time

300
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,303
Maya

301
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:29,119
When my grandfather passed away and my father was saying.

302
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,143
Traditional Cottage

303
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,935
That's the Jewish prayer for the Dead

304
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:36,287
There was no synagogue anywhere in close proximity to where he lived at the time

305
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,359
And because we're Orthodox when I drive on the Sabbath

306
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,407
That was a little bit prohibitive to

307
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,175
City college

308
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,967
There's a very

309
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:51,135
Convenient show right down the block so I'm

310
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,439
Every single job is for a year

311
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:55,743
How we would move into the purple Hotel

312
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,535
Had to accommodate my fathers

313
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,839
Responsibility to say the kaddish for his father

314
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:03,679
So we lived there for about a year every single weekend

315
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:07,775
And you know me my sister at the hotel was our playground

316
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:13,663
And the architect Weiss is chosen to redesign the purple hotel and bring it back to its original luster

317
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:16,479
Is Jackie COO of Jackie Cooper and Associates

318
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:17,503
Also

319
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:20,319
Former student of my father the original architect

320
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,343
John Maxon

321
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:25,695
One of the things that we're looking into is more of a historic

322
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,743
Restoration of the building

323
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:32,351
That would be wonderful I'm especially since we have some of the old drawings

324
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:36,703
The original drawings from the 60s 1961 when it was constructed

325
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,055
And there are a lot of pieces that are still left in the building such as this wonderful

326
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:47,455
Monumental Terrazzo stair with this wood wall behind it I mean you can really see it as a

327
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,223
Kind of

328
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:54,623
You know late 50s early 60s kind of Mad Men era

329
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,415
Pan Am sort of

330
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,695
Hotel

331
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,719
That really could

332
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:04,095
Be very current in today's Hospitality environment

333
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:06,143
Especially in the hospitality Market

334
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,239
For some reason purple is a predominant color not necessarily the color of the brick

335
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:15,103
But an older marketing I mean you'll look at the neon lights and the color of the

336
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,127
Bob card

337
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,151
IMDb

338
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:19,711
Brochures that get printed for some reason

339
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:22,015
Purple is popping and I'm not quite sure why

340
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,135
Have any of your buildings

341
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:27,903
Had

342
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,183
This kind of

343
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:31,231
History this kind of life cycle

344
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,255
But you know

345
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,791
None of them

346
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:39,679
The same way that a person they go through life and you might go through different Cycles yourself and

347
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,983
Everybody goes through different rebellious

348
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,543
Ups and downs

349
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,847
The same holds true for

350
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:51,455
A property like this that really was a character of itself the building was

351
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:55,295
Really a product of the environment around it at any given time and

352
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:58,879
Not too certain extent the fact that the building did change

353
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,415
With the

354
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:03,487
Decades and the environment around it

355
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:06,047
It really is in the building's character

356
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,655
And while it's true that this character this building

357
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,703
This structure of nine lives

358
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,823
Empty at the moment surrounded by board traffic and an empty parking lot

359
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,615
It may just be crouching

360
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:22,943
Gathering it's muster ready to spring back to life

361
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,223
Arresting that traffic

362
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,503
Feeling that parking lot

363
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,551
And spreading like a proud

364
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,855
A purple one

365
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:48,287
99% invisible was produced this week by Gwen Maxon host of ReSound
