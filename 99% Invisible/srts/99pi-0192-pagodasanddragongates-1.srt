I stepped off a plane from Hong Kong to San Francisco International Airport

36

It was his first time on American soil

37
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:45,728
At 22 years old he had left his homeland of China and traveled across the ocean to build a new life for me

00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:55,968
Immigrants first come to the u.s. census in this is such an old Trope in an old story that you expect

41
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:58,272
Yeah the streets are paved with gold

42
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,552

48
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:20,288
Upon generation of Chinese immigrants before him

49
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,824
What's San Francisco's

50
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,592
Chinatown

51
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,176
And he was not impressed

52
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,200
The Gorge

53
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,992
San Francisco Chinatown

54
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,016
Out-of-date

55
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:34,624
All the things he saw in Chinatown these Pagoda roofs these Dragon Gates

56
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,160
These flourishes that

57
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,696
You know to a signal

58
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,464
China

59
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,352
And Tiny's notice there were things that he actually hadn't seen in back in China fur

60
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:47,168
Years and years and years and they were not used in that

61
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,240
Architectural vernacular back there and so

62
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,544
He wondered how Chinatown in this

63
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:55,616
In a relay supposedly modern America was

64
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:58,688
Why did it feel older than oldest parts

65
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,968
14 krona

66
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,016
Because it was designed that way

67
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,064
That's producer Chelsea Davis

68
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,880
For George soy and many other Chinese immigrants

69
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:11,232
San Francisco's Chinatown and the chinatown's in a lot of American cities

70
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:16,352
They don't look much like the China they know it actually

71
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,424
It's a lot of contacts to anything else

72
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,216
Next to it on either side

73
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,520
That's filmmaker Felicia Lowe

74
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:26,592
She made a documentary about San Francisco's Chinatown

75
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,152
Walking around Chinatown together

76
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:31,200
Epass Bank of America ATM

77
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,736
Guarded by gold dragon

78
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:35,040
Shops with neon lit names like

79
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:37,856
Heart of Shanghai selling paper fans in pots

80
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,184
And towering four-story bazaars

81
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,720
Crowned with little pagodas

82
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:45,280
But Chinatown hasn't always looked this way

83
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,656
In fact before the massive earthquake that leveled San Francisco in 1906

84
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:57,312
Chinatown look like most of the other neighborhoods in San Francisco rows of brick homes done up with Victorian

85
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:02,688
Italianate facades do you want anything you recognizes Chinatown other people in it

86
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:06,016
And Chinese signs

87
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,296
Instead of

88
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,320
American

89
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,088
Signs

90
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:12,928
That's Phil Choi a retired architect and historian of Chinese America

91
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,232
He grew up in San

92
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,000
Cisco's China

93
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,791
And still live there today

94
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,071
He says

95
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:22,911
It's not like Chinese immigrants in SF had strong opinions either way

96
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,935
About their neighborhoods

97
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:24,703
Victorian flourish

98
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:25,983
The columns

99
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:26,751
The porches

100
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:27,519
Beijing

101
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,799
Didn't have much

102
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,591
Choice when it came to where they live

103
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:35,967
After arriving in America they moved into the old homes that white people had abandoned for greener pasture

104
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,551
And after that basically the Chinese didn't have

105
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,319
Time

106
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,879
To really pay attention to

107
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,951
The architecture or creating

108
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,999
Chinese architecture

109
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,535
The basic

110
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,583
Desire was to make a living

111
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,399
And making a living with easier said than done

112
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,447
If you were Chinese in early 20th

113
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,263
Since the 1860

114
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,823
Chinese immigrants have been a convenience

115
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,871
Scapegoat for Nationwide job short

116
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,151
The result

117
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:08,735
Was Federal legislation like the 1882 Chinese

118
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:09,503
Exclusion Act

119
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,831
Which bar the vast majority of Chinese people from entering the

120
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:13,599
Estate

121
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,927
And made it impossible for Chinese already in the US

122
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,463
Become New American

123
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,231
And citizens

124
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:25,887
In San Francisco racist housing policies made it almost impossible for people of Chinese Heritage to live

125
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,167
Outside of Chinatown

126
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:32,031
And when they did set foot outside the 15 square blocks of the Chinese Enclave

127
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:34,335
It was at the risk of physical violence

128
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:38,943
So the self-contained world of Chinatown serves as a desperately needed Refuge

129
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:39,967
4 Chinese stamp

130
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,015
But in 1906

131
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:44,319
That Refuge would be eviscerated

132
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,111
Buy a double whammy

133
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:46,879
I'm a disaster

134
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:54,303
Early in the morning of April 18th of that year San Francisco magnitude earthquake

135
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:57,631
It was the biggest quake in the cities recorded history

136
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:03,263
But those violent Tremors were just the beginning

137
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,311
Shattered the cities gas means

138
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:09,151
And the gas that leaked out somewhere it connected

139
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,431
With a spark

140
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:16,063
The massive fire that resulted lasted for three days and destroyed about 500 city blocks

141
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,135
Chinatown was one of the first neighborhoods to go up in smoke

142
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,159
The safe space

143
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:23,999
For Chinese release at 15 block radius of the neighborhood and without it

144
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,047
Give me something very dangerous

145
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,071
Situation

146
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,351
Andrea Davies

147
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,911
This is a historian at the Stanford Humanities Center

148
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:36,031
But before her career in Academia she was in a slightly different line of work

149
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:38,335
I was a San Francisco firefighter

150
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,127
For about 5 years

151
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,687
And so my first assignment was trying to tell

152
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,831
Fighting fires in that neighborhood later LED Davies to write a Social history of the 1906 cutkosky

153
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,903
She says that in the wake of the disaster

154
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,695
Newspapers pedal this

155
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,975
You'll goodies story

156
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:58,047
But the SF quake and fire where social equalizers

157
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,863
That the shared experience of suffering

158
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:04,447
United San franciscans of all colors and creeds

159
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:06,751
Man helping man and so on

160
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:09,055
But while white man may have helped

161
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:09,823
White man

162
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,871
No one was open the Chinese

163
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:15,199
And the racism against them only intensified

164
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:17,503
I called Heiden post-disaster race

165
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,831
You could see this heightened racism happening on at least

166
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:21,599
Two level

167
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,671
First with individual White Sands

168
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,207
The built environment

169
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,231
Everyone in there

170
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:27,999
Your place

171
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,535
And that's what gets erase

172
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:32,863
So

173
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,423
If you're an elite White San Francisco and you don't have

174
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:38,239
The residence of China Town unless you go there

175
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,263
As

176
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:44,895
The Chinese are leaving their homes in desperation they're being yelled at to get out

177
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,431
And don't turn back

178
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,319
And according to Davies it wasn't just private citizens who were guilty of that heightened racism

179
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:56,927
Because the second place that the fire spur to flare up and racism

180
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:00,255
Wasn't how the recovery efforts were managed

181
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,279
The fire department

182
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,559
Did very little to

183
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,583
Stop it in China

184
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,119
And in fact made it worse

185
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:06,911
MN water main depth

186
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,679
Broken so there

187
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:08,959
Not wet enough water

188
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,263
Is if you look at

189
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,031
Chinatown

190
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,567
Which is nestled right against

191
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:14,335
Nob Hill

192
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,359
We're all the elite manga

193
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,919
All the water goes

194
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,967
Bridge by the mayor to save nod

195
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,527
And all the dynamite

196
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,063
Goes into

197
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,415
At the time fire departments would Dynamite buildings

198
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,695
To keep fire from spreading

199
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:33,279
But the fire department use the wrong kind of dynamite

200
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,583
In Chinatown burned all the faster

201
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,119
In the following days

202
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,911
At the Embers of Chinatown

203
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,959
The Chinese found themselves

204
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:41,727
Homeless

205
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,263
A new Leaf vulnerable

206
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,287
And hostel Street

207
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:45,823
But things

208
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,103
We're about to get worse

209
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:50,431
So many of the city's political and Business Leaders

210
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,479
Or actually excited about

211
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,247
The social

212
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,527
Equalizing disaster

213
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,599
Because of the Limited in Chinatown and they thought will never be

214
00:08:59,135 --> 00:08:59,903
Before the quake

215
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,951
Many whites it's in the Chinese Navy

216
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,511
At the Camorra of opium dens

217
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,303
Prostitution and disease

218
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,095
In 1885

219
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:11,167
City Hall had prepared a municipal report on China

220
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,703
And in that report

221
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,983
Hate yourself

222
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:18,079
Of documentation listing all the houses of

223
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:24,735
Prostitution and the number of gambling houses and opium dens throughout China

224
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,039
This reputation for Vice

225
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:30,623
Had actually created a minor industry of Slum tourism

226
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,647
In Chinatown

227
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:37,023
Thrill-seeking white people could hire a guide to lead them through scenes of alleged

228
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:37,791
Depravity

229
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:42,399
It would be taken through dimly-lit building then shown opium smokers

230
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,167
Person prostitute

231
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,191
Sam gambling

232
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:48,543
Evidence suggests that some of these scenes may have actually been staged

233
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,823
By the gods themselves

234
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:53,663
And one thing that was definitely fake was a widespread rumor

235
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,711
That San Francisco's Chinese resident

236
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:59,807
Lived in underground tunnels this is what they really believe

237
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:04,927
That the Chinese lived underground and even today

238
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,975
People wants to see

239
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,023
Chinatown Underground

240
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,559
On top of all this

241
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:14,143
Chinatown was right in the middle of choice downtown rio

242
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:17,215
Real Estates at San Franciscan Elite

243
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,495
Had long wanted

244
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,519
For white business

245
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,055
In fact

246
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:21,823
2 years

247
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,847
Before the fire

248
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:25,407
Then-mayor James Phelan had hired an architect

249
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,431
Back to drive sketch

250
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,455
Free nude

251
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,271
The architect they hire

252
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,295
You may have heard of it

253
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:32,575
Daniel

254
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,343
Burnham

255
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,391
And in his plan there is no

256
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:42,303
Burnham was a proponent of the city beautiful movement and urban planning philosophy popular in the late 19th and early

257
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,071
20th century

258
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,863
And this idea of City beautiful

259
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,143
Biracial

260
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,167
Review

261
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,447
And the idea is

262
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,263
A more beautiful Urban environment create

263
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,567
My beautiful citizen

264
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:56,127
Like we want a beautiful city of well-educated

265
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,151
Citizens

266
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:57,919
Everyone is

267
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:01,759
White and productive and with China Town burn to the ground

268
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,807
City leaders seize the chance

269
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,111
Make that white dream a reality

270
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,671
Within a week of the fire

271
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,975
City Hall created a committee dedicated

272
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:11,743
Solely

273
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,511
To relocating

274
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,279
Chinatown

275
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,351
The group included former mayor James Phelan

276
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:19,935
The one you would hired Burnham to drive those revised draft

277
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,471
Cisco

278
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,519
And so the minute the city Goes Up in Flames

279
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,567
I'm not kidding I don't think so

280
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:26,847
Burning

281
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,127
And James feeling is

282
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,151
Telegraph

283
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,175
Daniel Burnham

284
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,967
Send more reports

285
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,759
Immediately get them at the hands of the

286
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,551
The city leaders and Business Leaders

287
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,855
Here's our plan we can rebuild

288
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,623
Here's the perfect

289
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,439
The plan for that perfect City

290
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:44,255
Who did the Chinese all the way to Hunters Point

291
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:46,047
A region on the edge of town

292
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,095
It's where the city slaughterhouse

293
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,447
But it wasn't long before the Chinese residents found out about

294
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,239
And they fought back

295
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:57,567
And I think they fought back very intelligently

296
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,615
They got china's empress

297
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,407
Dowager Sochi involve

298
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,967
She sent her consul-general from Washington

299
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,759
To meet with San Francisco officials

300
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,551
But the coup de gras

301
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,575
Was Financial

302
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,111
For decades

303
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:13,183
San Francisco had been a key hub for trade

304
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:13,951
What's China

305
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:16,255
So a group of the Cities

306
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:22,655
Chinese business owners wrote to the current mayor in a language San Francisco officials could ease

307
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,423
Totally understand

308
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:26,495
And so the on the business level of the negotiation was

309
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,775
Okay you don't want us to

310
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,311
Come back we're not going to Hunters

311
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,359
WinCo Tacoma

312
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,383
Weather Portland

313
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,687
What is a panic of a loss of Revenue

314
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:37,503
And that was a loss that city leaders

315
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,271
Couldn't take

316
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,831
Less than a month after the quake

317
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,111
The mayor dissolve

318
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,647
What is committee to relocate chine

319
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:49,279
For Chinese Americans at this time this was an unprecedented political victory

320
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,071
But they didn't stop there

321
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:53,375
The fire had left Chinatown

322
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,399
Blank slate

323
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,447
And for the first time

324
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,983
The Chinese were holding the

325
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,871
They were sick of Chinatown getting this bad rap for Vice

326
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,919
Sick of City Hall harassing them

327
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:08,991
Sick of visitors asking them if they lived in tunnels

328
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,295
The Chinese wanted makeover

329
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,319
For their neighborhood

330
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:16,671
And an American Born Chinese businessman named looked in Eli

331
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,463
You just had to go about it

332
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:21,023
The word was build me a pagoda

333
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,815
That's Felicia low again

334
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,631
She says that look Tennille I figured

335
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,911
Hey if Taurus

336
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,959
Are always going to come to Chinatown

337
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:29,983
Seeking a taste

338
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,519
If some imaginary is

339
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:36,639
Let's give them what they want and so he was able to hire white architect

340
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:39,967
To create a Chinatown that looked

341
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,247
The way

342
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:44,063
White people imagine Chinatown to look

343
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,855
Even though he knew

344
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,391
In his own mind that

345
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:50,207
The buildings in China didn't all look like this

346
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:54,559
That looks plan might seem a bit counterintuitive at first

347
00:13:55,071 --> 00:14:00,191
For decades the Chinese of San Francisco had been harassed precisely because they look

348
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:02,751
And dress differently from mainstream White America

349
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,287
And he was the guy saying

350
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,335
Let's rebuild our neighborhood in a way that

351
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,127
Emphasizes are foreigners

352
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:12,991
The cars are different from the rest of the city into the very face of our buildings

353
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,271
The bunny soy

354
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,551
Whose father had been

355
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,575
Flummoxed by the look

356
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:19,135
Chinatown when he arrived in San Francisco

357
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:22,975
She says that the Chinese community of 1907

358
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,767
Saw a positive side to that

359
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,535
Foreignness

360
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,607
And they also were pretty Savvy with the fact that

361
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:32,191
People were interested in them and they were interested in this exotic

362
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,239
Element and if they could

363
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:37,055
Bill that in a way that was attractive

364
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,847
Instead of repellent

365
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,127
But that would be

366
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:41,919
Protective

367
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:42,687
For them

368
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,223
Look hired an architect

369
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,015
Text name t Patterson Ross

370
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:48,319
And an engineer named aw Burger

371
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:49,855
These two men

372
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,391
Had never been to China

373
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,671
At the time

374
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,695
The architect

375
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,463
Or not

376
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:57,535
Train did the tradition or anything about

377
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,071
Oriental architecture

378
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,607
Because

379
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:05,727
Also at the time the Orion was consider way behind the West

380
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,263
So

381
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,311
Culturally everything

382
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:12,383
Was look down upon that say

383
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,175
There's nothing to study about

384
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:20,831
Rothenburg runs knowledge of China was limited to a few images they seen of ancient palaces from the

385
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,855
The Song Dynasty

386
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:25,951
An architectural style that was already hundreds of years old

387
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,487
By the early 20th century

388
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:31,583
But that didn't stop Ross and brogren from using their imagination

389
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,399
I know how they use their imagination

390
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:38,495
They created the sort of Disneyland effect

391
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:42,847
Prince the sing Chong building was topped with a small structure that

392
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,895
Sort of look like a pagoda

393
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:50,783
The choice has that in China you typically wouldn't see a pagoda on top of another building

394
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:53,599
Pagodas there are free-standing structures

395
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,647
Not a decorative flourish

396
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,927
And secondly

397
00:15:57,183 --> 00:16:03,327
In China these were The Monuments for religious purposes of the religion of Buddhism

398
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:07,167
Here and it's San Franciscan for him the Pagoda Inn

399
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:09,215
Stead houses in Monument 2

400
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:09,983
Consumers

401
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:14,591
Sing cheong became a bustling department store Hocking Asian art

402
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:15,871
Which it still is

403
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:16,895
To this day

404
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:22,783
But nonetheless the designers that looked in Eli hired created a striking building

405
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:25,343
Another Merchants rebuilding in Chinatown

406
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,879
Couldn't help but notice

407
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:34,559
Soon sing Chong's bombastic chinoiserie look had become dstyle Foremost New structures

408
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,583
Is going up in China

409
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:40,959
The Architects were trying to reproduce Beijing in San Francisco may have gotten a lot of the details wrong

410
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:42,239
But for the Taurus

411
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,543
They were wrong in all the right

412
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,311
Waves

413
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,079
Taurus

414
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,615
Loved the new trident

415
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:52,223
This was exactly the Westerner friendly version of China they want

416
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,015
Vaguely exotic

417
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:56,063
But safe enough for middle class

418
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:56,831
White America

419
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,647
Visitors began to flow into China

420
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,951
And so did their cash

421
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:08,095
Antenna towns Pleasant new appearance was beginning to change popular sentiment towards the Chinese people

422
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:14,751
American newspapers made it explicit that the neighborhood makeover was causing them to rethink their contempt for the time

423
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:18,079
And one newspaper the bulletin put it in 1909

424
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:18,847
Quote

425
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:23,199
Chinatown is one of the most noted places on the American continent

426
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:25,247
We have held up to the public gaze for

427
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:28,831
Too long the racial grief that separates the yellow and white people

428
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:29,599
The Earth

429
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,367
And quote

430
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:32,415
Looked in Eli's plan

431
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,183
Have work

432
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:36,511
In Chinese communities elsewhere in the US

433
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,535
We're taking notes

434
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,583
All of the success of Chinatown

435
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,607
That have come

436
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,399
In America

437
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:45,215
Take a cue from this take a page from this

438
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:45,983
Play book

439
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:51,103
New York San Francisco LA Honolulu

440
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,895
San Francisco

441
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,687
That's funny story again

442
00:17:55,199 --> 00:18:00,575
She says visual style and tourist-friendly attitude that San Francisco's Chinatown

443
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,343
Affected

444
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,135
Soon began to spread

445
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:09,791
In fact a new Chinatown brand was so successful that it's still influencing chinatown's being built in our own time

446
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:10,815
Princess

447
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:14,655
Take the Chinatown in Las Vegas which was created in the 90s

448
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,959
It also had the same

449
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:23,615
Pagoda roof lines and dragon Gates like the same language architectural language at same architectural vernacular

450
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,639
I was being used

451
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:25,663
To create

452
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,967
The newest Chinatown that was used

453
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:34,367
To create the oldest Chinatown you know you outsmarted the devil you know who basically there is a phrase you know that they call

454
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,391
Call white people

455
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,927
Parkway which is

456
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,719
The white devil

457
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:41,791
I think that it was a victory absolutely

458
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:42,559
Of course

459
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:44,351
This architectural Revenge

460
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,655
Didn't instantly fix everything

461
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,935
For the Chinese in Sanford

462
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,983
They still face

463
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,799
Plenty of legal and popular discrimination

464
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:57,919
For example they were still required by real estate laws to live in Chinatown

465
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,967
And on a federal level

466
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:05,087
The Chinese Exclusion Act itself wouldn't even be repealed until 1943

467
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,135
More than 30 years later

468
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:12,511
And even if the rebranding of Chinatown help to ease negative sentiment towards the Chinese

469
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:16,863
Philips Hue believes it may also have helped promote certain stereotypes

470
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:19,167
It continues to promote

471
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,191
Al forniss

472
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:23,775
And my I remember my daughter coming home

473
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,823
One day very annoyed

474
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,103
And

475
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:33,503
These people look look look it's like they never seen a Chinese person before

476
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,807
By contrast

477
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:39,391
Look at the other traditionally ethnic neighborhoods in San Francisco

478
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:42,719
Japantown or the Italian neighborhood of North

479
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:45,279
Choices those neighborhoods

480
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:47,839
In South exoticize in the 1900s

481
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:50,399
The nearly the same extent the Chinatown did

482
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:56,287
They deliberately not embellish and embrace the ethnicity

483
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:01,151
Other immigrant groups at that time didn't face the same antagonism that the Chinese did

484
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,735
So only the Chinese were forced to cater to white people

485
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:05,503
Fantasies

486
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,527
As a survival knife

487
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,575
That's the irony

488
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:11,903
At that time we have to promote our forniss

489
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,695
To be accepted

490
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:17,279
But even if chinatown's architecture is a somewhat

491
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:19,583
Authentic representation of the real thing

492
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:26,239
But a lot of tourists don't realize is the fact that real people live there and that it is a place

493
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:28,287
Actually that is for poor people

494
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,311
You know I mean it is

495
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,079
@its

496
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:32,383
Essence a place where people

497
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,663
Come to live

498
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:37,503
When they first get here because they can't afford to live anywhere else

499
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:40,831
Because they need the services that are provided

500
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,111
There

501
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:48,255
Bunny soy says this is true of all the Chinatown she studied they're all portals of entry for

502
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:54,655
New immigrants of a particular class in a working-class immigrants who

503
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:55,935
Don't speak English

504
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:56,959
In fact

505
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:03,359
Thanks to factors like rent control zoning restrictions and really active tenants rights groups in the community

506
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:08,479
San Francisco's Chinatown has managed to remain a relatively affordable neighborhood

507
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,759
For low income in Agra

508
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,807
Ebony says yes

509
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:15,903
Chinatown has been disneyfied and rebranded to cater to American tastes

510
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,232
But there still an authentic and important history there

511
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:23,584
There's something about it that if you can reserve wreaths

512
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,656
Skyline you can read the story of

513
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:32,800
That's how this place came to be and also in that is Chinese American history and in that there's like there's a power in that

514
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:52,768
99percentinvisible was produced this week by Chelsea Davis and Katie mingle with Sam Greenspan Avery Joplin Kurt Kolstad

Bongs and chatter of our devices

522
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:18,112
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man made sound

523
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,136
If

524

Okay

537
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:58,560
