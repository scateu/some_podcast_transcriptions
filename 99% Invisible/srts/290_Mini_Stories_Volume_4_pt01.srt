I don't quite fill out an entire episode

27
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:26,272

Barney

36
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:43,680
Let's do this

37
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:47,264
You start with who you are

38
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:52,896
Okay yeah so I am Delaney Hall and I am a producer and Senior editor

39
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:53,664
OnStaff

40
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,456
What is your story

41
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:58,272
Well first I'm going to introduce you to

42
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,040
2 Peter suckers

43
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:03,136
Play my levels are okay

44
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,928
And I try to not pop my peas

45
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:08,768
I get excited I'll try not to talk too fast

46
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:17,216
And the stuff that Peter gets really excited about the stuff that makes and Papa's Pizza and Subs

47
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,360
Is language because he's the editor-at-large at Merriam-Webster and he's a leg

48
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,128
Photographer

49
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:30,528
Lexicographer is a person who compiles and edits dictionaries that's the old definition

50
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,552
The Great

51
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:33,856
Samuel Johnson lexicographer in London

52
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,392
Mid 18th century

53
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,672
Darius Amos Lee

54
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:39,232
Define lexicographer as a harmless

55
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,000
Drudge

56
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:44,352
And Peter actually said that they use that term affectionately now as like

57
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,120
I kind of

58
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:48,960
Badge of honor they like to be called harmless drudges

59
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:55,360
So don't worry about insulting them if if you want to use that term

60
00:02:55,616 --> 00:03:01,760
Merriam-Webster well from his description it sounds like they work in an office that is very very

61
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:04,064
Be quiet silent basically

62
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:08,928
And it's filled with these massive steel filing cabinet

63
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:15,328
And I've kind of been imagining it like that scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark at the end where the man

64
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:19,168
And it's pushing that create through a huge Warehouse

65
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:23,776
Instead of stacks of enormous crates is filled with metal filing cabinets

66
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:27,872
And those metal filing cabinets are filled with index

67
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,504
As far as I know it's the largest body of collected evidence of any language in the world it's

68
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,296
15 or 16 million

69
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,576
Index cards

70
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:39,904
With a word in context

71
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,952
Wicked full bibliography so we know

72
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,256
Who wrote it and where was published and when

73
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:50,144
And so that is the work of lexicographers are the keepers of that word history

74
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:56,032
And for a long time before computers came along this is how they did it with

75
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:58,848
These massive systems of filing cabinet

76
00:03:59,360 --> 00:03:59,872
Is the

77
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:03,200
File for the fin for the foundation for the pronunciation editor

78
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:09,344
Is the file for our dating editors who who do the etymological dating a Place full of file cabinet

79
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:14,464
But this isn't actually a story about how the Merriam-Webster offices are filled

80
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,071
Was filing cabinets no it's not it's a story about 1

81
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:25,215
Special filing cabinet Ventura office okay so here's where it gets really interesting

82
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:31,103
The 1-day Peter was wandering through these endless rows of filing cabinets and he came across

83
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,175
Is one and one of them simply said

84
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,199
Backward index

85
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:37,503
And so he opens up

86
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,807
The cabinet that says backward index

87
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,623
I realize what it what it was which was

88
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:47,743
Are all of the head words of the unabridged dictionary some 315,000

89
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,023
Separate index cards

90
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,303
With only

91
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,351
One word on them and it was

92
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,375
Edward

93
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,655
Typed backwards

94
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:58,751
Is a bad word that use the entry in the dictionary that's the first

95
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:02,591
Word with the word in question

96
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:06,687
This index is like imagine all the words in the dictionary

97
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:07,711
But

98
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:10,015
Typed backwards and then organized

99
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:10,783
Alphabetically

100
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:11,807
Okay

101
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:16,415
Why would you do that that is the question because

102
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:22,815
Utility of it is not immediately obvious at least not to non lexicographers like you and me

103
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,095
Repeater

104
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,887
The harmless Drudge

105
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,423
He kind of got it

106
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:29,983
Lexicography is an extreme sport

107
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,775
This is kind of a radical

108
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,847
The practice of collection and of archiving

109
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:38,431
And so to a certain degree this is

110
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:39,711
Maybe the the

111
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,527
The weirdest example of that kind of archiving

112
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,831
Abbott made a kind of sense to me

113
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:51,231
To really understand why it makes any kind of sense you have to think back to when lexicographers

114
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,767
First started compiling

115
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:53,535
The backwards

116
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,863
Which was in the 1930s it turns out

117
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:00,447
Which was a time before computers and

118
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:03,007
All of the search possibilities that they allow

119
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,055
In the pre-digital era

120
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:11,455
How else could we have known that there are four examples 500 words in the dictionary that end in ology

121
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:18,111
Yeah yeah you're getting it that's because with a regular dictionary just

122
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:21,183
Organized in a regular alphabetical way

123
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:24,511
A word like ecology would not appear next

124
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:28,607
To a word like technology because one starts with

125
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,375
Lydian once

126
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:36,543
I got it okay so with a backward index all the words that end in ology for example be grouped together

127
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:41,151
So you couldn't actually look up ology words you would look up

128
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:45,247
Y g o l o r word

129
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,295
Can yuan

130
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,575
Exactly yeah yeah

131
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,879
Kind of kind of ingenious

132
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:54,975
And there are actually a lot of other examples of of why this is useful

133
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,791
There was no way that they could know

134
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,351
For example how many words in English

135
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,679
Made with a compound like

136
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:07,263
Like you know block like clock like rock like sock like chocolate

137
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:10,847
I'm or how many open compound that is to say two word phrases

138
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:14,943
Found that use Pony so Highland Pony Shetland pony Welsh Pony that kind of thing

139
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:18,015
And then it gets a little deeper those

140
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:24,415
Words that are related morphologically like a ethological lithological ornithological

141
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:29,023
Particular sequence of letters basic rhyming

142
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:30,559
Sequences

143
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:33,631
Sleepy weepy sweet pea I'm forty shorty snorty

144
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:40,031
And in fact this backward index was instrumental in the creation of Merriam-Webster's 4

145
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,567
First rhyming dictionary

146
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:46,687
Oh yeah yeah yeah they're still they're very popular

147
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,991
By reading words backwards you can start to see

148
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:51,551
You kind of pattern psychology pattern or the

149
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:54,367
Logical pattern or destroy me better

150
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:59,743
The kind of lexical detail that we can get into by looking at the language backwards

151
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:04,863
In a normal way

152
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:12,287
In 3004 there were computers but does Peter know anything about who actually made this mystery is filing cabinet

153
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:17,663
Yeah so after he discovered it he started doing some research

154
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,199
And exactly

155
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:25,599
Who invented it is still a bit of a mystery he figured out that it dates back to the 1930s

156
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,879
And there's some evidence

157
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:30,463
That lexicographers work done it up until the 1970

158
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,767
So he knows how long it was

159
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,815
Actively being compiled

160
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:37,119
Co-founded the project

161
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:37,887
Was

162
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:41,727
A kind of favorite pet project of this one editor

163
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,519
Name Philip go

164
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,567
He edited Webster's

165
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:49,151
Third unabridged dictionary in the 1950s and it sounds like

166
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:49,919
He was

167
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,199
Barry

168
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:53,247
Rigorous Andrew lorient

169
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,551
Who is the famous

170
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,319
4

171
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,855
I'm his organizational

172
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,391
Skills and enforce

173
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:03,487
Making the dictionary apparatus that is to say that

174
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:07,327
The things that that we use as kind of code in the dictionary things like

175
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,143
And what is a bold-faced colon mean what is a light face

176
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,447
Metallic semicolon mean

177
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:15,519
When can we use commas so there's a rule for everything

178
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:18,079
And and so it was really go

179
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,615
Systematized

180
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,383
All of that

181
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:23,711
Key made a rule book for us for the editors

182
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:26,015
That was followed to the T

183
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,807
He was really really strict

184
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:34,207
I'm a very kind of innovative in its way and also kind of Proto digital because when we finally did this

185
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:37,023
Digitized dictionary recognize how very regular the

186
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,047
Apparatus was

187
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,071
Sogo

188
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:45,727
From Peter's description that seems like he's thought about the dictionary with the logic of a computer program

189
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:46,495
Hammer butt

190
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,799
Before computers were a thing

191
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:52,127
And now that computers are thinking you mentioned about an index

192
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:56,735
Propel out in the 1970s with makes tons of sense

193
00:09:56,991 --> 00:10:03,135
Indicators must have really changed the way let's confers of the distant really works

194
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,183
For one thing they have made

195
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:11,839
The old-school backwards index totally obsolete dream Webster website there's an advanced search

196
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,375
Search function where you can

197
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:15,167
Type in ology

198
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:21,567
Or phobia pulled up all the words that end with ology

199
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,335
Are phobia

200
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,871
So easy we haven't

201
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:26,687
So easy to do really do

202
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:33,087
And then computers have also allowed lexicographers like Peter to see

203
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,623
Other kinds of

204
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,159
For example

205
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:42,815
Well my favorite that we talked about in this interview is dysfunction on Merriam-Webster's

206
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,583
Website

207
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,631
Which is called time traveler

208
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,911
I'm by which you can

209
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,727
Reorder the dictionary in chronological

210
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,823
Order as opposed to alphabetical order because ultimately alphabetical order is

211
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,615
A random it's arbitrary

212
00:10:56,127 --> 00:11:02,271
But chronological order isn't because English develops in a very particular way all the words for the other words for exam

213
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,039
Apple about

214
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:08,927
You know a train travel in train tracks and Kohl's and engines they all come at a certain time

215
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:14,559
All words that have to do with repeating Firearms they'll come at a certain time when I'm going to the words that

216
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:18,655
I entered the language regarding the law that are derived from

217
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,935
French

218
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:24,287
They are coming up at a similar time to reorganize in the dictionary in in a

219
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,311
A digital way

220
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,359
I'm turned out to be a way to sort of

221
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:29,919
Turn the dictionary to a three dimensional

222
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,199
Search

223
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:33,247
A rather than just simply a list

224
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:35,295
We can go in in in Greater depth

225
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,087
Amazing

226
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:41,695
Cool love the idea of the time traveler

227
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:48,863
It's such a good way to older now at Jenna certain way and it's sort of like the backwards index was an early

228
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,655
Pre-digital attempt

229
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,191
Add achieving that kind of thing

230
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:52,959
Three dimensional

231
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:53,727
Search

232
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,775
I'm so cool oh thanks

233
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:56,543
Yeah thank you

234
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:11,391
We got to know Vivien Leigh when she was a finalist in the radiotopia podcast Kant

235
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,463
Her show billing is she is premiering this year

236
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:17,791
But she's also going to do a couple of 99 Pi stories

237
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,071
Including this

238
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:19,839
How many store

239
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,375
And she decided

240
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,143
Do you start

241
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:22,911
Big

242
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,959
So I want to start with

243
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,495
Nuclear accident

244
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,775
In US history

245
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,079
It's okay go ahead

246
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:36,735
How many years there has been a vigorous debate in this country about the safety of the nation 72 nuclear energy

247
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,503
Power plant

248
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:40,063
Activate is likely to be intensified

249
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:44,415
Because of what happened early this morning at a nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania

250
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,999
So you probably heard about this before because

251
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:48,767
This is big news

252
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:54,911
But back in 1979 there was a partial core meltdown at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant near Harrisburg

253
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,215
Cooling pump broke down

254
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:59,519
And the plant did just what am I supposed to do

255
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,543
Shut itself off

256
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:03,359
94 some radioactivity had escaped

257
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,383
We have to report

258
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:08,479
A bunch of communities around the reactor ended up having to evacuate

259
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:11,807
A lot of people out they should have been freaked out there

260
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:15,135
Freaking scary

261
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,927
In the aftermath of what happened

262
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:20,511
The president ordered a commission to investigate what happened and there's a

263
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:23,327
This big post-mortem report to try to understand what

264
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,631
And what

265
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,727
It's kind of complicated because a lot of things went wrong

266
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:33,055
But Three Mile Island was

267
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,615
A classic cascading failure type accident

268
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:36,895
So essentially

269
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:41,503
A relief valve in one of the reactor units got stuck in the open position which caused all the

270
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,271
Going to be released

271
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:45,599
So the coolant run out of the core and it started to overheat

272
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:50,463
And in the end it ended up being a pretty minor mechanical breakdown

273
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:55,071
But what they found out was that it was actually human error that made the whole situation worse

274
00:13:55,583 --> 00:14:01,727
Humans make everything worse really do they really do

275
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,287
But

276
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,335
The plant operators

277
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:11,455
See and they can hear that something was wrong because all these lights are flashing and alarms are sounding

278
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,759
But it wasn't clear exactly what was wrong

279
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,295
Because all the alarms are really

280
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,575
Fusing and just made this

281
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,599
Situation worse

282
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,879
Because I went to

283
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,671
Same time

284
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,463
That would have hindered

285
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,231
Communication

286
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,255
At the very time

287
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,279
When they need you

288
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,047
Communicate

289
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,327
And who is that

290
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,703
So that's Judy edworthy she said he's psychoacoustics and alarm design at the University of Plymouth

291
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:38,847
And she told me that Three Mile Island is actually a really common case study when it comes to bad and ineffective alarm design

292
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,663
Is very well-known

293
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,199
Having hundreds of alarms going off

294
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,991
A short period of time

295
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:49,855
Until happens

296
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:52,159
Alarm design really matters

297
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,719
Yes it definitely matters to

298
00:14:55,231 --> 00:15:01,375
And there have actually been other major accidents were alarms that were supposed to help people respond to emergency

299
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,679
But instead they made the situation worse

300
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:09,567
Like the Deepwater Horizon accident in 2010 would cause a ton of oil to fill into the Gulf of Mexico

301
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,359
I didn't know that had anything to do with me

302
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:12,639
Oh yeah yeah

303
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:19,039
It turned out that a bunch of the alarm systems on the Deepwater rig and actually been inhibited for at least a year before the

304
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:21,087
Because Transocean

305
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:25,439
What is the company that ran the rig didn't want false alarms to wake up the crew while they're sleeping

306
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,719
Three alarms

307
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:27,999
Too easily triggered

308
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,535
And so they just turn them off

309
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,559
They didn't upset

310
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:34,655
The operation of the ranch

311
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,679
To visit going to stop

312
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,727
Professor Edward a think about a lot

313
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:40,287
Yes yeah she thinks about the best ways

314
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:43,103
It has an alarm so that they can accomplish what they need to do

315
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:49,759
And whenever big concerns is that humans are just bombarded by so many alarms in our everyday life that we just

316
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,039
Start tuning them out

317
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,831
Or treating them off

318
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,903
Cuz I think the whole world's have to serve along today

319
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:59,743
Just so used to alarm just going a whole lot of time

320
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,535
Under almost

321
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,583
Digital backdrop to allies

322
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:08,447
She says that the average person probably hears about a hundred different types of alarms a day

323
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,263
The distal the time you send it to cash register

324
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,287
Speak to me away

325
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,311
Shunyi

326
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,079
You had called

327
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:17,151
Turn ons going off

328
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,199
Everything

329
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,247
FANUC

330
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:27,647
And so people just start tune them out and they lose track of which alarms are important and which

331
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:33,791
If everything in the world is beeping we kind of forget that those beats are trying to point out actual problems

332
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,095
But another consideration is

333
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:39,679
Set alarm tones Ben cell should communicate something about what the problem is

334
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,215
How does that

335
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:42,751
So

336
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,799
When you think of an alarm sound

337
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:45,567
What do you think of

338
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,591
Well I think of

339
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,407
Bracing klaxon

340
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,455
Beeping siren high pitched

341
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:57,855
Alarm alarm in upsetting all have like one culture

342
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:00,159
Reference point for what an alarm should sound like

343
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:04,511
Because like in the olden days we didn't really have much range in terms of

344
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,279
Alarm

345
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,071
In the past

346
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,351
Alarms

347
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,655
Metra Lombard

348
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:14,239
Pushing son pushing a through an object like a

349
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,263
The klaxon

350
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,311
Pitching

351
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,079
Taco Bell

352
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,639
Wesoo cities arcade noises

353
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:23,455
Like bells and whistles and sirens and klaxons with

354
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,479
Auditory alarms

355
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:28,575
Because that's just what the technology of the time allowed for and we got used to it

356
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:29,599
So

357
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:35,999
Judy made actually was kind of funny point which is that we have such a narrow idea of what an alarm should sound like

358
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,815
That it even shows up in futuristic Sci-Fi movies

359
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,351
Sci-fi film

360
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:43,167
Oh so wonderful things happen in the film

361
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:47,007
But when you put alarms both and I just the same alarms that work

362
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,287
We just used to

363
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:51,871
So I come in the film

364
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,151
The Martian

365
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,991
They can do it just want to listen good malls

366
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:59,551
But the counts on veteran loans

367
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:30,783
Digital sound

368
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,575
Esl which was possible you can make

369
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,367
An alarm sound like basically anything

370
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,415
You can use music

371
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,183
Some people use

372
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:39,487
Tunsel sequences of melodies

373
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,023
You can use

374
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:45,375
Sounds of the sounds of real object to real things that we tend to

375
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:47,167
Research thesis

376
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,471
But really love just metaphors

377
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:53,567
And I love this I love the idea of auditory icons and

378
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,871
Metaphorical sound is just really interesting

379
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:58,687
So what's a good example of an auditorium

380
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:00,735
So

381
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:04,063
Hospitals are notorious for having these terrible sounds

382
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,623
Because the sheer amount of alarms that are

383
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,903
Ashley going off in

384
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,695
All hours of the night

385
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:13,535
And I'll just eat some towns that are kind of variations of each other

386
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,583
Soju Design This NuTone

387
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:19,679
It's meant to be used when there's a problem related to a patient's medication and

388
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,447
This is how it works

389
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:23,775
What you might do is dance

390
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,311
An alarm by using

391
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,079
Coming out this

392
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:29,919
Attention

393
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:38,111
There's a little bit

394
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:39,647
Attention grabber

395
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,695
And then something metaphorical

396
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:42,719
Oh so you can really tell

397
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:45,279
What it is kind of

398
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,095
Choose medication in your head so you kind of already

399
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,399
Know what the problem is before you even address

400
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:52,703
What we what we find is over to icons

401
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,727
The very very easy

402
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,263
Can you just tell people once

403
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,543
What they mean

404
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,359
And then there was ever understood it

405
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:03,199
So instead of some generic an alarming alarm sound

406
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:05,247
I could literally mean anything

407
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:08,319
Which is what happened at Three Mile Island you can imagine these

408
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:14,975
Auditory icons that kind of communicate exactly what the problem is so you work there wouldn't be this confusion about trying to decipher

409
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:16,511
What is One Tone means

410
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:19,583
Except for a 3-mile and when there's a hundred things going wrong

411
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,607
It would sound like

412
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:26,239
Preschool classroom and rattles

413
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,799
But that becomes the sound design challenge of like

414
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:29,567
How do you

415
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,871
Prince which one you hear the loudest in

416
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:32,895
In what order do you hear

417
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:33,919
That's worth it

418
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,711
Which you know is really

419
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:37,759
Cool concept to be into

420
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:41,087
Yeah yeah yeah you basically have to rethink

421
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,879
And environment from the top down

422
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,415
In terms of what it sounds like

423
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,951
Thank you so much

424
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:46,975
Thank you

425
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:05,919
Since your voice isn't heard as much on the air want you say Who You Are

426
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,967
I'm sure Jusuf

427
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:14,367
I am what did you settle on technical producer

428
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,391
Make things sound good

429
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,159
That's awesome

430
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,184
I need to make things sound good

431
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,976
What kind of story do you have

432
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:25,376
Yesterday I have I believe it's called a mini story and it is about alchemy

433
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:31,520
It is a the idea of

434
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:34,336
Turn it using chemistry to turn lead into gold

435
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,128
Yeah basically or any other base

436
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,968
It was this loony idea that folks in the Medieval ages were obsessed

437
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:41,248
Sweat turning base metals

438
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:43,040
Lead and mercury into gold

439
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:45,344
Which of course is preposterous nowadays

440
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:51,232
But there's this time when Alchemists were these like really dope people back by Rich folks and Powerful folks

441
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:53,536
Including King Henry the 4th of France

442
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:56,352
A lot of Catholic monks practice Alchemy

443
00:21:56,608 --> 00:22:01,216
Even Sir Isaac Newton was super into Alchemy he apparently wrote about it more than physics

444
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:01,984
Optics

445
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,800
So for a long time hundreds and hundreds of years

446
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:05,568
Lacrosse team

447
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,336
Tire world

448
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,872
In the Middle East in Europe

449
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:11,712
There are these blurred lines between science and Alchemy

450
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:13,504
I'm back to Alchemy can actually be

451
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,272
Be traced back to

452
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:16,320
The Arabic alkemia which means

453
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,088
Chemistry

454
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,368
Because apparently Egyptians

455
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:21,184
Since we're pretty big into Alchemy back in the day especially

456
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:21,952
Italy during the holidays

457
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:25,280
X in Alexandria which is where I used to live

458
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:27,840
So shout out to Alexandria

459
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:32,192
And so Alchemy was really big thing and it is still

460
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:35,264
Really prevalent in pop culture today like I don't know if

461
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,056
Minecraft

462
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:40,896
Based on a cursory Google search

463
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:44,224
I think there are some Alchemist characters involved in the oast

464
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:48,320
Examples for my child who doesn't Harry Potter

465
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,112
The whole first book is about the

466
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,136
The Sorcerer's Stone

467
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,672
The British version

468
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,952
The Philosopher's Stone

469
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:57,280
Which is this thing that turns Metals into gold and also

470
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,048
Apparently

471
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,328
Makes people immortal

472
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:01,632
Which is like Voldemort was all about it

473
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:08,288
Anyway that's all to say that this idea that you could design

474
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:10,848
Kind of design gold from other metals

475
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:12,896
It was a really big pseudo-scientific West

476
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:14,688
For a really long time

477
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,296
But that'll sort of went by the wayside when Modern Chemistry started to become

478
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,064
Its own disk

479
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:24,928
Atoms neutrons and electrons and all that stuff sort of started

480
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:25,952
Taking cold

481
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:28,000
Well the ironic thing is is that

482
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:33,632
With modern chemistry it is actually possible to create gold from other elements

483
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:37,984
It actually happens in nature like when a neutron stars collide

484
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,848
And it can happen in Labs if you have nuclear capabilities or like a particle accelerator

485
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:45,152
Which brings us to Maryland

486
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,432
In the 1960

487
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:49,760
There was a physicist there named Judith temperley

488
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:53,088
And there with a nuclear reactor she managed to turn

489
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:53,856
Mercury

490
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:54,624
Into gold

491
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,952
Well she actually transmuted it which

492
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:01,792
Is the technical term end as I understand it means she modified the nucleus of

493
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,072
1 elements

494
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,352
Until it had

495
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,376
The same amount of protein

496
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,680
Gold

497
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:11,776
Should I do a quick chemistry lesson I mean

498
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,056
Chocolate chemistry

499
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:16,384
Elements are defined by the number of protons in the nucleus

500
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,944
It's like hydrogen is number one in the periodic table

501
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,248
Which means it has one proton in its nucleus

502
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:24,576
Sodium is number 11 has 11 protons Meadow on

503
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,904
I'm so the idea was that

504
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,184
If you got an element

505
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:29,952
That

506
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:31,232
Had you know

507
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:33,792
Close to the number of protons is gold

508
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:36,864
Yeah I'm then maybe like with particle accelerator youku

509
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,192
Add protons to weatherstrip protons away but to do that you need

510
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,728
A huge amount of energy

511
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:42,496
Because if you

512
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:43,264
Collide

513
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,800
2 positive things the witch

514
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,080
Are than they were

515
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:46,848
Bounce off

516
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:47,872
Ready to party

517
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:48,640
Accelerated

518
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:50,944
And Mercury is number 80

519
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,712
On the period

520
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,272
Gold is number 79

521
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,296
So they're very close

522
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:59,904
Right so she was like okay cool I'll put mercury in there which has 80 protons

523
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:05,024
I'll try to smack one of those off and maybe one of the protons will fall off and I'll be left with gold

524
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,816
And she did that

525
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,352
I think successfully converted

526
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:14,752
One atom into gold which you know great that was really great job and she proved that this ID

527
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:17,056
Do you have that was really crazy but was

528
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:19,616
So obsessed over for so many hundreds of years

529
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:20,896
Actually sign

530
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:21,920
Play possible

531
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:23,968
I'm a man in the 1980s

532
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:28,832
This professor named Glenn T seaborg who was a nobel-winning chemist at Berkeley

533
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,368
Made even more gold

534
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,904
Transmitted the same way

535
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:36,256
Except this time he was bismuth which you know unlike Mercury isn't poisonous

536
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:38,816
And it was also pretty close to gold on them

537
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:40,864
I think it was

538
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:41,888
3

539
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,424
Kirkland's number 83

540
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,704
Compared to a gold set

541
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:47,520
Find some smack some carbon into it using up

542
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:49,056
Particle accelerator

543
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:50,848
And he managed to create several

544
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:51,616
Thousand

545
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:53,664
You know when both

546
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,432
Cases

547
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:57,248
Love and results we're sort of invisible

548
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,272
Like to the naked eye

549
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:00,064
So it doesn't seem like a

550
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,344
The best option

551
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,112
Referred

552
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,136
Creating wealth

553
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,672
Xiamen

554
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:06,464
Especially considering that you need

555
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,024
Particle accelerator do if a child care

556
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:10,560
Pretty expense

557
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:11,328
Sensitive Bell

558
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:12,864
Solace

559
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:15,168
CenturyLink West becomes possible

560
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,240
But in the end it's pretty impractical because

561
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:21,312
You really have to spend way more gold than could ever be made

562
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:23,104
Creating a

563
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,896
Gold atom out of business

564
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:27,200
Yeah I think

565
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:30,272
Seeburg Economist told the Associated Press at the time

566
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:35,392
That in order to create an ounce of gold using his process that he did in Berkeley

567
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,160
It was he

568
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:41,792
One quadrillion dollars to create an ounce of gold and I had to look up quadrillion

569
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:47,168
It's a one with 15 zeros after it and at the same time the going rate for gold was about

570
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:48,448
$560

571
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:51,520
Not the most cost-effective but

572
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,312
Pretty cool that we did it

573
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,592
Thanks so much

574
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,344
Last but certainly not least is the longest serving soldier in the 99 PIR me

575
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:06,880
Avery trufelman

576
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:08,416
Answer the question

577
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:09,952
So how long have you lived in the Bay Area

578
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,744
I moved here in

579
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,280
1990

580
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:15,584
So are there any

581
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:16,608
Tourist

582
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,144
You still haven't been

583
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,192
Oh

584
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,216
Yeah

585
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:24,544
Alcatraz Pier 39

586
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,568
Lombard Street

587
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:29,152
Oh yeah I've never driven down on bars really

588
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:34,784
That's so funny that you would love them

589
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,600
Live there for my childhood and adulthood

590
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:38,624
Are you tired

591
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,184
And I never ever went to the crown of the Statue of

592
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:44,512
Now it's too late and it's the kind of thing that I've always told me to do

593
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:45,536
And it's

594
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:48,352
You know just kind of a typical thing that locals have a very

595
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:51,936
Different experience of their town and their city and visitors

596
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,240
Does by and large they don't see the attraction

597
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:57,056
The vast majority of our visitors

598
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:57,824
Are from out of town

599
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,616
Overwhelming majority

600
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:02,432
Play about locals doing tourist activities in any town around United

601
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:04,224
Many people do not go to The Tourist

602
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,088
In their town this is Dina jerrion he is a tour guide in an area of downtown Seattle called

603
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,112
Pioneer Square

604
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,392
Very touristy

605
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,184
And he works for a company

606
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,744
Bill Speidel Underground Tour

607
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:17,024
As the name suggests

608
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,048
The Torah allows you to

609
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:19,072
You descend some steps

610
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,608
And find yourself below street level

611
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,168
Like literally underground under the ground

612
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,448
I lived here

613
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,216
Ford

614
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:26,496
12 years before I knew

615
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:28,032
Safe to say

616
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:33,152
Easley the majority of people live in works at in Seattle do not know

617
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,176
They don't know

618
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:35,968
As we look around up above there

619
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:40,576
All of the sidewalks you see up there all of those sidewalks are Halo

620
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:43,136
What does it mean that the sidewalks are Hollow

621
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:45,696
Explain that we have to go back to 1851

622
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:49,792
To the founding of Seattle when the first White settlers

623
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:52,096
Arrived back then the land look

624
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:53,120
Completely different

625
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:54,400
Topographic

626
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:55,424
It was

627
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:57,728
I mean shockingly differin if you look at a map

628
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:02,848
Seattle is this tiny little Peninsula that used to sometimes flood into an island.

629
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,128
It was

630
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:06,432
Not the best place to establish a city

631
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:07,200
But

632
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:09,760
Some young white guys went ahead and established it

633
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:12,576
Pioneer Square quickly became this little logging town

634
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:13,856
Tiny wooden houses

635
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:14,880
And the logging Mill

636
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:18,208
That was the original Pioneer Square area and that's

637
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,488
The dock was

638
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,256
That's where the song

639
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:21,536
What business is work

640
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,328
This is history and allenstein

641
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,168
And he says even after the settlement the town would still flood sometimes

642
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:29,472
And this man plumbing was impossible

643
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,752
Toilets were at

644
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:35,104
Sea level so the problem is every time the tide came and it would blast water through

645
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:39,712
And so these toilets erupting with water

646
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:44,064
Sound off.

647
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,136
Stupid places establishing Town it was a bad idea

648
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:49,696
But the settlers decided to grin and bear it

649
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:52,768
And they put up with the many faults of their little city

650
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,048
As long as they could

651
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,840
Could continue to sell its Lumber

652
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:58,400
Until they accidentally burned the entire Earth

653
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:01,728
Even when the great fire hidden 89th at

654
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:05,824
That burned down that started in Pioneer Square that burned down was that area Because by the

655
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,592
This time

656
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,896
Wooden buildings have been built up

657
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:10,432
In 1889

658
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:12,992
The great fire had Seattle and it is pretty much

659
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,016
Levels downtown

660
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:14,784
Town it's just a

661
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,552
Asteroid

662
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:16,832
But miraculously

663
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:18,624
No one died in the Grapevine

664
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:21,440
So the city actually sees this as an opportunity

665
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:25,024
Saddles like okay this is our big chance to get the town above sea level and we

666
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,048
Start again

667
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,584
They thought well let's live

668
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,864
Grated over let's

669
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,656
Pack up the streets so that there

670
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,704
11 feet higher in the air

671
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:34,240
Yeah and

672
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,264
That way it is

673
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,544
It's a little more stable

674
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:41,920
But the business owner has already started building the city didn't want to tell the businesses in Pioneer Square

675
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:44,224
To wait until the project was done to rebuild

676
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,784
Because raising up the streets with this really ambitious project

677
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:52,160
I was going to take like 10 years to do so you can tell all the businesses in your town to take a 10-year hiatus

678
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:54,464
The Pioneer Square businesses

679
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,256
Where is that when they rebuild

680
00:30:56,512 --> 00:31:00,608
First I should do it in Brick and Stone not would my no lesson and then secondly

681
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:02,400
They should add another entrance

682
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,680
On their second floor

683
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:05,728
And slowly in increments

684
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:07,776
The city raise up the street

685
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,568
5 to 11 feet up

686
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:10,848
Around business

687
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,640
So they built their businesses

688
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:13,920
With an entrance

689
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:15,200
On the first floor

690
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:16,992
And an entrance

691
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:18,784
On base with a second-story

692
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:25,440
For the eventuality that the street would raise to meet at

693
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:31,584
We're raised up and then the sidewalk and the building were lower than the street

694
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:35,680
So for example if you wanted to park your carriage

695
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:36,704
In the street

696
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,728
And then

697
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,288
Leave your carriage and go into a store

698
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:42,080
You got to actually go down steps

699
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:43,616
Stairs reedem ladders

700
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,408
Storefronts

701
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:49,760
Basically the sidewalk at this point wasn't really joined that Second Story

702
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:51,552
But the street was there but the sidewalk

703
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:54,624
Yeah the sidewalk was still down at the old

704
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,648
Athletic

705
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,928
Yeah first level

706
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:58,208
It did not happen

707
00:31:58,464 --> 00:31:59,232
Once it happened in increments

708
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:01,280
But yeah and then the street was above it

709
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:02,560
So

710
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:05,376
Eventually the city connected the raised

711
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,936
It's to the new 2nd Story entrances

712
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,728
With a new sidewalk

713
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:12,032
I just covered up the old sidewalk

714
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,312
Incredibles hollow space

715
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:15,104
Between the old sidewalk

716
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:15,872
Anakaren

717
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,408
Once

718
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:19,200
The streets were graded level

719
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:19,968
Then

720
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:23,296
Businesses move to the Opera that the Second Story

721
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:25,344
And that's where their storefront

722
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:26,624
Later became

723
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,392
So all these

724
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:28,672
Original storefront

725
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:29,952
Worthen

726
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:31,232
Covered over Underground

727
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,280
And that's what

728
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,560
Became Underground

729
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,328
Seattle

730
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:37,376
So the underground was rumored to have a lot of

731
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:39,936
People speculate

732
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:45,824
About its life is speakeasies and gay clubs and Pat's for Espionage or smuggling

733
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,128
But honestly for most of its existence it was

734
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:49,152
Abandoned

735
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:51,968
Forgotten are used as storage space by the shops

736
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:52,992
What's the weather in Pinehurst

737
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,552
But then in the

738
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,880
Most of the businesses started to leave Pioneer Square

739
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:00,928
And the area became kind of down and out

740
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:07,840
And said this was the sixties everyone is like great let's just turn down all the old buildings in Pioneer Square so we can build more space AG stuff

741
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:09,632
Lego Space Needle

742
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,936
The space-age the future

743
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:13,472
People are looking

744
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:14,752
Forward than they were.

745
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:15,520
The past

746
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,824
Except for a man named Bill Speidel

747
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:20,128
So build it was a

748
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:20,896
Columnist

749
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:21,920
For the Seattle Times

750
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:24,224
And he had an interested

751
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:24,992
In history

752
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:27,808
A lot of it was because he had a lot of contacts

753
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:31,904
Like contacts with direct descendants of the founders of the city

754
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:36,768
Bill Speidel new people who were the sons or grandsons of the founding Pioneer families

755
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,560
Galilee young history

756
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:40,608
As far as White Settlement goes

757
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,400
Here in Seattle really it's

758
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:43,680
Three generations

759
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:44,448
It's away if you

760
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:48,544
And through these Old-Timers their stories the rumors

761
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,128
Speidel hears about these underground kind of tunnels in downtown Seattle

762
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,688
And he eventually learned about the raising of the streets in this house

763
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:55,712
Spaces between the car

764
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:57,248
Current sidewalk and gold sidewalk

765
00:33:57,504 --> 00:34:00,832
In 1965 Bill Speidel Underground Tour with a

766
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:01,600
Officially born

767
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:05,952
And he use the tour as an opportunity to show seattleites that they had history

768
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:08,512
And I had a historic district but they were ignoring

769
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,072
And they thought they didn't they thought they were this young City

770
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:15,680
This got the ball rolling on preserving Pioneer Square and by 19

771
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:16,448
69

772
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,032
It worked because it became a a National Historic District

773
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,592
Nancy is still listed as day

774
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:25,152
Bill Speidel passed away in 1988

775
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:27,200
But today if you go to Pioneer Square you will see

776
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:30,528
Hordes of tourists roving around in groups of 47

777
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:32,576
Taking Bill speidel's Underground Tour

778
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:37,184
They trying out these massive Torres everyday a hundred eighty eight people come through every hour and

779
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,208
One time I went

780
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:39,488
There is never this woman

781
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:43,840
Translate inventory in real time on her phone into Chinese I mean they're from all over the world

782
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:48,704
I'm at or very much continues and Bill speidel's original style it's a lot more dedicated to

783
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,984
The fun Ben facts

784
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:56,384
Lightest eye exam dad jokes

785
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,944
Drunken debauchery on the Rays Street

786
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:03,552
In the first year of construction Alone 17 men

787
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:06,368
Walked out of bars tried to cross the street

788
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:09,696
Fell to their death stepping from the street to the sidewalk below

789
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:14,816
Bill Speidel said that was it working away because that was early Seattle's original one step program

790
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:16,608
I love that joke

791
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:18,912
So it's a lot of

792
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:22,752
Unverified stuff and a few exaggerations but honestly

793
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:27,360
It's true with a lot of tourists detours they kind of turn into this giant game of telephone

794
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:31,968
But in this case without Speidel Legends and dad jokes we might not have

795
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:35,040
At all where this piece of Seattle history

796
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,832
Notorious no better than the local

797
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,144
Since literally thousands of you asked

798
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,680
I'm going to tell you what I think

799
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:53,472
The redesigned Donald Trump

800
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:54,752
Presidential challenge coin

801
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,032
Right after this

802
00:35:59,104 --> 00:35:59,872
Between the beats

803
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:02,176
Bongs and chatter of our devices

804
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:05,760
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

805
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:11,392
If I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexis

806
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:17,280
Is talking to me and my wife is in another room and a kid is another remembrall hearing that voice

807
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:19,072
Technology talk to us

808
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:21,376
It is a creation of Sonic trash

809
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:24,192
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

810
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:27,776
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

811
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,824
To make them more human

812
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:33,920
Turn the living room lights on

813
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:35,456
Okay

814
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:37,504
Dim the living room lights to 50

815
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,272
80%

816
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,064
Okay

817
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:46,464
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

818
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,280
Makes for a much more natural experience

819
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:51,328
Turn the living room lights on

820
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:54,912
Dim the living room lights to 50

821
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:56,192
Resent

822
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:02,848
We're presenting to special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

823
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:04,384
About how are sounds gay

824
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,920
Is impacting our health

825
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:08,224
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

826
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:11,296
Look for them Friday is May 17th and May 24th

827
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:13,344
Right here on the 99.

828
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:17,696
We need to talk about something

829
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:20,256
Constipation abdominal pain and bloating

830
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:26,656
You tell yourself it's not that bad you take laxatives you modify your diet and exercise routine but thinking about it all the time is from

831
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:32,288
Frustrating it doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again

832
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:35,872
You don't know why and it may be time to seek help

833
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,944
Go to oh my God. Info podcast

00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:44,064
We can learn more about your symptoms that's oh my God. Info / podcast

835
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,600
Oh my God. Info

836
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:46,624
Flat pocket

837
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,440
You might not remember

838
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:53,024
December 22nd 2017 is a particularly notable day

839
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:56,864
But I will always remember it as a day of the world first song

840
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,400
Donald Trump's

841
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,168
Redesign

842
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,192
Presidential

843
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:00,960
Challenge coin

844
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:03,264
Now if you were unfamiliar with challenge coin

845
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:04,800
Please turn your hymnals

846
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:06,080
Two episode number 156

847
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:07,872
Text 999 gold coin

848
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:09,664
And you know everything you need to know

849
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,456
But if you've been here awhile

850
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:12,480
You know

851
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:13,760
I know about challenge coins

852
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:15,296
And I care about them deeply

853
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:17,344
Inside if you didn't serve in the military

854
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:21,440
There's a good chance you learn about challenge going to the first time from 99% invisible

855
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:25,792
This show is don't challenge coins radiotopia so my association with John Lithgow

856
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:26,816
Is strong

857
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:27,840
And because of that

858
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,376
I was forwarded

859
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:35,264
The December 22nd Washington Post article about Trump's garishly over-the-top challenge coin

860
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,032
By about

861
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:38,336
9000 people

862
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,896
So am I other podcast

863
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,944
What Trump can teach us about con law

864
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:45,504
We take the tweets of Donald Trump and we use them

865
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:48,832
As a jumping-off point to learn about the US Constitution

866
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:49,856
If you haven't heard it

867
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:54,208
It's a really fun show and it's not nearly as snarky and angry as you might think

868
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,512
Plus my co-host on that show is

869
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:59,328
Hello professor and a friend of mine her name is Elizabeth Joe

870
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,864
And she's super smart and

871
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,912
Delightful to listen to so check it out

872
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:06,240
When things we discuss a lot on the show is that Donald Trump

873
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:08,032
Has a tendency to subvert

874
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:09,568
Constitutional norms

875
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,128
And if you're into Trump you can actually

876
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:15,200
Appreciate that Tennessee I know I totally dig people

877
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:17,248
Pushon rules to achieve the things

878
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:18,016
I want

879
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:18,784
To achieve

880
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:24,672
Anyway with the redesign of the presidential challenge coin it's clear that Trump also likes to break the norms

881
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:25,952
Taste

882
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,256
Good design and tradition

883
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:31,840
The new Trump challenge coin dispensers with the presidential seal

884
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:34,912
And replaces it with a similar-looking eagle image

885
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:36,704
But the head of the Eagle at 23

886
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,984
The directions for some reason

887
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,032
And it has Donald Trump signature

888
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:41,056
Across the bottom

889
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:43,104
Instead of e pluribus unum

890
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:43,872
It says

891
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:45,408
Make America great again

892
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:51,296
And it says Donald Trump again on a ribbon that extends below the traditional circle of the coin

893
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:52,832
It is twice as thick

894
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:58,976
Is the most recent presidential challenge coins and instead of the muted colors befitting a dignified office

895
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,768
This coin is gold

896
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,048
Burberry

897
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:02,816
Very

898
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:03,840
Cheap-looking

899
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:04,608
Goal

900
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:08,192
In terms of taste I consider this new coin and imp

901
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,216
Events

902
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:12,800
I will personally draw up the articles of impeachment myself just give me a call

903
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:13,824
However

904
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:16,896
I also must consider this from a design perspective

905
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:19,200
The key question in design is

906
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,992
The Thing You Do

907
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:22,272
What it was designed to do

908
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:23,808
In that sense

909
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,088
One could argue

910
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,880
But the Donald Trump challenge

911
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:28,416
Is perfectly

912
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:29,184
Design

913
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:34,048
It completely reflects the taste and style of trump and his presidency

914
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:35,072
In every way

915
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:36,096
Is in your face

916
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:37,120
Non-traditional

917
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:42,240
I fundit unbelievably ugly and tacky and I don't like the ribbon protruding from the bottom of the circle

918
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:43,264
But it's

919
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,824
Much like the man himself where is his

920
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:48,384
Wide shiny ties that come down

921
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,664
Way too low

922
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:54,272
So just like I didn't really get the red Maga hats I can't argue that they weren't

923
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:57,088
Effective icon for did the job they were designed to do

Turn away

925
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:01,184
You kind of have to admire the new coin

926
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:02,208
And judge it

927
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,488
What it is

928
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:05,280

931
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:11,680
Awful to look at

932
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:13,472
In every way it is just

933
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,008
It is it is

934
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,032
