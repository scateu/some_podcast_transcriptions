And that

40
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:41,888

Moms that are brown or overgrown are considered especially heinous

48
00:01:54,432 --> 00:02:00,576
Elite squads of dedicated individuals have been deputized by their local governments or homeowners association

49
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:04,672
To take action against those whose Lawns failed to meet Community standards

50
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:07,232
Call them lawn enforcement agency

00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,024
Producer Sam Greenspan

52
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,048
This

53
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,072
Is his story

54
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:20,032
In 2008 a lawn enforcement agent stop buy a home in Hudson Florida

55
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:20,800
Outside of town

56
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:25,408
Maybe the agent snap some photos maybe there was some boxes ticked off a checklist

57
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,200
Whatever the agents field method

58
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:30,784
He or she went back to lawn enforcement HQ

59
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,064
And sent out a letter

60
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,624
They send out letters stating that you know

61
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,928
European your Lawns not up to par

62
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,232
You have a lot of bare spots

63
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,768
In a lot of weeds

64
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,840
My sprinkler system was busting I didn't have the money at

65
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,632
Demri Parrott

66
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:48,192
That's Joe prudente who with his wife Pat

67
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,728
Owns the home in question

68
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:54,080
Lawn enforcement thoughts of the prudente is long with two brown chewy d

69
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:58,944
I'm not well maintained this was not the first such letter that the prudente is had received

70
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:05,344
But Joe prudente says he is no deadbeat over the course of a few years he had tried to keep a clean

71
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,392
Mean Green Lawn as best I could

72
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,416
He watered it

73
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:10,720
He put down grass seeds and grass plugs

74
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:17,376
He even dug up and completely replanted the grass in his front yard three times over

75
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,400
3 *

76
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:21,216
The first time I had a company do it

77
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,520
They charged me like $1,200

78
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:28,896
And I said I'm not doing this you know every time it dies Joe met with his homeowners association

79
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:31,456
But they were not cutting him any slack

80
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,248
So then finally they

81
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:37,088
Did some ruling that that if I didn't put sod down the whole place

82
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:39,136
Dale a law firm was sending it

83
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,928
To the judge to the court

84
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,976
See what would happen

85
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,560
Are they going to lock me up then I got to put me in jail

86
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,584
Banana pudding

87
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,888
Brasstown listen to fetch crazy

88
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:55,776
Shortly thereafter Joe got another letter

89
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:58,592
I don't want everybody to see police coming to the house

90
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,128
Caught me a wafer

91
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:04,736
Rob the bank and you know how neighbors are

92
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:09,088
So I did it to them the choir way I turn myself in

93
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,928
At 66 years old Joe prudente

94
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:16,000
And otherwise law-abiding retiree from Long Island

95
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:21,375
Presented himself to the Pasco County Jail wearing a grandpa gone wild t-shirt

96
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:26,239
He was apprehended on allegations of failing to properly maintain his lawn

97
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,519
To community standards

98
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,543
There was no bail

99
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:31,359
No bail until the side was done

100
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:38,271
Now fortunately for Joe the local paper had written about the arrest and detainment of a senior citizen for having a

101
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,295
Brown mod

102
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:45,183
Word got around and dozens of people came to help dig up Andre saw the prudente is lon

103
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,487
Joe was released from jail the next day

104
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:53,887
Most cases of homeowners brushing up against the lawn enforcement

105
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,935
Do not end in jail time

106
00:04:56,191 --> 00:05:00,799
The only person to have ended up behind bars because of a landscaping issue

107
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:06,431
Frankie Rose of Grand Prairie Texas did two days in jail for having an overgrown lawn

108
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:12,831
And Gary settle a seventy-five-year-old former city council member of Riesel Texas had a warrant if

109
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:19,231
Issued for her arrest until some neighborhood kids came by and

110
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:19,999
On our own

111
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,791
There's a paradox for the lawn

112
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:26,911
On the one hand it is the pedestal on which sits the greatest symbol of the American dream

113
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:27,935
The home

114
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:30,751
And homeowners are independent and free

115
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:34,335
Have dominion over their own little corner of the world and yet

116
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:35,871
And yet

117
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,407
The lawn is the least

118
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,455
Freewheel control

119
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,479
Landscape

120
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,503
Insofar

121
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,295
Constantly pressure

122
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,087
Nearby formal or informal

123
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,903
In the management just like their neighbors

124
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:54,303
That's Paul Robbins director of The Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison

125
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:57,375
And I'm the author of the book lawn people

126
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,911
How grasses weeds

127
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,447
And chemicals make us who we are

128
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,495
Grass maybe a plant

129
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,519
But a lawn

130
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,055
Is a designed object

131
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:07,359
Elan is an entirely design.

132
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,407
Imaginary nice

133
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,687
Clean Green Lawn

134
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:12,479
That's entirely engineered

135
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:13,503
Landscape

136
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:16,831
And the reason we maintain this landscape says Paul Robbins

137
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:19,903
Is about everything except the grass

138
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:20,671
It's about every

139
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,719
It's about Community it's about

140
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,999
Proper moral Behavior

141
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,559
It's about participating in the life of a community

142
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:29,375
Even in the beginning Lawns were always about

143
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,703
The lawn or really the idea of law

144
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,495
Began with art

145
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,311
The Italians for a while we're painting these

146
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,079
The Pastoral

147
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:41,151
Scenes scenes full of grasslands and had to

148
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,687
Grasslands in hedges

149
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,223
That didn't actually

150
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:44,991
Exist

151
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:48,831
No I mean these are pastoral images out of somebody's imagination of what the landscape

152
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:49,599
Should look like

153
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:53,183
Chinese paintings got popular among Great Britain's landed Elite

154
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:56,255
They like the painting so much but they wanted to live in them

155
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,023
What

156
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,303
The British were doing

157
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:01,375
Designing their landscape to look like what was

158
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,911
Trending in Italian

159
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:03,679
Paint

160
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,983
So life definitely followed art

161
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:06,751
In this case

162
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:10,591
A style of English garden developed where a prominent feature is a green lawn

163
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:13,663
And by the way everyone recognized that is soft

164
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,271
Verdant grasses were more than just a nice place to walk around barefoot outside

165
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,295
Elan

166
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,063
Was about

167
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:20,831
Power

168
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:24,159
Elan was away for these English Elites to show off

169
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,439
They were so wealthy

170
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,743
They didn't need this land to grow food

171
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,815
They can afford to let their fields go fallow

172
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:35,423
And could afford to keep raising animals inside wielding peasants to keep it short

173
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:39,263
When European colonists set sail for the new world they took grasses with them

174
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:44,127
But morons were still mostly for rich people and eventually public parks

175
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:47,967
It wasn't until the turn of the 20th century with the first suburbs

176
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:51,295
That lawn started appearing around the homes of the middle class

177
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,855
And here is where the launch

178
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:56,927
It's from being about the flagrant display of wealth

179
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:00,767
To a moral Force for the good of civilization

180
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:05,631
Andrew Jackson Downing considered by some to be the father of American landscape architecture

181
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:12,031
Who is slightly older than the other guy considered to be the father of American landscape architecture Frederick Law

182
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,823
I know you're thinking it nerds

183
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:16,639
Downing Road in 1850 quote

184
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:22,271
When smiling Lawns and tasteful Cottages begin to embellish a country we know

185
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,807
That order and culture

186
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,575
Re-establish

187
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,647
There's kind of a social message which is that if you make it

188
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,927
Look like this we will make

189
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,463
Better City

190
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,255
As opposed to write having

191
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,791
I'm living in squalor

192
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,607
And the urban areas are considered evil

193
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:43,775
Unproblematic will maintain lawn in other words is the opposite of a broken window

194
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:44,543
It's precisely

195
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,847
People think whatever is going on outside

196
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,151
If it's civilized manicure.

197
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,479
Reflects something is going on good inside the house

198
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:56,575
With the start of the Great American suburbanization in the 1950s

199
00:08:56,831 --> 00:09:00,927
Suddenly middle-class people were owning a larger and larger swaths of land

200
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:03,487
So covering it with grass was

201
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:07,327
Partly utilitarian you know you have this big piece of land they got to do something with it

202
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,143
But this connection between Lawn & Order

203
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,423
Only grow stronger

204
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,703
E&R lawn

205
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,031
Got bigger we did an air photography study and you

Tax assessor

207
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,079

00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:20,895
Typical

210
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,431
American city and we found that about

211
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,199
25

212
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:23,967
Percent

213
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,247
The entire County

214
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,527
Was turf grass lawn

215
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,295
That doesn't include

216
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,575
Football field

217
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:29,599

221
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:38,559
Grass living a completely unnatural life cycle

222
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:41,119
We don't let grass grow tall enough to go to seed

223
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:44,447
But we also water and fertilize it to keep it from going dormant

224
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,727
We don't want to die

225
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,263
Reproduce

226
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,567
The author Michael Pollan wrote that

227
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:53,151
Lawns are nature purged of Sex and Death

228
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:53,919
Feed

229
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:54,687
Weed

230
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,455
Cut

231
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,223
Repeat

232
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:59,807
Paul Robbins interviewed dozens of people about their lawns for his book

233
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,623
People told him that if their grass got too long

234
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:06,719
Neighbors would come by and ask if their lawn mower was broken and need to borrow one

235
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:13,375
People who wouldn't blow their lawn might find an aggressive neighbor had done it for them in the middle of the night or while

236
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,399
How they were out of town

237
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,935
Uomo because everybody else does

238
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,983
The free-market American

239
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:18,751
Free

240
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,031
Neoliberal subject

241
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,567
It does that

242
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,871
He or she pleases would just say to hell with my

243
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,407
Let my lawn grow

244
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,943
But instead they do the Communists

245
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,759
Which is collective management

246
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:30,527
Of what is essentially

247
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:31,807
Commons

248
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,343
It's not your lawn

249
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,879
It's the whole communities

250
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:35,903
Your response

251
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:39,231
Deviate from acceptable Community norms

252
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:41,535
And your community goes to war with you

253
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:45,631
What does how you get cases like Joe prudente being thrown in jail

254
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:48,447
For failing to keep his lawn up to quote on quote

255
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,215
Community

256
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:52,543
One of the guys in my city

257
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,639
I said the Griffis of smoking it or selling it

258
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:02,015
But as much as the lawn seem to be rooted to the American landscape

259
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:04,319
We may be seeing a transition

260
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,111
At least here out west

261
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,159
Where in historic drought

262
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,695
And that demands

263
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,975
Unprecedented Act

264
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,023
Trump treason

265
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:13,791
I miss you

266
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,071
Executive order

267
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,351
Men dating

268
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,399
Substantial water reduction

269
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:19,935
Across our state

270
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:26,591
California Governor Jerry Brown declared in 2015 that our state would need to cut water use by 25%

271
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,639
Read a new era

272
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,431
The idea of you

273
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,967
Nicely green grass

274
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,503
Lots of water everyday

275
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,807
Skimpy thing of the past

276
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:40,159
Here in California the lawn is perhaps the most visible symbol of the drought

277
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:44,767
Water restrictions allow people to water only two or three times a week

278
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:47,583
Down from four or five or even more

279
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:50,655
In California and Arizona and Nevada

280
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:53,983
You're actually paying people to rip out their grass

281
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:58,847
Prices range from a dollar to as much as $4 per square foot of turf removed

282
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:03,967
Which homeowners continues to buy artificial turf or use it for xeriscaping

283
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,783
Which is Landscaping with things that don't need water like

284
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,551
Rocks

285
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:13,951
Some people are also choosing to put native plants new yards which theoretically should grow with rain water only

286
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:17,791
And would help restore the ecosystem that have been there before

287
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,839
Or you can just let your lawn go Brown

288
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:23,935
California has a bunch of public service announcements that are all like

289
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,727
Look at through this truck just

290
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,567
Movement that help fight the drought

291
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,359
Get down with brown

292
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,127
Brown

293
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,151
The new Green

294
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:33,919
Do your part

295
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:34,687
To help Cal

296
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:40,319
Nobody bought a home in this country to have a brown lawn this is America

297
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:44,159
We have green grass for a reason here that's the American dream is to

298
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,207
Have a green lawn so

299
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,743
And last a little bit

300
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,303
And our service and you can have a

301
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:54,143
Green Lawn during the drought season

302
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:57,471
Is David Bartlett of extreme brain brass

303
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,263
He is decidedly

304
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,311
Not down with brown

305
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,639
I'm David Bartlett with extreme Green Grass and we are

306
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:07,967
Turning her brown grass green

307
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:14,367
And he doing this by literally painting a customer's laundry we are spraying on and on

308
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,647
Natural Earth friendly

309
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:19,487
Product that we manufacture called Extreme green grass

310
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:24,351
Last 3 to 6 months was golden brown

311
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:27,167
It had been watered in 6 months

312
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:33,567
David uses a spray wand attached to a tank full of liquid which he swears is non-toxic and as he's spraying

313
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:37,919
It's like magic like he's transforming a Wheatfield into a soccer pitch

314
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:42,015
I cut the grass is still crunchy

315
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:44,831
Unfortunately

316
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:47,135
Target changes out process I'd be rich

317
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,439
You do anything besides green

318
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,231
Yeah we do white. Christmas

319
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:51,999
Precision

320
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,535
Megan looks like you got a

321
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:56,607
Snow your kind of looks like you went up and got some

322
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,631
Snow from the mountains

323
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,191
I like pink or purple Orange

324
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,983
I'll do that for you bro

325
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:07,103
David got in his line of work after a friend got him a similar service for his lawn as a gift

326
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,407
David has been working in landscaping and

327
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,967
Thought he could do a better job than the other company is he insane

328
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,015
Mom painting is actually not new

329
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:19,647
But if you've never heard of it it's because it's generally only been used on golf courses and pro sports

330
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,999
It's only since this most recent drought that lawn painting has come home

331
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:32,191
I first heard that long painting I had assumed that we stopped at by the lawn obsessive kind of people who had

332
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:36,287
But a lot of extreme green grasses clients

333
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,079
Are homeowners association

334
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,359
1 painting

335
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:43,199
Is becoming accepted by even the strictest lawn enforcement agency

336
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:47,039
It kind of makes you wonder if we as a society are beginning to

337
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,831
The question the supremacy of the

338
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,367
Perfectly kept lawn

339
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,391
Maybe

340
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:54,463
We can finally quit lawn shaming each other

341
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:58,559
This is America we can always find ways to shame each other

342
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,583
I think it's very very

343
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,863
First thing to see what's happening

344
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:01,631
In California

345
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,399
With

346
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,935
People getting on each other's case

347
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:04,959
We're having

348
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,519
After all these decades

349
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,055
Getting on each other's case

350
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,079
For not having

351
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:15,199
That's Paul Robbins again now we have a case where the drought has inspired peep

352
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,991
Really wack 100

353
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:19,039
On the Internet or whatever else

354
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,063
Shame people

355
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,367
For putting water on their lawn

356
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,903
See Twitter hashtag

357
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,671
Drought shaming

358
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:28,255
Paul says it's good that people are looking to conserve water

359
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:32,863
But the moral architecture of drought shaming is a little too familiar

360
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:37,471
It's just the newest trend on how people beliefs each other's lawns

361
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,519
It's just another version of the same thing

362
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:42,847
Like moral outrage that people are not doing their share

363
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,639
Is soda bad

364
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,663
A natural response

365
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,199
Two people's Land Management

366
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,247
Just like it was for keeping a lawn green

367
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:55,647
