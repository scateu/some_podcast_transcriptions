You've never noticed

That I've had people you know, and look for it

39
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,864
I specifically and not find it

40
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,192

Earth and Air

48
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,040
It's a 6 inch circle of

49
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,832
Soil in the column of air above it

50
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:36,160
Extending all the way to the limit of US controlled airspace

51
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:40,512
The column is marked by a 6

Description of the outer edge read

56
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,448
This soil

57
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,472
And the airspace

58
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,496

64

Uses jurisdiction laws in politics

65
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,576
It's kind of material to work with

66
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:07,392
The Free Speech Monument has both subtlety and Granger

67
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,416
And it's also

68
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,208
Bond and thought-provoking

69
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:15,328
A new way to consider jurisdictional space usually spaces of jurisdiction you enter into

70
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,888
You cross into a country you cross into

71
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,168
Estate you move into

72
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:25,568
Somebody private property and I thought it would be interesting to kind of inferred that and have a space that sort of move through your body

73
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:27,104
And when you stand next to it today

74
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,896
20 years after it was installed

75
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,176
You never see

76
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:30,944
Spect

77
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,968
The drama

78
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,992
That went on

79
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:36,320
To get this Granite Circle placed in the ground on University

80
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:39,392
The property I was kind of thrown into a little bit of a hornet's nest that I wasn't

81
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,416
Prepared for it all

82
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,208
Here's what happened

83
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:45,792
Free Speech Monument was born out of an open design competition

84
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,840
Memory at the 25th anniversary of

85
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:48,608
The start of the

86
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,496
Free Speech movement a bunch of professors ask professors they called themselves the Berkeley art from

87
00:03:54,752 --> 00:04:00,384
Put this competition together separate from the University they did it as an autonomous group

88
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,712
Because they knew if they tried to go through the university to commemorate the

89
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,760
Which movement it would go nowhere

90
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:06,784
Because of the time

91
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,832
The university did not want to

92
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,112
Commemorate the free speech

93
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,904
Movement in any way shape

94
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,720
The Free Speech movement started in the fall of 1960

95
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,000
Before when students set up a

96
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,839
The table in Sproul Plaza to recruit for an off-campus Civil Rights group

97
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,119
This was against

98
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,399
School policy at the

99
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,471
And everything escalated from there

100
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,495
The following months

101
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,775
Wehrmacht by sit-ins

102
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:28,799
Strikes in a row

103
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,335
It was a pivotal moment

104
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,615
That defined

105
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,407
What we think of as the 6th

106
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,711
Monument seems appropriate

107
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:37,759
So anyway it's 1989

108
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,039
Calling out hundreds

109
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,575
Designs for consider

110
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,343
The 300

111
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,367
From all over the

112
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:43,903
They tweeted that down.

113
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,951
Define open.

114
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:48,511
Public discussion and voting that included

115
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:49,535
Publican

116
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,303
Art critics

117
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:53,119
All kinds of people outside of the Berkeley art project

118
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:58,751
That eventually selected Mark Pressman campins column of Earth and air as the Free Speech Monument

119
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,055
The Democracy doesn't always work with art thou

120
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,335
So I'm glad that it were

121
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,615
Work out this time

122
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,431
The people who would put the project together

123
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:10,015
Wanted to give the winning entry to the university as a gift

124
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:13,855
And then of course university did not want to accept it as a gift

125
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:19,743
And did everything that they could not do in the reason for the reluctance is that a lot of the Berkeley art project group

126
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,279
The once commissioned the monument

127
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,583
And the higher-ups at the University

128
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:29,983
We're the same people who are in the fight 25 years before and they were still very upset about it they still had

129
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:30,751
Very hurt feelings

130
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:33,567
So UC Berkeley did not want to memorialize the priest

131
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:37,151
Each movement in general and they hated this piece in particular

132
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,175
Yeah so

133
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,479
They did everything in their power

134
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,527
To not accepted

135
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:45,599
Which is kind of hard to do when still seem like a good guy

136
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,135
And after this big

137
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,415
Public selection process

138
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:49,951
They didn't have

139
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:50,975
Too much of a choice

140
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,511
So University decided to

141
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,279
SEPTA stop

142
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,071
Under one condition

143
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:00,703
They said okay will accept this commemoration to free speech as long as the press release that goes out

144
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,983
Does not contain

145
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:02,751
Any reference

146
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,543
To the Free Speech movement

147
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,079
That's right

148
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,615
Free Speech Monument

149
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:08,895
What sensor

150
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,431
And the unintended side of a

151
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:11,711
Is that it made

152
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:13,247
A piece of conceptual art

153
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,783
Conceptually better

154
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:18,879
Ironically it wasn't just the University Administration

155
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:19,903
Batman had a problem with

156
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,439
Column of Earth and Air

157
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,999
Probably early Free Speech movement leaders

158
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,559
Express their misgivings about the monument as well

159
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:38,591
I remember having a conversation with Mario Savio

160
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,735
He didn't like the peace at all

161
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:50,367
And not put words in his mouth but I did kind of get the impression that he wanted something that was a little bit more specific

162
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,647
Do the free speech

163
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:52,927
Movement

164
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:53,951
In the sixties

165
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,231
And I

166
00:06:55,487 --> 00:07:00,863
Specifically didn't want to do that it seemed more relevant to me to use a

167
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,143
Real person

168
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,215
Speaking freely about something that they

169
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:08,031
Felt strongly about at that moment as a monument

170
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:11,103
Capri speech rather than a statue or something like that

171
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,711
The piece itself remains unfinished

172
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,759
The goal is to completely liberate this

173
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,295
Circle of soil

174
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,087
From any jurisdiction

175
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:27,743
And to do that it would have to go through all the jurisdictions you know the private property owners to the Board of Regents

176
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:34,143
The city of Berkeley County of Alameda the state there have to be an act of Congress

177
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:40,543
You also have to get International treaties because you don't want France coming in and taking that little piece of land so

178
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,847
You know it'll probably never be completely finished

179
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:47,711
After several attempts he made it only to the city jurisdiction level before getting bored

180
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,271
And now twenty years after it was installed

181
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,831
I'm standing in a noisy Sproul Plaza

182
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,623
If my breasts been camping

183
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,903
We run our hands

184
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:56,671
Through the column

Labare

186
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,719
And even though the Jurassic

Formula

189
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:01,535
I asked him if he

190
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,303
I feel something

191
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,095
Screw into

192
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:05,631
Baidu

193
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,935
I feel like I can feel the space

194
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,031
I grew up in Utah

195
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,055
And I

196
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:19,455
Would go to Southern Utah Lot in the four corners area that's the only place the United States where 4 States come together at

197
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,223
At one point

198
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,527
I remember very specifically

199
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:27,647
Jumping from state-to-state from Arizona to Colorado to Utah to New Mexico

200
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:30,975
It's also fun to lie down spread eagle in all four states at once

201
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:34,815
And really having a visceral feeling about that invisible line

202
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:35,839
Obviously

203
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,375
Psychological

204
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:40,191
But those spaces are very real I mean you commit

205
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,495
Certain acts in one space and you

206
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:45,055
You can do it you can make certain act in another space

207
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:50,943
And you might be killed so even though they're imaginary to certain extent they're very real

Before we go I want to tell you about the body genius

224
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:32,671
Series from Bellow radio TV show the truth

225
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:38,815
The body genius is a Dark comic mystery that whines through a treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

226
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,351
We're looking the part

227
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,887
Might cost you your life

228
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:48,287
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

229
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:54,687
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden 2 playlist

230
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,967
Like a dad

231
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:00,319
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

232
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:04,671
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that kind of

233
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:12,095
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

234
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:15,423
Was found dead in my private gym

235
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:18,751
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

236
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:23,103
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

237
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:26,431
Now I need to clear my name

238
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:31,807
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes

239
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:32,831
To find them

00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:41,791
