Is Jeff Manor

40
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:02,624
My name is Jeff Maino architecture writer and blogger based in Los Angeles

41
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,696
For seven years he has written a website called building block

42
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,744
Which is about architectural conjecture

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,024
Urban speculation

44
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:09,792
And Landscape

45
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:13,376
I've always liked the sound of things

46
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:16,448
And the acoustic nature walking to the city or even just the sense that

47
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:18,752
When you're walking down the hall that has really rich

48
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:19,776
Lush

49
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,056
Wall coverings

50
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:24,128
The right side and sound totally different from the left side

51
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:27,712
I've just always been interested in those sorts of acoustic

52
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:29,504
Aspects of architectural space

53
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:34,368
Most Architects if a design for sound but they're actually designing to do is design for silence

54
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,184
Designing to keep sound out of the environments

55
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,280
They're designing to make sure that you don't hear the street sounds that are happening outside

56
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:46,912
Or that you're insulated from cars driving by or from the gravel plants up the road

57
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:53,568
So it's really an architecture silence that that people tend to be designing for but you know having said that there was an interesting project

58
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:56,384
A couple years ago by an architect named Joel Sanders

59
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,784
Mexican architectural design instead of standard glass windows that would use things like parabolic microphones

60
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:07,904
Kind of like those things that you see people holding on the sides of the football field during NFL games

61
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:14,304
These parabolic microphones would be pointed at the sky or they be pointed out into the woods nearby or you know they would capture the sounds

62
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,584
Airplanes flying overhead

63
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,984
Or birds in that in the forest or flat metal kids down the road it's very consciously and clearly brings a couch

64
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,520
Sticks into the architectural

65
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,288
Equation

66
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:30,432
There's an article in a British magazine called The Wire it was an article about

67
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:35,296
Generative sound so to speak it referred to it this idea of a quote-unquote Soundgarden

68
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:42,720
Rather than being the 1990s grunge band they were talking actually about the idea that you would deliberately plants

69
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:49,120
A certain species of flowering trees in the car thing in your back Garden so that you can sort of time in acoustic

70
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,400
Event over the course of the year

71
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,704
There certain species that when they

72
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,032
Bloom the seed pod opens up with an audible pop

73
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:59,872
It's going to be acoustic equivalent of the daisies coming up to the ground of the Tulips blooming

74
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:03,712
There's all kinds of other species that have particularly kind of silky leaves that

75
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:07,552
Brass against each other in the breeze so you can fall asleep at night too

76
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,576
The sound of this kind of

77
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,856
Really silken

78
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:10,624
Silvery

79
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,904
Serta tree brushing sound

80
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:17,024
That's one thing I think is really quite interesting that you can actually deliberately sort of build an acoustic ecosystem

81
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,887
You know you can easily imagine that sort of thing being added onto a kind of Botanic Garden

82
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:25,215
Said that you need to pay money to go literally listen to plant life

83
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:28,031
Desmond was also interested in

84
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:28,799
RKO

85
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:31,615
Good question

86
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:36,991
It's basically concerned with what two things not only how would a building have sounded or what would have been the acoustic

87
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,271
Effect of a certain building

88
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,063
When that building was standing

89
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:43,135
But then also what was the sort of sound culture of a given

90
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,927
Civilization or Village

91
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,975
Old Mayan temples were built

92
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:47,743
It's not just

93
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,791
Spaz spectacular mountain bike

94
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:50,815
Constructions

95
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:54,399
But specifically is a acoustic devices that would amplify

96
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,447
Not only the voice of the priest

97
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:01,311
But also the sounds of things like The Conch Shell that would be played to do ritualistic

98
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,591
Music internet service time

99
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,943
They building was actually physically designed to be as accurate as possible

100
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,783
The buildings themselves were like acoustic resonators or subwoofer so to speak

101
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,647
That were deliberately made to help induce a kind of almost like a psychedelic state in people

102
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,695
That's archaeoacoustics

103
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,743
Indiana Jones meets John Cage

104
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:23,071
I think Architects are too willing to sort of

105
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:27,679
Acoustics and sounds be taken care of by sound designers are taken up by other people

106
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:31,007
And I think it really would be interesting to see them think more in terms of

107
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:34,079
How to integrate their building into the soundscape of a city

108
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:38,687
There's a lot of talk with an architecture of how to build something that's contextually specific

109
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:40,479
And early response to its site

110
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:46,367
But the sight quote is almost always literally a question of sight it's an obstacle relationship the city

111
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,159
It would really be answering I should think about

112
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,463
Architects going out to sort of acoustically map

113
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:54,559
The city block where they're building is going to be in in figuring out a nice way to

114
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:57,887
Intervene in it and maybe reflect the sound back at the neighborhood

115
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:00,447
Too much silence is no more interesting than too much noise

116
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:08,639

Absolutely the best

133
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,663
I was going to clean that

134
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,223
At the end of this program but

135
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,759
Man that program

136
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:46,783

Series from Bellow radio TV show the truth

150
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,183
The body genius is a Dark comic mystery

151
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,463
That whines through a

152
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,511
Treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,047

00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,583
Might cost you your life

155
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:36,959
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

156
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:41,311
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

157
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:44,639
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like

158
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,663
A dad

159
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,015
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

160
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:54,367
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main guy to know how to do that kind

161
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,391
I think

162
00:07:55,647 --> 00:08:01,791
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

163
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:05,119
Was found dead in my private gym

164
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:08,447
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

165
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:12,799
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

166
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,079
Now

167
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:16,127
I need to clear my name

168
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:21,503
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes

169
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,527
To find them
