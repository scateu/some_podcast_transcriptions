Ucdavis.edu

21
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,768
This is 99% invisible I'm Roman Mars

22
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:43,168
I'm not one of those people who romanticizes the edgier grittier New York but this park

23
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,264
Has been overrun with dogs and babies

24
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,664
And this is my friend Benjamin Walker reporting from New York City's Tompkins Square Park the first Tompkins Square riot

25
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,456
Took place in 1857

26
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:57,504
A bunch of unemployed immigrants

27
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,296
Try to set the park on fire

28
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:05,952
And then in 1863 the parks are more trouble when the ultraviolet draft riots in golf

29
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:12,352
City but it was the right of 1874 that made Tompkins Square Park famous over 7,000 workers

30
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:14,144
Battle 1600 police office

31
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,704
Some on Horseback swinging clubs

32
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:22,848
Early labor organizer Samuel Gompers describe the riot as an orgy of brutality

33
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:27,712
In 1936 Robert Moses redesign the park

34
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:28,992
It supposedly

35
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,784
He believes his design

36
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,808
Was Riot proof

37
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,344
Well I guess what we knew about that is

38
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:40,000
Chakrabarti is a professor of architecture and design at colombe

39
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,024
Peking university

40
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:44,096
And the late 80s he had a girlfriend who live in your tongue

41
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:44,864
Square Park

42
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,632
So he is

43
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,656
Experience the riots

44
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,680
The 1988

45
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,704
First hand

46
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:50,496
It was pretty extraordinary

47
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:53,568
You didn't want to wander around here too much

48
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:56,640
Set night time once again activist battled it out with

49
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,176
Cops on horseback

50
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,224
But the difference with this riot

51
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,552
If you can watch it on YouTube

52
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:09,952
In 1992 the park was redesigned again and there hasn't been another riot

53
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:14,560
Yes yes there does seem to be a little bit of a deliberate intent

54
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,328
Taft

55
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,120
Make it more of a places

56
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,144
Do the circulation

57
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,168
Places of

58
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:19,936
Repose

59
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:24,800
You know one can imagine crowd control happening in a different way now that there's all these for

60
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,080
Circulation pathway.

61
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,616
But no big

62
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,640
Lawns in which

63
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:29,920
Kongregate

64
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,456
The height of the fences scene

65
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,736
Growing

66
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:36,320
Chakrabarti recently wrote an essay on the architecture of public

67
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,624
Protest for the website Urban omnibus

68
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,928
He examined some of the protests

69
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,208
Unfolding in the Middle East

70
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,488
But he's interested

71
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,256
In the physical

72
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,024
Full site

73
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,840
Thousands and thousands of people are coming together

74
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,888
The traffic Circles of Bahrain

75
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:51,168
And the large and open

76
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:51,936
In space that is

77
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,728
Cairo's tahrir Square

78
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:54,752
I think one of the most

79
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:55,776
Extraordinary

80
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:56,544
Sites

81
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,848
When we looked at the protest run tires

82
00:03:59,104 --> 00:03:59,872
Square where that

83
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:02,688
Was young and older children and they were

84
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:05,504
Clearly better off and clearly worse off

85
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,528
I don't think

86
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,088
Did actions like that are possible in C

87
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,392
Without broad swath

88
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,672
Space

89
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,976
Chakrabarti recently toured the Middle East

90
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:17,536
And he learned that some authoritarian regimes

91
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,327
Are still keeping the Robert Moses

92
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,119
Tompkins Square dream alive

93
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,143
Designing

94
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,423
Control

95
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,703
If you go to rehab

96
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,239
The capital of Saudi Arabia here is

97
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,007
The city of

98
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,799
4 million people is growing

99
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:33,151
And yet there are virtually no public spaces other than

100
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:33,919
Shopping mall

101
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,455
Actually that's not exact

102
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:37,247
Play true there is a giant public

103
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,271
What's square in Riyadh

104
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,295
Deera Square

105
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,599
But the only time the public is really allowed to

106
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,367
Kongregate

107
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,391
Is when there are B

108
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,159
Beheadings

109
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,183
That's why expat

110
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:45,951
Call it

111
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:49,791
There's a sore drain the diameter of a

112
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:50,559
Pizza

113
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,607
In order to evacuate the blood

114
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:55,423
Chakrabarti says the Saudi royalty doesn't need to build

115
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,447
Chop chop

116
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:58,239
Square or at the shopping malls

117
00:04:59,007 --> 00:04:59,519
Cuz fear

118
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:00,287
Worx jawsaw

119
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,311
As well

120
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,079
Control

121
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,127
Doesn't need that much

122
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,919
Physical intervention

123
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,455
To be understood by the popular

124
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:11,295
There's a clear understanding that if you break the rules there are dire quoi

125
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,623
Now here in New York City's Tompkins Square Park

126
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,671
There is no pizza size

127
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,439
Blood drain

128
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:18,975
But there are fences

129
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,767
That keep people from coming together

130
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,047
The way they did in 90

131
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:27,679
You know a little gives a very tense time in New York serving history and a lot of

132
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:30,495
The more peaceful protesters were protesting about

133
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,775
Affordable housing

134
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,567
And I think those are very legitimate

135
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,151
Concern and actually I think it's really impacted policy

136
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,455
You know today the city of New York built

137
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:42,783
More affordable housing a year than the entire State of California

138
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:49,183
Bichon chakrabarti is not saying that open space necessarily lead

139
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,207
The social chain

140
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:52,511
But what do you want us to see

141
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,583
When we watch those giant crowds in the Middle East on

142
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,351
TV

143
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,375
Is this

144
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,399
One could argue

145
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,423
That

146
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:02,239
Nations actually may not be able to change without the

147
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,519
Kind of activities that happen

148
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,799
Pain in the public spaces

149
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:05,823
Of cities

150
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:13,247
99% invisible was produced this week by Benjamin Walker and me Roman Mars with support from lunar

151
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:19,647
Making a difference with creativity it's a project of kalw the American Institute of Architects San Francisco in this

152
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,439
Center for architecture and Design

153
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:24,511
Devon at Morganton 99% invisible. Org

154
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:37,567
Hello 99 percentile it's me Roman Mars and I have a little bonus for the podcasters and website streamers

155
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:43,967
This week story is from my friend Benjamin Walker and he has his own program on WFMU call too much information

156
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:49,855
And if you do not listen to too much information you have basically resigned yourself to have one hour of your week

157
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:50,623
Suck

158
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,903
When it could actually

159
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,183
Be awesome

160
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:58,559
When I asked him to do a story for 99% invisible I told him to highlight something that was kind of hidden

161
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:01,119
Has some greater thought InDesign put into it

162
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,143
I said

163
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:08,543
Toy Story like that penis graffiti store you did 40 Mi but I can't use that one because I can't talk about genitalia for Foreman

164
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,823
Morning Edition

165
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:14,431
It's actually a really nice story about funny meaning when it seemed like the most

166
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:16,223
Artistic displays but

167
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:19,039
Still too many penises for 7:30 in the morning

168
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,063
But alas it's

169
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:20,831
Perfect

170
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,623
For the podcast so

171
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:26,975
Young Master Gilbert please check with your dad if it's okay but for the rest of you

172
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,767
This is Benjamin Walker

173
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,535
Again

174
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,071
Promise program

175
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,351
Too much information

176
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:44,127
Gaylon Smith lives in Brooklyn and works in Manhattan

177
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,431
And so he spends a lot of his time

178
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,711
Riding the subway

179
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:48,991
And waiting for

180
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,039
Living in New York

181
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:53,343
You know you see a lot of graffiti and in the

182
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,135
The time. Which I've lived here

183
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,671
Mike the Knight ESO now

184
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,975
It hasn't been real big

185
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:02,815
Classic 70s and 80s train mural

186
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:06,911
Send it hasn't really been that that famous New York style that really

187
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:11,007
Yeah got the ball rolling all around the world it's quick tags and quick

188
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:11,775
Throw ups

189
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,799
Nothing much

190
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:13,567
Pieces

191
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,615
The majority of these quicktags

192
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,383
End up

193
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,663
On the posters

194
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,943
On a Subway platter

195
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,479
You know dude

196
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,015
The are knocked out teeth

197
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:26,623
The zombie eyes like all the other the blacked out or cut out eye sockets

198
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,207
You know your mustaches all the way from

199
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,231
Chaplin Hitler

200
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:34,047
Over to El Salvador Dali Style

201
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:37,375
But you know I'm a graphic designer in overtime I got

202
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,679
I got past the initial feeling of

203
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:40,959
Blur

204
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:46,335
And then something really jumped out of made it in a way that most obvious things like their penis is growing

205
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,383
Almost on every single poster

206
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,175
Jaylon Smith is the author

207
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,455
New York DEC

208
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,735
A book

209
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,271
About to Subway penis

210
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,087
A Primitive little symbol to be sure

211
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,623
But one he believes

212
00:08:59,135 --> 00:08:59,903
Is giving voice

213
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,695
To our true feelings

214
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,743
About our media landscape

215
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:11,423
These posters are are ubiquitous if you're if you're having traveled in New York you may not realize that there are

216
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:15,775
On practically all Subway platforms and there are dozens of them they're all over

217
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:20,383
The place they're in there in your stair literally in your space there about the height you are

218
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,151
Turn their large

219
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,455
Very unlike print ads in

220
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,479
Nothing like

221
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,247
Video types

222
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:28,575
And you're sort of bombarded with them

223
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,623
All the time and even if you don't think of your

224
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,903
Being bombarded

225
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,927
You're hanging with

226
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:33,695
A lot

227
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,999
And it can get really tedious

228
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,279
Especially if it's one you don't

229
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:38,815
But in this

230
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,351
Spec's in this country

231
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,631
Text you really can

232
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:44,703
Make your own counter argument your own counter state

233
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,751
And everyone knows what you mean

234
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,543
How is this different than

235
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,311
Say like

236
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,591
Conventional author

237
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,383
Graffiti tag

238
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:57,759
Glenn sings it makes it different in for me makes it really interesting is that it's

239
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,807
It's even more folklore

240
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:00,831
There's no

241
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:03,391
There's no authorship there's no getting famous

242
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:06,975
Well now you're not even really getting a lot of credit with your friends

243
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,791
I mean your friends may have been here giggling with you when you did it

244
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:13,375
But it's not really like your you know going all city with these things

245
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,911
No one's claiming a cigar

246
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,959
Everyone knows it's a little stupid

247
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:18,495
If there's something about

248
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,519
The idiocy

249
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:20,799
That is part of the

250
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,847
Part of why it works so well and

251
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:26,431
Like it in our culture way to show absolute disrespect

252
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,223
Is the draw this penis

253
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,295
But that's a very New Yorkie

254
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,575
Conversationalist how

255
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,343
New Yorkers like

256
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,111
Seether

257
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,415
Very aggressive

258
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,207
Moderately clever

259
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,487
And really thought of it

260
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:40,511
Disrespect

261
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,559
But honestly just

262
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,583
Respectful

263
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,143
The person drawing a penis didn't start the

264
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,959
Versation they didn't think they were winning and dominate

265
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,495
Communication

266
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,287
The Advertiser in the

267
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,311
System did

268
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,103
And so it's a way of

269
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,639
Putting some brakes on this

270
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:57,663
Is ramp

271
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,687
Concert

272
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,015
Getting over on one

273
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,039
Good advertising

274
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:09,183
Seems to feel that it's doing all right I like advertising okay I find it very interesting and away and so mad.

275
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,207
Really fun

276
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,487
But a lot of them aren't

277
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:15,071
Every time I see one of these penises now

278
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,095
I get

279
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,375
Kind of excited

280
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,167
It's like finally

281
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,471
Proof that there are tons of people

282
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,519
Who feel the same way I do

283
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:27,103
About our ever encroaching commercial world

284
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,383
Hunza people

285
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,943
And they're all saying the same thing

286
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,223
Screw

287
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:33,503
You

288
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:34,783
Really

289
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,063
It's awesome

290
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,855
This is actually happening now

291
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,879
Real people

292
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,671
Making real comments

293
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,463
I'm in a real space

294
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,487
And it's

295
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:46,047
More of a community than than you might realize

296
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,119
New York City subway stairs

297
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,399
10000

298
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,959
The conjoining that conversation

299
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,519
Or you can just witness it and give that sort of

300
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,823
A little bit of charcoal the living

301
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,127
I'm not saying I agree but I

302
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:12,415
That's an excerpt from Benjamin Walker's too much information find a link at the 99% invisible website

303
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:15,743
That's 99percentinvisible. Org

304
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,559
That's it for me this week I'm Roman Mars

305
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,583
Take care

306
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:27,007
Before we go I want to tell you about the body genius a five-part series from Bello radiotopia show the truth

307
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,543
The body genius is a dark

308
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,567
Comic mystery

309
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:33,151
That whines through a treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

310
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,431
We're looking the part

311
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:40,831
Might cost you your life you know that sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked to play superhero and

312
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:45,695
Any movie or lose a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

313
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:50,047
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like a dad

314
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:54,399
I'm having I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

315
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:56,703
Actually if I'm being honest

316
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:03,103
I'm one of the main guy to know how to do that kind of thing a few days ago Wesley Stern

317
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:09,503
After that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop was found dead in my private gym

318
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:16,159
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine even worse the cops think that I had some

319
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,439
Nothing to do with it

320
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,463
Now

321
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:24,863
I need to clear my name somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do what

322
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:27,167
Whatever it takes to find them

323
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:33,823
Final episode of the body genius drops on May 30th Bend all 5 parts
