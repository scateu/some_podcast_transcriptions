A few months before the end of the world

24
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:16,800
Paul Monaco posted this message on YouTube

25
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:18,592

00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:19,872
Call Monaco here

27
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:20,896
Buddha Paul

00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:24,224
Know me as

29
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:27,552
Probably all heard the news

30
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:29,856
Online closing down

31
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:32,928
The world that was ending was called The Sims Online

32
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:38,304
It was online version of one of the most popular computer games ever met a wonderful

33
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:42,912
Help me through a hard time in my life when I first got online

34
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:46,752
But ironically the online version of the sentence with not very popular

35
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:51,360
Banded up losing tons of subscribers and changing the name to EA land

36
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,640
And then they finally

37
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:53,664
Pull the clock

38
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:57,504
Thank you and please try to stay in touch

39
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,088
SmackDown

40
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:04,160
Whatever you choose to do and move on to

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,280
As you can probably hear

42
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:12,096
Jalen is not a normal video game

43
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:14,144
There are no monsters no killing

44
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,520
And although it had some competitive element for many players competition wasn't the point at all

45
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:22,080
Unlike a lot of other games where you might be

46
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,360
Shooting people

47
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:26,688
Slaying dragons or something this is a game about socializing

48
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:33,088
That's Robert Ashley and Robert Ashley

49
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:39,488
Very long Hiatus and the creator of a life well wasted a life well wasted it's about

50
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,280
Video games in the people who love them

51
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:46,144
Any aliens a video game that a dedicated few absolutely love

52
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,448
The crowded attracted I think we're p

53
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,984
Where to get together

54
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,264
And searched at me

55
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,288
Meet strangers

56
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,824
It was a nice place

57
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,616
Over time it became

58
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,896
A kind of intimate

59
00:02:57,152 --> 00:03:03,296
Almost bar like the cheers of video games where everyone knows your name and at the moment that Paul Mana

60
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:08,672
Maaco AKA Buddha Paul found ETA land it was exactly what I needed most

61
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,048
My wife's son

62
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,424
A long-term illness from a blood transfusion she had hepatitis C

63
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:23,008
3 years of silver life we're pretty

64
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,824
Yeah pretty much a challenge for a while for both of us

65
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,128
And after she passed away

66
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,176
I had absolutely no

67
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:33,504
Function of the new wake up go to work and go to sleep again

68
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,064
With with her illness I

69
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:42,464
Didn't get out and socialize much we know we weren't able to you know go out to the bars and meet up with friends

70
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,744
Have dinner

71
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,792
I totally be socialized myself

72
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,168
And this game was kind of a way for me to just can't get back into into living you

73
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:53,984
It was pretty amazing

74
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:00,384
And Paul began to live for Yale and 4 hours an hour

75
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:17,536
Really good but his friends were real friends and Virtual Worlds

76
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:22,911
Do have an upside your erase your call Eagle Imaging all that can be totally

77
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,679
Truly

78
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:27,519
Judged on who you really are and how you present yourself

79
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:31,103
There's no no prejudices no preconceived

80
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,895
Anythink

81
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:39,807
If you really taken at face value people could really like break loosen and be themselves and have some fun

82
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:48,511
But Paul is Utopia didn't last because he alien started hemorrhaging money

83
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:53,631
The writing was on the wall the server was about to go dark in this event this virtual apocalypse

84
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:56,191
My only exist in the memory of the players

85
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,215
Is it work

86
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,751
Dr. Henry lowood

87
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,335
I just stumbled across this and this

88
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,615
Project pie

89
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,687
Henry lowood who is this

90
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:10,271
Archival researcher at Stanford

91
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,295
Header project

92
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:16,671
Called how they got game which is on the history of digital games and simulations

93
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,951
Saving video games for

94
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:18,975
Generation

95
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:22,815
50 a hundred two hundred years from now are we going to say that history and I like

96
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,095
We got to save the video game

97
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:29,727
So doctor lowood his colleagues preserve what happens inside video games

98
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:32,799
Mount for a single player game like Pac-Man for example

99
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:33,823
This is easy

100
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,919
You effectively take out the Atari cartridge and put it on the Shelf

101
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:44,575
But saving multiplayer online games is not so simple saving the software alone is kind of a baronet

102
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:48,415
If you save the code for you and turn it on a hundred years from now

103
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:51,487
You enter a world and nothing would be there

104
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:54,303
All the things that Paul Monaco and his friends love

105
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,095
Would be impossible to find

106
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,119
You need to

107
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,935
Document what people are doing in these faces

108
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:06,335
That situation is much more like what a historian on archivist would do when faced with the problem of

109
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,871
Documenting the real world

110
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:11,199
Hello would caught wind of Yale and shutting down

111
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:15,295
He had the opportunity to record something I story in our calendar

112
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:18,879
With dye to witness firsthand in the real world

113
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,927
To see what it would be like

114
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,719
When an online world

115
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:23,999
Came to an end

116
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:30,399
What happens when a virtual world close at the end of a culture what is it like to be there at the last minute.

117
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,167
When it shuts down

118
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:35,775
To the tape is rolling in the last few hours the alien are being recorded

119
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:40,895
And the most dedicated DieHard users are there exchanging virtual hugs and reminiscing

120
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:43,711
The players are typing messages that appear like

121
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:45,247
Comic book word bubbles

122
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,807
You hear all these avatars crying

123
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:53,439
Can you also hear all the Coos and moans and then gibberish language of the game known as simlish

124
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:56,511
And you know they said they sound like they're going to be bombed and

125
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:59,839
And everything but it's not like a big pity party but then

126
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:02,143
Toward the end of the night

127
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:06,239
There's this radio station that you can listen to you in the game called Charmed radio

128
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,031
And they had

129
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,055
This DJ there

130
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,079
Names

131
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,871
Spike he is assertive

132
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:14,943
The only voice that you and appearing at the end of the world

133
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:17,247
And as soon as he starts talking

134
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,551
You understand what is being lost

135
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:24,671
Hey guys the last time you going to have me speak quote

3 has been awesome

142
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,503
Some people don't get attached to things

143
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:52,063
But not when you make fake friends

144
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,463

Cars that make you look like you

159
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:44,287
To get this feeling like

160
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,311
Like being on that

161
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,847
Deck of the Titanic

162
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:49,151
Anyone who actually stayed to the end

163
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:53,503
Very much invested in the game on an emotional level

164
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,295
When they pulled the plug on the server

165
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:58,111
Bits and pieces of the world started disappearing

166
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,671
Environment begin to the center brain

167
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02,719
The texture on the trees flickered

168
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,511
All the people froze

169
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,303
In blank. Of existence

170
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,935
The actual ending was was

171
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:16,543
You're not with a bang but with a whimper and the last thing that they saw was basically just

172
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,567
Json error message

173
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,847
Server disconnect

174
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:29,599
And then

175
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,647
World ended

176
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:43,935
