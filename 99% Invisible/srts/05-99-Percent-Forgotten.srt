Figure a shattered visit why

00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,792
Who has a wrinkled lip

43
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,840
And a sneer of cold command

44
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,120
The statue points

45
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:15,680
To all the works around him

46
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:18,496
And the poem reads my name is Ozymandias

47

King of Kings King of Kings

48
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,360

Do you mind

50
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:29,504
And the rest of the poem says that all of the works that the statue of

51
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,832
Appear nothing beside remains

52
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,624
So it's really a poem about

53
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:37,696
Set the figure remains but everything around it has

54
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,744
It appears everything that the figure in the sky

All of the things around it all of the landscape that the statue was supposed to serve urge to

59
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,104
Liberty in philanthropy

60
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,224
That's all still here the San Francisco the statue was dedicated to improving is there

A massive Stone pedestal

72
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:29,920
That rises up

73
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,456
To nothing

74
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,784

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,600
12 foot high bronze statue still on top

76
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:42,208

360 view of the

78
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,072
The city the statue was called the triumph

79
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,632
Of light with a statue of this woman

80
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,656
It looks a little like this

81
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,680
Statue of Liberty

82
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,728
She was holding Aloft a giant

00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,568
Piece of parchment

85
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:00,896
And below her was a crouched figure kind of reaching up

86
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:01,920
Do these two objects

87
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,992
Symbolizing mankind

00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,272
Reaching for

89
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,296
For light and Liberty

90
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:11,136
It was erected in 1887 by VIN developer

91
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,416
Future mayor out of

It Sutra dedicated the statue

95
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,095
In 1887 on Thanksgiving Day

96
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,119
He told the crowd

97
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,679
May the light shine from the torch

98
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:26,495
Are the goddess of Liberty to inspire our citizens

99
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,287
To good and Noble Deeds

100
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,311
For the benefit

101
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:32,383
Of mankind it was supposed to stand forever

102
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,919
To be a Timeless reminder

103
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:34,687
About

104
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:39,551
The importance of Liberty and civilization in philanthropy but it didn't last

105
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:43,135
In the 1930s people referring to it as the mystery

106
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:50,047
So obviously people have forgotten about Sutro and his goals and then by the 40s or discussion about removing it after death

107
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,071
Decades of neglect

108
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:54,143
Sometime in the 1950s it just disappears

109
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,959
The people discuss it online where it may have gone

110
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:57,983
Sonos

111
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,055
People really do come up to this hill

112
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:04,639
The same things that you bring dog walkers and

113
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,919
Urban Walker

114
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:06,943
Come up here

115
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:12,063
Maybe through these kind of discussions we can actually have someone maybe decide to build a new Statue

116
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,855
Who knows what it would look like

117
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:18,207
Imagine that debates about how would you symbolize Liberty in

118
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:18,975
Philanthropy

119
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:22,815
Yeah I don't know if I would like to see anything else here does that

120
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,095
Does that make me weird

121
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,631
Okay

122
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,167
I know I mean that is

123
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:30,495
Then what we should have here is a little

124
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:31,519
Plaque

125
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,543
Telling people

126
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,079
That there was once this

127
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,615
Beautiful

128
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,663

Philanthropy

130
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:39,711
And now it's gone

131
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,991
So that's what we need

132
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,295
Although a sense of mystery Zone

133
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,831
You know people look up in

134
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:46,879

And maybe in this case the

139
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,303
Absence

140
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,071

00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:44,479
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

164
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:48,575
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

165
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:53,183
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like a dad

I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

167
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:01,887
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main got to know how to do that kind of

168
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:09,311
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

169
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:12,639
Was found dead in my private gym

170
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:15,967
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

171
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:20,319
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

172
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:23,647
Now I need to clear my name

173
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:29,023
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes
