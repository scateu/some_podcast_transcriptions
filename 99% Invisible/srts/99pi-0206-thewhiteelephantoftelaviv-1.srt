Massive bus station known as the city under a roof

34
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:58,272

And end up at a giant Yiddish book Library

00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:50,496
We're about twenty years until the year 2010 Tel Aviv new Central bus station was the largest in the world

50
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:55,872
This isn't a city whose population just barely reached 400,000 people during this time

51
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,664
The bus station is busy

52
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:01,248
In fact it's almost impossible not to get lost there

53
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,600
All attempts at designing proper wayfinding have failed miserably

54
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:09,952
But what's probably most interesting about the new Central bus station in Tel Aviv

55
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:13,536
Is that it's sort of a layered fossil of the history of Israel

56
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:19,936
If archaeologists were to excavate through the layers they'd find remnants of every phase in the short story of this day

57
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:25,312
From Independence through post-war Euphoria to recession and westernization

58
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:28,640
They be able to trace the waves of immigration to Israel

From Europe and North Africa

60
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,712
Africa so in many ways

61
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:35,552
The story of Tel Aviv new Central bus station is

62
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,832
The story of Israel

63
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:40,416
And this story of Israel As Told through this bus station

64
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,696
It's going to be told to us

65
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,232
Mile High middle

66
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,280

Is real story

68
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:56,032
Silverado Chevy single thing I like about this station

69
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:58,080
Everything here is worthless

70
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:02,176
Believe me I'm here cuz I have no other choice before then

71
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,200
That salon

72
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:06,528
He bought a store in Tel Aviv new Central bus.

73
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,808
Fiction in the early 90s

74
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,088
Even before it opened

75
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,648
He dreamt of eventually passing it on to his

76
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:17,280
Cathy bought it is an investment 20 years ago

77
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,303
Now I'm stuck

78
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,863
No matter what happens I'm stuck

79
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:26,751
Taxes utility bills office fees will suck me. His place ruin me

80
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,055
Ellen store has been closed for years

81
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:32,127
Because no one hangs out anymore at the far end of the fourth

82
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,431
Where are you supermarket

83
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,271
And Ellen is just one of hundreds of vendors

84
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:41,343
To pay good money to purchase the store here and

85
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,623
Who are today

86
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,415
Stuck with a property that's worth

87
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,695
Absolutely not

88
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,399
I Met You London

89
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,703
Section of the station called that I'm load Market

90
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:57,727
On the thirty

91
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,775
He was Moonlighting

92
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,311
Selling baby clothes

93
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,847
Do Eritrean refugees

94
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:03,871
Friends doll

95
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,175
Trying to make up for the Lost income

96
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,711
Chrome is out of business shop

97
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:11,039
Which of the Stalls around him are abandoned

98
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:14,111
Old newspapers are glued to the display window

99
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,391
Nearby sports bar

100
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:22,815
If you can close you can make out headlines about the 2003 Columbia space shuttle disaster or

101
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:26,399
The disengagement from Gaza in 2005

102
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:29,727
The ceilings are covered with black soot

103
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,263
Board paddlers

104
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,543
Anxiously smoke cigarettes

105
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,359
It's right underneath an old sign that says no smoking

106
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:40,223
And the smell of nicotine Blends into the stench of urine swak

107
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:40,991
Diesel

108
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,807
What can I say

109
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:48,415
It's depressing to hang out with the vendors of the Dominican Republic

110
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,439
I love you

111
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,975
New Central bus station

112
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:58,143
The structure itself is terribly confusing and that's no coincidence

113
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,447
It was designed to make people get lice

114
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,239
The Labyrinth

115
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,287
It was coined by the station's Chief Architect

116
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,567
Lamb County

117
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,871
Indiana Labyrinth you get lost

118
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,663
You know how you get in

119
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,479
But you have no idea how he'll get out

120
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:16,575
So even if you get out that liquor County I'm an architect

121
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:19,391
And I'm the Widow of Salem call me

122
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,671
Let me always say

123
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:23,487
Did the good city is a city you get lost

124
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:27,839
Andy mentioned the central bus station is a city and the Wolf

125
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:30,399
So if it is a city and a wolf

126
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,703
Why shouldn't we get a little bit lost inside

127
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,263
So in order to help me get lost in in

128
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,031
I don't know

129
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,567
Slightly more organized fashion

130
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:44,223
I teamed up with an energetic architectural Duo

131
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:50,879
I'm an architect from Israel and I'm currently at Masters today

132
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:57,279
Bent at the architectural Association in London I just graduated from Master School design in Harvard

133
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:02,399
And I've been investigating researching the central bus station in Tel Aviv with Talia

134
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,935
For many years now

135
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,727
Research

136
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:08,287
Of the Central bus station started

137
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:14,687
When we had to reorganize the time carmie's archive and while going through loads of

138
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:19,039
Dusty documents and plans we found amazing materials

139
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:21,343
David from the sixties and seventies

140
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,647
About the central bus station

141
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:26,207
When you're the station pretty well even before

142
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:30,559
And when you what everybody thinks about the station how complicated the building is

143
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,095
But then we saw these

144
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,143
These drawings and they were like

145
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:38,239
Really beautiful actually the drawings are indeed

146
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,007
Beautiful

147
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:41,823
They're sweeping lines and huge glass skylight

148
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,103
But

149
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:46,175
Few people see much Beauty in the building as it stands today

150
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,455
Dalian

151
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,991
And I accept

152
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,527
It's really hard to do

153
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,319
Describe it without getting lost

154
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,367
In this weird dark

155
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,135
Ollie's

156
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:59,231
Where you really don't have anybody around you

157
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:01,023
Almost half of it is underneath the

158
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:01,791
Street-level

159
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:04,095
So it is dark really dark

160
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,375
Ender list

161
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,935
In a way it's like a dark amusement park

162
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,727
You're actually of Spades

163
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,495
On one hand

164
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:13,055
And on the other hand having like

165
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:13,823
The most

166
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:18,175
Exciting environment around you with people from all around the world

167
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,223
Super colorful

168
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,271
I would say to Movie Central place

169
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,295
It's a lousy

170
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:24,831
Almost

171
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:30,975
Anything or everything to happen in its is what went wrong

172
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,535
So we go there and try to find

173
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,559
The answer for that

174
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:38,399
They took me around this magical multi Central dark amusement park

175
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,167
There's

176
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,727
At some point they let me down to the abandoned first

177
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,775
Store then up a narrow ramp

178
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,567
Creaky side door

179
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,871
I looked around and realized

180
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:51,967
We are in the lobby of a deserted movie theater

181
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:58,879
So we're actually 15 meters below ground level here in what was the Grand Cinema

182
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:02,719
And there was Six movie theaters here with

183
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:07,327
Amazing names like John Wayne Everest Gandhi

184
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:12,191
Even though it's been more than 15 years since the credits roll on the last movie played here

185
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:14,239
The theaters are still in great shape

186
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,287
The walls are covered with posters

187
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,079
Films like Pulp Fiction

188
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:18,847
Titanic

189
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,895
The Acoustics remain excellent

190
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,455
And the cushions of the red velvet seats are

191
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,479
Still pretty comfy

192
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:27,807
Miss forgotten glamour is testimony to the big hoax

193
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,087
The station invited in

194
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:29,855
It's early days

195
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:35,743
What time does the original idea was that passengers would pop in and catch a movie as they waited for the bus

196
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:37,791
That never had

197
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:41,119
And the cinema closed down just a few years after dope

198
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:48,031
Today as you can see is completely abandoned still here

199
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:55,199
The new Central bus station open its doors to the public in the summer of 1993

200
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:59,807
After nearly three decades of planning it was shiny and new

201
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:00,831
Exciting

202
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,391
But then in just a few short years

203
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,439
Became the grimiest place in town

204
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:09,023
How does a place go from such splendor

205
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,559
If such neglect

206
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,095
So short a period

207
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:16,191
Sean what about xiamen architect writer

208
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,727
Publisher and

209
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,519
Who lives right near the sea

210
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,055
300-meter

211
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:24,639
Thinks that in order to answer this question we need to go all the way back

212
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,431
The days before the establishment of is

213
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,967
In 1948

214
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:33,855
We should talk about the land Central bus station was built on

215
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,415
I just don't do Arabs

216
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,487
From Jaffa used to be in Orange Grove

217
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:41,535
Play Sublime of grew up on the outside

218
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,839
He remembers it well

219
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:47,167
Jamaya party

220
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,983
It was called Abbotts Grove

221
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:55,871
We used to sneak in underneath the fence steal some oranges and then run away

222
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,919
Following the war of independence

223
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:02,015
Most of the Citrus Groves in the area between GFI in Tel Aviv

224
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,551
Where abandoned

225
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,599
Deserted / confiscated

226
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,391
Depending on your political

227
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,719
In any event the state took over the land

228
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,255
Jews started moving in

229
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,095
Princesses Homestead exactly where the new Central bus take

230
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,631
Situated today

231
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:21,983
I buy chili II by my house was a special house

232
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:24,799
Right on the corner of levinsky Street

233
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,335
Second house from the corner

234
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,151
On the second floor there was this big wall

235
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,687
How to mural

236
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,711
Of the Sea of Galilee

237
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:35,039
For the fisherman fishing

238
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,575
Llama llama

239
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,879
Really something to favor

240
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,183
Beautiful houses in Bryans mother

241
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,631
Initially the government wanted to expand a nearby neighborhood by the name of Novation

242
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,447
But is always the plans were delayed

243
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,215
Installed

244
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,263
So they were forgotten altogether

245
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:58,079
So instead of a brand new residential neighbor

246
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,871
Fayetteville Observer

247
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,895
Started to develop

248
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,943
Islamic tents

249
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:03,711
Sheds

250
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:06,783
Warehouses meanwhile

251
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,575
In a better part of town

252
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,879
Leave the man called alyafeets

253
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:13,695
He was an immigrant coming from pollen and studies

254
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,231
And he open up

255
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:15,999
Cafe Pele

256
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,535
Switch was a really famous

257
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:23,935
Coffee shop on the seaside of Tel Aviv Cafe Fields was the

258
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:24,959
Swankiest joint in town

259
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,751
Senior British officers

260
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,799
Came to relax over a dry martini

261
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:35,199
Elegant waiters in long tails and a boat I would walk around serving cocovan steak bearnaise

262
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,759
In an orchestra played the latest hits in the back

263
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:50,815
And as he spent his days sitting in his Cafe smoking his cigars

264
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:53,631
Pete's couldn't help notice the construction friends

265
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,911
Going on all around it

266
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:57,215
Imma be this person with life right now

267
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:00,799
This is a promotional permit Tel Aviv from the late 50s

268
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,431
Over here

269
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,527
New York

270
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,831
Well, the same

271
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:16,415
Apart from the fact that we haven't got the skyscrapers

272
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:20,255
Tel Aviv was humming

273
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:24,863
And feels the tireless entrepreneur spotted real estate opportunities everywhere

274
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:29,471
So we purchased the old Orange Grove turn slime from the Jewish National Fund

275
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:35,871
But then there was the problem of the squatters

276
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,151
Like

277
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,015
DLC gear

278
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,039
Bill showed up

279
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:45,343
And wanted to see what them

280
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,135
Gradually he bought them all out

281
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:51,487
Brought in tractors and raise the shed to create one giant product line

282
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,071
The location wasn't ideal

283
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,375
Across the street was New Vision on

284
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,935
Densely populated low-income neighborhood

285
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:03,007
And in the middle of Nevaeh Shannon's to Tel Aviv

286
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:03,775
Mean buster

287
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,055
The Olsen

288
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:10,687
Everyday dozens and dozens of buses zigzag through the neighborhoods Narrow Street

289
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,735
And as often happens

290
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,271
This contributed to the areas

291
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,319
Decline into a hub of crime

292
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,087
Poverty

293
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,903
It was clear to the municipal planners that

294
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:20,927
Something wasn't working

295
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:25,535
They wanted to move the station to another place while they renovate and open up the old one

296
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:26,815
So cute

297
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,607
Who was a really clever guy just

298
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:30,399
Came out to dance party and told them

299
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,167
Wait a minute

300
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:31,935
Why

301
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,727
Would you move the bus station and then

302
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,263
Bring it back just keep it

303
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,543
Where do you

304
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,591
Well I will build you a new one

305
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,895
And pills had Big Dreams

306
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:44,223
He was going to finance the building of the new bus station

307
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,015
By making it part of a huge Mall

308
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,039
It was

309
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:53,183
Meant to be the largest bus station in the world when it was

310
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,207
I conceived

311
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,999
Israel is still a small country

312
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:58,303
With a population of just over 2 million

313
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:01,887
So as you might imagine lots of people thought the idea was

314
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,423
Absolutely insane

315
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,727
But this is charismatic

316
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:08,543
And even more importantly he knew all the right people

317
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:12,895
So you managed to persuade the folks at City Hall and with their approval

318
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:15,199
He approached a 33 year old architect

319
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,479
Langkawi

320
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,015
Enfield said to him

321
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:22,367
Build me a central bus station

322
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:34,143
Promise first proposal was relatively simple day there was the decisions that will ever would be similar to

323
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,471
Train station in the sense that the buses would pass right through it

324
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,519
On top of that they would build

325
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:44,127
Apartments hotels offices in in the center that would be a big Park

326
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,687
Which would actually sit on the stations

327
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,247
From there on it only went down

328
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,319
Pretty quickly issues a rose with

329
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,343
Counties plan

330
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:56,415
Bigger than than the two rival bus companies

331
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,463
Could become stakeholders in a project

332
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:01,279
Where is furious when they realized they would have to sheriff

333
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,815
Not a problem

334
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:03,583
The developer

335
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:06,399
We'll put the bus companies on separate

336
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,703
Carly had a brilliant idea

337
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:12,543
Dividing the transportation between the 1st and the 6th floor

338
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,079
The dance city buses

339
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,359
Svn stop on the first floor

340
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:20,223
And it gets Intercity buses would leave from a platform all the way up on the 6th

341
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:25,087
So passengers transferring from one to the other would have to go through the entire building

342
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:27,391
And what's been good money in The Malt Shop

343
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:33,023
Yeah it seem logical at this time

344
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,863
Was very trendy at the time and I'm coming forward this idea to Israel

345
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:43,519
Built in the meantime understood that the project was going to be much more expensive than he originally expected

346
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:44,287
He said

347
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:47,359
Cuz I mean we need more spaces which we can sell

348
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:50,687
And so in every subsequent design, submitted

349
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,735
The station grew bigger

350
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:53,503
Bigger

351
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:57,599
By the six draft handed in in November 1967

352
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:00,415
The blueprint that started to resemble that behemoth

353
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,183
Reno today

354
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:05,023
In fact I remember I'm talking about the central bus station

355
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,327
And saying that they wanted

356
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,607
To build the largest

357
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,143
Bus station in the world

358
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:15,263
And they kept wondering why would anyone wants to build a largest

359
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:18,591
Central bus station in such a small country

360
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,383
But this is exactly what I

361
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:24,735
In the end the new Central bus station was designed to include 8th floor

362
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,551
For a total of 230 square meter

363
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,343
Parasaur 57 Acres

364
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,879
Which is more less

365
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:31,647
2

366
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,927
Empire State Building

367
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:36,255
By the time Prince Carlos building permits in order

368
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:39,327
Architectural Styles around the world had begun to change

369
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:43,423
New wisdom had it that a few small scale public transportation hubs

370
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,239
We're more efficient than one gigantic station

371
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,031
And besides

372
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:51,103
There were enough examples to conclude that megastructures

373
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,663
Rarely function the way they were originally intended to

374
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,735
On top of all that has had other problems

375
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,295
He had bought out all the squatters

376
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:02,367
But the residents in the adjacent streets were living

377
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:05,951
Even though their neighborhood had never been particularly nicer

378
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:06,975
Upscale

379
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:08,767
They were concerned that the new station

380
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,559
And all the increased bus traffic

381
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,351
Would depreciate the value of their

382
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,631
Apartments even more

383
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:16,447
The day would end up living in a cloud of smoke and

384
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,215
Fumes

385
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,239
And

386
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,519
As it turns out

387
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,287
They were right

388
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,823
This is Sheila Kesha

389
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,103
A resident of the neighbor

390
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:26,687
Can you imagine what it feels like to wake up

391
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:29,759
Z82 this terrifying rattling noise

392
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:33,343
And I wake up and this news doesn't stop

393
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:37,951
You seated home you want to watch TV and you can't hear it

394
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:40,255
You want to talk with the family

395
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,535
You can talk

396
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:44,095
Deafening noise

397
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,399
Beside that we have to

398
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:48,447
We have to shut the balconies

399
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:51,263
Because the people who go by in the buses

400
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:56,127
Chimney practically see what's going on inside our houses

401
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:58,943
Give me a call.

402
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:01,247
Someone knocks on the door I can't hear it

403
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:03,551
It's awful what can I tell you

404
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,319
My niggaa.

405
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,599
Terrible noise

406
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:06,367
All the time

407
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,391
That's in Canarsie

408
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,463
Who still lives directly across from one of the bus sex

409
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:13,023
He was one of the residents who complained

410
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:16,095
And well you can judge for yourself

411
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:20,191
This is a recording from his living room window

412
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:20,959
10 p.m.

413
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:29,151
Inline sander Central bus station should never been built in the first place

414
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,175
Absolutely not

415
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,967
But pills was determined

416
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:35,295
End on December 14th 1967

417
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:39,391
Six months after Israel tripled its size in the Six-Day War

418
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,439
The minister of Transportation

419
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:44,255
The mayor of Tel Aviv and many other dignitaries

420
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,559
Gathered at the edge of the old Orange Grove

421
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:48,351
And lay down the Cornerstone

422
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,631
Perricone's create

423
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:52,703
It went now felt like a huge country

424
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:54,495
Huge station scene

425
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,263
50

426
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:58,591
The hubris of building the world's largest by state

427
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:01,151
Was in line with the general sense

428
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,687
Post-war euphoria

429
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:12,159
In the months that followed

430
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:14,207
Hundreds of workers dug Foundation

431
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,999
Splayed rebar poured in concrete

432
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,279
Drilled and hammered

433
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,095
And all the while residents demonstrated outs

434
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,935
Hilton the meantime was ready to move on to the second stage

435
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:29,823
He needed to sell the vast commercial space he was building

436
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:32,127
Who invited Jews from all over the world

437
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,919
Time to come on and see the place

438
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:36,223
And get a free tour in Israel

439
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:36,991
On him

440
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:39,295
Sort of like breath right before birth

441
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:41,087
And of course the grand finale of the

442
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:45,439
The trip would be a visit to the new Central bus station filters new project

443
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:47,743
With expectations that the visitors

444
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,791
Would buy a shop in the station

445
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,863
Teens hope to tap into the overflowing Zionist sentiment

446
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,399
Follow the Six-Day War

447
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,959
And amazingly he succeeded

448
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:59,007
Hundreds of people bike shops

449
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,543
Some of them took out loan

450
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:03,359
And others like Macklemore from France

451
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,639
Solder houses

452
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,663
Natalia

453
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:11,551
Sunday will promise the Magnificent shop in a shopping center that the

454
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:12,575
Whole world with

455
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,111
Others like

456
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:17,696
Whose house with the painting of the Sea of Galilee was

457
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,464
Demolished

458
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,744
To make way for the station

459
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:26,400
We're giving shops has some sort of compensation I got 42 at the central bus

460
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,448
It's at the shop will be

461
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,216
Be something

462
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:35,616
Something great it's important to bear in mind that peels didn't lease those shops as a

463
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:36,384
The mall developer

464
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,152
Weather today

465
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,432
He sold

466
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,456
Property

467
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:42,528
The owners register the asset under their own name

468
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,320
Just like buying an apartment

469
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,368
Over the next 6 years

470
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:49,184
It's sold more and more of his stories on paper

471
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:51,488
The massive building started taking shower

472
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,536
People were excited

473
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:56,352
Every few months that would be a headline in the paper

474
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,376
Saying something like

475
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:59,168
A city under a roof is

476
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:05,568
Is coming to life or the world's most high-tech bus station due to open but then in 1973

477
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,104
Became the Yom Kippur War

478
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:10,176
And with it a general Nationwide recession

479
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:15,040
Chicago levinsky Contracting Company field setup to build

480
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,320
Bankroll the

481
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:17,344
Started fault

482
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,904
It was a shortage of concrete

483
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,696
Problems with the Worker's Unions

484
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,488
Growing debt

485
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:27,584
Finally in 1976 filed for bankruptcy

486
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,376
The construction stopped.

487
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:33,472
By that time the structure was already moved

488
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,032
A huge concrete

489
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,568
In the middle of the city

490
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:41,152
Tell your grandma and grandpa's all remember this place is the series

491
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:41,920
Big white out

492
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:49,600
Now a saga of who should take responsibility for the Fiasco erupted

493
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,904
Public commissions were established

494
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:54,464
But the blame game went on and

495
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,232
On

496
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,768
And so

497
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:58,048
For 12 years

498
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,584
That miserable station

499
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,376
Spit some self called it

500
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,400
Remain empty

501
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:03,936
Or

502
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,728
Almost there

503
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,264
A huge colony of bats

504
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,544
It's made the building their home

505
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:15,456
Gradually started to host those sort of national Park of society

506
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:19,552
By the early 80s the station had already gained its notorious reputation

507
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:23,136
It served as an underground meeting

508
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:26,208
Huge Raves Rock and Metal

509
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:32,608
Replacement

510
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:38,240
In 1983 after a decade of neglect

511
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,032
Inhabited only by bats

512
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,056
Punks

513
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:43,872
It finally seems like the station was going to be redeemed

514
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,432
Contractor motivacion about the crotch

515
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,456
From its creditors

516
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:49,760
For a bargain price of $5000000

517
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:52,832
Once again you could hear the hustle and bustle

518
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:55,136
Construction work in the empty concrete show

519
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:58,720
You're not like his predecessor peels knew the right people

520
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,536
Like the then minister of Transportation

521
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,304
Shaketha

522
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,864
When cats have visited the site just

523
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,168
A few months before it was supposed to open to the public

524
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:13,056
He said that I'm certainly pleasantly surprised

525
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:18,176
And we of course will be happy to help you in any way to overcome bureaucratic Oster

526
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,784
What guitar was happy about

527
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,576
Was that Jana was delivered

528
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,392
The station was set to open more or less on schedule

529
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,464
Most of the real estate had already been sold

530
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,488
Back in the day

531
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:36,096
So in order to make this financially viable you don't know how to build more

532
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,888
And more

533
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,168
And more

534
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:43,008
The huge station like The Very Hungry Caterpillar just

535
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:46,592
Gru and Gru

536
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:50,688
Toto Build-A-Bear ranger station is more than double the area that was authorized

537
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,712
That's the issue

538
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:55,040
Lawyer who represents many of the original shop owners

539
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:57,600
Long-standing class action suit against

540
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,368
The station

541
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,904
He's actually continuing a fight is

542
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,696
His father also a like started

543
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:06,048
LaFollette

544
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,584
Thousands of square meters

545
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,424
Equability legally without building permits or even organize plans

546
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:13,984
And they were also sold to people

547
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,032
Tennessee impossible Fallout.

548
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,568
And there's really nothing

549
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,336
Things to do about

550
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:21,664
So what you're saying is that the new Central bus station is

551
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,224
The largest construction violation in the city

552
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:26,016
Bollocks in the country

553
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,624
Casa however promise to remove bureaucratic Ops

554
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:32,416
And he kept his

555
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,096
Advertising brochures in radio campaigns to the public to buy a shop

556
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:42,656
The country's biggest commercial centers

557
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,680
Is on its way

558
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,984
Don't let it start without you

559
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:58,528
And again people who seem to have forgotten the heartache of the station

560
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,808
First incarnation

561
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:01,600
Lined up to buy a store from you on

562
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:03,904
In the summer of 1993

563
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:08,000
29 years after the ambitious architect that I'm counting put pencils

564
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:08,768
The paper

565
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,584
All the usual dignitaries reconvened at the station

566
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:16,448
Prime minister Yitzhak Rabin was there as was the transportation minister

567
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,728
Finance minister

568
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:19,008
The mayor of Tel Aviv

569
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:20,800
And even, himself

570
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:23,872
And what was the only time he ever visited the building

571
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:24,896
While it was working

572
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,224
In a rare moment of self-deprecating humor

573
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:34,624
The opening ceremony was kicked off by releasing a giant helium balloon in the shape of

574
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,392
All white outfit

575
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,976
But not everyone was amused

576
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:41,024
Here again is Chula Kesha

577
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,072
One of the station's unhappy Neighbors

578
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:46,656
At the time they were celebrating inside

579
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:51,264
We were standing outside in a big demonstration of thousands of people

580
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,288
Thousands of

581
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,056
People

582
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:55,360
And we were standing in demonstrating

583
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,920
At the foot of the Central bus station

584
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:02,784
This terrible monster that is destroying lives until today

585
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:05,856
But the neighborhood residents protest was largely ignored

586
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:09,184
While all of Israel heard about the grand opening that evening

587
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,464
National TV

588
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,048
Sahana milk

589
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:17,120
More than 30 years after Creekside first set his eyes on

590
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:20,960
The new Central bus station in Tel Aviv was now up and run

591
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,264
It's been open ever since

592
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:26,080
But it's far from the Posh shopping

593
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:26,848
What was meant

594
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:33,504
Does a certain temptation to view

595
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,832
Do those first years as the years when things were still working

596
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:38,880
But honestly

597
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,672
Things never really worked here

598
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,000
You'll never manage to sell all the new stores had built

599
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,536
So many of them stood Baker

600
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:47,840
And many of the ones that were open

601
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:49,632
Specialized stores located in

602
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:50,656
Far Corners of

603
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:51,936
Last Labyrinth

604
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:52,960
Where

605
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:54,240
Barely getting any footage

606
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,056
You can understand why the vendors

607
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,848
Don't have many good words to say about

608
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:02,176
This Saturday in Tarzana

609
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,968
Not good

610
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:08,320
Working

611
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:12,416
Play mice but nothing more wife in a cemetery

612
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:18,816
The wedding was not enabled

613
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,632
Nothing it stinks

614
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:23,424
Can you look at my cash register

615
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,704
No money

616
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:31,360
Then. You can't make a living here no work

617
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:32,640
No nothing

618
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:35,200
I'm just sitting here passing the time

619
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:39,552
I prefer to work in another place than inside here in Tel Aviv

620
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:40,832
Central bus station

621
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:42,368
And we can go on like

622
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,648
Believe me

623
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:45,440
We're not short on this kind

624
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,048
In 2002 the ground floor was closed for Good

625
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:52,352
The reason excessive Airport

626
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:56,960
That man that done the municipal bus company moved up to the 6th

627
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:57,728
7

628
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,264
Right next to egg

629
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,288
The national bus

630
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:01,824
So now what

631
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,640
All the platforms located on the top floors

632
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:06,688
The entire concept of the station

633
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,528
People will trickle down through the shops on their way from one bus

634
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:11,552
To the other was

635
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:12,320
Gone

636
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:15,392
The lower floors of the station became ghost

637
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,744
Before long just like his predecessor.

638
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:22,048
Mordecai and I filed for bankruptcy

639
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,144
Since then the station is falling deep in debt

640
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:29,216
They're real estate billionaires and Banks

641
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:31,776
Passing the hot potatoes from one to the other

642
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:34,080
Store owners suing in court

643
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:39,200
And in the middle of all of this is me Kizi the station's general manager

644
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:41,504
Who's doing his best to run the play

645
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:44,320
He's tried all kinds of creative solution

646
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:46,368
Cheap rates for artist Studios

647
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:48,416
Cultural events conferences

648
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:50,720
But it seems as if the station is

649
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,512
Is just getting emptier and emptier

650
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,048
We have here

651
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,608
1500 pesos

652
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,704
But only say 600 open

653
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,776
Because the building is so huge

654
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:06,080
Download necessary

655
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:10,176
At first the planners thought that up to a million people a date with

656
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:11,456
Pass through the station

657
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,736
Nowadays

658
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,784
Eva rage

659
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:17,600
50000 people are coming

660
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:19,648
It's going down

661
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,184
50000 people

662
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:23,744
That's just 5% of the original estimate

663
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:26,304
Maybe this is the root of the problem

664
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:30,144
The developers agreed LED them to sell more and more commercial space

665
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:31,680
Which in turn

666
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:33,472
Do the station size out of

667
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:34,240
Proportion

668
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:39,872
Or maybe it's all just a location location location and putting the station in the poor neighborhoods

669
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:40,896
Southern Tel Aviv

670
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:41,920
Sealed his fate

671
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,760
Or perhaps it was simple short-sightedness

672
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:50,112
In the 1960s there were only 24000 private vehicle

673
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,136
Wilson all of Israel

674
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,672
And everybody use public

675
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:53,696
Capitation

676
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:57,280
Who knew then that this number would increase more than a hundred fold

677
00:30:57,792 --> 00:31:00,096
And reached a 2.5 million cars

678
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:01,376
Crowder roads today

679
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:04,960
When Pete's and call me dreamt up the project

680
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:07,520
The imagine the city under a roof

681
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:10,336
When all said and done

682
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,872
Does kind of have that vibe

683
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,664
Here's Talia the ark

684
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,456
Anyway the fact that it

685
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:17,248
It's called a city under a roof

686
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:19,040
Kind of says it all

687
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:25,440
In the city of got everything you've got the dark spaces you've got the lease spaces you've got the interesting bits you have the scary bit

688
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,720
To have the exciting bits

689
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:28,512
And all of it just

690
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:30,816
Coexister coexister

691
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:31,584
In a way

692
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,376
Despite the gloomy this all around

693
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:36,192
Sometimes you get the feeling you can spend your whole life

694
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:38,240
Does that post office

695
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:39,520
Grocery shop

696

In synagogue says the whole world in here right on the television news

703
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:02,048
It's just a shame that nobody bothers to pick up the stone and take a look beneath it

704
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:11,520
More than 50 years have passed since the idea for the central bus station was

705
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:14,080
Born in the creative mind of Alia.

706
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:17,664
And started to take shape on rom-com is drawing for

707
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:22,016
Ever since people have been trying to figure out what to do with it

708
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:23,808
Here's schonwald

709
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:24,832
About the architect

710
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:32,000
I can search and see how and about 10-15 years do use of the station's decreasing shops are closing

711
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:35,072
Trade is deteriorating and gradually

712
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:38,400
Causing deterioration in older neighborhoods around here

713
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:41,472
In this case there is no deal winner

714
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:44,800
Everybody's loser the architect of the

715
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:50,176
Office building lamb call me asking to be despised for this

716
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,712

Is a bit more Optimus

725
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:19,616
I believe the story of the Central bus station is not over yet

726
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:20,896
Pinterest for his part

732
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:31,648
Nowadays

733
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,928
I have no energy

Amelia Earhart

735
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,232
There are many parallels

736
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:38,048
Between the story of the Central bus station and

737
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,840
The entire science project
