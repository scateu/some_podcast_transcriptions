Performing this story in front of a live audience was a privilege

37
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:40,352
Unlike anything else I've ever done

38
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:42,400

41
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,568
I'm Roman Mars

42
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,344
It was the middle of the night

43
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,928
On March 27th 1964

44
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:10,560
Earlier that evening the second biggest earthquake ever measured at the time

45
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:15,936
And scene 9.2 had mangled Anchorage Alaska

46
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:19,008
115 people dying

47
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:25,920
Houses turned literally upside down or skidded into the sea there was no light

48
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:27,456
Power in the city

49
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:29,248
And for a long time

50
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:32,576
Virtually no communication with the outside world

51
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,904
But there was radio

52
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,400
It was a station in Anchorage running on backup generator is in a Crock transmitter

53
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:50,496
What station in Fairbanks picked up that signal and repeated it

54
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:57,408
And a man in Juno somehow picked up at Fairbank station called a radio station in Seattle and let the

55
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:03,040
Broadcast play over the phone

56
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:06,624
Bill Noble would like to get a message if they're all right

57
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:11,232
Like that a voice from Anchorage touch the lower 48

58
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:17,632
Assignment city was still there and soon the degraded signal broadcast in Seattle

59
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:24,032
Relaid and relate again until eventually people across America then

60
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:30,432
Around the world I heard the same woman's voice

61
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,992
Mary sweet is asked to contact your mother

62
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,040
Mother is at home

63
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:40,672
The president of that Anchorage radio station happened to be on a Goodwill tour of Japan

64
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:43,488
And when he turned on a radio in Tokyo

65
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:48,608
He couldn't believe in it was the voice of his own news girl back home

66
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:52,448
The woman's name was Jeannie chance

67
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:57,568
John Wang and the brink of players

68
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,360
Have her story

69
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:17,183
1964 Anchorage was the fastest growing city in America

70
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:22,559
The generation earlier it had been a Frontier Town Without a single concrete building

71
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,863
100000

72
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:29,215
It was mostly military buildup in oil speculation

73
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,007
The city felt like a bubble that

74
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:37,407
Pot Alaska is only been a state for 5 years and is 1 minute

75
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:42,015
The feeling that everything is temporary we weren't all going to leave but you know

76
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,039
We might

77
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:49,695
Insecurities made every new construction feel monumental

78
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:53,791
He was real like the brand new JC Penney building downtown

79
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:57,631
This is one of the first Big Chain retailers to build in Alaska

80
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:58,911
It was huge

81
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,703
Nothing said

82
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03,007
Sophisticated civilization

83
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,799
Rising out of the wilderness

84
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:09,407
Like a five story department store full of lingerie and blender

85
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:28,607
Beginnings of genuine culture

86
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:32,447
Volunteer Symphony conducted by on Moonlighting bulldozer Opera

87
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,751
The Anchorage Little Theater

88
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:38,591
A community troop run by a Cosmopolitan guy in a turtleneck

89
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,871

Any work does actors Hardy just ages own 3 hour Epic

93
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:54,207
Of Alaskan history called Cry Of The Wild Ram

94
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:57,535
I know it sounds a little bit like waiting for guffman

95
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,327
They were good

96
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:03,679
Meanwhile covering all this life in the city or two daily newspapers

97
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,727
Local radio stations

98
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:12,127
One of them Ken I prided itself on being

99
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:12,895
State of the Union

100
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:16,223
And one of Katie and eyes biggest on-air personalities

101
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,783
Was a woman named Genie

102
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:26,975
Jenny was 37 she's grown-up for in Bonham Texas then come to Alaska with her husband if

103
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,279
A few years earlier looking for opportunity

104
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,095
The only sort of found it the first

105
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:37,983
He sold used cars and she watch their three kids at home but Genie loved radio

106
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:42,079
So she started working construction every morning in exchange for childcare

107
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:46,431
Then go to work all afternoon at one of the local radio stations

108
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,455
Back then

109
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:53,855
Women were usually made to cover cooking or fashion but it came and I Genie turn yourself into a

110
00:07:54,111 --> 00:08:00,255
Reporter driving all over Alaska with a mobile broadcasting unit in her car she fluid smokejumper

Reported from Inuit villages in Crab boats

113
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:12,543
Her voice was part of the city people trusted are respected her in Anchorage I don't know way women journalists were in Ohio

114
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,591
Who is respected in 1964

115
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:17,151
Later a New York papers celebrated rise

116
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:23,039
Alaskan housewife and mother of three children who does a man-sized job with a radio microphone

117
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,183
Late in the afternoon of March 27th

118
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:33,535
Jenny was driving her thirteen-year-old son to a bookstore downtown

119
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:39,935
Wizkid Friday and lots of people would already gone home from work for the Easter weekend a banner across Sports

They were doing the Thornton Wilder play

123
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:46,847
Our town

124
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,663
Curtain was going to go up at 8

125
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,687
But

126
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,479
At 5:36

127
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:05,279
Cheese first thought when your car start

128
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:08,863
Started bucking at the red light was that she must have blown a tire

129
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:14,239
But then through the windshield she saw people knocked down in the street

130
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:20,639
She saw a line of parked cars at the gas station slam together and separate and slam again

131
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:23,199
Do you watch them fold in and out and thought

132
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:26,271
Like a grotesque accordion

133
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:32,927
Later one man would say it felt like the Earth was whipping the city around like a dog shaking an animal he's killed

134
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:38,559
Building listed off their foundations issues ground waves move through the asphalt

135
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,351
The roads were liquid

136
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:45,471
The JC Penney building a school kids stuck in the elevator watch the book

137
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:50,079
Suddenly levitate off the elevator floor and hang weightless in midair in front of them

138
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:56,479
Split-second was like he was in orbit and that's when he knew the elevator was falling

139
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,575
Quick went on like this for almost five full minutes

140
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:01,855
Ben

141
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:03,647
Stop

142
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,951
Peninsula did

143
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,231
Genie

144
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:08,511
Direct car in gear

145
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:21,567
She was a reporter after all and still not realizing how severe the situation was she raised to the police station to get

146
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,359
Quick story believing broadcast

147
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:26,943
Inside all the filing cabinets were thrown over

148
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:29,247
Ceiling plaster sheets on the floor

149
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,551
Then a second juul hit

150
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:37,951
We got off came running around the corner shouting

151
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:44,351
An enormous concrete panel at shorn away from the JCPenney's exterior in Fallen now the entire

152
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:48,959
Building with sagging and running over can you watch the second panel lerch loose

153
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:52,543
Drop with a roar the scene was brutal

154
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:55,615
Geez the brown part of a body in the snow

155
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:59,199
The person split into by the falling debris

156
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:05,599
Chevy station wagon was flattened but you could hear a woman still alive inside calling to the crowd

157
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,623
Route

158
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:07,647
Then

159
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,695
Genie rounded a corner

160
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:14,303
Saw the whole impossible panorama

161
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:17,119
1 in tire size

162
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,655
4th Avenue

163
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,423
Just

164
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,447
Dropped

165
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,471
42 block

166
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:24,287
Everything was 12 or 15 ft lower

167
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,591
Intervene that it opened Thunder Hat

168
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,359
Street

169
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:30,175
The crazy part was buildings were still intact down there

170
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,967
Cars were still perfect

171
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,735
C park

172
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:33,503
Are there meters

173
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,599
Men looked up from outside of bar it doesn't feet underground like

174
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,623
Stunned minors

175
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,927
I'm still hanging there

176
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:41,951
Over the street

177
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:45,279
Like a cruel caption over the cereal record

178
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,839
What's the theater Banner that read

179
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,119
Our town

180
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:56,799
The Quake did not genius radio station off the air but now the static on the transistor radio she was

181
00:11:57,055 --> 00:12:01,151
Suddenly gave way to music

182
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:07,039
An engineer started talking engineer at the radio unit in her car and cut in

183
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,855
She was surprised later when people told her she's

184
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,623
It sounded calm

185
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:17,535
It has become obvious that the earthquake that struck Anchorage less than an hour ago is a major one

186
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:23,679
We are to each and everyone of you to seek shelter check your emergency supplies

187
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:26,239
As much as possible so that you can retain the Heat

188
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,775
Check your neighbors

189
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,055
See if they have Transit

190
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:33,151
If they don't possibly they could move in with you and share one for the

191
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,455
It seems like it's going to be

192
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,991
A Long Cold Night For A

193
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,295
So prepare to batten down the hatches

194
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,111
And stay tuned to kemi

195
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:00,031
Think of what it means when we say

196
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,567
A person feel shaken

197
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,359
In Anchorage

198
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,383
This wasn't a metaphor

199
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,687
Those city of been thrown

200
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,503
It only been about an hour between the

201
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,783
The quake and Nightfall

202
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,063
With the power out

203
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,879
Snow falling through thick fog in the dark

204
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:18,975
There's no way for everyone to tell just how badly their world had been jumping

205
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,279
The feeling of vulnerability

206
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,071
Total dislocation

207
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,095
It's hard to describe

208
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,143
One guy put it

209
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:29,215
You don't know if anyone else is alive

210
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,519
Maybe you were the last man

211
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,359
Who is comforting to hear another voice

212
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,895
Start talking to you

213
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,455
Especially Genie chances

214
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:45,855
After making that first announcement on the air Genie drove back to the

215
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:46,623
The police station

216
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,927
Authorities realize that

217
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,975
With the radio unit in her car

218
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,791
She was the only voice they are able to address the entire C

219
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,607
I told her to keep talking

220
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:03,007
Senegal are broadcasting from inside the building and rounded phone calls to her as the lines reopened

221
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:07,359
Who's up to Genie to decide what information to relay to the public

222
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,431
The first it was mostly just her

223
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:15,039
1K United employee remembers that the newscaster has been on the air when the Quake struck

224
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:19,135
Hot Shot they just hired away from a big station in Los Angeles

225
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:22,719
I've been so wigged out that II is shaking stop

226
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:28,607
Get walked out of the building without a word he resurfaced a couple weeks later calling from back

227
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:29,631
California

228
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,423
Officially quit

229
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:37,823
Gene was shaking to the week later she's breakdown out of nowhere and weep all night but now

230
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:44,735
I kept trying to forget the unforgettable scenes eyewitness thousands of terrified people were huddled in there

231
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:45,759
Unheated shelter

232
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:49,087
Construction

233
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:53,439
So she started doing your job talking to people on the radio

234
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:59,327
Before long the rest of her colleagues and other stations in town we're back working the airwaves to the

235
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:03,167
So often felt like Genie was the one at the center of things

236
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:09,567
Directing things the turbine site needs diesel fuel should say or here's where I

237
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,103
Electricians report

238
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,639
Men

239
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:15,711
She started reading the personal messages

240
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:17,503
Pouring into

241
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:23,647
Mr. and mrs. Dick Fisher are still here at Police Headquarters waiting for any word of their children

242
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:26,975
Read a message from Northwest Airlines saying that the

243
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:30,047
Stewardess Beverly Jones

244
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:34,399
So many people were desperate to locate or reassure each other

245
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:40,799
Howard Forbes would like it to be known that he will be as Mike Whitmore

246
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:43,615
Shout across the fractured City

247
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:50,015
Kenneth Sadler mrs. Sadler is fine a message to Walter Hartley heart is fine

248
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:55,647
Meanwhile ham radio operators were relaying those messages to families in the lower 48

249
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:58,719
And when reporters around the country finally got through to Anchorage

250
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:03,071
It was often Jeannie still sitting in front of a radio microphone who took their call

251
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:07,167
No she assured them the city wasn't swallowed in flames

252
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,727
I know it wasn't under martial law

253
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,519
She talked to Omaha

254
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,287
New York

255
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:17,407
London one interview she did was rebroadcast in more than a hundred other places

256
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,175
The same day

257
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,503
Friday night if you come Saturday morning by then

258
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,551
On Saturday afternoon

259
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,087
Saturday night

260
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,391
For the first 30 hours

261
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:30,975
I talked constantly after 2 hours sleep

262
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:32,255
She was right back on the air

263
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:56,319
It's probably worth stopping for a second

264
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,855
Say this out loud

265
00:16:59,135 --> 00:16:59,903
Earthquakes

266
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:04,511
But I mean

267
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,303
In an existential way to

268
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:09,631
It must have been

269
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:12,447
Watching reality suddenly Buckle around you

270
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:14,495
Watching your city oven

271
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,775
Infallible right angles

272
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:16,799
End

273
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,615
Who is enough to change a person's worldview

274
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:23,711
More than 50 years later a former mayor of Anchorage

275
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:30,111
Even though I can look at this Solid Ground out the window and know that it's not permanent

276
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:32,159
You can change any time

277
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,439
It just moves

278
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,719
Everything

279
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,351
Understand

280
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,143
In 1964

281
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,959
Plate tectonics was still just a theory

282
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:51,359
It's hard for people to accept that the continents we stand on

283
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:52,895
We're actually in motion

284
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,967
They were just sliding around randomly

285
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:57,503
Violently colliding

286
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:58,783
Rock

287
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,319
Nothing is stable

288
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,111
But everything runs

289
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,647
Pure chance

290
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,463
That's what the stories about really

291
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,231
Champs

292
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,767
Maybe that's obvious

293
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,303
Steven the woman's last name

294
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,351
But

295
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,119
The question is

296
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,655
How are we supposed to live

297
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:17,471
On the surface of such unbearable random

298
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:20,543
What can we grab hold of

299
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:21,567
Fixed

300
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:26,943
I want to hear the old recordings of Jeannie on the radio that weekend

301
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,991
All the other voices working too

302
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,783
A picture of them as saw it up

303
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,575
Like wires

304
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,343
Crossing

305
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,367
City of Anchorage

306
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,647
State of Alaska

307
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:36,927
Further out

308
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,743
Crossing each other to like a net

309
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,535
Kind of alternate

310
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,303
Schumann

311
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,375
Snapping into place

312
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,911
For the built environment

313
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:47,935
Gateway

314
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:10,719
Episcopal Church

315
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:45,023
Time right now to evaluate

316
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:10,623
This one I'm very happy for not

317
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:17,535
Okay

318
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,703
Northern Hotel

319
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:30,335
Your family has been contacted and everything is okay

320
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:39,551
Headquarters

321
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:45,695
I really hadn't stopped to think how worried and concerned my parents must be I understand that

322
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:51,327
Kfar in Fairbanks is monitoring us and is relaying messages to the South 48th

323
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:57,727
I wonder if the person in Kfar would take down a message from me and get the word to my family

324
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,007
Right and Bonham

325
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,543
Second chance

326
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,335
Family is all right

327
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,895
The chance family is all right

328
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,479
Received

329
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:15,903
We have another message here to

330
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,192
Late on Saturday

331
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,472
The day after

332
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:05,568
Jeanne read a list of the missing and dead on the air

333
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,616
No one told her to do it

334
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:10,432
But there didn't seem to be anyone to ask for

335
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,200
Permission either

336
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:15,040
The next day was Easter Sunday

337
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:18,112
Ministers talked about death and Resurrection

338
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:22,720
The staff of the Anchorage Daily Times picked up all the pieces of movable type

339
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,512
Thrown all over there printing room

340
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,304
Managed to put on a noose

341
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:31,168
Do JCPenney Executives declared we will build again

342
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:33,472
Bigger and better than before

343
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:38,080
Eventually the Little Theatre resumed its production of our town too

344
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:44,224
What are the actors told me that after the Quake whenever a restaurant in Anchorage reopened or a church held a mass

345
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,528
There was never an empty seat she said

346
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:49,088
Everyone wanted to be with someone else

347
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,904
I never something especially poetic

348
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:55,232
About the sold-out crowd at the theater that first night

349
00:22:56,256 --> 00:23:01,376
Because that kind of togetherness is basically what Thornton Wilder's play is about

350
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:04,448
Play about daily life in a small town

351
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,984
The deaths and marriages

352
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,008
Tragedies

353
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:07,776
Spurts

354
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,312
And how I wonder all that

355
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:11,104
Flux their stability

356
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,152
Every community over time

357
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,688
In Anchorage

358
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:17,248
A city that worried it was temporary

359
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,528
Realized

360
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,064
It was temporary

361
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,392
At least all its buildings and houses in Rhodes

362
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:27,488
But it was discovering there was something permanent about itself to

363
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:34,656
All night at the theater the character of the stage manager talks to the audience directly narrating the story of the play

364
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:36,448
Kind of like I've been doing tonight

365
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:39,520
Now when the curtain rose on the Final Act

366
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,312
He came out for his monologue

367
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:46,944
Now there are some things we all know

368
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,736
But we don't take him out

369
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:54,112
And look at them very often we all know that something is eternal

370
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,696
And it ain't houses and it ain't names

371
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:04,096
Earth and it ain't even Stars everybody knows in their bones

372
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,888
Is that something is eternal

373
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:09,216
And that something has to do with human beings

374
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,080
All the greatest people ever lived been telling us that for 5000 years

375
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:14,848
And yet

376
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,432
You'd be surprised how people are always losing hold of it

377
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,040
Me and Jeannie chance stayed on duty

378
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,344
Kni for 59 hours

379
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:26,368
That weekend

380
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,672
When things finally calm down

381
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:30,976
She sat down to write a letter to a parent

382
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:37,120
They'd written to her right after the Quake pleading with Jeannie to send her three kids to live with them

383
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:39,424
Well that battered City up in Alaska

384
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,704
Figured out what's next

385
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:42,752
Think of the kids safety

386
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:46,336
Depart of Jeannie thought it was a good idea

387
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:49,152
She had another more convinced

388
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,456
We must be together

389
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:53,248
As long as we're together

390
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,272
We are confident of the

391
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,576
She explained to her.

392
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:00,160
That Good Friday night

393
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,976
I knew we had survived miraculously

394
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:07,072
And for this reason there must be a purpose to our lives

395
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:09,632
Apparently the children must sense this to

396
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,424
Remain calm

397
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:15,008
Steven fully aware of the emergency but if not

398
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,104
We are proud that they are such Dependable responsible young

399
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:22,944
I would not undermine their confidence in the future

400
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,784
In themselves by sending them away for their safety

401
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:29,344
What is DC anyway

402
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:33,184
How can you predict where or when tragedy will occur

403
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:36,512
You can only learn to live with it and make the best of it when it happens

404
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:39,328
These children are not afraid

405
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:42,144
Their father and I are not afraid

406
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:44,704
Please don't you fear for us

407
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,360
What is safety anyway

408
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:55,200
Virginia seemed to be conceding that there is only randomness

409
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,992
Only chance

410
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:59,296
And if everything Beyond this is chance

411
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:03,136
Maybe the only Force we have to survive a world like that

412
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,160
Disconnection

413
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:05,696
By then

414
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:07,744
It must have seemed so obvious to her

415
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,816

Between the beeps bongs and chatter of our devices

435

We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

436
00:27:57,824 --> 00:28:02,688
If I'm in room listening to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexis
