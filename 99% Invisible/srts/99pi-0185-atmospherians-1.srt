September 2015 Duke University's football team promoted its backup quarterback to starter

23
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:21,920
This was a little bit of a shake-up because the new starting quarterback was a total rookie stepping up to take

24
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:28,320
Take command of the team Dukes new quarterback may have been inexperienced but he sure did look the part

Who is exactly the kind of person you cast in a movie about a team trying to turn around

A public defender was making headlines for his work investigating how local law enforcement

32
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,104
I've been stacking the deck against defendants

In the West African country of Burkina Faso a group of armed soldiers in military fatigues

37
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:11,328
Forced their way into a cabinet meeting

38
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:13,632
And asserted their control over the government

In each of these cases the quarterback the attorney the coup

40
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:22,080
Newspaper articles about each of them describe them in exactly the same way

41
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:24,384
They were all written up as being

42
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:27,200
Straight out of Central Casting

43
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:29,504
Calling something or someone

44
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,784
From Central Casting

45
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,928
Is it kind of cultural shorthand for a stereotype or archetype something so visually perfect

46
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,976
That it's like it's been design

47
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:45,632
The first time Barack Obama flew in Air Force One he said to the pilot

48
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:50,496
If you do a new search for the phrase

49
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,288
Straight out of Central Casting

50
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:54,336

Business Executives politicians billionaire philanthropist

52
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:03,296
But every now and then you'll find an article that makes reference to a proper noun Central Casting

53
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,576
In Burbank

54
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:05,344
California

55
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,160
Morning

56
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,696
I'm going to Temple casting please

57
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,536
I've known the phrase straight out of Central casting for a long time

58
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,376
But I never really stopped to think about where it came from

59
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,144
And so

60
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,424
I was quite

61
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,472
Surprised to learn that Central Casting

62
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,496
Is a real place

63
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,544
I can know right

64
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,104
It's like learning the Acme is a real company

65
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,408
And they still make anvil

66
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,992
Give my taxi driver both longtime resident of Los Angeles

67
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,040
Even he didn't know Central Casting was real

68
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:41,440
Central Casting is in Burbank California in the San Fernando Valley and it's where the vast majority of extra

69
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,208
What's come from

70
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:45,792
Okay I am on South Flower Street

71
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:48,352
In Burbank California outside

72
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,144
Of the Central Casting building

73
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,704
It's a nondescript two-story office building

74
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,776
The kind of place you'd expect to find an orthodontist

75
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:58,080
And every Monday Wednesday and Friday

76
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,616
Starting in the very

77
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,152
Early early morning

78
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,432
People lineup

79
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,712
Outside Central Casting

80
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:07,808
When I got there at 8 on a Monday morning there were about 50 people in line

81
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:10,368
It would grow to about a hundred over the next hour

82
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:15,232
And at the very front was a woman that named Carissa Guerrero

83
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,000
In the morning

84
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,280
3:10 a.m.

85
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,815
So it's already been a long day

86
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,095
Yeah it has

87
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:23,679
The people in line at Central Casting aren't there for auditions

88
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:28,543
Carissa and everyone behind her in line are there for the chance to fill out some paperwork

89
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,567
Take a headshot

90
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:32,895
And get entered into Central Castings database for extra

91
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,199
They will not be harassed for speaking roles

92
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:37,503
No many if not all the people in mind

93
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,087
Are hoping that a director or producer will like their look

94
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,367
And give them some dialogue

95
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,695
Just like old John Wayne and Marilyn Monroe

96
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,975
And Brad Pitt got started

97
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:50,559
Blind Hollywood hopefuls stretches down the sidewalk

98
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:53,631
Some people have brought lawn chairs or blankets to sit on

99
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,911
And now look

100
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:59,007
They look like they're straight out of Central Casting

101
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:04,639
There's a handsome Texan in a suit and tie fresh-faced to the prospect of showbiz

102
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,919
Friends

103
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:06,943
Call me over

104
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:07,967

So he was like a you want to do some background work

Central Casting can go over there there's a female bodybuilder fitness competition so I'm trying to build myself as a brand

107
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,463
And that industry as well

108
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,743
A guy who calls himself

109
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,279
Kid Radioactive

110
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,047
I'm going to be

111
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,071
Famous

112
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:27,679
Even though it's already hot and most of the people here have been waiting for

113
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,471
345 hours

114
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,007
Be more cheerful

115
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,031
Optimistic

116
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:33,567
Men

117
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:37,151
Around 9:30 a guy emerges from inside Central Casting

118
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:41,247
He's heading up his laminated slips of paper they kind of look like oversized bookbar

119
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:44,575
These are the tickets in at 2 today is registration

120
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,343
In process

121
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,903
You'll make it halfway down the line when he runs

122
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,695
You didn't get one I'm sorry

123
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:53,791
No ma'am

Thank you

Come back on Wednesday

126
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:57,887
Wednesday morning

127
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:01,215
Maybe 5 in the morning

128
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,775
Central Castings bouncer is named Russell LeBlanc

129
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,847
I'm safety Specialist of passing out the cars this morning

130
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:11,199
Right so your people's either best friend or worst enemy in the morning cuz he has pretty much

131
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:17,599
One person protests and if you ask Russell about exceptions but most of the 60-odd people who didn't get to

132
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,159
Retreat to their cars wordlessly

133
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,183
Then

134
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,231
The door to Central Casting opens up

135
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:26,559
In a 50 or so left golden tickets in hand

136
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,351
Slowly violin

137
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:33,983
The first job that any aspiring film actor gets is usually as an extra

138
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,519
Known in the industry

139
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,543
As background Act

140
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,079
The other people

141
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,359
To really make

142
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:42,431
The film without your being aware that that fencing

143
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,711
That's Anthony slide

144
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:45,503
My name is Anthony slide

145
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,295
I am the author of

146
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,599
76 books I believe in

147
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:50,879
Count correctly

148
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,927
On the history of popular entertainment

149
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:57,023
And one of them is Hollywood unknowns a history of Hollywood extras

150
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,047
Standings

151
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,839
Bitplay isn't stunt people

152
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:03,423
Even though the industry has shifted to calling them background.

153
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,983
Anthony slide still calls the next

154
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:09,311
They will always cold extras in the early years

155
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,871
Theodore Dreiser the novelist called them

156
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,151
Spherion

157
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,431
Pictures of all the noise

158
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:18,271
If your director you need Atmos.

159
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:24,671
Because if you tried to shoot a film out in the world with regular people the risk you take is the people walking around the Sun

160
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:29,023
Aaliyah where they're being filmed and said there's something going to stop waving at the camera

161
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:33,375
A mugging or whatever plus you're going to have to shoot the same scene a bunch of the

162
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,143
Different times

163
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,727
It's what you need to be able to tell your actors background included

164
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,519
Where to go and what to do

165
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:42,079
You need people who are paid to listen to you

166
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,103
It's about control here

167
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,639
In the early days of Cinema

168
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:49,759
The Hollywood Machine had near complete control of extras both on the set and off

169
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:53,343
People would come from all over seeking fame and fortune

170
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,367
And it work

171
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,927
People converged on the gates of the movie lights

172
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,463
Hoping to get cash for the day

173
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,743
They were desperate

174
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,535
Many were exploited

175
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:05,631
So many horror stories were emanating from Hollywood

176
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,423
That by the 1920s

177
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,215
Hollywood headband nickname

178
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,007
The port of missing girls

179
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,543
The port of missing girls

180
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,823
It's a place where

181
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,103
Women flock

182
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,711
In the hope of getting into films

183
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:26,367
And they were all very vulnerable they will be lied about the men at the studios Batiste the casting directors

184
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,903
The assistant directors

185
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:32,767
Who would hide them in a lot of times these men would simply ask for sexual favors

186
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,679
Are in a movie for a dollar a day

187
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:43,263
Extras who did get hired were often not paid what they were promised

188
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,079
By 1925 the state of California was

189
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,871
Threatening to investigate Hollywood

190
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,407
If they didn't clean up their act

191
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,223
And so as a means of regulating industry

192
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,247
And keeping

193
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,271
The government off their back

194
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:58,367
The motion pictures Association of America the MPAA

195
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,135
Established

196
00:08:59,391 --> 00:08:59,903
Central Casting

197
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:06,047
A centralized Clearing House to match people who wanted to be extras with the people who wanted to hire them

198
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:06,815
Now

199
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:09,887
Instead of just picking one of the major movie studios and just

200
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,167
Standing around the gates

201
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,703
All day hoping to be picked

202
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:15,519
People who wanted to be extras could register with c

203
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,287
Central Casting

204
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,591
So now they could wait by their phone

205
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:21,407
Hoping for a call like

206
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,015
Strip club

207
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,343
Extras also called into Central Casting

208
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,671
The Operators developed

209
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:39,071
Super quick ways to relay information if there was no work they say Nook but they wanted the

210
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:42,399
Extras to try again later they say

211
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:48,287
But as Cinema took off and as silent films gave way to talkies the need for extras only grew

212
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,359
And Central Casting how to get more sophisticated and it's

213
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,895
Packing and recruitment of a

214
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:57,247
This is the team that's doing the registration today

215
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:59,039
Back in present-day Central Casting

216
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:02,623
Executive vice-president Jennifer Bender is showing me around

217
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:05,183
Then afterwards they'll come over

218
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:05,951
Here

219
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,231
And get their photos

220
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:07,999
Take it

221
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,279
This office is one of

222
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,047
3

223
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:12,351
Central Casting is now in Burbank New York

224
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:18,751
And New Orleans between all three offices we've got about 90,000 almost a hundred thousand

225
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,799
It's like there's a small City

226
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,591
Living inside their computer servers

227
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:28,991
An extremely diverse and infinitely indexable City

228
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:29,759
Nice to meet you

229
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,807
Jennifer introduces me to Brandy Hawk

230
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:34,879
I mean Brandy Hawkins and I believe casting director here

231
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,951
I kept stand-ins photo double dead bodies

232
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,231
Restaurant patrons

233
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:39,999
Circus acts

234
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,047
Everything everybody that's not

235
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:46,143
Brandy take me on a test drive of how the Central Casting database work

236
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:52,799
She opened up a window on their custom-built software which has just about every search parameter for a person you can imagine

237
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,079
Tight race

238
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:58,943
Shoe size bust size tattoos location of tattoos missing lens

239
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,735
How much nudity you'll do

240
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,783
Now she just needed a Target

241
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:06,623
You want to look for like your photos will my God yeah let's do that

242
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,439
This is what I would do

243
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,719
No please

244
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,743
Why would you like

245
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:15,071
35 range

246
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:19,935
And I would do Caucasian male like 66162

247
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,471
Good

248
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,007
Why would you like 6 to 6

249
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:23,775
3

250
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,591
I would do hair color

251
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,127
Why are brown

252
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:29,663
Coat

253
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,967
But 4042 some morning

254
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:37,343
I'm good at this and like 32 ways

255
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:43,999
I told him we would just do a search and one-by-one a stream of tall brown-haired 30-something white dudes

256
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,535
All scroll Buy

257
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,839
And then we just kind of scroll through

258
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:52,447
And see kind of who we think that life might come up that anywhere near

259
00:11:56,031 --> 00:12:00,383
I would submit him it was like you'd be like your long lost brother

260
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,687
Oh man that sounds

261
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:05,247
So unsettling it was a little unsettling

262
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:08,575
I just want to stand up and shout know I'm unique

263
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:12,927
I ask Brandy how she got comfortable talking so explicitly about what people look like

264
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:18,047
It was very difficult first because I came from a human resources background and there were so many things you couldn't

265
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,583
Dude like you couldn't

266
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,143
Hire people based off of their looks

267
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:27,007
Where is now that's what it's all about like they'll literally say I need African American male

268
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,311
6ft tall Etsy sizes

269
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:32,383
And you know like if you pray in a basketball team

270
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:38,783
It's going to look like a realistic basketball team if they're all these are nice looking guys were five foot four

271
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:44,671
And so to do this Central Casting and pretty much every casting agency that deals with background there are plenty of others

272
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,695
There callouts

273
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,975
Can be pretty blunt

274
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:52,351
Central Castings Facebook page is full of descriptions such as this is a real one quote

275
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:57,727
Looking for hip attractive men and women who appear to be Asian in their 20s

276
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,007
The trendy wardrobe

277
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,287
No visible tattoos

278
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,567
To an outsider

279
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,359
This language can really feel abrasive

280
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:08,223
It's clear that this line of work demands that you categorize and stereotype

281
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,783
Kristen Barona is a senior casting director at

282
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,551
Central Casting

283
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:15,647
And to get a feel for how she works I've asked her how she cast a couple different okay

284
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,183
Starting with a diaper

285
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,743
A dive bar I would probably do an older

286
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:26,143
Caucasian guy bartender kind of maybe on a little bit on the bikery side or little bit on the sketchy side

287
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,935
Because they're always at a dive bar

288
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:31,775
Did I would probably do a second bartender that would be like a tatted-up

289
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,799
Hypstar

290
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,591
And some women that have probably been

291
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,127
You know

292
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,919
Through it

293
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,455
Auto body shop

294
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:42,271
Auto Body Shop Auto Body workers

295
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,551
Mostly Hispanic

296
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,599
Alarm guys I would do definitely

297
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:48,671
Guidance for these kind of punch you with maybe a mustache

298
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:51,487
And then some younger guys that are

299
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:54,559
Kind of running around I would probably do a female on her

300
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:55,583
50s

301
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,119
That's the receptionist

302
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,935
I mean I picture myself in the place and what I would say

303
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:05,567
Background actors are supposed to look like they belong there

304
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:11,199
Show casting directors plate or expectations about how we think the real world looks

305
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,991
And sometimes in doing so

306
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,783
Banda perpetuating

307
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:15,551
Applications

308
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:20,927
Casting directors are trying to strike a balance between authenticity and expectation

309
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:26,047
They're constantly looking at the real world and wondering if it matches the way they would cast it

310
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:29,119
Here Central Casting Executive Vice President Jennifer bendery

311
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:33,471
The other week I was in New York and I was walking down the street and there

312
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,775
This is just so silly

313
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:36,799
There were

314
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:37,823
Warm blonde

315
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,591
Justin Burnett

316
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:39,615
And

317
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,407
What's very stereotypical

318
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,687
Forecasting a New York City

319
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,223
Street Scene is they don't want any play

320
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:45,503
Because

321
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,527
People think of New York

322
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,087
Thoughts to myself

323
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,135
If I would have cast the steam

324
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:54,463
3 New York Street Scene I would be fired because this

325
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,487
It doesn't even look

326
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,791
Like it should be really here

327
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,399
Back in the registration room the people who were waiting outside all morning

328
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,447
Set of chairs facing a PowerPoint presentation

329
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:06,239
Central Casting employees

330
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:16,223
Out there for quite a bit the Central Casting orientation it's pretty much like any new employee orientation

331
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,039
What is the I-9 form

332
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:25,183
Dope every now and then there are some forms to fill out that you would not find

333
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:25,951
Find at most

334
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:28,255
On to level of nudity

335
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,071
Everyone is alive

336
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:31,839
Wednesday

337
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,959
Everything apart

338
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,495
No is

339
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,287
Swimsuits for women

340
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,311
Impartial

341
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,079
Would be

342
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,479
There are boxes to check

343
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:51,295
Tattoos Piercings missing body parts

344
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,575
If you can dress in Drag

345
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,855
You can dress like a clown

346
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:57,183
Can juggle there's also information about how the payment system works

347
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:00,255
In a session on identifying the signs of heat exhaustion

348
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:02,559
And who to talk to you if you're feeling a little on Sat

349
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:06,143
After about an hour of document signing everyone gets ahead

350
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,751
And that's it

351
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:13,055
They are released back into the world

352
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,079
Where they will wait

353
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:14,847
Rural

354
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,919
There's a cynicism that one could take here

355
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:20,479
But Central Casting is about turning humans

356
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,503
In two objects

357
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:24,319
It is one of the only if not the only job

358
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:27,135
Where you are hired solely for what you look like

359
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,671
On the other hand though

360
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,975
One can argue that this is progress

361
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:31,999
Cheer

362
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,535
Everyone will be seen

363
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,071
The young the old

364

This is a path way into Showbiz thats

368
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,031
Not about nepotism

369
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,055

Bongs and Charter of our devices

406
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:06,623
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

407
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:07,647
If

408
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:14,047

00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,935
Technology talk to us

411
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,983
It is a creation of Sonic trash

00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,143
Makes for a much more natural experience

422
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,191

00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,448
That whines through a

445
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,240
Treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

448
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:38,688
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

449
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:43,040
Or lose a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

450
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:47,392
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like a dad

451
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:54,048
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff actually if I'm being honest

452
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:57,376
I'm one of the main guy to know how to do that kind of thing

453
00:21:57,632 --> 00:22:03,776
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

454
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:07,104
Was found dead in my private gym

Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

456
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:14,784
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

457
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,808
Now

458
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:18,112
I need to clear my name

459
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:23,488
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes

460
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,512
