This is 99% invisible

23
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:08,864
I'm Roman Mars

24
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:14,752
Imagine for a moment the year 1800

25
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:17,056
The doctor is meeting the patient

26
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:19,104
Most likely in the patient's home

27
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:22,176
The patient is complaining about shortness of breath

28
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:23,968
Fever

29
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,784
The doctor listens to the patients complaints

30
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,832
Asks a ton of questions

31
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,112
Scribble some notes

32
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,648
Producer Emmett Fitzgerald

33
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:34,976
And the doctor might check the patient's pulse

34
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:39,072
But unlike today what's happening inside of the

35
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:39,840
Patient is

36
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:41,376
Basically unknowable

37
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,448
There's no MRI no x-rays

38
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,776
The living body is like a black box

39
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,312
It can't be open

40
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,896
The only way for a doctor to figure out what's wrong with a patient

41
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:53,664
Is to ask

42
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:57,760
You needed the patient to tell you what was wrong and what they were suffering

43
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,040
So doctors were

44
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:05,440
Very interested in the patient's history the story of what the symptom was how long it had been there how had it change

45
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:07,232
What made it better what made it worse

46
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:09,024
This is dr. Jacqueline Duffy

47
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:11,072
I am a hematologist

48
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:17,728
And a historian of medicine at Queen's University

49
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,776
Was all the doctor had to go on

50
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:23,616
The symptoms were often seen as in themselves

51
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:26,432
So for example today if you have a fever

52
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,224
You think of it as a symptom

53
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,272
Of some underlying disease

54
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,296
It's like the flu

55
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:34,112
But back at the turn of the 19th century

56
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,136
The fever is

57
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:37,184
Self was considered the disease

58
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,232
They're all different kinds of fevers

59
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:42,560
And fever itself was a broad category of diagnosis

60
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:45,376
Because doctors had no way of connecting symptoms

61
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:48,448
With what was actually going on inside the body

62
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:53,056
Until someone built a device that would help the doctor

63
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,592
Open the black box

64
00:02:54,848 --> 00:03:00,992
And travel inside the human body

65
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:07,392
And suddenly the doctor could hear everything so much more clearly the heart

66
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:12,512
Salons the brat and everything

67
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:20,448
The inventor of the stethoscope was unsurprisingly a doctor

68
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:26,080
Rene laennec was born in Brittany in 1781

69
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,128
And she went to medical school in Paris

70
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,432
Where you learn to practice percussion

71
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:35,552
A technique in which the doctor Taps their fingers against a patient's chest

72
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,600
And listen to the sound

73
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,392
To determine things like if

74
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,696
Fluid is building up in the patient's lungs

75
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:48,096
Lennox uses the technique for years and in 1816 he's examining a patient and he produces her

76
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:48,864
Torso

77
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,240
She's a little bit plump and because she's plump he's not getting much sound back from for cussing

78
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,288
He thought about putting his ear right against the

79
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:59,616
The patient's breast but he decided that that would be inappropriate

80
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,152
So we took a notebook

81
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:07,552
That he had with them and he bolted up into a little cylinder and he put one end on the patient's chest and went in on his ear

82
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,088
Angie tells us

83
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:14,208
He was clearly he could hear her and her breath sounds

84
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:20,095
Satisfied to hear the beating of the heart in a manner that was clearer and more distinct than I had ever heard

85
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,375
Idirect application

86
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,143
The ear

87
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:27,519
She was so impressed by the quality of the sound that he said about trying to construct the

88
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,543
The perfect device

89
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,847
For listening to the internal sounds

90
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:31,615
The body

91
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,895
All based on that

92
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,175
Same cylinder

93
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:39,295
People said that he became a silandro maniac has cylinder Maniac because he

94
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,319
He was convinced

95
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,855
That the instrument

96
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,879
Mediating

97
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:43,903
Between

98
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,439
The two bodies of

99
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:48,255
The patient and the doctor improved but the doctor

100
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,303
Can use the lathe

101
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,351
Car cylinders out of wood

102
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,399
And at first he wanted to

103
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,679
Call his new device

104
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,703
The cylinder

105
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,263
But eventually he settled on the steps

106
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:00,543
Which means

107
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,079
To explore the chest

108
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:05,407
Line-X original stethoscope looks

109
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:07,455
Pretty different from the ones were used to

110
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:12,319
Do today it's a long tube-like cylinder it looks like a small handheld telescope

111
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,343
Line-X

112
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:18,207
Started using his new invention to listen to the heart sounds and the breathing sound

113
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,487
Sense of all of the patient

114
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:20,511
Summit Hospital

115
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:24,351
And he started to invent words to describe the sounds cuz nobody

116
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,143
Nobody had heard the sound before it

117
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:29,727
Lenoch and invented a way to hear the inner workings of the human body

118
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,031
But that wasn't enough by itself

119
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:35,103
He wanted to connect the sounds he was hearing in his patient

120
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:38,687
With what was actually happening anatomically inside their body

121
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:44,063
And how do you connect sounds to what's actually happening inside a body

122
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,855
You listen to people

123
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:52,255
Right before they died around the ward listening to all the patients documenting their

124
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:58,655
Listen to The Sounds they made and then connecting them to the discoveries he would make up their autopsy when they died

125
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:05,055
He thought that every abnormal sound heard with a stethoscope should correspond

126
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:11,455
Comical finding during autopsy found it equals

127
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:17,855
. anatomical finding later so that the stethoscope was a way of practicing the autopsy before the patient

128
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:24,255
I mean we're all this future cadaver is right but the stethoscope gave us a way of looking inside

129
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:29,631
Side of a body before it was dead to see what was causing a particular medical problem

130
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:35,519
In a relatively short period of time my neck made some discoveries using his stethoscope

131
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:39,615
For example he figured out that when a person has fluid beneath their lungs

132
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:42,175
They make a sound kind of like a goat

133
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,783
A sound he called egophony

134
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,599
He also discovered sounds that attract

135
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,647
With the different stages of tuberculosis

136
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,951
The number one killer in Europe

137
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:54,719
Set the time

138
00:06:55,231 --> 00:07:01,119
Mainak publishes results linking different diagnosis with anatomical changes in the body that could be detected

139
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,655
Using his new stethoscope

140
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:03,935
Eye doctors

141
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:09,311
Who were his colleagues loved it did they felt that every disease would eventually

142
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:12,127
Be attached to an anatomical finding in and out of time

143
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:12,895
Chemical change

144
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:15,967
Some doctors began using Line-X new device themselves

145
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:17,503
Even put a diagram

146
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,319
I bet in his book so you could make your own quite easily

147
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,111
For you by any

148
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:22,879
Carpenter

149
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:25,183
And as these doctors use the stethoscope

150
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,999
To make more important discoveries about the body

151
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,815
New categories of disease were created

152
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:33,119
For example before the stethoscope

153
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,655
A lot of different ailments

154
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,679
Since we're all lumped

155
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,703
Into one disease

156
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,727
Call dibs

157
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:38,751
Which means

158
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:39,519
Shortness

159
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,287
Breath

160
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,823
But after Line-X

161
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,103
Shortness of breath

162
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,151
A various

163
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,431
Heart or lung problem

164
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,711
They could be diagnosed

165
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:48,735
Sing the stethoscope

166
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:51,295
Medical language completely changed

167
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:53,855
His doctors invented new anatomical words

168
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:54,623
Diseases

169
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:55,647
Bronchitis

170
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,207
Which means the inflammation of the bronchioles

171
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:00,767
The Airways that lead to the lungs

172
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:04,863
Little by little our entire understanding of disease shift

173
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,167
Became more objective

174
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,727
Diseases went from being constellations

175
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,751
Symptoms felt

176
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,543
Patience

177
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,311
2

178
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:18,431
Anatomical or chemical alterations inside the body detected by the doctor

179
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:22,271
This shift in how people thought about disease

180
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:25,343
Change the relationships between doctors and patients

181
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,367
With the doctors

182
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,415
Suddenly having a lot more power

183
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,463
Show before the stethoscope

184
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,255
Feel sick

185
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,095
The doctor had to find

186
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:40,703
But didn't matter what the patient

187
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:46,079
Line-X himself actually worried that many doctors were taking his ideas too far

188
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:52,479
He believed that listening to what patients had to say was still important to understanding disease

189
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:56,831
But the Quest for objective information about disease was underway

190
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,367
In the stethoscope

191
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,647
Was just the beginning

192
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,671
Then we got x-rays

193
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:07,071
Which do the same thing at the end of the 19th century and now we have CT scanners and MRIs and pet scans and all of these

194
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:13,471
Marvelous devices are basically trading upon the same Paradigm that the stethoscope brought along that we should be

195
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:18,847
Able somehow to image the pathological anatomical abnormalities inside the body

196
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,383
To reach the diagnosis

197
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:23,455
When is a patient has any symptoms at all or not

198
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:31,391
These new technologies have led to so many important discoveries about the human body and disease

199
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,671
Today we can

200
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,695
Spot tumors

201
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,231
Before they become life threatening

202
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:38,559
And diagnose problems like high blood pressure

203
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,095
Before it causes heart disease

204
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:44,959
But there are also patients today who struggle because they've got

205
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:45,983
Tons of symptoms

206
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:49,823
But the doctor can't find anything quote on quote wrong with

207
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:54,175
The Paradigm Shift brought on by the stethoscope has

208
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,735
Push doctors and patients further apart

209
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:00,319
The doctor is no longer visiting you in your bedroom

210
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,343
Interviewing

211
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,903
And you about every tiny detail of your

212
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:04,671
Experience

213
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:09,535
And sometimes patients end up feeling like just the collection of data point

214
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,071
Rather than a whole

215
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,031
Rene laennec died in 1826

216
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,311
Beta 45

217
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,103
Most likely from tuberculosis

218
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,151
Disease he and his stethoscope

219
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,431
Help us understand

220
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:30,783
It's been 200 years since he first rolled up his notebook and pressed

221
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,319
To that patient's chest

222
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:35,647
Medicine looks completely different than it did back

223
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,183
But somehow

224
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,463
The stethoscope

225
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,487
Has endured

226
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:42,559
There are certain tools of the trade that we have

227
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,327
Gotten rid of

228
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,351
So

229
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,655
You don't really see doctors carrying around this

230
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,679
Is big black bag

231
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,471
This is dr. Andrew Bomba

232
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,007
Is a nephrologist

233
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,031
A kidney doctor

234
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:54,079
And an assistant professor at the

235
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,103
Columbia University

236
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,895
College of Physicians and

237
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:02,783
Most doctors nowadays don't carry around reflex hammers unless their new neurologist

238
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,319
Most doctors

239
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,879
Don't wear that light on their head

240
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,671
But the stethoscope has

241
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:11,231
Never really falling out of practice

242
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:14,303
Of course doctors aren't walking around with wooden cylinders anymore

243
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:18,143
In the 1840s they began experimenting with flexible tubing

244
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,239
And soon after an Irish physician invented the binaural stethoscope design

245
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,543
With two earpieces that we still use

246
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,311
Today

247
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,871
There are a few kinds of specialized stethoscopes

248
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,407
Particular types of listening

249
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,687
And more recently

250
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,735
Companies have developed electronic stethoscope

251
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:35,551
With enhanced sound quality and the ability

252
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,319
Need to record

253
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:39,647
But to this day when you walk into a doctor's office

254
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,183
Is for a routine exam

255
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,207
You can expect

256
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,999
The field familiar stethoscope

257
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,535
Sliding along your back

258
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:46,559
But that

259
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,583
Could be changing

260
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:53,983
Almost 200 years that trustee stethoscope has been at the Forefront of the diagnostic procedure

261
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:57,823
CJ constantly hanging around the necks of doctors and often used

262
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,407
New technology is threatening to Exile this old friend

263
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,455
To The Archives of medical history

264
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:10,111
X-rays and ultrasound have given doctors at Clear Window into the body than ever before

265
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,927
And with new portable ultrasound machines

266
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:16,255
Doctors can see an image of a hole in a patient's heart

267
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,535
Right from the bedside

268
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:23,679
The rise of portable ultrasound has some doctors arguing that we don't need the stethoscope

269
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,215
They say that

270
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,263
If you have that technology why not

271
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,287
Use it right away

272
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:31,103
But ultrasound isn't available

273
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,127
In many developing

274
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,687
And even in the United States

275
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,455
It's

276
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,223
Expensive

277
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:40,575
Tell me if we eliminated the stethoscope and everybody got an ultrasound at every visit

278
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,623
We would bankrupt our Healthcare System

279
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,927
This is dr. Dan Burns

280
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,975
A cardiologist at Stanford

281
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:47,743
University

282
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:52,095
He says that when he hears something problematic during the stethoscope exam

283
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:54,143
He immediately orders in Ultra

284
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,191
But do I start

285
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:59,007
With every patient who comes in the emergency room

286
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,823
Taking out the ultrasound machine looking in the lungs

287
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,615
I think that's not a good

288
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,383
Sabbatical

289
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:08,735
Right now he says the stethoscope functions as a screening tool

290
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:12,831
So that patients don't need to go get an expensive ultrasound unless they need one

291
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:16,671
Still there's no denying that advanced imaging has

292
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,439
Change the

293
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,463
Instruments roll

294
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:23,327
Dr. Andrew bomback says that medical students today aren't as good list

295
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,607
The body as they want

296
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:28,703
And across-the-board doctors rely Less on the steps

297
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:29,983
How to make a diagnosis

298
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:33,055
It's become almost a ritual more then

299
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,591
A actual

300
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,871
Tool of the trade

301
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,919
In terms of helping us make diagnosis

302
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:46,111
Recently one of doctor bombax most

303
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,135
Respected colleague

304
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,671
Please ask to borrow a stethoscope

305
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,439
End

306
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,975
Bombeck was embarrassed

307
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:54,047
Because the only one he had within that day was this

308
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,839
Cheap plastic disposable

309
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,655
But he handed it over anyway

310
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:03,519
And he said he thinks that's perfect he was walking away he's like no patience

311
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,799
Expect you to have this

312
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,591
When you see that I'm not going to really

313
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,359
Need to use

314
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:11,199
And I thought that was such a funny story because

315
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:14,527
There's someone that I consider the consummate clinician

316
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:15,551
And

317
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,343
He was acknowledging that

318
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,111
The stethoscope

319
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,671
Was in many ways just sort of a prop

320
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:23,487
But it's an omnipresent prop

321
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,279
If you do a Google image search

322
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,047
4dr

323
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:29,887
Right away you'll notice a couple of things about what a physician is

324
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:30,911
Supposed to look like

325
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:35,519
Most of the doctors pictures on the first page of results are white men in white coats

326
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:38,335
Some of them are appearing inside a patient's ears

327
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:40,127
Others are writing something down

328
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:40,895
My clipboard

329
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:41,919
But all of them

330
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:43,711
Stethoscope

331
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:47,039
But what I find so intriguing about the Google Images search

332
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:47,807
Is 4dr

333
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,855
Is knowledge every doctor wearing a

334
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:50,623
Stethoscope

335
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:55,487
But they are almost all wearing the stethoscope in the exact same way

336
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,023
Which is

337
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,047
Like a shawl

338
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,327
Around the back of the neck

339
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,399
With the earpieces on one side and the Bell on the other

340
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:05,215
Baumbach says that this way of wearing a stethoscope

341
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,007
Draped over the shoulders

342
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,543
Is a relatively recent

343
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,311
Fashion trend

344
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,615
The first time I can remember ever seeing that

345
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,919
Was on the television show ER

346
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,479
And then on Scrubs

347
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,783
Which is another very popular medical TV show

348
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,599
Doctors used to wear their stethoscopes

349
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:24,415
Dangling down the front of the shirt like a tie

350
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:25,951
And this was

351
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:30,047
If you needed to use your stethoscope in a hurry you just

352
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,071
Pop the interior

353
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:37,727
It's almost like this new version of wearing it like a scarf or shawl is almost a concession that is more fattening

354
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,495
Accessory

355
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,543
Then actually a tool that were using

356
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:45,663
But even if the stethoscope exam has become something of a ritual

357
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:48,479
It doesn't mean that doctors are ready to give it up

358
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,783
And I would never give up my son

359
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,063
Because

360
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,855
I think in the very least

361
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,391
It's this conduit

362
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,671
2 connecting with the patient

363
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,463
Bombeck says babe

364
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:01,791
Physical contact between a doctor and a patient

365
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,839
Has become increasingly rare

366
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,887
Doctor's visits are short

367
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:08,959
And Physicians often spend half the time staring at a

368
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:09,727
Computer screen

369
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,519
The status quo

370
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,823
Provides an important opportunity

371
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,591
For intimacy

372
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,639
The stethoscope is still

373
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:23,295
A part of the exam that is still very much aligned with that idea of the laying on of hands that A Healer can do when we go to the physical

374
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:27,903
Omar desk we move away from the computer we stand right next to the patient

375
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:30,207
And it's a much more intimate conversation

376
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:32,767
And even with all these powerful

377
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:35,839
Tools for measuring what's going on inside a body

378
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,655
Intimate conversations are still really in

379
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,679
Important in medicine

380
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:42,239
Dr. bomback says he thinks that the

381
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,543
The stethoscope has come to symbolize

382
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,847
At the doctor is there too

383
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,639
And

384
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:55,039
Whether we're actually listening to their heart or their lungs is probably not that important but but they really want to know is that we're listening

385
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,063
Into what they say

386
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,391
200 years ago

387
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:02,463
Renee Line-X invention ushered in a new medical era

388
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:05,791
One with the patient's own understanding of their disease

389
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:09,119
Gateway to more objective observation of the body

390
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,935
This turn put a certain amount of distance

391
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,471
Doctor's patient

392
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:20,127
Today maybe the stethoscope lives on to keep Physicians and patients from drifting too far apart

393
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,687
Make sure doctors keep close to their page

394
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,223
And he pussy

395
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:42,399

00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:48,543
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices were immersed

398
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,103
Cluttered world of man-made sound

399
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:56,735
If I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexa

400
00:17:56,991 --> 00:18:02,111
Is talking to me and my wife is in another room

401
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:04,415
Voice technology talk to us

402
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,719
It is a creation of Sonic trash

403
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,535
That's Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

404
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:13,119
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

405
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,167
To make them more human

406
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:19,263

It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

412
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,623
Makes for a much more natural experience

413
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,671
Turn the living room lights on

414
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:40,255
Dim the living room lights to 50

415
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,023
