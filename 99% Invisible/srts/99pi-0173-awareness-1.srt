This is 99% invisible

22
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:08,864
I'm Roman Mars

23
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,240
By the late 1980s

24
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:17,056
AIDS have been in the US for almost a decade

25
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:19,616
We look through timeline from this.

26
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:23,200
You see the records of 100 people that a thousand

27
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:25,760
People that a million people that

28
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:30,368
AIDS becomes the number one killer of young men in New York City

29
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,416
Then of young men in the country

30
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:34,976
Then of young men and women in the country

31
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:39,584
So what you don't see much of in the late 80s is public acknowledgement of AIDS

32
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,888
Beth reporter Audrey Quinn

33
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:45,472
Millions of people were dying of this mysterious new disease

34
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:48,032
But there was so much stigma against talking about

35
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:51,872
You kind of felt like you were living in a war zone and there was no reported

36
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:55,200
It was a Bizarro world

37
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:58,272
He was really involved with the Manhattan arts in the late 80s

38
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:01,856
Community where can be hard to think about anything but gave Christ

39
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,160
We would spend days

40
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:07,488
Going to St Vincent's to visit someone

41
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:10,048
Going to readings for a funeral and then getting

42
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:14,144
On your answering machine message of somebody flipping out because

43
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,424
It just been told

44
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,800
To Patrick and a group of other artists

45
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,592
Turn their focus to AIDS

46
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,920
Yeah why why were you making art and response

47
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:36,928
In 1988 O'Connell and his collaborators begin calling their Collective

48
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,208
Visual aids

49
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:40,512
They held public events to raise awareness

50
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:41,792
There was slideshows

51
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:42,816
Gallery shows

52
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:45,888
But of all the work they did the thing that had the biggest effect

53
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,424
With a simple little symbol

54
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:50,240
That at the time was a novel concept

55
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,288
The AIDS awareness ribbon

56
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:56,384
It all started one night in the spring of 1991

57
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,176
The visual aids artist caucus

58
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,224
Hilton meeting in search of a symbol

59
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:03,552
They wanted something that could be created that

60
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,320
Could

61
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:06,624
Be put out there for people to wear

62
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,952
That's a couple he's a costume designer and was at that meeting

63
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,768
He's now director of costumes for the New York City Ballet

64
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:17,120
That's a lot of driving around upstate New York

65
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:23,776
This was at the time of the Persian Gulf War we started to see a course at the time yellow ribbons or

66
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,312
Tied around trees which is

67
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:29,408
You know in reference to that song for servicemen

68
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:40,160
It's been so long

69
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,744
You know we just were like

70
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:45,536
You know

71
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:48,096
Why can't we do something like that

72
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,376
4

73
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,144
8

74
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:55,264
And we talked about it you know what it really be around a tree and that just seemed a little like

75
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,056
I don't know not right

76
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,592
Then it became like

77
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,360
Oh

78
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:03,968
Maybe not around the tree but maybe folded

79
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,504
With a pin on your lapel

80
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,296
Then it was time to pick a color

81
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:13,184
In the meaning it also came about that it was like yes it should be red because it represents blood

82
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,232
It was just so obviously right

83
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:21,119
The local ribbon supplier donated spools of half inch wide red grosgrain ribbon

84
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:25,471
Greens that ribs ribbon you might have worn around your ponytail growing up

85
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:32,127
And we started just in these meetings like folding them and doing different things with them and force it just

86
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:34,175
Started out just like folding it in half

87
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,711
But then it came

88
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:38,271
To actually folding it in that

89
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,319
Way we now know it so well

90
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,343
With a safety pin

91
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,367
The loop

92
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,647
Inverted V shape

93
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,183
They're on the streets of the

94
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:45,951
City

95
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,719
Within

96
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:47,743
10 weeks

97
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,767
Search something with them

98
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,303
Patrick O'Connell again

99
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,607
By this time he was director of visual aid

100
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,679
And at this point the red ribbons were essentially in art

101
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,031
The visual aids artist caucus members help but they called ribbon.

102
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,823
Think like a quilting bee

103
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,359
Bunch of people gather to work

104
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,151
Hand-cut

105
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,687
Fold and pin

106
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,711
Thousand

107
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:09,503
I'll just a hand out for free

108
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,551
In mid-may

109
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,391
I had this very foolish idea that we should be

110
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,671
Telhio

111
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,743
Which left us

112
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:22,303
Approximately two weeks

113
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,327
Apache

114
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,911
Condense everybody

115
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,703
Not going to be disrupted by

116
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,239
Something they should embrace

117
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:33,311
A number of visual aids members had Broadway connection

118
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:36,127
Beihai gold with the organizers of the Tony Awards

119
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:36,895
And Coke

120
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:40,991
Celebrity dressers into pinning the ribbons on their clients

121
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:43,807
Before the ceremony

122
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:48,415
Mark Hoppus Studio was mad it was stabbed

123
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,207
We were Distributing the more

124
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,999
Typically size 2

125
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,535
Ribbon tweeter

126
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,607
We're going to ruin everybody's dressing and dinner jacket

127
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,911
So let's make them big and stupid

128
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:01,215
Set pack for the presenters

129
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:05,311
Status of the camera could like really capture

130
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,871
The night of the show came

131
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:08,895
June 7th

132
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,175
1991

133
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:16,575
The night we all kind of went home and everybody was crossing their fingers because we didn't know they didn't know if anyone would actually wear

134
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,855
Are the ribbons I mean

135
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:22,975
We we handed all the stuff out and all these word of Supervisors and only stretches on you

136
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:23,999
They said

137
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:27,839
Sure we'll see what we can do can't promise much but will try

138
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,631
Live

139
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:36,031
From the minskoff theatre on Broadway

140
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:42,431
Tony Award winner

141
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:49,087
Jeremy Irons walked out with a red ribbon on his lapel

142
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:53,695
I mean I'm emotional now because he was like

143
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,023
You know it worked

144
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:59,071
I found the full show on YouTube

145
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:05,215
Jeremy Irons is so handsome the slicked-back hair and a big red ribbon on the left lapel of his black tux

146
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:09,823
The first winner of the knights this little girl the basic vegan star of The Secret Garden

147
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,615
I don't think I can talk

148
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:16,479
She's got this poofy sleeve black and white dress on

149
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,527
And a little red ribbon on your chest

150
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,319
Thank you

151
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,647
Then there's Kevin Spacey

152
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:24,927
Lost in Yonkers

153
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:29,535
Because up to accept his award with the more medium sized red dripping

154
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,559
Thank you very much

155
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:34,143
Next DC Penn and Teller wearing big red ribbon

156
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:38,495
By the end of the show I was paying more attention to the presenters not wearing ribbons

157
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:41,055
Totally judging them for missing the memo

158
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:47,455
What you also notice watching the Tonys is how new the awareness ribbon was

159
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,735
Everyone was wearing them

160
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,759
In different ways

161
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,783
Somewhere loot

162
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:51,807
Summer folded

163
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:52,831
Sharp angles

164
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:56,415
Some of the ribbons have their ends spread wide like wings

165
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,695
But here's the

166
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,463
Crucial thing

167
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,255
Doing

168
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:02,047
Explain the ribbons on air

169
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,583
Rumor has it the network

170
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,143
Threaten to go to commercial break if they did

171
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:10,751
Turns out this degree of mystery provided some incredibly good press

172
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:16,127
The one thing that was kind of exciting as the next day there was a little blurb in the newspaper that was like

173
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,943
What was that red ribbon and it was every

174
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:22,527
There was two days of print media

175
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:25,599
Wondering what is Red Ribbon

176
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:26,879
So

177
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,927
You know that really

178
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:31,231
I think for us and for

179
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,279
The Red Ribbon at cell

180
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,815
Was just the point where at

181
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:35,839
Exploded

182
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:38,655
Within days the ribbon with stopping traffic

183
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,935
We ran into this

184
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:44,287
Seemingly very successful businessman and his wife on the street

185
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:45,823
And

186
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:50,687
He saw his wearing everybody and he was like I saw that

187
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:55,807
Isn't it isn't it that's about AIDS cuz no one actually said it

188
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,879
I suppose yes

189
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:02,207
How did you get what I said well actually made them it's our project

190
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:06,815
I filled up a hundred-dollar bill and gave it to us

191
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,119
When they found out what

192
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:13,983
Was for I think a lot of people really got on board and just for like

193
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,519
I need start wearing red river

194
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:20,895
And it just really pushed it over into being kind of almost

195
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:21,663
Piano

196
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,991
Just a much bigger symbol than I've ever had been

197
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,271
And I think that we ever

198
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,295
Really thought it might

199
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,319
Be so quick

200
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,623
The next step for the ribbon was the Emmys

201
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:33,183
Then the Oscars and the Grammy Awards

202
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:36,767
And the members of visual aids continue to gather to make them

203
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,303
Cut

204
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:41,631
We will be watching on TV

205
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,703
Famous people where are they

206
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:49,055
While we sat in the Loft making ribbons together

207
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,615
Very meta that say now say

208
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,407
No David said it would have

209
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,431
Danberry Pomo

210
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:58,015
School groups in church group started contacting visual aids artist

211
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:00,575
Ask me how they could start their own Moon project

212
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,111
Patent.

213
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,159
Wechat

214
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,439
Becomes this phenomenon

215
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,487
Which we were

216
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:08,511
Surprised by

217
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,303
When did it start

218
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,607
Ribbon with out of your hair

219
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,983
Well probably by 90

220
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,519
The end of 92

221
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,055
In terms of

222
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,103
The introduction of Vicodin

223
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:26,943
Bejeweled leatherback

224
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:29,503
Crystal pave red ribbon

225
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:33,087
Etc they were Red Ribbon diamond necklaces

226
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,623
Red Ribbon Christmas ornaments

227
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,903
Red Ribbon t-shirt

228
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,463
There were some of us thought that visual aids should

229
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,231
Trade market

230
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:39,999
And

231
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:43,583
So that any time it's used the money had to come back to fish late

232
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,375
It's one of the reasons we didn't was that

233
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,911
I would not have been embraced

234
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:48,703
So willingly

235
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,239
Kentucky University

236
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,287
If we had if everyone had to come

237
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,335
And say may I have permission to do the

238
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,895
It would have been contrasted

239
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:57,663
Spirit of the Earth

240
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,223
Oh yeah I haven't

241
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:05,855
Tie waist visual aids have a nickel for every ribbon settled in the world or Ribbon object

242
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:07,903
Adapt after

243
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,951
The ribbons graders

244
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:12,511
A backlash from other AIDS activist

245
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:16,351
A person just wearing the ribbon felt like a radical a

246
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:19,167
Publicly acknowledging that aids existed

247
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,703
The people were suffering

248
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:21,727
That you cared

249
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,543
What is the ribbon became more ubiquitous

250
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,591
Some activists called wearing it

251
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,871
An easy out

252
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,663
A way to look like you cared

253
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:33,247
About people with AIDS without actually doing anything to help people with AIDS

254
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,575
Basically the same criticisms that net the Livestrong bracelet

255
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,367
And the ice bucket challenge

256
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,927
Couple says that's okay

257
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:44,255
What we wanted to do was create something that

258
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,303
A mother in Michigan

259
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:49,119
Cookware on the lapel of her blouse

260
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:54,495
And you know maybe her son was living in New York and living with AIDS and she

261
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,031
Wanted to do something

262
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,823
I think it was just

263
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:01,151
Who is also a symbol that we created the

264
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,943
Somebody could wear

265
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,759
And somebody might go up to them and say

266
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:06,527
What is that

267
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:10,111
Why are you wearing that red ribbon and hopefully that person would say

268
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:10,879
Here's why

269
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,439
The ribbon was doing its job

270
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:15,487
People were talking about AIDS

271
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:19,071
The New York Times declared 1992 the year of the ribbon

272
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:22,911
President Clinton set up the White House Office of national AIDS policy

273
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,983
The National Institute of Health expanded its AIDS research

274
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:29,567
And the government funded the national HIV epidemiology study

275
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:33,151
Overtime you gotten so much attention for AIDS

276
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:35,711
That more than 200 other causes

277
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,479
Best Buy Arlo

278
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,271
Account now use a loop

279
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,319
Awareness ribbon as their symbol

280
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,855
Well it's interesting that

281
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,903
We almost 25 years later

282
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,207
It's everywhere now and everybody

283
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:46,975
Space

284
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:47,999
Indifferent

285
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,279
Colors

286
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,095
There's the pink ribbon for breast cancer awareness

287
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,911
An indigo ribbon for bullying awareness

288
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:57,983
A teal ribbon for anxiety disorder awareness

289
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:01,567
Actually the teal ribbon is also used for ovarian cancer awareness

290
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,847
Tourette Syndrome awareness

291
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,383
Tsunami victim awareness

292
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,479
Thermal causes that want ribbons and there are colors of ribbon

293
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:12,063
And the ribbons Ubiquiti eventually reach the point of parity

294
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:17,695
When the Band Death Cab for Cutie wore light blue ribbons at the Grammys in 2009

295
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,463
People wondered

296
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:20,767
What about second hand smoke awareness

297
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:23,327
Adrenocortical carcinoma awareness

298
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,351
It turns out

299
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,655
Death Cab for Cutie had started their own cause

300
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,703
Auto-tune abuse awareness

301
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:33,311
You know on 7th Avenue to call that

302
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,871
A knockoff elsewhere you call it a rip-off

303
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:39,199
I think it's great that people

304
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,479
Cook that

305
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,015
Simple

306
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:45,343
Little ribbon with a pin and made it their own

307
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:48,671
You know and used it for whatever cause they

308
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,695
They were fighting

309
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,975
I'm

310
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,279
Totally fine with that and I think you know it's

311
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,559
It's

312
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,839
There for people to use

313
00:13:56,095 --> 00:14:02,239
In whatever way they want to and however they want to get a message out

314
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,775
Imagination when I look at it is that it

315
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,311
Such a perfect phone

316
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,359
Yusuf all

317
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,431
Economic in terms of its design

318
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,967
And that is

319
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:12,991
The best kind of

320
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:15,551
Design that's Michelle Miller Fisher

321
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:20,927
She's a curatorial assistant at the architecture and design department at the Museum of Modern Art

322
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:27,583
And this last month she helps make the red AIDS ribbon an official part of the Museum's collection

323
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:31,423
She remembers first seeing the ribbon as a kid in England in the 90s

324
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,983
The very first time I saw it I realized it

325
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:38,591
Advocacy and passion even understanding it is a very young child

326
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:43,455
Imbued in a very simple design

327
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:49,855
The MoMA hasn't collection one of the hand-cut visual aids ribbons pinned to an original ribbon project handout

328
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:50,879
Explaining its meaning

329
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,159
I love the fact that

330
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,719
I can see what someone has cut this

331
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,511
And so I wonder whether

332
00:14:57,023 --> 00:15:01,119
This was someone's like 50th weapon at the end of the day

333
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:04,703
The Momo plans to have the ribbon out on display in the next year

334
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,751
I will always think it's irrelevant

335
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,031
Kabul again

336
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,055
Because

337
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,079
You know

338
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:16,479
AIDS is still with us it's still out there and we still have to be aware of it and we still have to raise money and we still have to fight

339
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,759
We still have to

340
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,295
Care for people in

341
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,575
So on and so forth

342
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:24,159
No AIDS isn't the killer that used to be at least in the US

343
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,719
But that doesn't mean the disease is gone

344
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:30,815
The number of people living with HIV in the United States

345
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,607
Is now higher than ever before

346
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:36,703
Patrick O'Connell also says he'll keep wearing his AIDS awareness ribbons

347
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:40,287
Back at his apartment he showed me the ribbons in his wardrobe

348
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,311
Sure they're on

349
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:43,871
330 Ravens

350
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:50,015
Yeah that he doesn't even take them off when he washes his shirt

351
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,551
Just keep them pinned on

352
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,343
Is anything that has

353
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:54,879
Do you have the ribbon you don't

354
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,415
Wait NF

355
00:15:56,671 --> 00:16:00,511
We had fun that we did bizarrely we had fun

356
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,047
I'm telling you why

357
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:11,007
Remember me

358
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:14,591
Explain

359
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,527
Urinating

360
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:28,927
Domingo with the old times

361
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:33,535
I am sad that I be there

362
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:44,287
99percentinvisible was produced this week by Audrey Quinn with Katie mingle Sam Greenspan Avery trufelman and Mero

363
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:49,919
We are project of kalw San Francisco and produce out of the offices of arcsin

364
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,967
An architecture and Interiors firm

365
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,503
In beautiful downtown

366
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,783
Oakland California

367
00:16:56,063 --> 00:17:02,207
The inspiration for this story came from WHYY the pulse

368
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:02,975
