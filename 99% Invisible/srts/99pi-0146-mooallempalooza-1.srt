I'm Roman Mars

24
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:16,544
During this holiday season we have a special episode with two stories from one of my favorite writers John welham

25
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,664
He is a contributing writer to the New York Times magazine and also a writer at large for pop-up magazine

26
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,968
We're lucky to have him on the show a few times

27
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:27,808
The first stories about the origin of the teddy bear and it would be successor

28
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,952
And we also have this Encore presentation of Wild Ones live the song is Dory Extravaganza that probably

29
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,256
My favorite thing that we broadcast

30
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:38,560
And it deserves to be listened to numerous.

31
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:39,584
Here we go

32
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,960
It's totally unfair

33
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:48,288
Hydrox cookies came out in 1908

34
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,872
Warriors didn't show up until 4 years later

35
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,664
But it didn't matter

36
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:57,248
Hydrox could never shake the image of being a knock off

37
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,528
Also ran

38
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:02,624

As a consumer product it's just not up to you

43
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:18,496
Sometimes you redeemed the mighty Transformer

44
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,032
And sometimes

45
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:22,336
Give it to love someone kobot

46
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,480
It's capricious who wins

47
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,784
Swiss cake roll vs hoho

48
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,576
Twizzler vs. red vine

49
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,696
Maybe yours was the first family in the block with a technologically Superior betamax player

50
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:41,536
Only to be overwhelmed by the mediocre VHS tape

51
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:45,120
Sometimes it doesn't make any sense at all

52
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,704
But sometimes it does

53
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:50,240
I'm John Wallin

54
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:56,640
John is a writer for New York Times magazine in a writer at large for pop-up magazine live magazine in San Francisco

55
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,664
Story first appeared

56
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:04,576
Bright starts 1902 and Theodore Roosevelt as president and he decides to vacation in a town called

57
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:06,368
Needs in the Mississippi Woods

58
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,184
We can hunt black bear is a big Outdoorsman

59
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,584
Big hunter and his hunting trip became kind of a famous story basically it's been a few days hunting and I don't think they

60
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,984
Even saw a single bear they definitely didn't get to shoot it any and then one morning the dogs get the scent of a bear and they follow it down

61
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:28,384
To this really weedy place where the president's guide says you know what don't even bother going in there and then troubling yourself I'll go in and I'll flush

62
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,200
What's the beer out you just stay here and I'll flush it right to you

63
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:35,808
So Roosevelt Waits and waits but then he gets bored and decides to go out and eat lunch

64
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:42,464
Eventually the dog is to Corner the baron and the guy not really knowing what to do leaps off his horse cracks the bear over the head

65
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,512
With the butt of his rifle Knox

66
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:50,912
Unconscious or send me unconscious and tied it to a tree and then starts blowing away on his usual trying to call Rusev

67
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:54,240
Robots that the president can be the one with the owner shooting it

68
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:58,080
Roosevelt here's the buccal and makes his way back to the hunting party

69
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:03,456
Is this bear two female bear it weighs about 235 lb

70
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,992
And it's tied to a tree

71
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,528
It's still semi-conscious

72
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,576
Injured it looks a little mangy

73
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:14,976
It's actually probably about half as heavy and big as it should be but there's been a real drought going on in the area the bear looks

74
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:15,744
Pathetic

75
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:16,768
Roosevelt

76
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:17,536
Takes pity on it

77
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,095
He decides that it's it's unsportsmanlike

78
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:23,679
To shoot this thing you know he's not going to do it and doesn't want anyone else to do it either

79
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,215
Has gun

80
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:28,543
And in this sort of merciful moment

81
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:32,127
Is your word of this spreads and a political cartoonist

82
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,943
Draw the cartoon of the of the moment of him

83
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,807
Showing the bear this mercy and the way the cartoonist draws the berries almost like a

84
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:43,391
Little Labrador puppy or a golden retriever puppy survive on its

85
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,439
On its butt and its hind legs

86
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:49,023
Kentucky's big round perked up ears almost like Mickey Mouse

87
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:53,631
Nice big white eyes and it's tearing at the president waiting to see what its fate will be

88
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:56,959
The cartoon was called Drawing the Line in Mississippi

89
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:01,055
And from that basically spawned the teddy bear this adorable little

90
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:07,455
Bear in the cartoon was turned into a three-dimensional plush toy the very first teddy bear was either made by a

91
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,991
A German company called Steve

92
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:12,319
Aura Brooklyn toys around are depending on who you ask

93
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:15,903
And they named it after Theodore Roosevelt they called teddy bear

94
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,439
It's a huge

95
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:23,839
Sensation and it's actually more popular than baby dolls which freaks everyone out a little bit you know why should their children be playing with bear

96
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,119
Reason and not dolls

97
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,143
Hello Savage

98
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:31,775
And within a few years I think Steve is producing close to a million teddy bears a year and shipping them to the US

99
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:38,431
It was considered so bizarre that kids would play with a stuffed bear that people just assumed it was a novelty and as soon as Rose

100
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,455
Roosevelt left office

101
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:44,575
No one would want them anymore at this time the whole idea of mass-produced toys was also really new

102
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:48,415
So the toy industry wanted to kind of capitalized on its rally and keep it going

103
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,975
It was really looking for whatever was going to be the next

104
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:55,327
Cubby play things that American kids were going to want all though it had no idea what that might be

105
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,375
The best forward in 1909

106
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:01,983
Roosevelt's term is about up in the president-elect is Roosevelt's hand-picked

107
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:02,751
Sensor

108
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:09,151
William Howard Taft and that January January 1909 Taft is in the Atlanta he's trying to woo the South

109
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:14,271
I'll try to convince him that his administration is going to take them seriously as a constituency

110
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,319
And he's the guest of honor at this banquet

111
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:20,415
In the Chamber of Commerce in Atlanta decides it's going to serve him the truest

112
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:23,487
Most unpretentious Southern dish around

113
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:27,839
It's something that a writer of the time I found this little book about southern food from the time

114
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:30,911
Calls it the Christmas goose of the Epicurean negro

115
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:35,263
The meal was possum and taters and what it was was it an opossum

116
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,567
Would be roasted on a bed of sweet potatoes

117
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,871
And then presented hole on a platter

118
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:42,175
With its head on its tail on

119
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:46,783
And it often you'd get a smaller a little sweet potato Crown between the animals teeth

120
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:53,183
50 teeth has apparently the most teeth of any North American mammal

121
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:57,023
Indian the one that they brought the test table weight 18 lb

122
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:04,191
All the sudden Orchestra strikes up and they just burst into song suddenly Taft is presented with a surprise gift

123
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,983
The small stuff

124
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:12,383
Opossum toy in this is a brand new invention that some local tap supporters are trying to position as William Taft president

125
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,687
Answer to the teddy bear

126
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:15,711
They're calling it

127
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,735
The Billy possum

128
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,295
Already there was a company set up

129
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,599
Call the Georgia Billy possum company

130
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:28,511
According to One account within 24 hours of that bank with their already deals being brokered for Billy possums with distributors

131
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,279
Across the country

132
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,703
In covering the banquet the LA Times announced that

133
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:41,823
The teddy bear has been relegated to a seed in the rear end for 4 years possibly 8

134
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,639
The children of the United States will play with Billy possum

135
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:52,063
Government on a bit of opossum Mania started their Billy possum postcards Billy possum pins Billy possum pictures

136
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,367
Trader cream when you had coffee

137
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:57,951
There was a Ragtime tune called possum the latest craze

138
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:05,119
Does tap travel around the South some people actually start giving him live opossums in cages when he would make public appearances or

139
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,167
Handing them over like they were floral the kids

140
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:14,079
Soon baby possums were in toy stores from New York to San Francisco because real opossums weren't actually that, Nancy

141
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,871
Cities that and no one really knew what they were

142
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,663
A toy store in Brooklyn

143
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:24,063
Brandon in-store promotion with a live captive opossum that they could show off the kids so the kids could familiarize in

144
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,879
Animal are going to be best friends with was

145
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:31,231
I found an advertisement for the story that read do not let it be said

146
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:34,047
But any man woman or child in Brooklyn

147
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:36,095
Has not seen the cute little animal

148
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:39,423
Whose name is mentioned more in all parts of the world today

149
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,447
In any other

150
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,847
President on the newspapers

151
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:53,247
Hauser morning the passing of the dolls and and how sad it was at these teddy bears were coming into nurseries in vanquishing

152
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,783
And now the ra poems

153
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:58,111
In newspapers about Billy possums displacing teddy bears

154
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:01,439
But since you probably never heard of a billy possum

155
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,743
You can guess what comes next

156
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:09,631
Next it was a total flop and the Billy possum was forgotten and almost entirely out of stores within a couple of months

157
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:13,215
What's another word for Billy possum never even made it to see Christmas time

158
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:16,287
Which is a special kind of tragedy for toy

159
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:21,407
There are several possible explanations as to why the Billy possum never took off

160
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,175
The first

161
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:24,479
Probably thinking right now is this

162
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:28,575
Opossums are ugly and nobody likes them

163
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:31,903
It was also the dawn of the mechanical toy

164
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:35,999
And even some teddy bears that evolved into wind up animatronics

165
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,791
There is a French maid teddy bear

166
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:43,167
That quote wines up and is calculated to indulge in a number of ludicrous somersault

167
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,447
How could a limp

168
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:46,751
Stuffed Billy possum compete with that

169
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,799
Pajama Willam argues that

170
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:53,663
At its heart the acceptance of teddy bear and the rejection of Billy possum

171
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,711
Comes down to their origin story

172
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,783
In the story that was told about Roosevelt and his bear

173
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,343
It was a very kind of tender moment where

174
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,903
Rosella showing the bear Mercy

175
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:07,231
And when you look at that cartoon the way the bear was drawn

176
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:13,119
It looked like something that you would want to just sweep up into your arms and take care of and that was vulnerable and that needed your help

177
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,423
It looked like a teddy bear as we know it

178
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:19,263
Although no one knew it at the time the story with Taft it didn't give it anything else

179
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,031
You're tough

180
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,567
State is Boston for supper

181
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,871
I need a lot of it and he ate so much

182
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:30,271
The Doctor's first several helping is a doctor seated nearby apparently passed him a note suggesting that it might be a good idea if you slowed

183
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,039
Down a little

184
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:37,439
Taft even bragged reporters the next day about how much possum he consumed fly like a possum and I ate very hard on the other

185
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,207
But it last night

186
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:40,511
And it did not disturb in the slightest

187
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,303
My digestion or my sleep

188
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,095
The possum was vulnerable I guess

189
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,399
Splayed out on a bed of taters but

190
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:52,287
You're not exactly routing for it I started feeling really bad for tattoo and the more I read a little bit about him

191
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,079
He was this totally colorless

192
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,103
Politician

193
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:58,431
And you didn't actually been want to be president by some accounts

194
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,479
How you assert strong-armed into it

195
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:06,879
Original any never really measured up to Roosevelt's Charisma and charm I mean Roosevelt was the kind of guy who

196
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:10,207
No matter what he did history seemed eager to glorifying for it

197
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:16,607
Case in point the messed up thing about the famous story of Teddy the bear on that hunting trip in Mississippi

198
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,399
Is it isn't even the whole truth

199
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,447
You have to remember that Roosevelt was

200
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:26,079
A hunter he was there to hunt bears he wasn't a Peta activist or something like this

201
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:29,919
Well he did show the bear Mercy it was very particular

202
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,199
Kind of Mercy

203
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,247
After he refused to shoot it

204
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:35,295
He said put it out of its misery

205
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:40,159
And then one of his Hunting Buddies came in and slip the bear's neck open with a knife

206
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:44,255
They Carried the Bears body back to Camp over the back of a horse

207
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:47,327
And they basically ate off it for the next several days

208
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,119
And the last name of their trip

209
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,423
They finish it off they roasted its paws

210
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:55,263
And I kid you not date the paws with a side of possum and taters

211
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,919
So that's why you will never cuddle up

212
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,199
With a billy possum

213
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:06,271
Just like you will never watch a betamax tape

214
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:09,343
Or travel to go betron with weeder one

215
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,135
And you will never again

216
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,183
Tonka Hydrox cookie

217
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,791
Mandamus Hydrox cookies

218
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,095
They're really tasty

219
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:27,775
We have one cardinal rule on 99percentinvisible

220
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,311
No Cardinals

221
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,615
Meaning we don't deal with the natural world

222
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,639
Only the built world

223
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:39,295
So when I read John wellons brilliant book called Wild Ones a sometimes this main weirdly reassuring story

224
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:42,879
About looking at people looking at animals in America

225
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:47,487
I didn't think I'd ever do an episode of 99% invisible about it I just read it for fun

226
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:53,375
But then I saw John perform stories from the book live with musical accompaniment and I thought

227
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,703
I need to put this on the radio

228
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,495
Gaston College radio

229
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:03,103
Anyway what you need to know about Wild Ones is that it isn't a book about nature

230
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:06,943
It's a book about how we fit nature into our modern lives

231
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:09,759
Wild Ones is about the QT stuffed animals

232
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,551
Eco tours

233
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:14,879
In the Byzantine methods of conservation that involved

234
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:18,463
When our experience with Wildlife goes from something natural

235
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,487
Do something

236
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,255
Design

237
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,351
Human-animal interaction has become a designed experience

238
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,399
In the story of that transition

239
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,935
As the title of the book suggests

240
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,983
Is sometimes dismay

241
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,519
And also

242
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,055
Weirdly reassuring

243
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:38,431
John William is friends with the band black prairie and as he was writing the book

244
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:42,271
They can talk to this idea of the band creating a soundtrack to the book

245
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:45,855
And the result was an extended EP called Wild Ones

246
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:48,671
The musical score for the things you might see in your head

247
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:51,231
When you reflect on certain characters and incidents

248
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,511
That you read in the book

249
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:59,167
The writer and the band then went on a short tour with the song and story Extravaganza that I'm going to play for you today

250
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,983
When I saw them perform this live in San Francisco

251
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:06,847
I'm freaked out it was so good and I costed them in the dressing room and said

252
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:09,663
You have to let me share this with my audience

253
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,199
So here it is

254
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,479
Eureka

255
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,415
Happens every summer

256
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,719
Small turtles

257
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:03,839
Call diamondback terrapin skidder out of the water around JFK Airport New York

258
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,631
They start moving West

259
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,935
They're heading for a patch of sand

260
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,471
Where they like to lay their eggs

261
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,799
The crossover one of the airport's runways

262
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,847
Runway 4L

263
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:16,895
Sometimes

264
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:19,199
There's so many turtles on the move at 1

265
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:20,991
Control tower

266
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,527
Has to delay flights

267
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:24,575
Letterpress

268
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:27,135
Loves doing stories about how funny this

269
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:30,207
Hella Fleet a giant airplane

270
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,487
Can be held up

271
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,023
I just a few tiny turtle

272
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:38,399
The hold that picture in your mind and think about the Caribbean Sea in 1492

273
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,679
They were almost

274
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,703
A billion

275
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,495
Sea turtles living in a back then

276
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:45,311
Columbus has been anchored in the Caribbean

277
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,615
Rude about being kept awake at night

278
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:51,199
Butterfly king of so many turtle shells against the sides of their ship

279
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:57,855
Notice how that scene is the exact opposite of the scene at JFK

280
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:02,463
It's not a fleet of giant airplanes being held up by a few tiny turtle

281
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,279
It's a giant

282
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,303
Fleta Turtles

283
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,327
Bombarding

284
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,143
Just a few relatively tiny ships

285
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:23,199
So I wrote this book about people and wild animals in America and it only really started

286
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:28,319
Because I wanted to show my daughter endangered species in the wild before they disappeared

287
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:31,903
Like a lot of people I think I felt this pain

288
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:32,671
I knew that

289
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,695
All around us

290
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:36,767
Beautiful parts of the world are expiring

291
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,303
And I also knew that

292
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,583
People in the future

293
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,863
They might not even notice

294
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:44,703
Today I'm a world without whales or wilderness

295
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:46,239
Might feel normal

296
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,775
Wanted to counteract

297
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:48,799
Not forgetting

298
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,847
That's bound to take old overtime

299
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,663
This forgetting has a name

300
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:57,247
Scientist called shifting Baseline syndrome

301
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:58,527
It means that

302
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,319
All of us except

303
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:02,367
The version of the world we inherit

304
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,391
Is normal

305
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:07,743
Over the years we watch Forrest get louder animals disappear but

306
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,023
When the next generation

307
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:09,791
Comes along

308
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:10,559
Except

309
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:13,375
That depleted version of nature is there normal

310
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,167
Chart zoom out

311
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,959
Really feel the change

312
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,239
Stutter stacking up

313
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,775
Across the generations

314
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,823
I can't even imagine

315
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:25,663
What an ocean filled with a billion sea turtles must feel like

316
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:26,943
Last winter

317
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,991
I was in Hawaii

318
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,039
And I saw three seater

319
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,575
And I flipped

320
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,391
Felt like I was in

321
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,159
Eden

322
00:18:55,103 --> 00:19:01,247
It wasn't so long ago that America was a kind of eating when people could be dwarfed and engulf by

323
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:07,647
Wild animals in a way that feels almost impossible now in the late 1800s trains with

324
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:10,463
Sometimes have to stop for four or five hours

325
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:13,279
Extremes of Buffalo moved across the tracks

326
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:18,911
Occasionally I Stampede with battery into the side of a train derailing it

327
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:21,727
The witness describes one of these scenes

328
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:24,031
1871 in Kansas

329
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:26,847
Each individual a buffalo went out in

330
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:31,199
What's the best ratio does paraplegic locomotive cars

331
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:37,599
Directed after having dreams thrown off the track twice in one week conductors learn to have a

332
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:43,999
Mother decided respect for the idiosyncrasies of the Buffalo this man's name

333
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:50,399
Was William Temple hornaday he was a bombastic mid Westerner with an elaborate Mustang

334
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:56,799
Hornaday was head taxidermist at the Smithsonian and he traveled the globe hunting a

335
00:19:57,055 --> 00:20:03,199
Exotic animals and stuffing them for the museum in India after he took down an elephant climb.

336
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:06,015
Stop the carcass and popped open a bass ale

337
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:11,903
Once he trapped an orangutan named did little man gave it to Andrew Carnegie as a pet

338
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,999
It sounds weird but for hornaday

339
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:18,047
Killing these animals with a kind of

340
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:18,815
Conservation

341
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:20,607
He believed

342
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,143
By stuffing them

343
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,935
He was preserving endangered

344
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:28,287
For the future Generations that might not know them after they were gone

345
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,335
Do taxidermy

346
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:31,615
You can make them a more

347
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,431
In 1886

348
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,967
Hornaday looked West

349
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:36,991
Since all that America

350
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:38,527
So many buff

351
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:39,807
So rapidly

352
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,087
The Prairie was on

353
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,135
You figured

354
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,159
They were maybe

355
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:46,207
Less than 300 Buffalo left

356
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,511
And so we did

357
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,535
What he thought

358
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,071
Helpful and Lodge

359
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,375
He lit out for a month

360
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,167
Killed several dozen

361
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,984
They shot 25 buffalo in Montana and he built the best looking ones into an exhibit at the Museum

362
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,336
He gathered them around a pic Watering Hole looking for Lauren

363
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:11,456
But from there his thinking of all of you realize he was basically just a funeral director

364
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:16,832
Embalming the species that America was Exterminating it occurred to him

365
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:19,904
What if we actually tried to keep these animals alive

366
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:26,816
And so he became one of America's first real wildlife conservationists and activist the lobbyists to celebra

367
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:33,984
America was killing every conceivable kind of animal in their way and hornaday sit up for all of them

368
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:40,384
Micon's like the grizzly to lowly or less Majestic things like the squirrel

369
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:46,784
Alive squirrel two trees poetry in motion to save the silver tail

370
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:51,136
There was really only one animal on the continent that Hornet it wasn't worried about

371
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:57,280
It would seem to Mighty to be brought down by men with guns and it lived in a cold and brutal wilderness

372
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:59,584
Batman couldn't possibly take over

373
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:01,888
Polar bear

374
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,680
Is the king of the Frozen North

375
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:07,008
It's not very probable that the polar bear

376
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:07,776
Forever views

377
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,056
Terminated

378
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:12,640
That's hornaday writing a 1914

379
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:13,664
Back then

380
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:17,760
No one could have imagined the problem is abstract is climate change

381
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:23,392
But think about how quickly climate changes change the polar bears reputation in our minds

382
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:26,208
It's gone from bloodthirsty Man Killer

383
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,488
The delicate

384
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,512
Drowning victim

385
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:34,912
200 years ago Arctic explorers wrote about polar bears leaping into their boat

386
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,448
I'm trying to eat them

387
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,008
Even if they lit the bear on fire

388
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:42,848
I recently when I went to the tiny Northern Town that calls itself

389
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:45,152
The polar bear capital of the world

390
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:47,456
Martha Stewart had just arrived

391
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,736
The film The Animals

392
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,528
For her daytime show

393
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,552
The Hallmark

394
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:05,888
The town is called Churchill Manitoba it's on the edge of Hudson Bay and every fall right before the bay freezes

395
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:12,288
Silver Churchill gets overrun with about 900 polar bears and 10,000 polar bear tours

396
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:18,688
Prayers routinely wander into town they like hanging out at the elementary

397
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:25,088
Especially 675 Bear Paw Patrol officers will come

398
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:31,488
Chase the animals backgrounds of the tundra and their trucks bears that won't budge or tranquilizing

399
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:34,048
Shipped out to a quonset hut near the airport

400
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:40,448
Once this so-called polar bear gel fills up each animal is drugged again and airlifted one at a time

401
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:45,824
To an area north of town crowds of tourists come out to watch these bare lifts

402
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,616
And I went to one myself

403
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:03,232
There was

404
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:05,792
Something just a little ceremonial

405
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:07,328
About the bare lifts I went to

406
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:11,168
How do uniforms Wildlife officers arranged

407
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,192
Sleeping Bear

408
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,216
On a net

409
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:14,240
Epicenter of the

410
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,008
The crowd

411
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,288
How they talked

412
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,312
Pause

413
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,848
Carefully across it

414
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:19,616
Chess

415
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:22,944
Like some drunken Uncle after Thanksgiving dinner

416
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:25,248
It was so careful

417
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,528
Beautiful

418
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:27,808
You confusing

419
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,856
A couple of people cry

420
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,160
It was like the opposite

421
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:34,720
Of an animal sacrifice the ritual

422
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,000
To save the bear

423
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:39,584
To show how far out of our way we go not

424
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:43,936
I stood there and watched and as I did

425
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,472
Martha Stewart

426
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:46,496
Stood next to me

427
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,568
Her crew is there

428
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:50,592
Filming everything

429
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:05,696
Honestly it's a breathtaking thing to watch the polar

430
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:12,096
Bear flying away all of a sudden the helicopters started to turn the edges

431
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:18,496
Other than that lifted the furry shape inside contracted to you and

432
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:21,568
The entire package was off the ground

433
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,896
The helicopter client or the cloudbank

434
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:31,296
The bear twirling slightly underneath it like a tea bag and then finally

435
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:37,696
Polar bear was gone

436
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,528
Yeah I know

437
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,576
Airlifting polar bears

438
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:07,136
Strange no one could have imagined it would come

439
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:13,280
The way we help animals now has evolved into a surreal kind of performance art

440
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:17,632
We carry migrating salamanders across busy highway

441
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:20,192
We monitor pygmy rabbits with drone

442
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:24,288
At Cornell scientist breeding endangered peregrine falcon

443
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:26,336
Where is specially-made receptor

444
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:28,640
They called the copulation hat

445
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:32,992
Coach the bird named biercab to ejaculate on their heads

446
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:33,760
Several times

447
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:34,784
The day everyday

448
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:35,808
For much of

449
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,208
This is another Baseline that shifts

450
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:42,976
Overtime

451
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:45,280
The links were willing to go

452
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:47,840
Each generation does what would have look like

453
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,888
Fighting for a purpose

454
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:51,936
Just lost cause to the one before it

455
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:52,704
And then

456
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,472
Which generation

457
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:56,544
Comes along a new and does a little bit more than that

458
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,104
Nanako's Humanity

459
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:02,176
Strapping off the proverbial population hat

460
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:02,944
Again

461
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:03,968
And again

462
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:05,248
And again

463
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,552
Consider the story

464
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:08,576
George

465
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:25,728
In the late 1970s there were only a handful of whooping cranes left in the wild

466
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,056
Also a small number at a government lab in Maryland

467
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:34,176
Scientist there were doing their best to ring as many new Offspring as they could from those capped

468
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:42,880
But the lab had one problem child a female crane name a text as a newborn Texas

469
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:49,024
Been raised in a cardboard box in the zookeeper's living room and having never seen another crane

470
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:55,424
She imprinted on the one animal she did see the Zookeeper basically she wound up

471
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,752
I'm sexually attracted to people but not other grains

472
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:05,408
The scientist kept trying to parietex off but text wasn't interested she wanted a man I specifically

473
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:10,272
William and it looks like her old zookeeper a dark-haired white man the medium build

474
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:16,928
Now there was a young crane conservationists named George Archibald

475
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:23,328
George happened to pee is dark haired white man of medium build he took text to rule Wisconsin put a mattress

476
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:29,728
Personal pan and moved in as Texas companion they'd Forge together build a nest

477
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:36,128
And they dance George doing deep knee bends and springing up with arms out like wings

478
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:42,528
Pitbull and holler come on text come on

479
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:48,928
Heather just like wild cranes do during courtship this would get text aroused and it just the

480
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:55,328
The right moment to assistance with Richard from a hiding place and artificially inseminate her with crane semen

481
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:08,128
George did all this for 3 years living with text for months at a

482
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:14,528
What time because the eggs she kept playing where infertile the man and crane would start out after Dawn

483
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:20,928
They go for a walk and they dance they dance and they dance send it down

484
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:46,528
George didn't enjoy any of this he was miserable actually miserable

485
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:51,648
Spring of 1983 text finally laid an egg that hatched and George was right there when it did

486
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:54,720
He was invited on The Tonight Show to celebrate

487
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:56,256
When headline Redman

488
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:57,280
Crane

489
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,048
Proud parents

490
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:01,376
George name the chick qiwiz

491
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:07,776
I know gee whiz as 44 grandchildren and great-grandchildren today there are more

492
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,824
Whooping cranes in the wild than there have been

493
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,616
In almost a hundred years

494
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,520
William Temple hornaday

495
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:40,544
The taxidermy

496
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,312
Just died at 9

497
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:44,128
His funeral

498
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,152
Bugler's

499
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:46,176
Listen to local Boy Scout

500
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,968
Surrounded the coffee

501
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,504
Played Home on the Range

502
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,064
20 years later

503
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,392
Hornet is Buffalo

504
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,672
The one he built

505
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:01,792
They found a rusty

506
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:02,560
Beatbox

507
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,328
Buried in

508
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:05,888
Inside was a

509
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,192
From hornaday

510
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:16,896
But I'm Dustin

511

I beg you to protect

Especially

Deterioration

514
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,040
Destruction

515
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:24,576
At last

516
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:25,856
The game butchers

517
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,216
My name is William

00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,800
Please note

High-rises letters

I am happy not to be

525

I have free food

Enjoy their beauty

00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:01,760
You can move

532
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:12,000
Faster than one

533
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:04,992
Yocan

534
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:15,488
How to download

535
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:46,976
Of course

536
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:50,048
Hornet is written that pessimistic letter and 18

537
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:51,072
1887

538
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:51,840
When he was still

539
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:52,608
Just a young tok

540
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,424
Turns out he was wrong

541
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,728
The Buffalo we're not all day

542
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,008
And the years

543
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:02,592
He actually played a big role in helping to save

544
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,128
Lots of others

545
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:08,992
But it was hard for him to focus on those

546
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:11,808
He lost so many more battle

547
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,624
By the end of his life

548
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:15,904
He turned bitter

549
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:16,928
Disillusion

550
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,232
I tried

551
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:20,256
To inject

552
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:21,280
The Croods

553
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:24,864
Into the hearts of men but today

554
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,400
I think that speaking generally

555
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:29,728
Civilized man is an unmitigated ass

556
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,032
Like all of us

557
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,080
His imagination was hope

558
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,104
Flea traps

559
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,384
And its own moment

560
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:39,712
It only see the world

561
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:40,992
Do the tiny

562
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:41,760
Keyhole

563
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,176
So where does that leave us

564
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:12,992
Maybe

565
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,528
Anyone of us

566
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:15,296
Can do is

567
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,344
Against the Baseline

568
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:20,160
You can be a tiny

569
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:20,928
Counterweight

570
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,720
We weigh almost nothing

571
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:24,256
Generation app

572
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,024
Regeneration

573
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:27,840
Sometimes

574
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:28,864
Fun places

575
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:31,424
The other day

576
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,240
The direction of more Beauty

577
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:36,544
But that happens

578
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:37,824
Terminal E to a

579
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:38,848
To be hard to know

580
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,152
So

581
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:44,480
Picture that seeing a JFK again all those Turtles

582
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:46,272
When hornaday was born

583
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,064
There are close to

584
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:49,856
Being hunted

585
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,392
They tasted so good in suit

586
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:54,464
We're like those Turtles

587
00:38:55,232 --> 00:39:01,376
Erase of stubborn little things that barely notices is the Wilderness it migrates through fills up

588
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:03,168
With villages and lights

589
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,984
And swells into an Airport runway

590
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:11,872
Just keep migrating across that anyway talking in the eggs of the Next Generation into the saying

591
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,944
The world like the airplanes to

592
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:21,344
Cuz we have change we change into something that hornaday could never have imagined species that

593
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:25,184
10 least try to slow down try to stop

594
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:31,584
I like to think about those airplanes powering down the lines of them partying like a shining

595
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:37,984
Galaxy Sol this Tiny Tribe and turtles and pass-through I get it it look

596
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:44,384
Looks funny in the present but squint into the hazy Panorama of history and

597
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:50,784
Both airplanes idling in place that little moment of not moving forward

598
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:57,184
Looks unmistakably to me like progress

599
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:33,952
That was Wild Ones live text written by John Llewellyn music by black prairie Blackberry is Jenny Conlee

In beautiful Downtown Oakland California

617
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:34,367
Between the beeps bongs and chatter of our devices

618
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:37,951
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

619
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:43,583
If I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexis

620
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:49,471
Is talking to me and my wife is in another room and a kid is in another room and we're all hearing.

621
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:51,263
Technology talk to us

622
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:53,567

To make them more human

626

Okay

631
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:18,655
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

632
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:21,471
Makes for a much more natural experience

633
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:23,519
Turn the living room lights on

00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:27,103

Constipation abdominal pain and bloating

645
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:58,847
You tell yourself it's not that bad you take laxatives you modify your diet and exercise routine but thinking about it all the time is free

646
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:04,479
Frustrating but doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again

You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

666
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:14,111
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

667
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:18,463
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like a dad

668
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:22,815
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

669
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:25,119
Actually if I'm being honest

670
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:27,167
I'm one of the main guy to know how to do that

671
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:31,519
A few days ago Wesley Stern

672
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:34,847
After that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

673
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:38,175
Was found dead in my private gym

674
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:41,503
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

675
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:45,855
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

676
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:46,879
Now

677
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:49,183
I need to clear my name

678
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:53,279
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do

679
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:55,327
