37
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:49,056

The nipple is changing direction give me very high

39
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:55,456

Sports bras are a piece of clothing that women might take for granted today

49
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:22,080
But they were totally revolutionary when they were first invented

50
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:28,480
They opened up whole new Realms of sports and exercise to women

51
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,272

1000

56
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,648
Of women

57
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:36,928
This is a game changer

58
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:44,864
Today we're going to feature a story from our friends at the outside podcast from outside magazine and PRX

59
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,472
They did a whole episode dedicated to the design and history of the sports bra

00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:01,504
Stop the decades worth of vintage model

63
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:04,320
Some are more mystifying than others

64
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,624
There are so many straps

65
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,160
This cannot be any weirder

66
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,720
What's it called the demon jogger with

67
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,000
I called the

68
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,536
Daemon jogger

69
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,072
And

70
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,376
There were instructions

71
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,400
On how to get this

72
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,168
On

73
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,192
Which

74
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,776
You put your legs through it

75
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,312
What

76
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,848
A poet up

77
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,920
Look at all the options around the room it's

78
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:34,016
Crazy to think the modern sports bra didn't even exist, Jane was growing up

79
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,552
Ashley when I started High

80
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:38,880
School we weren't allowed to run full court because

81
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,184
With the assumption that girls for 2 weeks

82
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:44,000
And we couldn't run any races

83
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,536
Longer than like

84
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,816
400

85
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,864
So

86
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:52,960
Women participating in sports and having needing a

87
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:53,984
Sports bra

88
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,776
Is so recent

89
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:58,592
Recent and surprisingly controversial

90
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:03,456
Wilma Jean started doing her research back in the 80s she actually got some serious pushback

91
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:05,760
What's a fun letter that turned up at her office

92
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,808
Letter said

93
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:08,832
If

94
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,624
God had intended women

95
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:11,648
To run

96
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,416
He would not have

97
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,976
Put breast on them

98
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,512
So it's sort of like

99
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,303
There was a hole

100
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,351
Socio-cultural stereotype

101
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,887
How women should

102
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:22,655
Behave

103
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,935
And it wasn't

104
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:26,495
Vigorously and badly it was

105
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,263
It was

106
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,287
Need more

107
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,823
Carmen Suite

108
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,591
And have

109
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,359
Comport

110
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,895
Self with more

111
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:33,919
Daddy

112
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:34,943
And not

113
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:35,711
Assertive

114
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,479
Doseum

115
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,015
Compassionate

116
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:45,951
To understand how the sports bra change all that we need to go back to 1977

117
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:48,255
It was the same here that James fix

118
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:51,839
How much does blockbuster bestseller The Complete Book of running

119
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:54,143
It was just a few years out from Title Nine

120
00:04:54,655 --> 00:05:00,799
Women were finally wanting in on the Sports Action after being told for generations and generations that there by

121
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,847
Bodies just weren't built for sports

122
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,895
Started walking

123
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:07,711
Congratulations I got in shape I began to run

124
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,527
Now I Run 3 days a week

125
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:11,551
Family and

126
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,903
You know my whole generation

127
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:16,927
Started

128
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:17,951
Exercise

129
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,487
This is Lisa Lindell

130
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,767
She got caught up in the craze

131
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,559
I

132
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:25,119
Had a friend who introduced me to

133
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,655
What was then called

134
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,423
Jogging

135
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:30,239
And a new term

136
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,263
It was

137
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,871
I went out and started

138
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:39,711
Chalking up at the University of Vermont indoor track

139
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:43,551
And just to get around that track once was

140
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,319
Painful

141
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:49,183
And I remember the day that I got around that track four times in

142
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:53,279
Completed a mile and you would think I had won an Olympic medal

143
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,559
I was

144
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,095
So proud of my

145
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,423
Lisa broke a mile

146
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,983
N2 N3

147
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,031
She started running outside

148
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,823
Before she ran

149
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:08,127
The more she realized she had a new problem

150
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,919
Actually two problems

151
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,199
Her 360

152
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,015
When you have a t-shirt

153
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,295
Over

154
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,087
Bouncing nipples

155
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,623
You get chafing

156
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,927
So the answer to that

157
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,975
Is to put a bra on

158
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:28,095
Because I did try running without any Braun and then of course I got a lot of

159
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,375
Comments from

160
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,911
Passing motorists

161
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,239
Male runners

162
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,031
Things haven't changed much

163
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,359
Unfortunately not

164
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,687
So you wear a bra

165
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,711
Of some sort

166
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:47,295
And then that poses new and different product

167
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,831
Like the straps

168
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,879
It slip off your shoulder so you're all

169
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,415
Checking them back up

170
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:55,743
Hardware that can dig into your back

171
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,279
And they're hot

172
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:58,815
Sweaty

173
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:01,119
Lisa sister started running to

174
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,655
And one day she called The Rock

175
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:05,471
And she said what do you do about your

176
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:11,615
Actually that's what she said I am so uncomfortable when I'm running

177
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:14,687
What she said when I was talking about

178
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:17,247
The fact that I had no great solution

179
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,015
Was

180
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,551
Why isn't there a

181
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,575
A jockstrap

182
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:21,855
For women

183
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,671
That's when we really laughed we thought that

184
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,439
That's hilarious

185
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,511
Lisa couldn't let the idea drop

186
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,303
She started working the problem

187
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:35,935
What would that bra have to look like what would it have to do and I sat down at my

188
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:41,823
Dining room table and wrote out a list that was alright the straps shouldn't fall off

189
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:45,407
They should be wide enough that they don't take in

190
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,223
Ideally I was hoping that it could

191
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,527
Be modest enough that I could

192
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,111
Take off my t-shirt on really hot summer days

193
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:57,183
Because I had a running partner who

194
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,463
Would do that he would

195
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:01,023
Take off in the middle of a run his T-shirt

196
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,583
Over his head stuck in the back of his shorts and I was

197
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,119
Jealous

198
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,423
Because I couldn't do that

199
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,471
But I didn't hold a lot of Hope for

200
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,007
That in the beginning

201
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:14,079
And then you're somehow your husband became involve your husband at the time

202
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,615
Yeah also

203
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,407
How to roll hair

204
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,711
He did because

205
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:25,087
What happened is I mean part of the irony of this story Florence is that I

206
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,111
Don't

207
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:26,879
So

208
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,671
But

209
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:31,743
Living with me at the time when it was was my

210
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,535
Good friend Polly who

211
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:37,887
Had become a costume designer and so boy did she so

212
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,239
And I went to her and said Polly help me make this and

213
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,287
So we started making

214
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,823
Prototypes

215
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,103
And

216
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,151
Having difficulty because

217
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,199
Really bras

218
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,735
An engineering

219
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,015
Proposition

220
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:56,831
Yeah things need to be cantilevered

221
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,135
It's like building a bridge

222
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:03,487
But we didn't know that

223
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:08,351
So we were sitting in the living room Polly and I be moaning

224
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,119
The latest

225
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,959
Prototype that I had gone running in and was not cutting it

226
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:18,335
And my then-husband came down the stairs and he had pulled one of his jockstraps

227
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,127
On over his head

228
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:23,199
And across his breast and said

229
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:26,783
Hey ladies hahaha here's your new jock bra

230
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,319
And

231
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:31,903
We just thought that was very very funny and rolled on the floor and

232
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:34,975
I got up and and

233
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,767
Took it off of him

234
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:41,119
Tried it on cuz I had to get in the act

235
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,167
Pulled it over my

236
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,215
Dress that actually had breast

237
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:46,751
And when

238
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:52,383
I went running the next day in this truck

239
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,919
Backstrap contraption

240
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,711
And knew that it was

241
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:57,247
This was the

242
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:59,039
Product that was going to work

243
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:00,575
And

244
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:03,391
Probably went to New York City and found good elastic

245
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:06,207
Found a new fabric that would work for the cups

246
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:10,559
Wella we had a working prototype

247
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:13,119
How did you come up with the name jog bra

248
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,143
Well

249
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,959
There is no such term is sports bra the time

250
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:22,591
And so we are calling it jock brought I like that and

251
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:25,663
We heard from some people in the south

252
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:29,247
That jock was not such a nice word

253
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,015
And

254
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,831
We didn't want a name that offended some people

255
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,903
So we change jock to jock

256
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,951
And it became jog bra

257
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:41,791
Lisa started shopping her new job brought around to different sporting good stores

258
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:44,351
What's the buyer to look at her like she was crazy

259
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:48,191
Why would a running store sell women's underwear

260
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:53,055
I was very clear from the beginning that

261
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,359
This was not going to go into lingerie

262
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,919
It didn't look like lingerie it was

263
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,967
Considered ugly

264
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:06,367
And so it needed to go into Sporting Goods so that when a woman went in to buy her shoes she could also get this

265
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:07,903
Bra

266
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,183
And

267
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:12,255
So I had to contend with men

268
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:13,791
Who are the buyers

269
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,351
Or because of women's undergarments

270
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,655
Had never been sold outside of the context

271
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,679
Lingerie

272
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:20,959
Correct

273
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:25,311
To put it in lingerie would be to be minimizing its importance

274
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,615
Minimizing its functionality

275
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:31,455
It's so was not about lifting and separating and

276
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,247
Making a woman more

277
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,551
Attractive according to

278
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:36,831
Some

279
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,111
Fashionistas

280
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,671
It wasn't about the bullet problem

281
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:41,951
No

282
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:45,535
It would and it was about functionality Emmett smushed

283
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,815
The breast

284
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,583
Ferguson

285
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,351
The chest wall

286
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:51,679
There was a little bit of a uniboob issue right

287
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:52,959
Yes Absol

288
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,495
There was a eunuch

289
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,287
Asian of course now

290
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,847
You can have a very sexy sports bra now

291
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,663
Write the fact that it was really about function

292
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,943
100%

293
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,503
And it took off

294
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,319
And it was immediately success

295
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:13,183
Our average growth rate was like 25% per year

296
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,487
And we just kept growing

297
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:27,775
Fundamentally 80s everywhere she looked Lisa was seeing Runners and others wearing sports bras

298
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:34,175
But it wasn't until the 1999 Women's World Cup that she realized just how far her vision to travel

299
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:40,575
US soccer team have just beat China or the winning goal by Bri

300
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,599
Brandi Chastain

301
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:47,999
Rose Bowl in Pasadena

302
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:50,815
I was

303
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,351
Home in Vermont

304
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,399
And all of a sudden my phone started

305
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,959
I ran to the TV set

306
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:59,263
And of course they were replaying the moment

307
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,823
And I went oh my

308
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,591
Word

309
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,895
Annapolis let me just describe it

310
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,711
She made the final winning goal

311
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:08,991
Xi'an

312
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,783
As soon as a goal

313
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,807
Hit the net

314
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,087
She ripped

315
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,367
Off her shirt

316
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,927
And she was wearing a black jog bra

317
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:20,767
And she pumped her fist and she showed her muscles and she was

318
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:23,583
Swarmed by her ecstatic teammates

319
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:27,423
I end and it was really the jog bra that

320
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,215
Was seen around the world

321
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:35,103
The driver that was heard around the world

322
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:38,943
And I think I think what you said was it was her confidence

323
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,759
And her preparation and the long

324
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:42,783
Journey

325
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:45,855
That came to fruition in that moment

326
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,391
And that

327
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,415
That is just

328
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,975
Perfect because that's exactly

329
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,535
You know what I could say about my

330
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,839
Journey

331
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:59,167
In my life really but also the the

332
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,447
Jogbra

333
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:07,871
In a way that moment also really represented the culmination of your dream that one day women could

334
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:10,687
Run around with their shirt exactly it

335
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:17,087
Women do I see it all the time and I chuckled to myself and see women running down the

336
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:21,183
The running path of the greenway here in and they're in there

337
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:24,255
Running shorts and their sports bra

338
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,023
And that's it

339
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,655
So the jagras revolutionize women's participation in sports

340
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:34,495
If you were still geared toward women with small to medium-sized chest

341
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:39,103
What about the subsets of women who were the most discriminated against of all in sports

342
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,407
Do women with really big butts on guys

343
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,455
An often plus-sized body

344
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:50,879
Back of the champion bra lab Le Jean Lawson says the coming up with products for large breasted women was the obvious Next Step

345
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:53,695
Also required some Next Level engineering

346
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:59,071
When you're running their ground reaction forces coming up through your body that are

347
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,863
Two three times your bodyweight

348
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,911
And those impacts

349
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:05,471
Are transmitted through breast tissue

350
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:09,823
Are skeletons are pretty bony they were acting a certain way the breast

351
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,615
Is her the Scholastic

352
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,407
And can respond even

353
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,431
More

354
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,199
To the Empire

355
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:17,247
Stretch and distort out of shape

356
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:20,063
The larger the breast The more mass of the breast

357
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,111
The more impact

358
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:24,415
Can affected and create

359
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,207
Very large displacement

360
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,999
But yeah

361
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:30,559
Nice is a big factor

362
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:33,375
That was certainly proven to be true for renelle braaten

363
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:37,215
Oh I would try doubling up on sports bras

364
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,519
Shoot a hairdresser in Montana

365
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:42,335
And she been playing volleyball and running track

366
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,359
Triple d's

367
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,663
When you start getting up in the

368
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:48,479
CD double d triple D area

369
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,247
You got

370
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:52,575
You got to have a lot more going on there too

371
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,855
Containers

372
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:58,975
Give me pictures of how big triple D breasts are like do you know what they weigh for example

373
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:01,279
Oh not really

374
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:04,607
But

375
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,935
If I were looking at a triple D breast

376
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,727
You know in front of me what

377
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:10,495
Would it look like

378
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,799
So apparently you don't have triple D

379
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:19,199
I so do not know I'm a b r u r

380
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:23,295
I tell you what they can be very annoying

381
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:26,111
Because every time you want to do anything mover

382
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:28,415
You know I remember when I was playing volleyball

383
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,207
Get on the ball with

384
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,999
Florida Court

385
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:35,071
And I just stand there and let somebody else go after it because I was

386
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,351
Running after that thing

387
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:43,263
When I was Fed Up and eventually it occurred to her to just try to hack the dog brought and make it a much sturdier

388
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,287
Feat of engineering

389
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,591
That was a 1985

390
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:51,967
And I tell you the first bra that I made for myself was not pretty we just

391
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,503
We just use my

392
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:56,831
Mother's leftover fabric from different things and

393
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:01,183
But I really didn't care I didn't get that's that's the thing with me is I don't

394
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:04,511
I don't care what it looks like I just wanted to work

395
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:09,887
What were the big Innovations in in your bra what made it

396
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,167
Different from the jogger

397
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:14,239
It was more there's more fabric

398
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,055
There's less stretch

399
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:17,823
In the fabric

400
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,359
Because of you

401
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:21,151
What it what I always say if you can

402
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,199
If you can take a sports bra and

403
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,223
Stretch it out

404
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:25,759
Enough.

405
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,039
Pull it over your head

406
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,343
It's only going to stretch when it gets there

407
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:35,231
So we knew we had to do something that had a closure in it and I wanted the closer

408
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,255
In the front

409
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,303
I make it easier to get on and off

410
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,327
So

411
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,351
It looks like a vest

412
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,119
Basically

413
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:45,471
So you were able to distribute the weight a little bit through this design

414
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:51,103
But we're not why do you think large breasted women had been so ignored until this

415
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:54,943
You know I think it's probably a couple different things

416
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,503
There probably wasn't as many

417
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,551
Of us out there I think there's

418
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:00,575
The be more of us

419
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:04,415
So so you think that breasts are actually getting bigger now

420
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:07,487
Yeah I think they are I think people are getting bigger

421
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,023
Breasts are getting bigger

422
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,815
Feet are getting bigger

423
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,607
I mean if you look at an antique

424
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:15,423
Pair of shoes from way back when

425
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,959
They're tiny

426
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,519
I mean really tiny

427
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,567
Oh yeah I think people are getting bigger

428
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:27,967
Yeah well I've certainly heard that anecdotally I know it's it's not something that's really easy to quantify think of

429
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:30,527
Not really measured in your annual doctor's visit

430
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,087
And also

431
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:34,623
I think

432
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,903
When girls

433
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,439
Start to develop

434
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:42,047
If they develop like starting in junior high early High School

435
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:46,399
And they're playing sports and all the sudden they've got these boobs

436
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,423
Dinner

437
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,703
Causing problems

438
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,239
The alarm

439
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,519
What do you think is behind that

440
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,335
I don't know

441
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:59,199
And I'm not a scientist I'm just a big boob blond

442
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:03,295
Grinnell may not be a scientist but we did find a woman who actually studies

443
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,831
Hi Michelle

444
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:09,183
Can you can you press can you say your name and briefly what you do

445
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:11,999
My name is Michelle large

446
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:14,559
And I'm a senior research associate

447
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,327
And I'm

448
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,863
Department of sport and exercise science

449
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:17,631
Comparing universe

450
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:18,399
Portsmouth

451
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:21,983
We call that Michelle because we wanted to see if her nails instincts were right

452
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:25,311
In spite of all the Innovation sports bra technology

453
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:28,639
Boobs could still be causing girls to drop out of sports

454
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:31,199
Something certainly is

455
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:37,599
Yeah this is a kind of a really big issue I guess worldwide just the general participation levels in sport

456
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:40,671
And I we looked at it in school girls in the United Kingdom

457
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:44,511
And as it is about 12 % of 14 year old girls

458
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,559
Are cheating kind of exercise guidelines

459
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:51,935
I know that as a nation we're getting more obese and patting my Mastiff has the implications

460
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,727
So we need to try and combat.

461
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,519
We actually found that

462
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,055
Breasts are

463
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:01,663
One of the barriers of why these guys might be dropping out which are not reaching exercise

464
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,431
Skyline

465
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,735
Wow so what did you find in your research

466
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,039
Yeah so we find

467
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:07,807
That

468
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:09,343
Release the breast

469
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:13,183
The biggest reasons for lack of participation in essays I guess

470
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,719
Is this press pound

471
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,487
So

472
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:19,839
I'm disconnect fascist movement in breast that grows every subconscious office

473
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,631
This again it was

474
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:28,031
Changing in front of each other so in school they weren't comfortable case their breath might be closer friends

475
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,311
This was

476
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,591
Gain more prevalence

477
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:32,127
A large breasted girls

478
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:36,991
This is interesting to me I mean it's not necessarily that it was sort of a physics problem

479
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:39,807
As much as it is almost a psychological problem

480
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:42,367
Yeah definitely

481
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:45,695
In terms of the physics I mean having a good

482
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:48,255
Sports bra with no will reduce

483
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:52,607
The mount depressed mood ring high or low or any kind of

484
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,631
Activity

485
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:54,655
So we can

486
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:56,191
Easy ultrasound physics

487
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,215
Suppressed movie

488
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,263
What is the psychological

489
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:03,615
I think that they probably need education on that can cut have bigger impact Maybe

490
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:09,759
50% reported that they never wear a sports bra during Sports

491
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,295
And for auspices

492
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:15,647
One of the main educational aspects that we can kind of communal as well

493
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:18,464
If you get a good sports bra you can reduce this

494
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:19,488
Bounce

495
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:21,792
I'm doing Spartan with my dad

496
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,608
School girls engaged in sport then

497
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:26,912
Do you think there's an economic fees to this as well

498
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,192
Possibly

499
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,984
Boys I think that

500
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,080
We see a lot of good for Fresno that are not necessarily very expensive

501
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:37,408
So I think that is becoming more accessible for people to have

502
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,944
Fourth prize in general and

503
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,480
Well for me sports bras

504
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,248
Huh

505
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:45,856
This is really sort of an understanding area and looking at access to health

506
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:50,976
You know we need to get these girls in the right equipment

507
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,536
We also found that

508
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:58,912
Dakshin massive concerns about their breasts 73% reporters

509
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:01,728
I'm having one breast specific concern is bored

510
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:06,848
I thought they were looking for Education that they'd be happy to take in breast education

511
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,920
I'm with a just wasn't there in the schools for them

512
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:12,992
I think it's

513
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:17,344
As soon as a taboo subject talking about breath and we really want to make it out that this is not

514
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:18,368
A taboo

515
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:20,416
It's something we should all talk about freely

516
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,232
And that we can kind of educate them further on

517
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:28,096
It's been forty years now since the first jock bra hit the market

518
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:32,448
Annual retail sales of the sports bra or in the billions worldwide

519
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,216
Umbrella

520
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:37,824
And it's all continuing to track with a phenomenal growth of women's Athletics overall

521
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:42,176
Next 40 years will likely offer better materials

522
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:44,736
Smart bras that keep track of your vital

523
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:48,576
Ever cuter sturdier and flashier designs

524
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:55,488
And hopefully more education to make these Jr's Contraptions of Structural Engineering more accessible

525
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,512
Girls who could use them

526
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:59,328
Because girls need to run and play

527
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,096
Emu

528
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:02,144
Even if they don't want their breath

529
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,936
To move quite so much

530
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:07,520
So here's to the basement sewing session

531
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:09,568
The high-tech boob lab

532
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:12,896
The dedicated Enthusiast who made it all possible

533
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,432
From all of us

534
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:21,088
Happy 40th anniversary

535
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,880
That was for rent Williams

536
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:27,232
This story was produced by Phoebe Flanagan and edited by Peter Frank Ryan

537
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:33,632
With music by Robbie Carver and Dennis Funk the story originally aired on the outside podcast production of outside

538
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:35,168
Magazine and PRX

539
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,312
Between the beeps bongs and chatter of our devices

540
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,080
We're immersed

541
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:44,896
The cluttered World a man-made sound

542
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:45,920
If

543
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:52,320
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexa is talking to me and my wife isn't

544
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:57,952
Technology talk to us

545
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:00,256
It is a creation of Sonic trash

546
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:03,328
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

547
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:06,912
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

548
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:08,704
To make them more human

549
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,800
Turn the living room lights on

550
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:14,592
Okay

551
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:17,152
Dim the living room lights to 50%

552
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:18,944
Okay

553
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:25,344
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

554
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,648
Makes for a much more natural

555
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:28,416
Experience

556
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:30,208
