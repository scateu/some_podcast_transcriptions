This is 99% invisible

22
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:09,120
I'm Roman Mars

23
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:12,448
The best James Bond

24
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:15,008
Is either Sean Connery or Daniel Craig

25
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,800
I lean towards Daniel Craig

26
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,592
The new movies are just better

27
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:24,992
But the Sean Connery film definitely had the best of valence there's blofeld of course who's so iconic that he turned

28
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:26,784
The active cat stroking

29
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,648
Into a thing that supervillains do but bonds flashes nemesis

30
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:32,672
Has to be

31
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:33,952
Goldfinger

32
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,232
You expect me to talk

33
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,352
Do you expect me to talk

34
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,888
Yai yai

35
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,936
There's this dorky fun fact

36
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,984
That the bond villain Goldfinger

37
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,056
Was actually named after a real person

38
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,592
That's trouble

39
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,616
Original

40
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,920
The author of the James Bond books

41
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:54,944
Ian Fleming

42
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,784
Named Goldfinger for a man he found so dastardly

43
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,064
So terrible

44
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:03,136
That he immortalized him in pop culture

45
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:05,184
The real Goldfinger Was An Architect

46
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,720
Erno Goldfinger

47
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,000
Anime Giant

48
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:13,120
Hulking austere concrete buildings solace

49
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:18,240
Inhabitants claim to suffer health problems and depression from spending time inside them

50
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:22,592
Some of goldfinger's buildings were vacated because occupants found them so ugly

51
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,128
And yet many architects

52
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,408
Praise goldfinger's belt

53
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,736
Is trellick Tower which was once threatened with demolition

54
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,784
Has been awarded Landmark status

55
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,344
This device

56
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,368
This hatred

57
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,136
From the public

58
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,160
And love

59
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,696
From designers and

60
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,024
Tends to be the narrative around building

61
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,304
Like gold fingers

62
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,584
Which is to say

63
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,888
Gigantic imposing buildings

64
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,168
Made of concrete

65
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,472
What some people refer to as

66
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:50,496
Brutalist

67
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,264
Architecture

68
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,544
And a lot of folk

69
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,848
Beyond the creator of James Bond

70
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:55,616
Love

71
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:56,640
To hate them

72
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,944
We are in wurster Hall which

73
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,712
To migrate

74
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,992
This man frustration

75
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,016
Is often

76
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:02,784
Considered

77
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:07,904
The worst building on campus or wurster Hall more like worst

78
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,232
I met up with Sarah Briggs Ramsey in wurster Hall

79
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:15,328
I've realized building at UC Berkeley

80
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,608
Locking up my bike

81
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,400
Outside and I overhear undergrads

82
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,168
Walking with

83
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:19,936
Their parents

84
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,984
Ironically

85
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,008
This is the ark

86
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:25,824
Architecture school and it's the ugliest building on campus

87
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,360
Yep wurster Hall

88
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,640
Is the architecture school

89
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,432
Sarah completed her master's there

90
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,480
Buildings like this are pretty pervez

Campuses

95
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:41,696
Yeah there was a big bulky concrete building on the campus where I went to college

96
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,256
And I hated when I had to go through it

97
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:47,584
It just reminded me of a bunker or a bomb shelter

98
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,888
You think concrete buildings just like

99
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,424
Omni out

100
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:55,264
Absolutely I mean it it has these connotations

101
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,104
United soviet-era Construction

102
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,176
Sometimes third world Construction

103
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:08,576
Movies negative associations this is Professor Adrian 40 author of The excellent.

104
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:14,976
Concrete and culture he's been researching concrete for around 10 years now

105
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:19,583
Apart from aesthetic criticisms concrete buildings present environmental concern

106
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,119
Unlock these buildings

107
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:24,703
Dosage time when energy was cheap and

108
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:29,567
They use on putting with lots of energy to heat and cool them

109
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:32,895
Concrete buildings were built with the illusion of plenty

110
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:39,039
That we will always have enough energy to build and heat and cool these massive inefficient structures

111
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,319
As harsh as it looks

112
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,879
Concrete is an utterly optimistic

113
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:43,647
Building material

114
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,439
Arguably

115
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,207
To optimist

116
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:49,279
Really from the 1920s

117
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:53,119
It was seen as being the material that

118
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,655
Change the world

119
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:58,239
It had the potential to build things in a way that

120
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,519
Hadn't been seen before

121
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:02,335
Concrete was this material that seemed to boundless

122
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,639
Readily available in vast quantities

123
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:07,967
And who created massive spaces unlike any other material

124
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,527
The concrete spring up everywhere

125
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:13,599
Second most heavily consumed

126
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,135
Products in the world

127
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:18,463
The only thing we consume more of than concrete

128
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,487
Is water

129
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:24,095
We use concrete for sidewalks Bridges tunnels and highways and of course

130
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,631
Giant buildings

Or condominium or gimnasio or planetary act programs all over the world

135
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,687
Loved concrete

136
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:42,783
Particular in Soviet Russia battle simulator in Europe

137
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,575
North America

138
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:45,855
It was used

139
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:49,439
For welfare welfare state project

140
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:54,303
Concrete presented the most efficient way to hell is huge numbers of people

141
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:57,119
And philosophically it was seen as humble

142
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,143
Capable

143
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:58,911
An honest

144
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:02,239
Concrete was just out there and all of its rough Glory

145
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,287
Not hiding behind any paint or layers

146
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:07,103
Saying here I am Love Me Or Hate Me

147
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:12,223
And his concrete buildings came to signify humility honesty and integrity

148
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:15,807
They were erected all over the world as housing projects

149
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:16,831
Courthouse

150
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:17,855

Hospital

153
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:20,927
And City Hall

154
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,719
You'll stand outside

155
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,255
And a tour bus will go by and

156
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:27,071
Ladies and gentlemen voted the most ugliest

157
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,631
Building in the world Boston City Hall

158
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,655
How do you compete with

159
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,959
Chris Grimley is up against a lot

160
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:36,031
But he's trying to restore Boston City Hall

161
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,311
My name is

162
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,335
Chris Grimley

163
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,127
My

164
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:40,895

00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:42,943
Passyunk

166
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:48,063
Chris Mark and Michael have embarked on what they call the heroic project

167
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,647
Chronicling the concrete structures in and around Boston

168
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:54,975
Rather than referring to these concrete buildings as brutalist

169
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:57,023
They prefer the term heroic

170
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:59,071
Because like so many superheroes

171
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,351
These structures

172
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,911
Have the best most noble intentions

173
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,959
What are sorely misunderstood

174
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:11,103
Also just generally brutalism is a big broad label that gets used inconsistently in Ark

175
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:14,943
People tend to disagree on one precise definition

176
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,759
Any brutalism also just sounds intense

177
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:20,575
Even though it's not actually related to brutality

178
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,367
It comes from datong Brew

179
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,695
Interlock concrete

180
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,463
Heroic

181
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,743
Feels like a better term

182
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,535
Especially in Boston

183
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:33,887
We're concrete architecture swooped in and save the day you have to

184
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,423
Scituate Boston

185
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,191
In place

186
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:36,959
50 is 19

187
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:40,287
It is America's First City

188
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,055
It is

189
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,079
America's most

190
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:47,967
Historic City I think I'm not really but I get your point and yet it finds itself in the doldrums

191
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:54,367
Boston like a lot of other American cities was plagued by loss of manufacturing jobs and white flight to the suburbs

192
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:59,999
Boston had the highest property taxes in the nation and almost no development

193
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,047
There is this recognition

194
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,071
From

195
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:05,631
Civic authorities that something needs to be done

196
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:06,399
Something nice

197
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,167
To be done quickly

198
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:10,495
So Boston set an agenda to make the city great

199
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:11,775
Big

200
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,311
Soaring capable

201
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,615
Thoroughly Modern buildings made

202
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:16,639
Of course

203
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,407
How to conquer

204
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,967
I know some of these buildings were celebrated

205
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:22,015
Fathers were really not

206
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,551
What we call the third rail

207
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:25,599
Concrete modernism

208
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:28,927
City Hall in Boston City Hall was built in 1968

209
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,743
Critics were put off by this concrete Style

210
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:32,767
It was called

211
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:33,535
Alienated

212
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:34,559
Nicole

213
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:40,703
And since it was a government building this criticism became impossible to remove from polyp

214
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,775
Boston City Hall became a political Pawn

215
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:49,407
Mayors and City Council Members kept trying to win public support with promises to get rid of the building

216
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,967
Like John Tobin did when he ran for City Council

217
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,159
Modern architecture

218
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,767
And I think we can do a lot

219
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:11,167
Former mayor Thomas Menino actually started a study to really look into tearing it down

220
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,191
It turned out at the Ritz

221
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:16,031
The study that you would need something like a nuclear grade weapon basically.

222
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:16,799
Droid

223
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:20,895
I don't think it would say so heavily over built into concrete

224
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,711
And so when they couldn't tear down City Hall

225
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:25,503
Officials chose to ignore it

226
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,039
People that occupy

227
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:27,807
Building

228
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:30,111
For decades and decades didn't like it

229
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,183
Wanted to see

230
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,207
See the building go away

231
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:36,511
This is called active neglect

232
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,559
It happens with a lot of concrete building

233
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,095
They're intentionally

234
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:43,167
Unrepaired unrenovated and uncared-for

235
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:45,215
Which only makes the building more ugly

236
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,495
And then more hated

237
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:47,775
And then more than Ward

238
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,823
Increase this vicious cycle

239
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:52,383
When the public hate of Boston City Hall

240
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,407
Feeds itself

241
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,943
And then

242
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,991
Discussion years on really big

243
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:57,759
Came about

244
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,527
What the original

245
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:01,599
Not failure

246
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,367
Maintenance

247
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:06,463
When people don't these Mammoth concrete structures

248
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,511
No one really thought about maintenance

249
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,047
It seemed indestructible

250
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:12,863
In the early stages of concrete people

251
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:15,935
Assume that this was an everlasting material

252
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:19,007
But wouldn't need any attention at all

253
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,311
And that's wrong

254
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,103
We know that it does need

255
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,639
2B look soft

256
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,943
It does to Terry Wright

257
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,967
Does takai

258
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,783
But it can be hard to tell when concrete is to

259
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,343
They came to think of Breakin Timber

260
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,135
What's a guy takes place

261
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,159
Omnicef

262
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:39,231
But with concrete the

263
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,511
Deterioration

264
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,047
Is internal

265
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:45,375
Concrete deteriorates chemically from the inside out

266
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:50,239
Part of this has to do with a metal reinforcements that help hold up most concrete building

267
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,519
The rebar

268
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,543
Why can Ross

269
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,311
And the rest

270
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,359
Eats away at the overall structure

271
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,663
But Adrian 40 says

272
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,455
Tearing them down is not

273
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:02,527
Spencer your cruise as soon as you tell them down

274
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,551
Then

275
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:07,647
You have a problem Festival what you do with the picture

276
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:09,695
Black

277
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:13,791
And secondly you cup to replace them with something else

278
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:14,815
Use up

279
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:18,399
A lot more energy and creates a lot more CO2

280
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:22,495
In building something in that place already used up all that energy when they were made

281
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,775
They're already there

282
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:30,175
We can adapt these buildings to make them Greener and make them more appealing places to be by any windows for example

283
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,455
The basically

284
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:37,855
Professor 40 thinks we can all develop the capacity to love these concrete boots in all their home

285
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,623
Glory

286
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:42,463
Show people blunt

287
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,511
But you know as well

288
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,279
Any

289
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,071
Form with her it's

290
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,607
Uproar

291
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,679
Pain sitting or glitch

292
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,727
The more you know about it

293
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,007
The more you

294
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:57,567
Get out of it the more you'll appreciate it

295
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,407
And this is especially true of concrete building

296
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:07,807
Architecture students appreciate them because they know that concrete actually requires a hell of a lot

297
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,111
Skill and finesse to work with

298
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:13,695
To do architecture in concrete

299
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,719
Is

300
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:18,303
Proof you are really are an architect

301
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,095
It's the test being a naughty

302
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:25,727
But a concrete building every little detail needs to be calculated in advance

303
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:29,055
Concrete is wildly intimidating to work with

304
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,335
One support

305
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,359
There's No Going Back

306
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:36,479
With a concrete building it's like the result of an Immaculate Conception

307
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:39,039
The whole thing is

308
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:41,855
An integral monolithic hole

309
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:44,159
It has to be right

310
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,975
And aside from the interesting design challenge

311
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:47,999
Deposes

312
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:51,839
Concrete itself as a material can be subtly beautiful

313
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,631
If you look close

314
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,167
You know what we think of is

315
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,191
Adjusting monolith

316
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:57,727
Homogeneous

317
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,263
Pictures actually

318
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,287
Really rich

319
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,055
Action

320
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,079
Has a lot of

321
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:09,759
Sarah Briggs Ramsey the one I spoke with at Berkeley's wurster Hall did a year-long project

322
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,295
Traveling around the world

323
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:15,903
Looking at concrete buildings in Europe and Asia and South and North America

324
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:18,207
To create a global comparison of

325
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,511
One material that I think is so

326
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,815
Assertive under considered

327
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,655
It's like the background of all the cities but no one asked

328
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,679
Samsung

329
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,471
Luck we call the city

330
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,495
A Concrete Jungle

331
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,287
To talk about the artificialness

332
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,311
The urban landscape

333
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:38,175
But concrete can actually be a very natural expression of the environment

334
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,479
Concrete color and texture

335
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:44,575
Can be dictated by local climate local Earth and local rock

336
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:45,855
The Harvard

337
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:46,879
Game Center

338
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:47,903
On the Harbor

339
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:48,927
End

340
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,207
It's got a grape

341
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:50,975
Tripoli

342
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,255
Really pronounce

343
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,791
Purple color and

344
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,071
That's the ground

345
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,095
From the site

346
00:13:56,351 --> 00:14:01,983
Concrete can also be an expression of local style and custom UK concrete has big

347
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,775
Thick textured chunks of Rock

348
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,311
All Japanese kanji

349
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,847
Is very fine

350
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:10,687
But the beauty of concrete architecture is

351
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:15,039
When you can just observe the building like pieces of sculpture

352
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,599
Without actually having to live and work in them

353
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:20,671
Springs in concrete surprising Ally

354
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,207
Photography

355
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:24,255
Concrete looks good in Facebook

356
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,071
We provide this kind of neutral background

357
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,655
It provides a wonderful setting for

358
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,679
Peoples

359
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,215
Skin tones

360
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,263
Color of their clothes

361
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:41,407
Fashion photographers realized this first and then pockets of the internet started to appreciate these concrete building

362
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,943
There are lots of

363
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:44,991
Blogs

364
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,295
Sure

365
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:53,439
Kind of extraordinary enthusiasm for concrete photography is allowing a new audience of non architects

366
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:56,255
Appreciate these buildings for their strong lines

367
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,791
The crystal shadow

368
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:58,559
And

369
00:14:59,071 --> 00:14:59,839
Increasingly

370
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,375
The idealism and body

371
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,423
They represent

372
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,495
Ideas about

373
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:13,407
Taste of the wild salmon what the future has imagined to be that we want to preserve

374
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,431
You should remember what

375
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,711
People were thinking

376
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,735
50s guy

377
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:19,295
Retirees buildings down werewolf

378
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,319
Lose all the fat

379
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:23,135
Architecture whether we want to admit it or not

380
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,671
As a sort of shellfish

381
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:27,999
A time after which buildings fall out of fashion

382
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:30,303
And then are allowed to fall apart

383
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:33,631
Back in the 1960s victorian-style building

384
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,911
Things were considered hideous

385
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,191
Falling apart

386
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,471
Impossible to repair

387
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,775
And we were tearing batches of them down

388
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,823
All the while erecting big

389
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,847
Concrete building

390
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:46,687
Victorians were saved that today

391
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:49,759
They are these beautiful lovingly restored

392
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,527
Treasures

393
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,575
Brutalist heroic

394
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,599
Whatever you want to call it

395
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:58,207
Concrete architecture now finds itself at a potential inflection point

396
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:00,767
Too outdated to be modern

397
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,815
Too young to be classic

398
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:07,679
Context architecture enthusiasts and preservation us

399
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:10,239

It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

429
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:55,199
Makes for a much more natural experience

430
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,247
