1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:01,792
This is 99% invisible

2
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:03,072
I'm Roman Mars

3
00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:09,472
In the shadow of Silicon Valley San Francisco is home to a futuristic Eatery with a virtual cashier putting change

4
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:10,752
On the menu

5
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:12,800
It was a new restaurant

6
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:15,872
But opened a few years back in downtown San Francisco

7
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:16,896
It was called

8
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:17,664
Itza

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,992
Pizza a high-tech new restaurant where you order on iPad

10
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:22,528
And get your quinoa bowls out of

11
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:25,856
A cubby and instead of placing an order with a waiter or

12
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:27,136
Someone behind the counter

13
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:29,952
You punch in your order on a screen

14
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:37,120
Why do you swipe your car

15
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:39,680
And then a few minutes later you would walk to a wall

16
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:41,472
Clear glass cubbies

17
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:47,616
Go dark for just a second so you don't see the actual food being placed in the cubby and then when the food was placed

18
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:49,920
The cubby woodglo with your name

19
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:51,456
You tap the glass twice

20
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:54,272
And you could open the cubby and your food order was in there

21
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:55,040
Waiting for you

22
00:00:55,552 --> 00:01:00,672
You tap it you get your food and you leave the fact that you can just order on the iPad pick it up

23
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:03,488
It's really about the most productive way you can get lunch

24
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:07,840
You never had to interact with a single person if you didn't want to he didn't have to tip

25
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:08,864
It was fast.

26
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:09,888
Hop in

27
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:11,424
Grandpa custom made

28
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,448
Quinoa Bowl

29
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,984
And then go back to work

30
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,776
Without even pausing your pocket

31
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:17,568
And I

32
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,848
Hated it

33
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:20,384
So much

34
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:21,920
Producer Avery trial

35
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:25,248
As soon as I heard about Eatza I was like okay

36
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:26,016
Great

37
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,040
Just what we need

38
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,576
To be even more removed

39
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:29,344
From our food

40
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,904
Not only where it comes from but also

41
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,184
The person who handed to you

42
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:36,000
Cuz it's not like it's a completely Robot Restaurant

43
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,280
Little people back there

44
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,304
Find the Cubbies

45
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,840
Weisinger avocados

46
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:43,936
Conveniently placed out of sight so that you don't have to say thank you

47
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:46,752
But you never

48
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:47,776
Actually tried

49
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:50,080
Okay no I never went

50
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,360
So take it with a

51
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,128
Big fat

52
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,152
Salt

53
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:55,968
And also know that I hated it be

54
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:58,016
Because it was very fun to hate

55
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,296
Is like

56
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:02,368
Juicers that connect to your phone with Bluetooth

57
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,416
You know just like stuff that is so

58
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:07,232
Completely Lampoon Ubly San Francisco

59
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:11,072
And so I did what I always do when I'm upset about a stupid thing

60
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,608
I tweeted about it

61
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,144
Instead of getting in a fight

62
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,192
A number of people on Twitter pointed out that

63
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:16,960
This restaurant

64
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:20,032
Is not a distinctly modern phenomenon

65
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:23,104
Something very similar existed at the turn of the century

66
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,640
Over 100 years ago

67
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,688
It was not a San Francisco thing

68
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,968
It was very

69
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:28,992
New York

70
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,784
I grew up in the city

71
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,344
And the city that I grew up in

72
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,904
And the city I'm living in now

73
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,440
Ain't never met each other

74
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:41,280
This is one of the New Yorkie is people I have ever met

75
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,560
Lorraine.

76
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:44,096
Well I write about New York history

77
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:44,864
So I'm always

78
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,632
Fishing around

79
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,424
Something that I want to write about

80
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,960
My grandmother lived on 40s

81
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:55,616
King Street and 8th Avenue I used to meet her under the clock of the Franklin Savings Bank

82
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,152
Saturday afternoon

83
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,712
We will go to Horn & hardart

84
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:03,808
Ask anyone who the kid in New York in 50s or 60s

85
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,600
They went to Horn & hardart

86
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:08,928
What's a popular restaurant chain that was in many ways

87
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:15,328
The Itza of the twentieth century it had locations all over New York City and Philadelphia

88
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:19,936
It had very solid standard fare with literal meat and potatoes

89
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:23,264
What's your favorite dish

90
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:27,104
And when the rain decided that you wanted to write about Horn & hardart

91
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,152
She got connected with Marianne

92
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,176
People don't always

93
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:34,272
Connect my last name with horn & hardart but when they do immediately

94
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:35,040
Play Store

95
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,832

00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:40,160
The great-granddaughter of Horn & hardart co-founder Frank

97
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:40,928
Har.

98
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:47,328
Together Marriott heart art and Lorraine deal teamed up to write the definitive history of this restaurant chain

99
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:53,728
Puppies to live near each other on the Upper East Side and they get along like a house on fire emails

100
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,264
Yeah

101
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:00,384
But Horn & hardart restaurants also went by another name

102
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,920
How much more famous name

103
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,456
The automat

104
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,736
What's the automat

105
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:08,576
It was the first time that you could go up

106
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:09,856
To a wall

107
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,136
Put money in

108
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:11,904
And get food

109
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,672
Hotworx

110
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,208
Fresh

111
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:14,976
Prepared

112
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,327
Inside a horn & hardart automat it look like a glamorous

113
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,119
Ornate cafeteria

114
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:25,215
But instead of human handing you hot food over a steaming counter

115
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:28,031
You put your tray up to a wall of little glass

116
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:28,799
Cubbies

117
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:32,639
Beach Housing a fresh hot portion of food on a small plate

118
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,687
Maybe it would be a side of keys

119
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:37,247
Maybe a turkey sandwich or slice of pie

120
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,783
Nichols

121
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,831
And the door that kobe would unlock

122
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:41,855
And you could just take

123
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,135
The plate that was inside

124
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,671
That food was yours

125
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,207
This place where you can

126
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:49,279
He put money in the squad and pick your own food so for children

127
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,047
You know

00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:55,679
The parents would give him some money they would run up to the windows I can pick what they wanted they could put the nickel in and get their own food

129
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,703
It was a Realty

130
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,007
By the way I hit the Beast

131
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:04,127
And it was pretty good

132
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:05,919
UC automatic

133
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,199
In a ton of movies

134
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:11,295
Ranging from silent films like the early bird in 1925

135
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,087
To Whit stillman's Metropolitan

136
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,111
In 1990

137
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,951
Cake

138
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,767
Seeing a character in automatic

139
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:23,327
Told you there's a certain kind of American

140
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,119
One wants to go out to eat

141
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,399
Don't have the budget

142
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,679
My dear

143
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,215
She has no background

144
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:33,311
What's in this short from 1932

145
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,895
Opens with a group of people in Fancy

146
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:39,711
Dining like Royals

147
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,503
Then the camera zooms out

148
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,319
And womp womp

149
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:51,487
And this is also a punchline when Marilyn Monroe sings Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend

150
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,327
I help you

151
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:56,863
Audiomack

152
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:00,959
And none of these movies explain what the automat is

153
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:01,983
It's just assumed

154
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,263
That everyone knew

155
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,359
The Broadway columns in the newspapers to talk about

156
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:09,151
Who is singing at the automat

157
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:12,479
Gene Kelly when he was doing Pal Joey on Broadway

158
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:17,343
He and his wife will go over there and Gregory Peck would love their scrambled eggs or something

159
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,671
Count and Countess is coming in from Europe

160
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,207
We've got to try this

161
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:25,023
And they would sit down next to people who are flat broke

162
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,303
And you didn't have to tip

163
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,327
No

164
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,095
Wish

165
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,375
It's kind of like pizza

166
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,679
And that was the automat

167
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,703
100 +

168
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,471
10 years ago

169
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:38,847
The story of the automat started when Joe horn net Frank Hardy

170
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,919
Joey put an ad in a local Philadelphia paper

171
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,455
Seeking a business partner

172
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:48,063
And so they got together and they opened a luncheonette in Philadelphia

173
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,599
1888

174
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:50,623
1888

175
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:51,647
Over to you

176
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:54,463
None of that sits just add in the year 1888

177
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:56,767
And for a while it was just a normal Luncheonette

178
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,559
With famously good coffee

179
00:06:59,071 --> 00:06:59,839
Until

180
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,119
Frank hardart

181
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,423

00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,215
Right he was going to give himself a vacation

Their heart art encounter it's very early German vending machine technology

184
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,895
Bought one of these machines and brought it back to Philly

185
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,175
It was more

186
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:16,223
Rube Goldberg contraption

187
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:23,135
Rube Goldberg what does overly complicated German bending contraption

188
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,439
The food in the windows was a sample to

189
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,231
Display of what one could order

190
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,023
Customers with deposit coins

191
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,583
And wait around while someone in the basement

192
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,351
Cooked it

193
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,399
And then cranked it up in a dumbwaiter

194
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,423
It was a very

195
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:40,287
Convoluted way of getting your food but everyone loved the novelty of it

196
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:44,895
So they perfected it and then they brought it to New York City

197
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,967
About 10 years later

198
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,295
It was in Philadelphia the first automatic knife

199
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,831
Go to and then they came

200
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,879
New York City in 1912

201
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:55,647
And now

202
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,927
Equipped with a glass cubbies

203
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,487
Fast

204
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,047
But not because of a technology

205
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,607
I was just to get people in the door

206
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:07,423
The automat part was just as glorious gimmick

207
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,959
People came for the novelty

208
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:12,287
But came back again and again because it was solid

209
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,055
Good food

210
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:13,823
Good and cheap

211
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,359
The technology was

212
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,383
Custom Mechanical Turk

213
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,199
The only thing that was automatic was when you went in there and look

214
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:22,527
Look at this wall but what was going on behind those walls is very different

215
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:29,183
Behind the scenes there were people screwing around replacing all the food laws were scores of

216
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,487
Workers Mini Boom

217
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:34,303
Rapidly replenishing the food into the Cubbies

218
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,863
Starting out to bust and clean dishware

219
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:41,215
And is automatic expanded to more locations in both Philadelphia and New York

220
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,007
All the cooking itself

221
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:45,311
Happened in offside commentaries

222
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:48,895
These were separate kitchen and I took up a whole city block

223
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:54,271
There's one giant Central commissary in New York Giants Central commissary in Philly

224
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,111
Sauces in pies but a hundred

225
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:01,951
Which dispatched hot and fresh to automats throughout the day

226
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:05,791
Food for the New York locations with slightly different than Phillies

227
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:08,351
Through little Regional variations

228
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:14,751
For mac and cheese I think one had diced tomatoes and in the other one didn't you know there were some things like that like things spicy

229
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:17,055
Is a little bit sharper

230
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:21,919
The New York State star people are sharper their food

231
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,199
Burberry United

232
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,223
And how they look

233
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,759
Joe horn

234
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:29,855
And Frank hearted made it their business to make sure that when you walked into these

235
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:30,623
These places

236
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:34,975
They were really quite lovely and some of them witches Art Deco Palace

237
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:35,999
If they were beautiful

238
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:39,583
And that to me is a generosity of spirit

239
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,631
Because they know they're not getting

240
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:45,983
You're not getting the Carriage Trade coming in every day and on and ass

241
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,007
Asking for the wine list

242
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,567
There are those rare brands that appeal

243
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,847
La Crosse economic class

244
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,895
Ikea and Target

245
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,175
Horn & hardart

246
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:54,943
Was one of them

247
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,223
The automat

248
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:56,991
With a place

249
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,527
Anyone could eat

250
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,855
In a time when it was nearly unheard of for a woman to go out to

251
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:02,623
Eat Alone

252
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:03,647
Work from

253
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,671
People who just post up

254
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,695
Somewhere all day

255
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,231
And with the automatic

256
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,255
They could

257
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,791
Without Shame

258
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,839
And people who were just

259
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,887
Saving Face or saving shoe leather

260
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,423
Looking for jobs

261
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,471
Would be in their nursing a couple

262
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,775
Coffee all day and no one bothered them

263
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:22,847
We didn't even know that people would eat that way and then as soon as they could

264
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:26,687
They never could eat as much or as little as I could

265
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:29,503
Do they have total autonomy I just want a cup of coffee

266
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,039
I'd I really just want

267
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,319
5 pieces of dessert

268
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:35,391
I want this I want that and you didn't

269
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,695
I have to deal with what you should be ordering

270
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,463
How to order

271
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,231
And it could be

272
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,767
Kwik kopy leisurely

273
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:41,791
Use the boss

274
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,071
And be

275
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,119
Because everyone ate there

276
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,655
That's how they could keep it

277
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,423
It's so cheap

278
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,215
It was all economies of

279
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:49,983
Scale

280
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,775
That's how they made so much food

281
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,543
So fresh

282
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,823
And so affordable

283
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,359
It was all

284
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,127
Volume

285
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,919
Before McDonald's

286
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:04,063
Horn & hardart was the largest restaurant chain in America and one of the largest in the world this is Lisa hurwitz

287
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,879
Filmmaker working on a documentary about the automat

288
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,159
And by

289
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:08,927
Largest

290
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,463
I'm talking about volume

291
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,511
Just stopped

292
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:13,791
Somehow

293
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,327
Everyone knew about the automat

294
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,399
Marilyn Monroe was singing about it was in a ton of movies

295
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:21,983
Horn & hardart said more people than any other restaurant in the United States

296
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,287
And it was only in Two Cities

297
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,311
New York

298
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,335
In Philadelphia

299
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:31,455
For a lot of people they never could have imagined that horn & hardart was ever going to disa

300
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,759
The pr because it was such a big part of the fabric

301
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,039
Bank of New York City

302
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,319
Philadelphia

303
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,903
Today I can't ever imagine Starbucks

304
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,439
Hearing but it could

305
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,463
One day

306
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,487
You never know

307
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:48,863
I think maybe Horn & hardart got a little too comfortable and they couldn't imagine what was about to happen

308
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,911
What happened to the automat

309
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,959
Was the story of the American city

310
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,775
White flight and mass migration to the suburbs

311
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:58,591
American new homes with new cars

312
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,871
A new lifestyle

313
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,407
And of course

314
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,199
This changed how people ate

315
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:08,575
It became very trendy for women to be stay-at-home mothers

316
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,367
Taking care of new homes

317
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,159
Using their new kitchens

318
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,439
Taking care of the family

319
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,463
And

320
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,487
Batman

321
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,767
Les eating out

322
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,815
Sowell automatic used

323
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:21,375
Seven-day-a-week three-meal-a-day operation

324
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:24,447
They transformed into 5-day week

325
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,727
One meal a day off

326
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:30,591
And the people who went out to eat for that one meal didn't want

327
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,127
Send steaks anymore

328
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,687
You're on the go now there was fast food

329
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:35,967
Do you want to sit

330
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:40,319
You wanted white tablecloths and attentive waiter is in fancier food

331
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,855
Good that you couldn't cook at home

332
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,647
People have more money to spend

333
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:46,719
They were more inclined to have maybe fewer meals out

334
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,743
But to have nicer

335
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,071
Horn & Hardart's we're getting old

336
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,607
I'm looking kind of bedraggled

337
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:59,519
Customers and City governments were investing less and less in the increasingly neglected inner cities around

338
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,055
And so

339
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,847
Horn & hardart launches their big

340
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,383
Comeback ad campaign

341
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,663
In which

342
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,223
They dig in their heels and refuse to change it all

343
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:11,295
If you want something nice to look at when you eat at Horn & hardart

344
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,367
We suggest you keep an eye on your plate

345
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:18,207
The campaign was called it's not fancy but it's good

346
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,767
Although eventually it wasn't even that good

347
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:23,327
Horn & hardart got less popular

348
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,631
The food turnover wasn't as high

349
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,935
So it wasn't as fresh

350
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:30,495
There was something going on simultaneous

351
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,287
FYE which was that

352
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,823
The horns in the heart

353
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,615
We're being pushed out of the company

354
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:39,199
And the new people who weren't automat people they were fast food

355
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:44,319
The new heads of Horn & hardart realize that their greatest asset was not their restaurants

356
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,599
Buckeye real estate

357
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:49,951
So the really prime horn & hardart locations were franchised in too fast

358
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:50,719
Food restaurant

359
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:51,999
They were

360
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:52,767
The first

361
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:56,095
Burger King Arby's franchises in Manhattan

362
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:59,167
The automat lasted the better part of a century

363
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,703
Which is pretty incredible

364
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,775
Bless automat in New York

365
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:04,799
Triathlon

366
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,079
He much is a gimmick

367
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,103
Finally close

368
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,383
In 1991

369
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,687
I will admit that where I felt

370
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,223
Only disdain for

371
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:15,295
I was totally taken in by the idea of the automat

372
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,831
Like 100%

373
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:21,951
Sign me up for this place that is both highbrow and lowbrow or I can even a beautiful Art Deco dining room

374
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,999
As many slices of pie as I want without judgment

375
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,839
Enter some of that is just baseless nostalgia

376
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,375
And a genuine love of art deco

377
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:30,911
But

378
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:33,727
I think there's a reason Horn & hardart was in business

379
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,519
A hundred years

380
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:36,799
I think it's

381
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,847
Because it was always a very Human Experience

382
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,407
It wasn't to go container

383
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,199
It was metal flatware and

384
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:43,967
China

385
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,271
Customer stayed in the dining room to eat

386
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,575
It was always full of people hanging out

387
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:53,695
An ultimately humans seem to Crave some kind of interaction when they go out to eat

388
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,231
Even today

389
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:59,583
People aren't necessarily looking for an all robot kind of experience

390
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,887
Me when they walk in they want it to be

391
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:04,191
Easy and convenient and they want to

392
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:07,775
If they have an issue be able to communicate to someone who can take care of them

393
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,311
This is Gwyneth Borden

394
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:12,383
Executive director of the Golden Gate Restaurant Association

395
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,223
Which is the trade Association for the restaurants in the San Francisco Bay Area

396
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:20,575
2015 was the first year in the u.s. when the Department of Commerce was tracking it

397
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,879
People spend more money on dining out food then groceries

398
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,671
And increasingly what we have

399
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,951
Scene is food is

400
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,743
The modern form of entertainment

401
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,279
Demand for restaurants

402
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:32,607
Up which means there's a national shortage of restaurant workers

403
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:36,191
Especially in expensive cities like San Francisco

404
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:40,799
With the median cost of a one-bedroom apartment is now $3,700 a month

405
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:43,359
How do you pay for that while working in a restaurant

406
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,151
Labor costs overall risen

407
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:47,455
It's hard to find people to work in farming

408
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,991
Are the people working restaurants

409
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,271
Do you have to pay people more

410
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,087
The restaurant have been trying to get by with fewer people

411
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:56,159
With self ordering screens or counter service

412
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,695
Free describe a number for your table

413
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,999
But this can be taken too far

414
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:04,095
What we know for fact is that people will eat it on mediocre restaurant

415
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:06,143
For food but won't accept bad service

416
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:09,215
If you look at Yelp or TripAdvisor or whatever

417
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:11,007
UCM people's reviews that

418
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:13,311
Service is a really important factor

419
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,359
You know in General yet people write things about

420
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,639
Attitude not being great

421
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,943
But it was usually drives them to

422
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,711
To do that

423
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,479
That is

424
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:22,527
A bad experience where they feel like they were not

425
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:26,111
So rather than hiding the workers in the back

426
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,647
Automating the front of the house

427
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,439
Like Itza or the automat

428
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:32,511
The new automated restaurants are trying to flip it

429
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:36,351
They want the food to be served entirely by humans

430
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,375
But it's cooked

431
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,399
By robots

432
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:41,215
I went to one of these places in San Francisco

433
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,775
It's a robot burger restaurant called creator

434
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:47,359
But where people greet you and guide you through the menu

435
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,639
And place your order for you

436
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,431
Went down and drink

437
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,807
And then clear glass robots

438
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,855
Assemble your burger and under 5 minutes

439
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:01,183
But then a human called out your name and hand your order to you

440
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,999
And the secret power of this restaurant

441
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:06,047
It's not a central commissary kitchen

442
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,887
It's the 40 some-odd engineer's working in the office next door

443
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,423
Because whether they automate

444
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,447
The front or the back

445
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:15,007
These businesses are not just selling food

446
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,567
They are selling their technology

447
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,383
And that's true for Itza

448
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,431
They gone from selling quinoa Bowl

449
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,223
Selling their service

450
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:28,319
There two locations in San Francisco are now shuttered

451
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:30,367
With no signs of when the open again

452
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,927
Either wouldn't go on record for an interview

453
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:38,815
But their PR representative told me that now Itza is focus on selling their serving technology to other chains

454
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:41,375
Macaroni and cheese restaurant called Mac

455
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,679
Another chain called Wow Bao

456
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,983
Even at McDonald

457
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,287
It's pretty common to order on a screen

458
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:54,943
And salad making robot named Sally is mean put in a restaurant chain based in Louisiana Mississippi

459
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:55,711
In Alabama

460
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:58,271
Their new iterations of vending machines

461
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,319
Faceless delivery in robot chef

462
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,087
Popping up

463
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,111
Everywhere

464
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,391
The point is

465
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,159
Yes

466
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,695
Horn & hardart restaurants

467
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,463
Argon

468
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:08,767
But more and more chains

469
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:09,791
Are becoming

470
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:10,559
Automatic

471
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,383
Special thanks to Bro flag David Bordeaux and a moon announcer

472
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,407
On Ira Goldman

473
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,503
You can find out more about Lisa hurwitz documentary and share your automatic memories

474
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,807
Facebook.com

475
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:36,927
The automat the movie

476
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:44,607
Coming up

477
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:46,399
Robots that throw food

478
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:48,447
All in an effort to make that food

479
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,727
Seymour delicious

480
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,263
After that

481
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:57,663
When we were editing the story about the automatic brought to mind another story about robots

482
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,711
What's in food that we did a couple of years back

483
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,991
That I love because

484
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,271
It may be the most

485
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:08,415
Perfect example of the 99% invisible effort that goes into something that most people do not think about

486
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:13,023
But it totally changed the way we buy and consume food

487
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:18,143
Lemons are squeezing

488
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:24,543
Cabal the ads you see on TV or on billboards are on the sides of buses

489
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,847
It's an overwhelming number seem to be

490
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,127
Far food

491
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,151
This

492
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:29,919
He's our man

493
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,711
Bulls head

494
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,479
Google turkey

495
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:35,807
Egg and sausage pancakes

496
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,879
Morning I see coax in frosted glasses

497
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:41,183
Fajitas sizzling on the grill

498
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:48,863
A guy biting into the perfect hamburger on a sesame seed bun

499
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,167
Ingredients

500
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:55,263
Of course you know in real life

501
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:58,079
These Foods don't look like they do in the ass

502
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,943
Winter with a question from Isabelle Ave from Toronto Ontario

503
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:07,295
She asked why does your food look different in the advertising and then what's in the store

504
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:09,599
The great question Isabel we get off that a lot

505
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,647
And if you want to come with me

506
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:14,207
I'm going to take you across the street we're going to find out a bit more

507
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:19,327
In 2012 McDonald's Canada put out this video about the process they go through

508
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,119
Photograph one of their burgers

509
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,703
Let me introduce you now to Noah

510
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,471
Food stylist

511
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:28,799
I think it's important to note that all the ingredients

512
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,359
No uses are the exact same ingredients

513
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:39,551
The video follows food stylist Noah as he painstakingly selects the perfect slices of us

514
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:43,391
Onion and pickle pee places them on the burger with tweezers

515
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:45,183
And then precisely melt

516
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,463
The cheese just

517
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,231
So

518
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:49,023
Tell them Jack melting down

519
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:54,911
Then he picks up a plastic syringe filled with ketchup and a Plaza

520
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,703
With surgical precision

521
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,471
Maybe I'll put

522
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,263
Mustard ketchup

523
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:01,055
Actually ketchup mustard

524
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:06,431
Then they photograph this fancy burger and Photoshop at 2 perfect

525
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:13,599
They place a picture of a real burger just ordered at McDonald's

526
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:15,391
Next to the image of this

527
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,416
Stylized Burger

528
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:17,696
And the difference

529
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,720
Is striking

530
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:21,024
That's reporter Danny Lewis

531
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,096
I would like to eat the burger that Noah styled and assembled

532
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,888
The other one not so much

533
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,008
The last hundred years or so of food advertising have been shaped by this one simple

534
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,568
Real food looks bad

535
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,336
On camera

536
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:39,456
Shooting food and even photographing food is always been fiendishly difficult in that

537
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:41,760
This is Terry O'Reilly

538
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:42,528
Predict it

539
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,808
He was an ad man

540
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:46,368
And he now hosts a radio show about advertise

541
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,904
Called under the influence

542
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:51,488
Terry says the challenges of shooting food are obvious

543
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,584
First of all food is boring to look at when it's just sitting on a plane

544
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,632
Because food is he generally static

545
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:59,936
Then when you subjected to the Hot Lights of a

546
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:01,984
EStudio de food starts to wilt

547
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,288
It's just simple science

548
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:09,920
And so advertisers have had to constantly want that's fine line between enhancement and fakery

549
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,968
Trying all kinds of tricks

550
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:14,016
To get food to look good

551
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:16,320
For the first half of the 20th century

552
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:19,136
Well after photography it was widely adopted

553
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:23,488
Advertisers in magazines and newspapers relied heavily on illustration

554
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:25,024
The reason illustration

555
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,120
What's the preferred method was because you can completely control an illustration

556
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:33,472
Another word just know lighting issues there's no wilting food issues

557
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:36,288
A marketer could really completely dick

558
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:40,640
Tate what that food would look like right down to the to the strand of pasta

559
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,664
With an illustrate

560
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,736
Then TV came along in the 1950s and 60s

561
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:48,064
And advertisers face a whole new set of challenges

562
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,160
I'm going to show you how McDonald's deals at a Big Mac sandwich

563
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:56,256
A lot of them didn't really understand how to shoot food in a compelling way

564
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:58,304
In this add the hamburger just

565
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,840
Since they're on the counter

566
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,888
All the ingredients get piled on

567
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:05,216
It starts here with a lightly Toasted Bun

568
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:09,056
And then a pure beef hamburger

569
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:10,848
Sizzling hot

570
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:12,384
Without compelling visuals

571
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,920
There ought to be a voice over

572
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:16,736
Just describing the hell out of the food

573
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:20,576
Listing ingredients telling you how good it tasted

574
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:23,136
A little more sauce just for good flavor

575
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,208
Dill pickles

576
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:28,512
And the sesame seed crown

577
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:32,352
These early tv ads relied on relatively static shots

578
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:36,192
Advertisers would use a wide-angle lens mounted on a camera

579
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:39,264
A little but that's about it

580
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,312
There were lots of shots of boxes

581
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,360
The food did

582
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:46,432
Just normal food stuff you might see

583
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:51,040
Something being ladled out of a pot you might see you know a spoon

584
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:55,648
Serving peas at a dinner table or serving cream corn at a dinner table

585
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:57,440
So that would be the extent of the most

586
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,000
On top of the new challenges of television

587
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:06,400
Food advertisers in the late 60s found themselves facing new scrutiny the Federal Trade Commission with keeping a close eye

588
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,424
Ion TV app

589
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,752
Campbell Soup incident

590
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:18,176
68 they were introducing a new brand of suit that a lot of vegetables in it but the problem is the vegetable sink to the bar

591
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:19,968
So what they did was

592
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,296
Put a bunch of marbles in the bottom of the balls

593
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:25,088
Just too high.

594
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:25,856
The

595
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:29,952
When you have TC found out they threaten Campbell's with legal Act

596
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,280
Event led to a new push for truth in advertising

597
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:37,888
A lot of the old tricks advertisers had relied on in the past where now off

598
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:40,192
The table no more using glue

599
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,984
Milk and cereal ads

600
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,776
No more substituting mashed

601
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:44,800
Potatoes fries

602
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,360
But in the 1970s

603
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:49,664
Food advertising took a radical

604
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:52,224
Started

605
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:56,576
Open the door

606
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:59,136
Shrimp executing acrobatic flips

607
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:01,952
Lobster claws cracking open in slow motion

608
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:04,256
French fries bouncing across a table

609
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:06,048
Wasn't static anymore

610
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:08,096
Food was flying

611
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,656
And we've got one man to thank for the

612
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:11,424
Is new aesthetic

613
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:12,704
Albert Beauty

614
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:14,240
You didn't want any

615
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,568
Everything was always smooth

616
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,872
He wanted to

617
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:21,152
Romance

618
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,432
The food

619
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,480
Or whatever was in front of

620
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:28,576
This is Harry Drennan who spent years working for Elbert beaudin

621
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:30,112
That's how he met his wife

622
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:31,648
Set director Jackie Chan

623
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,464
I've been in the film business for

624
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:37,792
35 years 40 I don't want to say hello

625
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:42,656
The ads that can't until his death in 1996

626
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,936
Where unprecedented

627
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:50,592
Working with clients like McDonald's Burger King and Coca-Cola invented

628
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:51,360
Food commercials

629
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:54,944
Sandra Lee Pioneer the genre of advertising known

630
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,224
As table top

631
00:25:56,992 --> 00:26:01,600
Many of the terms and techniques that table top directors still use date back to Buda

632
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:02,624
For example

633
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,648
The prep shot

634
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,696
Which tells the backstory of the Prada

635
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:08,512
Showing all that goes into making the food

636
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:09,536
You know the ones

637
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:11,584
Chopping a crisp out of lettuce

638
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,632
Dicing some juicy red tomatoes

639
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,656
He would make these

640
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:17,472
Elaborate banquet things

641
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,264
Raw ingredients

642
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:20,800
That was his look

643
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:22,592
And creative shots

644
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:28,992
That's when the camera zooms way in and lingers on some tantalizing bite of food on the end of a fork

645
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,832
Sexy and you know it's almost foodporn you know it's

646
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:35,136
Made it all real tactel to you

647
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,928
And the hero shot

648
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,488
The last magnificent look at the food

649
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:41,536
On the plate ready to eat

650
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:44,864
Usually in the final seconds of the advertising

651
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:50,496
Buchanan's big breakthrough was that he didn't just describe the food and promised viewers it tasted

652
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:53,056
He made them feel actual

653
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,336
Hunger with his image

654
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:59,456
His real thing is just food in itself its Essence is really sensual

655
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,480
You know what I mean

656
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:04,832
Juicy Hamburger commercial

657
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:05,600
Point of it

658
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:07,392
And I think that's what he introduced

659
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:10,208
And you'll never see it any other way now

660
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,376
Kendall and Drennan remember working long days and

661
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,656
Sometimes the long night

662
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,448
To meet budenz hi-standard

663
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:22,752
And to achieve his vision of flying food

664
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,032
Mouth watering clothes

665
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:26,592
They had to use a whole bunch of

666
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,616
Crazy tool

667
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:33,504
Like giant high-speed cameras that was burned through 1000 feet of film in seconds and then

668
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,576
They start shooting as it was like

669
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:39,904
Justice

670
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:45,280
All day long it was something

671
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:49,376
It was used for the ballistics but we were the first ones to do it with

672
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:52,448
Food thanks to these cameras beaudin could achieve

673
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,240
Super slow motion effect

674
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:56,544
You take a split second of time

675
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,080
And luxuriate in it

676
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:01,152
He'd have oranges Splash through a sheet of water

677
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:04,480
Condensation would drip down the side of a bottle

678
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:06,528
In order to get the perfect egg

679
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:08,576
Duden started designing strange

680
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:11,648
Rube Goldberg soda machines to help him get the job done

681
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:13,696
These Contraptions were called rigs

682
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:19,072
They range from simple spouts for liquid to machines that would drop pancakes into a perfect stacked

683
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,096
The catapults that would

684
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:21,888
Languages across the studio

685
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,240
And sure the production team could have just thrown The Oranges by hand

686
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:27,776
But with a rig

687
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,568
They could get the exact

688
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,336
Same results

689
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,360
Over and over

690
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,896
Which meant fewer takes

691
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:35,456
Which meant less time and less money spell

692
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:40,064
Also meant that they could achieve a certain level of precision and artistry

693
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:42,880
It was so much prettier than other people

694
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:43,648
It's work is

695
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:44,928
Far as I could see

696
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,720
He's beautiful and Lighting

697
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:50,560
And then with Iowa once he got into all the movement that me he was

698
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:52,608
He was ahead of the curb

699
00:28:57,216 --> 00:29:00,032
Ice roll scene

700
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:02,080
About ready and action

701
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:04,384
Optimistic

702
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,712
To see how beautance techniques are still being used today

703
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:10,272
Danny went to MacGuffin films in New York

704
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:11,552
Okay so just

705
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:17,440
MacGuffin does commercials for Red Lobster Olive Garden Starbucks in a bunch by the restaurant

706
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:18,976
The date Danny was there

707
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:24,608
They were shooting a chicken sandwich so they are shooting a chicken sandwich

708
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:27,680
Sure Shot it looks like on a black

709
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:28,448
Sleep

710
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:31,520
A little tray of

711
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,568
Chili Peppers and garlic and stuff

712
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,664
A hand model stands near the edge of the table for the sandwiches display

713
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,456
What's another doing the crowning

714
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:41,248
Crowning means the hand model

715
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,272
Takes the bun

716
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:44,576
And put it on top of the sandwich

717
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:47,136
Does President there alluringly

718
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:48,672
Men take the crown off

719
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:58,400
Top of the chicken

720
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:00,448
Then the ground goes back on again

721
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:09,408
It took them all day to film this sandwich

722
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,968
The whole shoot precisely orchestrated

723
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:14,016
Relying on highly technical tool

724
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:19,136
Downstairs in macguffins proper I'm there all sorts of rig sitting in storage

725
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:21,184
A lot like the ones that you develop

726
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:23,744
But these are way more high-tech

727
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:26,048
Riggers today use lasers

728
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:28,352
And sensors and pre-programmed Motors

729
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:30,656
And depending on the shot or the rig

730
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,448
There can be some intense physics

731
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,728
To take into account

732
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:40,128
Like if you're trying to slice an onion into while it's flying through the air we break down the elements

733
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:42,432
Onion to a certain height

734
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,968
This is Anthony the robber

735
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:45,248
He's a special effects

736
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,784
Technician at MacGuffin films

737
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:49,600
And he designed a special rig just to get this

738
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:56,000
Shotgun Dan's computer-controlled so when the onions in the right spot these two sharp knives come through split the onion

739
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:56,768
Leave you with

740
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,048
Sliced in the middle

741
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:01,376
And slices of onion artfully tumbling across a table

742
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:02,656
Classic rock shop

743
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:06,496
But Wellbutrin may have introduced Rigs in action 2 tabletop

744
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:09,056
Some directors like macguffins Nick few.

745
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,848
I'm trying to get away from you

746
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:12,128
Fantastical Dreamscape

747
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:13,408
Pics of flying shrimp

748
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,176
And oranges

749
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:20,576
I think that's a little bit of an older point of view for next few ghosts at the idealized images of food that be

750
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:21,856
Tried to bring to his ass

751
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:25,952
Just don't cut it in a world that's now totally saturated with food poor

752
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:31,584
Well Butrans commercials often zoomed-in so close to food that you couldn't see the space around it

753
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:37,216
Tabletop directors like people start now frame there food in the space that you might see out in the world

754
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:39,008
Like at a restaurant or barbecue

755
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:43,104
You know when you dig into a lasagna do you want the sauce to go all over the place

756
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,920
We need to taco stuff going to fall out yet so let's shoot

757
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:48,480
Let it the flavors mix

758
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:49,760
It's all right so tasty

759
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:53,344
But the thing to remember is this

760
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:55,136
On the set of a food commercial

761
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:55,904
Everything

762
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,184
Everything

763
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,232
Is highly orchestrated and contrived

764
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:01,792
Even if the ultimate effect feel somewhat.

765
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:07,936
Because a 30-second TV spot by a firm like Magoffin can cost literally hundreds of thousands of dollars

766
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:11,008
Who's got to do one thing to make it all worthwhile

767
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:12,800
Sell a lot of food

768
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:15,872
I would say the number one rule

769
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:21,248
In food advertising is that the first taste is always with the eyes

770
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:24,576
So you trying to create a shot

771
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:26,368
That makes somebody's

772
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,440
This is Terry O'Reilly again

773
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:32,768
And he's fascinated by the links people go to sell something

774
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,352
He tells a story about working on commercial for a hamburger company

775
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:38,912
And watching an actor do take after take

776
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:40,960
Biting into a hamburger

777
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:43,264
And I'm gazing into a camera with a lookup

778
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,312
Total satisfaction on his face

779
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:47,104
Then you cut and then there's this

780
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:54,016
Right beside the actor then they just spit it right into the pale you know cut

781
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:59,392
Edit and you have any watch that happened 40 times are 30 * 1/20 and it's so hilarious to me

782
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:01,184
Just the mechanics

783
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:01,952
Evaporite

784
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:06,560
The illusion and the reality of creating if that's exactly it in a nutshell

785
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:16,032
This story was produced by Danny Lewis with Avery trufelman and Delaney Hall back in March of 2016

786
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:24,992

All the topics wasn't boring that is

794
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:40,352
Almost a point but trust me you will love

795
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:43,424
