I'm Roman Mars

29
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:46,496
Trying to succinctly some of the character or purpose of any city in the world is probably a fruitless exercise

30
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,288
But for much of its history

31
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,824
Bonn Germany was

32
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,104
Particularly

33
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,384
The first word that comes to

34
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,152
And mine is

00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:53,920
Wyatt

36
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,712
Unremarkable

37
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,248
A quiet town

38
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:00,832
Kind of hard to pin down Hills on one side the River on the other

39
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,368
Generally it's just a

40
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,136
Sleepy

41
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,160
Quiet

42
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,184
Quaint little

43
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:07,232
That's a ruse for of our

44
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:10,304
And he works for the German international broadcaster Deutsche welle

45
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:11,584
And he lives in pain

46
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,472
Bond has 300,000 people that's on the Rhine River so it was prodigiously important during World War II

47
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:23,360
It wasn't forgetting Beethoven was born there in 1770 but he took off in his early twenties for the burgeoning music

48
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,128
Capital of

49
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:24,896
Vienna

50
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:28,736
Not much happened in bond until the end of World War II

51
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:32,320
Bond was named as the provisional capital of West Germany

52
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:34,368
It became a city with a purpose

53
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,160
It was the government seat

54
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,184
And then

55
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,976
Half a century later

56
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:41,792
The country was reunified the Berlin Wall came down

57
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:45,376
Germany decided to move the capital away from Bond

58
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,400
And back

59
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,680
Tu Berlin

60
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:50,240
Now over a decade after its move

61
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,008
Bond

62
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,288
How to forge

63
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,312
Own identity

64
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:56,896
This is what cyruta street sounds like at 9 a.m. on a weekday

65
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:59,968
Yeah she lives in what was once the old diplomatic quarter of bond

66
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:03,040
Former home to many embassies and ambassador's residence

67
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,576
Pretty quiet it's

68
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:05,600
Be quiet

69
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:08,160
But it turns out that for newcomers like me

70
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,696
It's not immediately

71
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:11,232
Obvious where the embassies

72
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,000
Used to be

73
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,792
But according to Mikhail Dental

74
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:18,400
A local journalist who grew up in the neighborhood and wrote a book about bonds diplomatic history

75
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:23,776
There's one thing that you can look for in a clue you in as to where the embassies used to be

76
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:29,664
Flagstaff

77
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,200
With no flag

78
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:37,856
This house was a fraud example

79
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:38,624
English word

80
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:45,792
But today when you see a flag pole on my God

81
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:52,192
See a flagpole without flag that's 80% a sign for

82
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:56,800
Former m444 magazine

83
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,336
You have no other signs

84
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,640
Michelle explained to me that

85
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:03,200
Half a century before World War II

86
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:07,296
This part of bond was founded as a small summer Retreat for the wealthy

87
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,832
This specific

88
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,112
Part of bond is known as

89
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,136
Sadhguru

90
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,696
And this specific part of bad godesberg is

91
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:14,976
Call the feeling fear

92
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,512
The Village quarter

93
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,327
Don't closer to the Rhine Michelle pointed out the

94
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,375
Former British ambassador's residence

95
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:28,031
When the Union Jack was flying over this building you said there was a certain feeling about it

96
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:34,431
Union Jack Stars and Stripes feeling of

97
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:40,831
The end of World War II peace basically

98
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:47,231
Something important on the Ryan

99
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:59,519
American forces took bond in 1945 not long before the end of the war

100
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:05,407
After the war ended Germany was carved up into various the zones of occupation and bond was

101
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:07,455
Firmly in the British the zone

102
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:11,295
In 1949 who became the provisional capital of

103
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,063
Of West Germany

104
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:15,903
The choice was made mainly due to the advocacy of West Germany

105
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:16,927
Chancellor

106
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:17,951
Konrad Adenauer

107
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:21,535
He was a former mayor of cologne and a native of the area

108
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:27,679
But Bond was also an appealing choices the capital city because it was a small-town relatively intact

109
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:30,239
And it didn't really have a character

110
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,311
Choosing provision ality

111
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:36,639
Berlin was out of the question of course and Nazis had set up shop there

112
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:41,503
Before Frankford and homburg for the wrong choice because they were too big and would have felt too permanent

113
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,271
Bond

114
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,039
Was it clean

115
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:43,807
Slate

116
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:50,719
Little sweetie Bond was still the subject of some ridicule a 1986 Los Angeles Times article

117
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,487
Volleyball

118
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:57,887
Had a few good one line zingers about the city the minister of agriculture

119
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:03,519
The best thing about gone is the train to Munich former Chancellor Helmut Schmidt called Bond

120
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,823
A collection of crippled villages

121
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:11,199
He spend most weekends in his native homburg American correspondent based in bond said it was

122
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,759
Half the size of a Chicago Cemetery

123
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,039
Weiss's dad

124
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:19,135
But you shouldn't feel too bad for

125
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,183
It's crooked big is the cat

126
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,767
Tons of cash the City built

127
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,815
A Subway in International School

128
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:27,839
An opera house

129
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:28,863
All of this

130
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,631
In the city

131
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,423
Adjust around 300 thousand

132
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,191
Do people

133
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,103
But then

134
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,639
The Impossible

135
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,199
The Cold War ended

136
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:45,247
Germany reunified

137
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,527
The Berlin Wall came down

138
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,551
And

139
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,855
The German Parliament voted to move the capital

140
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:50,879
Back to Berlin

141
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:57,535
A June of 91 when the decision fails of to go to Berlin.

142
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,327
Call people

143
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,863
Beside each other

144
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:04,959
All the left All Things release to burn

145
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:08,799
Terrible

146
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:09,567
This moment

147
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:14,175
In other words everyone thought Bond would lose its Mojo at best

148
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:16,223
And at worst would become a ghost town

149
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,551
The parliament decided that by 90

150
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,319
1899

151
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,111
Nearly all government minister

152
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,135
It would move back

153
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:23,903
Tu Berlin

154
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,695
And then of course included the embassy

155
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,743
Is all the action was now in Berlin

156
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:34,399
Today the former French Embassy in bought is the physical embodiment of all the fears that people had about what Bond would be

157
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,167
Do you like

158
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,703
Once the capital moved away

159
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:37,983
A ghost town

160
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:44,383
Is he this building in France

161
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:50,783
Frances old it looks terrible

162
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:57,183
Yeah it looks like there's graffiti there's broken glass there's there's a Vines growing everywhere

163
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,975
Image of this old French Embassy

164
00:07:59,231 --> 00:07:59,999
See today they're like

165
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:05,375
30 foot high bushes in the front of the building there's broken glass in graffiti everywhere

166
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,167
You can see all this on Google Street View

167
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,727
And you might think that this would be the case

168
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,263
For all of the former Embassy

169
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,031
Susan Vaughn

170
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:12,799
But actually

171
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:13,823
What happened was

172
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,847
Somali embassy

173
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:15,615
She's got turned into

174
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,919
I'll just got sold internet

175
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,943
Private homes

176
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,735
Many actually still have empty

177
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,015
Flag poles out front

178
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,039
But the important thing

179
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:23,807
Is that Bond

180
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,575
Is not

181
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,343
A ghost town

182
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:28,159
It turns out that moving the capital to Berlin

183
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,183
I just be

184
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,207
The best thing

185
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,023
20 years later

186
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,559
