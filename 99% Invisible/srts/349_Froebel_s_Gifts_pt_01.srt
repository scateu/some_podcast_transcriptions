29
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,392
Once Upon a Time

30
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:32,416
It was a boy

31
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,440
Name Friedrich

32
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,208
Pro Bowl

33
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,304
Is early life reads like one of those dark old German fairy tales

34
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:41,120
His mother died in 1783

35
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:42,656
Right after he was born

36
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,192
It's a Friedrich froebel

37
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,728
Had a lonely childhood

38
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,776
He spent his days in the woods

39
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,312
Looking at trees and rocks

40
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,336
Sunflowers

41
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:52,896
Wandering the dense forests of thuringia

42
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,432
And what was then Prussia

43
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,968
It's a lush region

44
00:01:56,224 --> 00:02:00,064
Sometimes referred to today as the screen hits.

45
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,112
The green heart of Germany

46
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:04,416
That's great cause that he produces story

47
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:07,232
I actually lived near thuringia when I was a kid

48
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,768
In the forest there are

49
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,096
Simply Magic

50
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,144
And I can really see how problem

51
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:19,776
He looked at Roxy study the trees he was rewarded with a Forester for a while he was in

52
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,312
Prentice Forrester

53
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,592
Best Norman brosterman

54
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:25,152
He's an author who studied Friedrich froebel for years

55
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:30,272
Braun strowman says that probably worked for a time as a land surveyor and even served in the military

56
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,576
Skilled at drafting in geometry

57
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,624
And at one point became convinced

58
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,904
He should be a narc

59
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,464
It did everything you need to become a narc

60
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,000
Taxi took all the right classes

61
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,048
But he didn't become a narc

62
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:45,376
Friend convinced him to become an educator and sad

63
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:52,032
And in changing course froebel arguably ended up having more influence in the world of architecture and Design

64
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,824
Than any single architect

65
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:55,872
And that's because

66
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,664
Friedrich froebel created

67
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:58,688
Kindergarten

68
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,992
I believe kindergarten had it

69
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03,296
Tremendous influence on the twentieth century

70
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:06,368
It impacted all parts of society

71
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,392
Of course

72
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,416
Including

73
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,952
And architecture

74
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,304
If you ever looked at a piece of abstract art or modernist architecture and thought

75
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:16,608
My kindergartener could have made that

76
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,632
Well

77
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,680
That may be more true than you realize

78
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:26,848
The kindergarten was the product of frobbles Decades of experience in a wide range of fear

79
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,176
But the foundations are built on the principles of

80
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:30,944
Johanna

81
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,968
Pestalozzi

82
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:37,088
Pestalozzi is considered the father of modern education which basically means

83
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:42,720
They will learn better if you treat them well rather than hit them with sticks you know

84
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:46,304
In addition to the whole not hitting kids with sticks thing

85
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:52,704
Pestalozzi emphasized physical activity and active learning over rote memorization and repetition

86
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:53,984
And in particular

87
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,288
He felt that kids should draw

88
00:03:56,544 --> 00:04:00,384
Pestalozzi was early childhood educator

89
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,432
Who had Incorporated

90
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,480
Pedagogical drawings

91
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,528
In the curriculum

92
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,832
That's author and Cooper Union professor

93
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:09,856
Tomorrow singer

94
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:13,952
And basically he is one of the first with all that rowing

95
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:17,024
Should be part of any school curriculum

96
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,327
And should be taught to the very very young

97
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:22,655
Trouble work for a time at a school based on these principles

98
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,215
Any building where you learn from pestalozzi

99
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,751
Incorporating his own ideas

100
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:29,311
Along the way about how children should be taught

101
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,591
Facility was

102
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,383
Especially busy with

103
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,943
Breaking down the two dimensional world

104
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:35,711
With what

105
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,527
Probably this break down the street image

106
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,295
National world

107
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:44,415
Purple realized he wanted kids to go beyond just drawing lines on pages

108
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:48,255
He wanted them to learn through the physical manipulation of objects

109
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:51,071
Froebel wanted to building blocks of reality

110
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,863
And this Alchemy

111
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:53,887
Crystals in

112
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:57,471
Teaching of pestalozzi and a childhood alone in the woods

113
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:00,543
Crystallized into a solid vision

114
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,591
In 1837

115
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,127
Previous 55 years old

116
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,943
Froebel founded the very first kindergarten

117
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:09,247
MBA glockenberg Germany

118
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,343
And his intention was to create an educational system for

119
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,879
Children who could not

120
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,159
Yet read or write

121
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:18,207
So he sought to use

122
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,999
Geometric forms

123
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,279
As a way to

124
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,351
Teach complex and simple lessons

125
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,887
All through play

126
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,655
If you can

127
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:29,727
Harness play you can teach kids a lot of things

128
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:34,591
The word kindergarten cleverly and Compass two different ideas

129
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:37,151
Kids would play in and learn from nature

130
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:40,991
But they would also themselves be nurtured and nourished

131
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,527
Like plants in a garden

132
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,831
And the key to it all

133
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,647
Was a set of deceptively simple looking

134
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:48,671
Toys

135
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,719
Lee's

136
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,511
We're froebel's gifts

137
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,095
The cold gift because they were to draw out the gift

138
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,887
Oh the children

139
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:00,447
German of course the phrase froebel's gifts

140
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:02,495
Is rolled together into a single word

141
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,519
Pro Bowl

142
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:07,103
Froebel's gifts were meant to be given in a particular order

143
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:10,175
The toys growing more complex overtime

144
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,223
Teaching different lessons about shapes

145
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,783
Structure and perception along the way

146
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,623
The first of froebel's gifts was a soft

147
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,927
The wool ball

148
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,975
Annie's basically

149
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:24,255
The first gift

150
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,791
Child could get

151
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,095
At the age of 6 weeks

152
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,911
Village hybrid graduate to another

153
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,959
Roughly the same size as the first

154
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,031
But this one is not soft it's hard

155
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:40,127
Wouldn't Maple wooden ball

156
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:41,919
Has

157
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:42,687
Surface

158
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,479
Smoothie can roll

159
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,271
And then they are given the

160
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,039
Cube

161
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,575
And the cube is an opposite

162
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,367
Pyside

163
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,135
Tusk

164
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:51,903
Edges

165
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,695
Sharp edges

166
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,463
Poems

167
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,743
The cube cannot

168
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,279
Kids are

169
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:59,583
Ask to enumerate the differences

170
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,607
Between the two

171
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:05,471
And then they get a cylinder which combines elements of both the ball and the cube

172
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,519
Blow their little Minds

173
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,847
Each do gift would get more and more interact

174
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,127
The more complex

175
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,431
Some were designed to be hung from a string

176
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,455
Spun in the air

177
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,247
And as the rotate

178
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,831
Some very interesting forms are created

179
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,879
That are not visible

180
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,927
When the form is stationary

181
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:28,767
Like a cube for instance looks like a cylinder when you spin it around 5

182
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:33,631
If you want the children to start to see that there's some invisible parts

183
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,935
Contained within the visible

184
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,751
Next up game object

185
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,031
It's made up of smaller

186
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,615
Like a cube that breaks down into a bunch of little

187
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:48,479
And then the toys would ship from being about perception to being about creation

188
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,271
They would become more versatile

189
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,063
Pliant and constructive

190
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:58,463
Locks gave way to paper string wire little sticks and peas that could be connected in Stockton just

191
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,231
Structures

192
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:01,535
Objects would get more abstract and creative

193
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,815
Leading to the finals

194
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:06,655
The last is really just working freely with clay

195
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,959
Play being the most malleable evolve

196
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,751
It's rigid and it's off

197
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:14,079
And there's a whole range of things a child could build with it

198
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,871
But even at this final stage

199
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:18,431
This wasn't the kind of creative free for all week

200
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,223
We tend to associate with childhood play

201
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,783
Pro Bowl head children sitting at desk

202
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,343
Workstations with grids lay down

203
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,391
So it's not free play

204
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,183
The fact that the table

205
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,975
Has an underlying grid

206
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,023
He's very much at the

207
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,559
Root of

208
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,095
The directive play

209
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,887
You follow instructions

210
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,935
And there's an underlying order

211
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:43,519
And so in this very structured very dramatic way

212
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:46,335
The gifts encourage students to think abstract

213
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:49,407
Interrelated ideas objects and symbol

214
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,967
A set of blocks could be used to teach

215
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:52,735
Counting

216
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,807
In the child could use those same blocks to build a house

217
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,623
And then tell stories of a family living in the house

218
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,695
So they were modeling the world different ways

219
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,231
All using the same

220
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,255
Set of objects

221
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:07,839
The children realize that they can create a new

222
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,887
Shapes in new forms that

223
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:12,959
The create on top of the grill table

224
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:15,519
These kindergarten smart just schools

225
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,055
They were art schools

226
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:20,127
Without the sex and drugs and clove cigarettes

227
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:23,967
They were places that taught about shape and form and color

228
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:27,295
And when kindergarten graduates went out into the world

229
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,575
The world

230
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:29,855
Changed

231
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:36,767
The kind of art that was being made in the 19 century is really different than

232
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:39,839
The kind of art that was made after kids went to kindergarten

233
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,887
Expressionist Cubist

234
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:44,959
Surrealist artists like Paul clay and possibly convince

235
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,007
Attended early

236
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,567
Others like Piet Mondrian

237
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,615
Encountered 4 billion methods as teacher

238
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,431
And when you look at a lot of their work

239
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,967
Alongside illustration

240
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:57,247
Things in kindergarten

241
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,015
Teacher guides

242
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,295
The resemblance

243
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,319
Is uncanny

244
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,367
It wasn't just artists

245
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:04,927
Kindergarten influenced designers to

246
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:08,511
Walter gropius started the Bauhaus in 1919

247
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:11,839
Gropius decided to hire a kindergarten teacher as the first

248
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:12,607
Higher

249
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,911
Apus famous School of Design

250
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:20,031
So the Bauhaus had its adult designs

251
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,383
Much like those found in kindergarten

252
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,967
The effects of froebel's work on design education

253
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,015
Rippled out Beyond Germany

254
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:34,623
And some of his most explicit and direct influences can be found

255
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,439
Among the world's most famous architects

256
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,999
Frank Lloyd Wright the American architect

257
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:42,303
Is the great child of the kindergarten

258
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:45,375
You can find the kindergarten everything right ever did

259
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,703
Frank Lloyd Wright was born in 1867

260
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:52,031
Around the time kindergarten for gaining Traction in the United States

261
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:55,615
And his mom took classes in kindergarten education

262
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,663
Neverwinter

263
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,967
School but he recalls that when he was young

264
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,503
His mother brought home a set

265
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,271
Afrobull

266
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:06,367
Right said that the moment he was given froebel's gifts

267
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,135
Key quotes

268
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,671
Began to be a narc

269
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,463
He went on to say

270
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:14,047
For several years I sat at that little kindergarten table

271
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,583
Mean by lines about

272
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,863
4in apart

273
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:21,727
But the smooth cardboard triangles and maple wood blocks would most important

274
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,031
All are in my fingers

275
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:24,799
To this day

276
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,103
And rate wasn't the only one

277
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:29,663
European modernist Le corbusier

278
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,455
Also never went to architecture

279
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,271
But he did attempt Rebellion schools

280
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,039
In Switzerland

281
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:40,927
The Grid geometries in repeated patterns of Lil Boosie a modernist houses and apartment blocks

282
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:45,023
Look like they were drawn on those credited kindergarten desks

283
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,071
Look up Lizzie and Frank Lloyd Wright

284
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:47,839
Considered

285
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:50,911
Price on the two most important architect of the 20th century

286
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,471
Had exactly the same childhood education

287
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,263
And then there's Buckminster Fuller

288
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,567
Famous for pioneering geodesic dome

289
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,591
Meetup of trying

290
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,383
Fuller discovery

291
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,919
Is greatest engineering inside

292
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,455
As a kindergarten

293
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,503
Connecting from belly and peas

294
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,271
Styx

295
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:09,343
You know Buckminster Fuller this is the thing he's most famous for

296
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,647
You know the domes made out of

297
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:14,207
Pizza sticks pasqualino's and rods

298
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,023
So he learned that in kindergarten

299
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:27,775
Obviously not everyone who attended kindergarten became a Frank Lloyd Wright or a little corbusier or a bucket

300
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:30,335
But the abstract lessons of kindergarten

301
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,383
Tilled and fertilized the ground

302
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,687
So the seeds of their ideas

303
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,991
Could find purchase in the world

304
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:40,063
Abstraction was accepted fairly quickly

305
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,087
In Paris

306
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,367
Time in Europe

307
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:48,511
Perhaps because children are doing a lot of the same kinds of things for many decades

308
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:53,119
That was one of the reasons that they were not so shocked when our turn in that direction

309
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,959
Do in terms of 20th century Art and Design

310
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:59,519
Kindergarten was an absolute Triumph

311
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:03,871
Friedrich froebel only got to witness the spread of his vision

312
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,407
For about a decade

313
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,687
Before it was cut short

314
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:10,527
In the 1850s the Prussian government was cracking down on the broth

315
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,831
An 1851

316
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,623
Are you shoot the kindergarten for

317
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,927
A national ban on kindergarten

318
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,975
And probably died the very next

319
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:23,839
And you know I wonder if he died of a broken heart 1952

320
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,631
Of course when I was

321
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:29,215
Even though the band slowed the expansion of kindergartens in Germany

322
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:32,287
It didn't stop the idea from spreading elsewhere

323
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,311
Far from it

324
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:36,383
A lot of free thinking liberals left Germany

325
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,943
And they brought froebel's kindergarten with

326
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,735
Who is disciples

327
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,527
We were so

328
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:47,135
Dedicated to the work that they immigrated many of them to the United States

329
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:49,951
And basically because of the band

330
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:50,719
That's

331
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:53,791
What's latooth foibles the series to be

332
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,583
Known around the world

333
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,143
In the most dedicated kindergarten evangelist

334
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,167
Or women

335
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,727
Has tomorrow singer points out in her book arcs

336
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:02,495
Section play

337
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:06,079
Froebel believe that women should play a leading role in educating children

338
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,359
To be clear

339
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,151
Froebel wasn't exactly a feminist

340
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,967
Cadbury traditional ideas about gender roles

341
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:15,295
And believe that it was the role of women to nurture children

342
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,343
As panties and kindergarten

343
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:20,159
But regardless of verbal reasoning

344
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,463
Teaching kindergarten was a rare opportunity

345
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:25,279
It was one of the only jobs you could get as a young woman

346
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,071
There weren't many jobs

347
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,351
And it was women

348
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:31,167
Who drew up in translated the lesson books that would be used

349
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,959
The future generation of young artists

350
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:33,727
Designers

351
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:37,823
By 1885 there were over 500 kindergartens in America

352
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,615
And they were taught primarily

353
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,383
By women

354
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,919
And you might be thinking

355
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:47,807
Hey I went to kindergarten why didn't I grow up with this incredibly dramatic immaculately plan sequence of toys

356
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:51,903
Play ironic leave the passion of some of kindergardens biggest proponents

357
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:57,023
Is part of the reason why you probably didn't grow up playing with froebel's gifts

358
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:04,703
The first kindergarten in the United States started in Watertown Wisconsin in 1856

359
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,495
But it was German language only

360
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:10,335
The educator Elizabeth Peabody was inspired by this kindergarten

361
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:14,687
And went on to found the first American English language kindergarten in Boston

362
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,711
In 1860

363
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,247
Peabody wanted to

364
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,527
To spread the teachings of frobe

365
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:20,319
Call to as many children as possible

366
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,855
And so she reached out

367
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:22,879
Milton Bradley

368
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,415
The Famous Board Game maker

369
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:27,231
She wanted Bradley to mass produce from

370
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,535
So they could be accessible to everyone

371
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,839
And Milton Bradley have encouraged her

372
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:34,143
Was convinced and since that moment

373
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:38,239
Attorneys entire attention to the manufacturer of Roblox

374
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,007
Send gift

375
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,335
Door Peabody saw an educational ideal

376
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,895
Bradley saw a business opportunity

377
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,711
Bradley began adding a bunch of new toys

378
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:51,039
And other manufacturers

379
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:53,087
Making all different kinds of stuff and just

380
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:53,855
Call me at all

381
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:54,623
Kindergarten

382
00:15:55,647 --> 00:16:01,023
He just made up Stephanie said this is kindergarten this is kindergarten this is kindergarten it's not necessarily froboese

383
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:01,791
Kindergarten

384
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:05,631
The simple abstractions of Robles gifts

385
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,167
Shandong commercial

386
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:10,239
It was in a few years Elizabeth Peabody

387
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,287
Went from promoting the manufacturer of kindergarten

388
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,335
Ryan toys to speaking out against

389
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:17,919
The interest of Manufacturers and of merchants of the Gibson

390
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,455
Materials is a snare

391
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,503
It has already corrupted this

392
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,063
Simplicity of froebel in Europe and America

393
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:26,879
His idea was Hughes Elementary forms

394
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:27,647
Exclusively

395
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,927
And simple material

396
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,999
Even the word kindergarten itself

397
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,023
Became of generic

398
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,607
A catch-all for early childhood education of all differ

399
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:42,239
These days most kindergartens are a lot different from anything froebel imagine

400
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:47,103
And few kids encounter those early gifts in any kind of sequence if at all

401
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,407
But kids still play with blocks

402
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,199
I mean I really think that

403
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:54,527
It's because of froebel or $40 however it's correctly pronounce

404
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:55,295
That

405
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,831
Children in the western world

406
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:57,599
Play with blocks

407
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:00,927
But I think also blocks are

408
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:03,743
Constant across a variety of educational

409
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:04,511
System

410
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:08,607
Because there's so much in them that they can teach

411
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,143
That's Alexandra Lange

412
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,191
An architecture critic and author of

413
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,727
The design of childhood

414
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:16,799
Material World shapes independent kids

415
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:22,175
The block is incredibly malleable toy that can be used in all of these different ways

416
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:25,247
Probably wasn't the only one to see educational value

417
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,015
Box

418
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,551
In the early nineteen hundreds

419
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,855
Carolyn Pratt debuted hurt you

420
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,135
Unit blocks

421
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,927
Switch are essentially those classic

422
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,719
Brick shaped

423
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:36,511
Pale wood blocks

424
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:39,071
That really I can't think of any

425
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:42,143
Early Childhood classroom I've been to that doesn't have those blocks

426
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,543
In some ways all modern toy blocks were influenced by Freud

427
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:49,823
Tinker Toys

428
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:50,591
Lego

429
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,639
Connects all about understanding

430
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,175
Inform Lincoln connection

431
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,735
They also represent a departure

432
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,783
Comfortable highly organized and linear

433
00:17:59,039 --> 00:17:59,551
Approach

434
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,343
Roblox

435
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:03,135
You were supposed to proceed

436
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,415
1 to 20

437
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,463
Through his exercises

438
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,767
The unit block

439
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:13,375
Are much more open-ended there more like we tend in counter Blox today

440
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:20,031
These days we don't think that blocks need in a company gridded desk or a syllabus of objects

441
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:22,591
Mailbox are creative tools for children

442
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:25,151
That gives them a chance to use their imagination

443
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:28,479
As they build houses and cities and interact with each other

444
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,551
That's what I say when my boys play with Legos or

445
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,599
Build castles in Minecraft

446
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,391
There isn't this sense

447
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,439
Abstract progression

448
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:40,511
If it's Morrisons that

449
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:46,143
These blocks are too old for children to recreate their own world as best they can

450
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:51,007
And who knows how many Architects Builders designers and thinkers

451
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:54,079
All started with these literal building blocks

452
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,359
Pavilion or otherwise

453
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,151
Burning creativity

454
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:59,199
Through Construction

455
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:19,423
Froebel influence the design of educational toys

456
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,543
But his ideas also impacted help children play Outdoors that's coming up

457
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,311
After the break

458
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,295
Between the beats

459
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:37,599
Bongs and Charter of our devices

460
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,367
We're immersed

461
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:40,927
The cluttered World a man-made sound

462
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,207
If

463
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:46,559
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexa

464
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:52,447
Is talking to me and my wife is in another room and a kid is another remedy for all hearing that voice

465
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,471
Technology

466
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,239
You talk to us

467
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,543
It is a creation of Sonic trash

468
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:59,615
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

469
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:03,199
Studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

470
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,991
To make them more human

471
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,087
Turn the living room lights on

472
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:10,879
Okay

473
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,415
Dim the living room lights

474
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,439
50%

475
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,231
Okay

476
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:21,631
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

477
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,447
Makes for a much more natural experience

478
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:26,495
Turn the living room lights on

479
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,079
Dim the living room lights to 50

480
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:30,847
80%

481
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:39,295
We're presenting two special episodes from 99percentinvisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation about how are sound

482
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:41,087
Landscape is impacting our health

483
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:43,647
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

484
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:46,463
Look for them Friday is May 17th and May 24th

485
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,231
Right here

486
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:48,767
NPI fate

487
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:56,959
Robles gifts impacted early childhood education inside the classroom but froebel also influence the way chill

488
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,495
Golden played Outdoors

489
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,287
That's because his kindergarten

490
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:02,847
Had little Gardens Little plots work

491
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:03,615
Kids kids

492
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,407
Get their hands dirty and learn to

493
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,431
Cultivate plants

494
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,455
Is her book

495
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,735
The design of childhood

496
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:12,831
Author Alexandra Lange traces the connection between froebel's kindergarten

497
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:16,416
And the very first playgrounds in Berlin Germany

498
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:19,488
The first playgrounds were actually piles of sand

499
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:21,280
Which are called sand Gardens

500
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:27,168
Which really popped up in Berlin in the the 1850s and 1860s

501
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:29,216
There wasn't much to them design-wise

502
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:30,240
They're basically just

503
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:34,592
Huge piles of sand dumped in public parks for kids to play around

504
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:35,872
And a group of

505
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:38,176
Charitable ladies from Boston

506
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:41,504
Saw this and Gardens in Berlin and thought Oh

507
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,320
You know the children in the settlement houses in Boss

508
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:48,416
Austin The Immigrant children don't have anything to do during the summer when school's out

509
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:50,976
So they decided to bring these tan Gardens to New England

510
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:53,280
The thinking in part was that

511
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:59,680
Dense urban areas didn't have a lot of places for kids to play especially kids whose parents couldn't afford a big private

512
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:03,776
So saying Gardens would be useful additions to cities

513
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:07,360
So they picked an empty lot and kind of the dentist part of Boston

514
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,384
And they just

515
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,432
Poured a pile of sand in it

516
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:12,992
And said okay it's the same Garden

517
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,016
Come play

518
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:19,904
And then the kids spent the summary no digging in the sand making mountains of the sand playing in the sand

519
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:24,768
And it was hugely successful and garden started popping up all over the country

520
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,560
Often in public parks

521
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:30,912
Sometimes they were staffed with play leaders who would teach organized games and

522
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:33,984
Marching exercises in calisthenics and songs

523
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,544
But also more traditional organized Sports

524
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:42,176
There is also this push to americanize the Immigrant children and so they teach them how to play baseball

525
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:45,504
Which was thought to be a very collaborative and Democratic sport

526
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:50,368
And so the same Garden actually starts to shrink and become a box

527
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:53,184
Rather than a gardener box rather than a whole lot

528
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,208
And they have

529
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:56,256
Paved areas in grassy areas

530
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:58,816
So sanh Gardens kicked off The Playground movement

531
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:01,888
Organized around ideas of American culture

532
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,168
Productive teamwork

533
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,448
And healthy exercise

534
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,776
And then there's a whole proliferation of amazing

535
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,312
Spinning wheels

536
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:12,640
Climbing structures giant slides all of this

537
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:18,016
Like the metal equipment that you can still sometimes find an older playgrounds in the twenties and thirties

538
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,296
Their catalogs of this

539
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,576
Send cities by it

540
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:24,416
Nearly every city bought into this idea of playground

541
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,720
Seesaws slides and swings

542
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,768
All became standard features

543
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,584
Actual sandboxes got smaller and smaller

544
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,400
Becoming just another thing the playground could have

545
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:39,776
In 2 weeks we going to bring you the story of the rise of the mass-produced playground

546
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:43,872
And the stubborn super famous artists who push back

547
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:46,176
But next week's episode

548
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,968
