I'm Roman Mars

32
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:34,976
At their peak in the mid-90s there were about two and a half million payphones in the US

33
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:39,584
Adoption of cell phones has brought that number down further and further every year

34
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,448
Be fully enclosed outdoor telephone box you know the one that Superman changes in

35
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,240
That is exceptionally rare

36
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,544
Only four of those are left in New York City

37
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:55,968
After several decades these little pieces of single-use architecture just disappeared from the landscape

38
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,808
They simply weren't popular enough to justify their existence

39
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,624
But there's always an exception to the rule

40
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,904
20 years ago

41
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,512
A man discovered a phone booth in the middle of the desert that became his obsession

42
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:11,840
An obsession that he then passed on to the World At Large

43
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:18,496
From the great radio program snap judgment of Oakland California producer Joe Rosenberg tells the story of a very

44
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,800
In the middle of nowhere

45
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,136
Okay

46
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:41,536
So the story starts out back in the mid-90s in Phoenix we're Godfrey Daniels given name is Godfrey Daniels but I

47
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,560
IDOC

48
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:45,376
He's heading back home after seeing this band girl trouble

49
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,656
Odesza concert

50
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,496
Remember scenes if not

51
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,264
Don't worry

52
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,056
Free internet

53
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,336
Nature magazine

54
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:57,920
So as I was walking home I was kind of flipping through it and

55
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:58,944
What about the

56
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,784
34th page of a couple of letters to the editor and one of them mentioned

57
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,576
That there was a phone booth

58
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:06,112
In the Mojave Desert

59
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:10,208
Miles and miles from a pavement just sitting by itself

60
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,512
And this for dock

61
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,072
Just made no sense

62
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,608
I wasn't sure they believed it

63
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,144
Why not

64
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:20,192
Well I didn't have any reason to play

65
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,496
I mean I don't know if

66
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,544
And the in the age of cell phones

67
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,568
If it's the same

68
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:27,616
But when you were on the desert and those days

69
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,640
You are on your own

70
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,432
You can call people

71
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,992
So the idea that there could be this f****** puth

72
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,808
Just sitting out in an uncontactable place

73
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,904
It's kind of like if somebody was on the moon you know when you can talk to somebody on the moon

74
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,744
Where did he say it was exactly

75
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,024
Nearest

76
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,816
Recognizable landmarks

77
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,888
He didn't say it was a really short little paragraph

78
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,728
It was any solid information other than the number

79
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:56,800
Okay

80
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:57,824
Why not give it a shot

81
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:04,224
Captain the number and it just rang and I let it ring for a long time

82
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,624
I was just imagining making a phone ring how where presumably

83
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:16,512
Hear it except the coyotes but then there was also in the back your mind the thought what if

84
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:20,607
What if somebody's wondering why who would be out there

85
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:25,471
Who would pick up it just really grabbed me and so

86
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,007
I hung up and then

87
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,311
I just kept thinking about it I kept thinking about it

88
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:32,895
All Night Lights was thinking about it as I fell asleep and it just it just

89
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,199
Somehow got me into its clutches

90
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:38,015
So the next morning I called again

91
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,063
I just kind of became obsessed

92
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:44,159
Founders of confounded all the time

93
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:47,743
My friend visited his house he put their arm and make them call it

94
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:54,143
Supposed to know in the bathroom here it just said did you remember to call the Mojave Desert today

95
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,167
It turned off

96
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,959
I didn't need it because I used to call

97
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,007
Many times to take

98
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,799
Like how many times

99
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:05,151
If I was supposed to be working I was probably calling at least once an hour

100
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:09,247
And again this is all assuming that actually existed which I had no proof of

101
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:12,063
Like on speakerphone or like you would

102
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,343
Stop everything

103
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,159
No no no no cuz that would require explanation

104
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:19,743
I would just didn't have it and have the the phone kind of cradle against my ear

105
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,791
Yeah just listening to it rain

106
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,095
Stop it was weird

107
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:26,399
Keep calling a number with no one on the other end

108
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,447
If he was ever pressed about it

109
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,751
It was like being a ham radio operator

110
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,287
Little person

111
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,591
Sending a signal as far as you couldn't to be either

112
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:37,151
Wondering if another person without their

113
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,455
Waiting to be contacted

114
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,503
That uncontactable place

115
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:45,087
So I figured I would be doing this

116
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,367
Forever

117
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,159
I really didn't think anybody would ever pick up

118
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,487
Then just one month after he started calling

119
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,791
Just doing my daily call and

120
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,631
I got a busy signal

121
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,775
Actually mastercorp that call

122
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,079
I look I look like I'm an idiot

123
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,615
Because I keep saying wow

124
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,735
And

125
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:14,783
I thought well

126
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,575
I must have misdialed

127
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,927
So I dialed it again

128
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,975
Send it was a busy signal again

129
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:33,215
I realized okay either something has gone wrong with the phone company here or

130
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,055
She is using imabi phone

131
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:37,823
Right now

132
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,383
I was

133
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:47,295
Totally hyperactive my main thing was I didn't want them to get away like I was thinking I need to catch it right when they a

134
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:52,927
Hang up that phone so I just read and then it rang and

135
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:57,023
Earring for five times

136
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,351
And then

137
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,191
I Heard a Voice say hello

138
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,495
Deadly

139
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:09,055
Dog was only able to properly record his own words

140
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,103
This now historic moment

141
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,407
But as many times that I called

142
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,687
I had given

143
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,991
Remarkably little thought

144
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:19,295
If anyone would say

145
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,135
Hello

146
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,695
Are you in the Mojave Desert

147
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,231
She said yeah

148
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:27,999
I said

149
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:28,767
You are

150
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,047
Okay

151
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,375
Why are you in the middle of Mojave Desert

152
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,399
She said

153
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,679
I'm making my calls

154
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,519
And you don't have a phone

155
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:44,127
I got it when I looked at the transfer it was kind of funny cuz like

156
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,967
You think everything's cool if you're like and she's like

157
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,503
Undermining

158
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,855
Did you like cinder blocks so cool

159
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,951
End

160
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,999
She said that

161
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:02,047
She never heard the phone ring before

162
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,583
Tell your name

163
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,887
Her name's Doreen

164
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,679
Brain is nice to meet you

165
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,663
Was there was there any sense of disappointment

166
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:22,527
Disappointment about what

167
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,575
Got it all

168
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,879
Well let me put it this way, it's kind of like

169
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:30,207
The idea that this phone is ringing out there in the desert

170
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:31,999
And

171
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,535
Anyone can pick up

172
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:36,095
But then finally someone picked up and stiff Lorraine

173
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:40,447
Oh no no see I look at it the exact opposite way

174
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,495
Somebody did pick up

175
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,031
And I and I had no

176
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:46,335
I had no right to expect any one ever would

177
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,383
So this was great

178
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:51,711
To hear to hear a human voice

179
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,783
In place of the ringing you know I mean this with this was

180
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,063
This was a payoff

181
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,111
It just encouraged me more

182
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:03,231
And the instant I hung up I kicked myself because I had forgotten to ask her what

183
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:06,303
Probably the most important question which is where was the phone booth

184
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,327
Of course

185
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,351
Haddon Heights

186
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,143
I have no way to get in touch with her except

187
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:10,911
Define the thing

188
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:18,847
Soda called around doesn't sleuthing in a few months later gets his hands on the equivalent of an x marks the spot map showing

189
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,383
The supposed location

190
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:26,783
A blob that we're all set stove my friend

191
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:33,183
And I took off traveled all day for the Mojave Desert and this is in the middle of August and so scorching-hot just scored

192
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:39,583
Basically as far as you could see you saw Joshua trees and then we saw this little dirt path

193
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,679
That was Mark Trevino danger danger warning not maintain blah blah blah

194
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,727
That was the road we were supposed to take

195
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:50,079
Yeah we're just going along go along in the first I thought this is not bad at all

196
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:56,479
But the further along that we went the road would narrow and the thing was it the sun was going down

197
00:09:56,735 --> 00:10:02,879
And the daytime you got these Grand huge Vistas and you kind of have a sense of where you are but when the darkness drops

198
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:09,023
It's just whatever you can see right in front of him and we were ring by storms there was lightning

199
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:15,679
Almost in every direction is so then I started to think we have any kind of a problem unless we do find

200
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,983
The phone booth

201
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:21,055
Letting people know we're really in trouble that at a certain point

202
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:25,407
Just barely in the reach of the headlights I thought I saw a line of telephone poles

203
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:31,807
And there was a little a little jet to the left and then a little jet to the right and I brought the van

204
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:38,207
Stop with the headlights just shining right on the Mojave phone booth

205
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:44,607
It was really quite a moment and it's full of holes in it there's no class it's all busted out

206
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:49,215
It's kind of a wreck you know but to me it was just it was beautiful

207
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,311
I needed to hear that phone ring

208
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,591
I needed to hear

209
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,615
What I have been

210
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,151
Causing to happen

211
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,711
Conference time out there so I called the

212
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,991
I called my friends

213
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:01,759
Pager

214
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,551
And here I am

215
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:07,391
Out in the Mojave surrounded by Joshua trees

216
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,183
Lightning

217
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:14,303
Desert and now that's a familiar

218
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,863
Twist it was so loud

219
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,143
It was really loud

220
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,679
That was just

221
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,959
Crazy loud

222
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,263
Pray for me that was kind of D moment

223
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,287
Is

224
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,335
Hearing that phone ring

225
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,407
It was everything that I had been imagining when I was calling

226
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:31,711
For that

227
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,503
The story was over

228
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,295
They keep calling me

229
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:36,575
After all

230
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,599
Turn up to pick up

231
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,391
That was just for him

232
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:42,207
I never really expected anyone else to care

233
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:46,559
Until we did something which would not seem risky back in 1997

234
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,887
Today is obviously very

235
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:50,655
Barry

236
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,215
Naked Juice

237
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,495
What page

238
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:58,847
And in those days the internet there wasn't that much on it that's why I thought that was about

239
00:11:59,103 --> 00:11:59,871
As far as it would go

240
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,639
But yeah

241
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,663
What happened

242
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:05,759
Next thing you know how to go to my PO box and there would be

243
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:09,087
Clippings about the Mojave phone booth some newspapers

244
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,135
In languages that I didn't read

245
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:17,535
It just spread so I thought well this unexpected

246
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,815
Initial visit

247
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,119
They got their this phone

248
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:27,007
Wing out in the middle of nowhere

249
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,055
It was ringing off the hook

250
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,383
You didn't have to call anybody

251
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,151
It was just

252
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,711
As soon as you would hang up the phone

253
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:40,063
I was just crazy you pick it up and

254
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,855
Who's the Spurs going to be

255
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:42,879
Where are they going to be

256
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,927
And you had no idea it could be somebody from

257
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,719
Vietnam

258
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,023
Iran or just anywhere

259
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,815
Some people would call

260
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,607
And you couldn't talk to them because

261
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,143
Didn't speak English

262
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:57,727
And again you know most of the time it wasn't about the content

263
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:00,543
You know you're not really saying anything it's really not the point

264
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,103
It's just it's just the connection

265
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:05,151
An old trucker guy called and

266
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:07,199
I think he just wanted to be listened to

267
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:10,271
He wanted to tell stories about his Trucking days

268
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:13,343
And I didn't have anybody to tell him to

269
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,391
How many calls did you end up taking up there

270
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,975
It would be over a hundred guaranteed

271
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:25,375
Nan admittedly he said he shouldn't phone rang after awhile be like you get to know you get its return you get it

272
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:27,679
Eventually had to take it off the hook so we could sleep

273
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:30,495
Going to put it back on the hook the next morning

274
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:33,311
So they can leave there wouldn't have been a way to leave

275
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,359
In silence I mean

276
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:40,735
You work you were going to have to dry since it was raining all the time you were going to drive away from a ringing phone

277
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,527
Just calling

278
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,599
They were visiting

279
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,647
Traveling all the way out to the desert

280
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:51,231
Just for the honor informing collars that yes the phone booth

281
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:54,047
Was real

282
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:54,815
Reality

283
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:57,119
This is from short documentary made about the booth

284
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,679
Montage of people from all over the place

285
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:05,823
Taking calls from all over the place

286
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:11,199
Right on bro you're presenting yourself to the world in a way anybody who wanted to could call you

287
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,735
There was no control

288
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:17,599
Over who could call that phone

289
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:20,159
Store for the circuit

290
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:26,559
Quadriplegic or paraplegic

291
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,327
Circus

292
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,607
Best friend slept

293
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,471
How long were you in a coma

294
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,775
Yeah me too I was

295
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,847
Everybody wants to tell their story and they want

296
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,383
They want someone to listen to story

297
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,199
You should come out and do this

298
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,343
Did you like the fact

299
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,879
That it became popular

300
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:55,231
Would you have preferred it to remain

301
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:59,327
The hesitation came about just because once something like that

302
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,911
Gets out of control then then you know that

303
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,959
Equal and opposite reaction is going to come

304
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,495
The only question was when

305
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:13,663
And then I met a 2000 Lorraine's brother on the way out to the mine stopped

306
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,943
And answer the phone

307
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,223
It was ringing a course

308
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:21,599
And talk to some guy in England who is he said he was sitting there with his fiance

309
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,623
Having tea and crumpets

310
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:25,183
And he talked to him for a little while

311
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,975
And then continued on to the reins

312
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,535
And then in the morning when they were leaving

313
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:38,751
Miss Kate Equinox a reaction that come in the form of the National Park Service

314
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:44,639
Turned out the Bluetooth on the smack dab in the center of a new National Preserve on the phone at Lake Norman

315
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,919
No problem

316
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:49,503
The park officials haven't taken kilates Albany foot traffic

317
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,551
Or for that matter the ringing

318
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,111
By the time I figured out what was happening

319
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,391
Was already too late

320
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:00,511
Did you go out and see this for yourself

321
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:03,327
No no I didn't go out until

322
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,351
I think about

323
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:07,423
Call 2009-2010

324
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,191
Long

325
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:08,959
Long after

326
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:11,775
I mean once I knew it was gone there was

327
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,567
I didn't want to go out

328
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,359
Why not

329
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,431
Just be too sad you know I mean

330
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:21,759
A lot of fun there

331
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:24,575
Hilton it was funny to is that

332
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,111
People did keep going out

333
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,647
And they would go

334
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,951
And visit the concrete pad

335
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:32,255
Abu that stood on

336
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,095
A guy made a really nice Tombstone for the booth

337
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:39,935
And everything that anybody brought out there the Park Service hold off

338
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:46,335
And eventually they came out and broke up the concrete pad took that away to say it was like it was never there

339
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,615
Yeah

340
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:50,431
When I was there the only thing left was a few pieces of glass

341
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,455
The broken windows

342
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:57,087
And people would say I will it's not your phone moving out so yeah I know it's not my phone booth

343
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,367
It's my fault

344
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:02,207
You know it wasn't as though I set out to make a phone booth same as far from it

345
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:04,255
It's just had I known

346
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,047
I might not have done it

347
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:09,887
May I might still I don't know I might not have

348
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,263
Even given that we can now

349
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,031
Reach

350
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,871
No idea

351
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:24,223
I mean that that's something that I that I have thought about is is whether it could have happened

352
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,039
Even five years later

353
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:31,135
And I just don't think it would have I mean that was kind of the magic

354
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,927
Of being in contact

355
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,975
In an uncontactable place

356
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:37,791
And I don't think I don't think you had that feeling now

357
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,583
Did you ever

358
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,143
Try calling that number again after that

359
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,167
Of course

360
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:44,703
Camacho

361
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,311
Anime let it ring

362
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,103
For a long time and they left

363
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,407
