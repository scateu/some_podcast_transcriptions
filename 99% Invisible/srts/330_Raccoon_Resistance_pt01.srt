I'm Roman Mars

31
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,440
The city of Toronto has a special relationship

32
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,720
With raccoons

33
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:35,744
Or at least

34
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:36,768
They think they

35
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:41,376
You're not the only city with raccoons but we often act like we are

36
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:44,704
We like to think Toronto is the raccoon capital of the world

37
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,776
And were strangely proud of that distinction

38
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:50,592
But we really have no data to back it up

39
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,872
This is Amy Dempsey

40
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,920
The reporter for the Toronto Star

41
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:58,016
Do we have more raccoons and say Chicago or Vancouver

42
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:02,624
Well we don't actually know you can't count Urban raccoons they're all over the place

43
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,672
But who needs data when you can

44
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:05,952
Feel it in your heart

45
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:09,536
A few years ago when a raccoon died on Young Street

46
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:13,376
Torontonians named in Conrad and built a vigil around his body with

47
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,400
Flowers

48
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,192
In a framed photo

49
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:17,216
Cards

50
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:20,032
So if science ever disproved this idea

51
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:25,152
Of Toronto is raccoon Nation I really fear for Toronto I think we're going to have an identity crisis

52
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,504
Toronto's feelings about raccoons are not uncomplicated

53
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:33,088
Our relationship with raccoons is kind of a love-hate relationship

54
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,672
We hate when they destroy our grass and break into our houses

55
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,976
And yes they do break into our houses

56
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:42,048
Maybe worse than all this though

57
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:45,120
Was the raccoons proclivity for getting into the compost

58
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,680
What's the city started collecting for the residents

59
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:49,984
In green bins several years ago

60
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,032
From the perspective of the raccoon

61
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:54,848
These Campos bands were an incredible development

62
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:58,944
An all-you-can-eat buffet with the plastic and other garbage RT

63
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,480
Thoughtfully removed

64
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:03,808
And the raccoons will go to town on our stuff and just spread it everywhere

65
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,600
And you wake up

66
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,648
Look out your window and go s***

67
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:11,488
And then maybe you'd argue with your spouse or roommates about who'd have to clean it up

68
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:17,888
The green bins become a feast a veritable Feast For the raccoons this is Toronto mayor John Tory a few years ago

69
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:23,008
Go dressed in a blue suit in front of a row of Canadian flags if he's announcing a plan to

70
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,056
Step up the war on crime

71
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,336
In a way

72
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,920
He was probably nothing that represents more of a nuisance

73
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,968
In a big city like this

74
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:35,040
Dan of the feasting of the raccoons on the contents of

75
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:35,808
Set the green bins

76
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,600
End the war on raccoons

77
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:43,232
Started started with Mayor John Tory

78
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,768
They're hungry

79
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,048
And they're determined

80
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,328
But our job

81
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,632
Together with our private sector reinforced

82
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,680
I is to show them

83
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,472
That we are smarter

84
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,520
He said things like

85
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,312
We are armed we are motivated

86
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,336
We have left a nose

87
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:01,408
Stone unturned in our fight against raccoon Nation

88
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:09,344
The reason muir-torre felt so prepared that day was that the city was unveiling a new raccoon resistant green bin

89
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,368
Organic waste

90
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:15,744
During the same press conference the mirror held up new been victoriously

91
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,863
Ended up with reporters as cameras Flash

92
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:25,471
I would say it was 75% tongue and cheek

93
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:29,567
But there was also a hint of seriousness to it it was pretty clear

94
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:33,663
But he was confident the new green bins would solve our raccoon problems

95
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:37,503
Confident enough to stand in front of news cameras and say

96
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,575
Is not an option

97
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:44,159
But Amy was about to find out for herself

98
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,183
Weather defeat

99
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,207
Was an option

100
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:47,999
And spoiler alert

101
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,303
It was an option

102
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,287
Let's back up just a bit

103
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:03,103
This all started the way most things starting cities

104
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,407
With an RFP. PDF

105
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:07,967
Yeah they put out a request for proposals

106
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,551
Asking for a new generation green bin

107
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,087
And emphasizing

108
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:15,903
That it had to be rodent resistant

109
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,183
AKA

110
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,743
Animal resistant AKA raccoon proof

111
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:20,511
Please

112
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,047
The company that one

113
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,071
Was called

114
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:23,839
Rehrig

115
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:26,399
Pacific Dennis monestier with

116
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:30,495
Rehrig Pacific and I serve as the environmental sales manager

117
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,263
Canada

118
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:35,103
If the city of Toronto was in a war with raccoons this ladies and gentlemen

119
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,127
Was the General

120
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,919
In charge of a major front

121
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,199
And he took his role

122
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,479
Very seriously

123
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,783
I mean rehrig Pacific takes

124
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,647
New product development very very seriously and and there's a five pronged approach

125
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,695
Which we initiate

126
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,487
Dennis is in many ways

127
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,279
A classic sales guy

128
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:57,119
He wears shirts with his company logo he has a firm handshake

129
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,167
I found him to be

130
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:01,727
Extremely helpful and genuine

131
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:05,823
When he speaks about the green bin you can tell

132
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:12,479
He's really proud of it it's something that I'm very very passionate about not only being part of the design

133
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,503
Team

134
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,831
But I'm also Raisin in the city of Toronto so I know

135
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:19,647
What it means to me as a resident

136
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:26,303
Rehrig Pacific had a number of design criteria they were trying to meet with their green bin program

137
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:27,583
For example

138
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:32,703
Ben's would need to be picked up and dumped by an automatic on that reached out from the truck

139
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:37,311
The bandwidth need a lid that closed and locked to protect against raccoons

140
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:43,711
But the lid would also have to open up automatically when the bed was turned upside down and dumped into the truck by the owner

141
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:50,111
So we have to ensure that the lock itself disengages 100% of the time the container must

142
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:52,159
Function in extreme weather conditions

143
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:56,511
Ergonomics Easley open with one single hat we are looking at

144
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:59,583
You don't safety kids end up in the darndest places

145
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:05,983
Definitely don't want them in organic container but more importantly we don't want them locked inside the container Wheels limit

146
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:11,871
Nation of internal CashPoints any material that becomes trapped inside the container could pose significant risk

147
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:15,199
With respect to the X Factor for the residence

148
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:18,783
On top of the X Factor in the meddling kids

149
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,111
Rehrig Pacific had to think about Enemy Number One

150
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:23,903
The raccoons

151
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:28,511
Yes so we worked with an urban raccoon specialist to basic

152
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,047
Sickly understand

153
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,351
Raccoons likes

154
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,119
Dislike

155
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:39,007
Stair dexterity what they can and cannot do it was a local raccoon specialist by the name of

156
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:43,615
Suzanne McDonald's Dr Suzanne McDonald professor at York University

157
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:48,991
Study animal behavior calling her a raccoon specialist really downplays her accomplishments she is

158
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:51,807
A professor of biology and psychology

159
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,087
You have studied

160
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:55,391
Just about every animal you can think of

161
00:07:55,647 --> 00:08:00,511
She may have studied every animal you can think of but in Toronto there's only one animal that matters

162
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,303
In Toronto everybody tour

163
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:07,679
I work in Vancouver lot and nobody talks about raccoons are there raccoons all the time

164
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:12,031
So she wasn't that surprised when we are Pacific got in touch as they were designing there been

165
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:12,799
And

166
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,359
Asked me to talk to them about

167
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,151
Are raccoons work and I did

168
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,735
Will raccoons are omnivores

169
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,759
So that means I can eat

170
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,295
Everything

171
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:25,599
Really good teeth theyll use them

172
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,391
They don't want to use them

173
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,695
They want you to go away

174
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,999
You go away girl my yard

175
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:34,047
They also get a taste for human food

176
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:39,679
So once they get a taste for that Indian take out that we've thrown out that they've enjoyed our men on

177
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:43,263
Like berries I'm not eating berries we look at them they look at us

178
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,823
If you would look at a monkey in the face that look away

179
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,615
But reckons don't they look right out of

180
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,407
They look right through

181
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,991
You know they have pretty good senses of smell they have pretty good vision

182
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,783
But touches their superpower

183
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,063
I'm very persistent

184
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:59,903
It will work in a problem for hours and hours and hours and they're pretty strong

185
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:03,999
Rehrig Pacific took all of this information and applied it

186
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,023
Is there been design

187
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:08,863
There was multiple generations of the design

188
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:12,191
If multiple photorealistic rendering

189
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:15,007
In the end they came out with a Ben they believed in

190
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,079
It's an olive green 26 gallon container

191
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,383
That closes and locks

192
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:21,663
We felt

193
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:25,503
Very very confident with the success of that locking

194
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:28,063
Mechanism and the container itself

195
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:29,855
So

196
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,415
The new green bin rollout

197
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:35,231
Took about 18 months from start to finish

198
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:38,303
People are waiting for their new green bins and people are getting

199
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:42,911
Really excited about these things before they were rolled out on my street

200
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:46,239
They were rolled out on some of the streets nearby so

201
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:49,567
People on my street would have to walk by and see

202
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,871
At homes near us

203
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:53,919
Had the new green bin and we didn't

204
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:54,943
And you

205
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:58,527
It's sort of be thinking on your walk to the subway to go to work like

206
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,063
The hell where

207
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,855
Where's my Ben

208
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:05,695
But eventually Amy did get a bin of her own

209
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:06,719
So on the list

210
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:07,999
There is

211
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,023
A dial

212
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,071
Like a handle

213
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,351
That you turn

214
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,375
And

215
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,911
When it's in the

216
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,471
Horizontal position is open

217
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,263
When it's in the vertical position

218
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,799
It's secure

219
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,567
It's locked

220
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,383
You actually have to turn it in a way

221
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,175
That really would make it

222
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:30,783
Difficult if not impossible to turn if you don't have opposable thumbs

223
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,831
And contrary to popular belief

224
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:35,391
Raccoons don't have opposable thumbs

225
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:38,975
Even though they can move the thumb like did it on there creepy little hands

226
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:39,743
Little bit

227
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:44,095
For a while everything seems to be going according to plan

228
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,887
It's like some people worried

229
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,447
The new bands with working too well

230
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:52,287
In other words people were afraid that without the green bins as a food source

231
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,847
Maybe the raccoons were starving

232
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:58,175
So the way I became involved in all of this was

233
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,479
That in January of 2018

234
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:04,575
A friend sent me a note saying that he believed the new green bins

235
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:08,159
Had eliminated the raccoon population in Toronto

236
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,719
He actually use the word eliminated

237
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,279
Is any Intrepid reporter would do

238
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,327
Amy decided to look into it

239
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,375
I wrote a quick email to

240
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:20,191
Suzanne McDonald our local raccoon expert

241
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:21,727
And I said

242
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,263
Hey

243
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,311
Could racoons be dying

244
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,847
She decides

245
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:29,407
They're probably hiding from the cold

246
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,199
But she says

247
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:35,807
She would have more information a few months she said after I measure more dead raccoons

248
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,879
So a five-course wrote back immediately and said

249
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:39,903
Can I come

250
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:46,559
Animal Control was collecting raccoons killed by cars and storing them in freezers for Suzanne then come

251
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:49,887
Man and measure them in order to track the health of the population

252
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,935
From year to year and I do this

253
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,215
4 times a year

254
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:59,615
When you go in July it turns out and you bring up Frozen raccoon carcasses and it takes a while to measure them

255
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,407
They start to melt

256
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:04,991
Oh dear God you can imagine the maggots and the

257
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,807
All the things

258
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,599
That's fine I mean Society

259
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,879
Sweet Polly push through

260
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,951
Suzanne wouldn't have results of her data for a while

261
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:17,279
But while Amy was there watching her measured dead raccoons

262
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,303
Chester

263
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:21,887
Do you think it's possible they could learn how to get into the new green bin

264
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:23,935
And

265
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,983
She shook her head no she said

266
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:32,383
You know she'd filmed them trying and not one of them could do it she just said they won't they won't

267
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,199
Directions won't break into the

268
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,735
Into these green Vans

269
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:42,111
On the Raccoon proof

270
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,903
Green vandalism video

271
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,183
That was

272
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,231
Then about a week later

273
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:50,047
This story comes out

274
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,071
The look see your laughs

275
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,631
So watch a zoom into it here

276
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,423
Basically

277
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,727
Local Toronto resident who

278
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:00,543
Has film the video of a raccoon

279
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,567
Opening

280
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,103
His grain bin

281
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:06,175
Ask if that little tuck are we going

282
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:08,991
And just like kind of winking at the camera almost

283
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,527
Really

284
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:14,367
This was not the only report of a band being broken into

285
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:17,695
Although it was the first to include video which quickly went viral

286
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,231
Much to the dismay

287
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,255
Dennis monast

288
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,791
From rehrig Pacific

289
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:25,887
For somebody just to come out and say all the container doesn't work

290
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,191
You know it's frustrating

291
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:31,263
The videos going to says don't tell the whole story

292
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,287
A couple of break-ins

293
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,335
Doesn't mean the design is flawed

294
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,383
The screw might be loosened too much

295
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,943
And if you just simply tighten it

296
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:39,711
A little bit

297
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:40,735
It might

298
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,527
Prevent the issue

299
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:45,343
Dennis is frustrated by the fact that

300
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:48,415
Sometimes when people have issues with their green beans

301
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:52,767
They don't call the city they don't report their issues to 311

302
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,303
Instead they sometimes

303
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,327
Call

304
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,863
Local newspaper

305
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,911
And then it becomes a story

306
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,703
I think you said something to me like

307
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,287
You know when your car breaks down you don't call the Toronto Star

308
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,823
You call the mechanic

309
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:11,199
I don't know if for some reason you know Toronto specifically that they loved it glamorize raccoon

310
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:15,551
The city for its part playing the handful of break-ins on user error

311
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:19,391
And the city's response was to suggest that these homeowners

312
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:26,047
Locking their bins properly and to emphasize they had only had a handful of complaints at a 400

313
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,071
50000

314
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:27,839
Green Vans

315
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:32,191
The suggestion being that if Joe in Yorkville had a problem with his Ben

316
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:34,751
And maybe the problem was Joe

317
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,031
And not the Ben

318
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,615
So

319
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:46,015
Soon after I woke up one morning and walked outside

320
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:48,063
And saw that

321
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:52,671
My neighbor's green bin was on the ground and Arlene way

322
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,719
And there was

323
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,487
Food

324
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,511
Everywhere

325
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,559
So I texted my neighbor and said

326
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:01,375
Directions of garden into your green bin

327
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:04,959
She said you know what the hell kind of raccoons

328
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:05,727
Get into the

329
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:08,031
The green Vans now

330
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:11,615
This point Amy had been convinced by the city's argument

331
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:18,015
There was no problem with the Benz the problem was the users

332
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,063
But you didn't lock it properly

333
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:24,415
I still have the text message and when I read it I cringe a little bit

334
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,487
Thank you locked it properly

335
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,255
Caroline

336
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:32,351
But Amy didn't get to space mode for long

337
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,887
Two nights later

338
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,935
Her own been with Wonder

339
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,471
My

340
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,751
Husband and I get it

341
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:41,055
Group text message from Caroline

342
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:45,151
Directions of gotten into your green bin

343
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:48,735
At this point on Floors because

344
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,063
My husband is a person who locks

345
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,599
Thanks and checks locks

346
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,623
67 *

347
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,159
It seemed the reporter

348
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,695
I just become a character

349
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,719
Your Own Story

350
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:00,767
I'm thinking like first of all

351
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:06,143
Do they like this is so weird that they know that I was looking into the stuff

352
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,191
Am I being targeted

353
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:12,799
Amy Cole the city who said ma'am please you probably just have a broken handle

354
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,591
And they said some workers out to fix

355
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:17,407
And they replace the lid on my band as if

356
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,175
Caution

357
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:19,711
Even though they

358
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,991
Couldn't find anything

359
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:21,759
Wrong with it

360
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,551
She also wrote to the raccoon

361
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,343
Expert Suzanne McDonald who was

362
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,623
Because

363
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:29,439
She's always secretly been on Team raccoon

364
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,999
She wrote back almost immediately and said that

365
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:32,767
Is

366
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,047
Awesome

367
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,071
And she said

368
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,375
I'm going to I'm going to loan you a trail camera

369
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,167
And you have to see how they're doing it

370
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:43,007
So I get the I get the camera from Suzanne

371
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,799
We meet up at the zoo one day

372
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:49,919
I go to our local grocery store and I got a couple of chickens

373
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,967
Put the chicken in the green bin

374
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:55,039
Some of the chicken grease all over the grain bin

375
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:57,599
The first night raccoons did not come

376
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,391
The second night I went out

377
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,951
To the front porch actually with my toddler

378
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,743
We peeked around the corner

379
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,791
And my my daughter said

380
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,375
Then was down

381
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,399
Is a mess

382
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,447
I took the camera upstairs

383
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,727
And press play

384
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,519
On the video that I captured

385
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:22,175
It's almost as though the raccoons knew what I was doing and they were like let's give her a really good

386
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,455
Shah here

387
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:25,503
This one is going to go viral

388
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,039
Cameras pointing at

389
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,063
The bends

390
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,599
And then all of a sudden this

391
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,391
This mama raccoon

392
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,183
Come skulking out

393
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,207
And

394
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:37,023
She just pulled the bend down like

395
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:43,679
She gets out of the way like at this point you can tell she knows what she's doing when she's not going to stand in the way and get crushed by the Ben

396
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:49,311
No she's going to pull it at the exact right angle and it just falls down with like

397
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:53,663
And turns around and looks at the camera

398
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,455
As if to say

399
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:56,991
Watch this

400
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:03,903
And then she turns the handle into soap it likes it turns it opens it just like I would

401
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,439
And then they go

402
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,767
The key seem to be knocking down the bin

403
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:11,327
Which made the handle much easier to turn

404
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,399
When it's on the ground you can just kind of

405
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,423
Holonis

406
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,727
Like as if you're pulling a lever

407
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:22,079
You know you can almost bet your paws added or like pull it to the side

408
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,615
On August 30th

409
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:27,711
2018 Amy published an article in the Toronto Star with her video

410
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:30,271
And as these things tend to do in Toronto

411
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,551
It went viral

412
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,855
Thousands of torontonians watched

413
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,927
As the protagonist handily pulled down the Ben

414
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,999
Flashing her glowing eyes at the camera

415
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,047
Showed off how easily

416
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,071
She could open it

417
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:46,143
Amy got a bunch of emails and comments on the article

418
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:48,447
People saying that this was happening to them too

419
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,983
The city maintained

420
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,543
They were getting relatively few complaints overall

421
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,383
What Amy told them as monitor

422
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,663
Cathay pacific

423
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,991
But the raccoons were getting into the bin that his company designed

424
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:03,295
He decided to pay her house call

425
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:06,879
You know I personally wanted to go out there myself to

426
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:11,743
Inspect the container and to do some pork for testing on the handle itself

427
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,791
Some Heroes don't wear capes

428
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,327
Paper polo shirts

429
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,631
Company logo on the breast pocket

430
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,935
The date Dennis came over

431
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,727
My neighbor Mike came over

432
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:25,311
As soon as he saw this guy in my driveway working on the green bin

433
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,871
But Mike had no idea that

434
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:28,895
This is

435
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,431
The green van guy

436
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:36,575
It seemed like there was a gang of neighbors that came up all of a sudden out of nowhere and it was just like

437
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:42,975
All we have in a week we had we have some some problems with with the raccoons getting into our bins

438
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:45,279
Getting in everybody's been and he's just

439
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,815
Ripping on

440
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:47,839
The green bins

441
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,375
And the waste of money

442
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,167
Dennis took it all like a champ

443
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:57,055
He tightened up everyone's handles so they be particularly hard for little raccoon Paws to turn

444
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,359
But it hasn't solved the problem

445
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,663
Having accepted defeat

446
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:06,015
Amy nail keeps her bins tied to a wall so raccoons can't knock them over

447
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,319
And she can't help but Wonder

448
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,343
How soon

449
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,671
What this knowledge about how to open the Benz spreads

450
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,439
The rest

451
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,975
The raccoon Nation

452
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:16,255
Raccoons don't

453
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,303
Teach each other these things but

454
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,399
It's called social learning and even most monkeys don't do that

455
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,935
And so it's not like this

456
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:26,495
Innovation is going to spread across the city

457
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:32,383
Suzanne McDonald doesn't think most raccoons in Toronto currently have what it takes to get into the new green compost bins

458
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:34,687
That perfect combination of strength

459
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,735
Intelligence and determination

460
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:39,039
Amy just happen to encounter

461
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,575
An extra gifted one

462
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:43,903
We call her the genius raccoon because I think it's amazing that she did it

463
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:49,535
Suzanne finally finished her dead raccoon study

464
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,607
Toronto's favorite front of me is as bad as ever

465
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:56,703
She thinks that's because even though most of them can't get into the compost

466
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,751
They moved on to a different solution

467
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,799
Good old-fashioned

468
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:01,567
Garbage

469
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:04,383
Are raccoons are not starving to death that's for sure

470
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:07,199
She doesn't rule out that Anna for all future

471
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:09,503
We might end up creating an Uber raccoon

472
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:12,831
One like Amy's that can get into just about anything

473
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:16,416
She studied raccoons in cities and they are on the whole

474
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:18,464
Smarter than their world counterparts

475
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:23,072
Urban raccoons are constantly having new problems place in front of them to solve

476
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:25,120
And they keep figuring them out

477
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:31,520
And Suzanne and Dennis both tell people that the green beans were never advertised as raccoon proof

478
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,312
Only raccoon resistant

479
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:34,848
Nothing

480
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,640
Is raccoon proof they say

481
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:41,248
Which is a small concession that well the front of the line is holding for now

482
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:42,784
The war

483
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,320
Against raccoons

484
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:46,112
Continues

485
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,776
More raccoon news with our in-house raccoon correspondent Kurt Kolstad

486
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:04,800
After this

487
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,712
Between the beats

488
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:14,016
Bongs and chatter of our devices

489
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:14,784
We're immersed

490
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,344
In a cluttered World a man-made sound

491
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:18,624
If

492
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,976
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexa

493
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:28,864
Is talking to me and my wife is in another room and a kid is in another room and we're all hearing. Voice

494
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:29,888
Technology

495
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:30,656
You talk to us

496
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,960
It is a creation of Sonic trash

497
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:36,032
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

498
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:39,616
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

499
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,408
To make them more human

500
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:45,504
Turn the living room lights on

501
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,040
Okay

502
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,832
Dim the living room lights

503
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:49,856
50%

504
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:51,648
Okay

505
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:58,048
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

506
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:00,352
Makes for a much more natural

507
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,120
Experience

508
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,912
Turn the living room lights on

509
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:06,496
Dim the living room lights to 50

510
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,264
80%

511
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:15,712
We're presenting two special episodes from 99percentinvisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation about how are sound

512
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:17,504
Landscape is impacting our health

513
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:20,064
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

514
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,880
Look for them Friday is May 17th and May 24th

515
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:23,648
Right here

516
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:25,184
Npit

517
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,536
We need to talk about something

518
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,840
Constipation abdominal pain and bloating

519
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:38,240
You tell yourself it's not that bad you take laxatives modify your diet and exercise routine but thinking about it all the time is

520
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:44,640
Frustrating but doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again and you don't know

521
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:47,456
Know why then it may be time to seek help

522
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:53,856
Go to oh my God. Info podcast we can learn more about your symptoms that's oh my God

523
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:55,648
Infowars podcast

00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,672
Oh my God

525
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,792
If you listen to the show record

526
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:04,096
You know that Kurt Cole said has a background in Arkansas

527
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:06,400
But you also read the articles on our side

528
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,192
You probably also know

529
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,240
He's really into raccoons to

530
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:12,288
So when these two interest intersect

531
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,848
Say a raccoon going viral on the internet

532
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:18,432
Climbing up a downtown Saint Paul office tower earlier this year

533
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,456
All over that store

534
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,480
Oh yeah instant

535
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:24,832
Local news is there covering the story on the scene in Minnesota

536
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,880
But I'm out here

537
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,928
Actual building that the raccoon is crying

538
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,720
I got super into it

539
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,512
Asada material they started

540
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:34,304
Diagramming

541
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,072
The route

542
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:35,840
Raccoon totem

543
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:36,608
The top

544
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,400
So if you want like a

545
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,680
Like straight up

546
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:42,240
Kennedy assassination style deconstruction

547

549
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:48,896
Curtis here today with a story of a different

550
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:49,920
Famous raccoon

551
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:51,712
From nearly a century ago

552
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:52,480
1

553
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:53,248
That eventually

554
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:56,320
Resided in a particularly famous work of American architect

555
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,344
The White House

556
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,368
Oh yes

557
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,904
History's not exactly

558
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,744
There's this one in particular that really saying that

559
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,536
Especially around Thanksgiving

560
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,072
Her name is Rebecca

561
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,608
In the 1920s

562
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,144
She was sent to president count

563
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,424
Coolidge

564
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,216
In Mississippi

565
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,776
But this raccoon wasn't meant to be a pet

566
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:19,104
The idea was actually that should be served up as part of the holiday

567
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:22,688
Which is not the most traditional Thanksgiving meal

568
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,480
You know I mean not

569
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:26,528
Today at least but a century ago

570
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:27,552
Wild animals

571
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:29,856
Much more common to see

572
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:30,880
Dinner plates

573
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:33,184
Meals with Docker turtle or opossum work

574
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,000
Typical minute some cases that were even Regional delicacy

575
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:40,096
And then also you know sending animals as food to the White House for the holidays was a

576
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:40,864
Pretty popular

577
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,912
To the president getting center right

578
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,192
Wasn't Maybe...

579
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:44,960
But

580
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:46,240
Him keeping him as a pet

581
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:47,776
Was out of the garden

582
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:51,616
Right I mean that's a little bit more unusual when we think about president

583
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:52,384
And that

584
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,432
Thanksgiving we usually think of that turkey

585
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:57,248
Keyparts lady would walk her around on a leash during the day

586
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,272
And then at night

587
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,040
Cheap curl up

The fireplace

591
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,880
It's looking pretty good bad

592
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:06,464
Well yeah and that's one side of it the other side

593
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,768
Is that she was still a wild animal

594
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:12,096
NTB kink out of Infamous for chewing her way out of her

595
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:12,864

LV stories

599
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:20,544
Chase her around while she runs up trees

600
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:23,104
Yeah so she was a bit of a handful

601
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,128
Call too but

602
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:26,432
She got to hang out in the white house sometimes

603
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:28,224
Andres the time she got this

604
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,504
Little wooden houses

605
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,528
They put up for her on the side

606
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,576
So it would seem a little bit of a house

607
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:33,600
But she seems to have

608
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:41,024
Yeah she did and she live with the cool just for a while and then the first couple handed off to a zoo

609
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:43,584
Who is the time

610
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,864
Maybe Rebecca bit

611
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,400
Calvin because one day he

612
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:48,960
Came out with a bandage on his hand

613
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:51,776
But Grace leader wrote very fondly of this

614
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:52,800
White House raccoon

615
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,848
According to her Rebecca quote

616
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:57,152
Enjoyed nothing better than being placed in a bath

617
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,688
With a little water in it

618
00:26:58,944 --> 00:26:59,456
And given a cake

619
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,224
Pick up soap with witch

620
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:03,040
In this fashion she would amuse her so

621
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,320
Self for an hour or more

622
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,648
So obviously if nighttime

623
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:10,208
Can iPads have anymore raccoon stories they should

00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,304

Might cost you your life

661
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:37,760
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

662
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,112
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

663
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:46,464
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like a dad

664
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:50,816
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

665
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:53,120
Actually if I'm being honest

666
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:55,168
I'm one of the main guy to know how to do that

667
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:59,520
A few days ago Wesley Stern

668
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:02,848
After that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

669
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:06,176
Was found dead in my private gym

670
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:09,504
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

671
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,856
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

672
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:14,880
Now

673
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:17,184
I need to clear my name

674
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,280
