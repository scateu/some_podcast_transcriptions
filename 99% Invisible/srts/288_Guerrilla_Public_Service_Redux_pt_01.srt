I'm Roman Mars

29
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:34,464
At some point in your life you probably encountered a problem in the built world

30
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,304
Something that was poorly designed and effects was obvious to you

31
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:43,168
Maybe a door that open the wrong way we're poorly painted marker on the road

32
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,032
I know this is kind of stuff all the time even more so now after creating the show

33
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:51,360
I'm sorry if you do too because you listened to the show

34
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,408
And mostly when we see these things

35
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:55,456
Wii Grumble on the inside

36
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,224
In that

37
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,248
Do nothing

38
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,064
There are all sorts of reasons for inertia

39
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,344
We don't know how to fix

40
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,368
It's not ours

41
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,136
Fix

42
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:06,464
We could get in trouble that's producer David Weinberg

43
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,768
You might notice these little design flaws

44
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:09,792
4 years

45
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:10,816
Silently

46
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:11,584
Human

47
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,608
Until

48
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,888
One day

49
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,936
He calls me instead

50
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:17,728
Okay we're doing at

51
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,080
It was early Sunday morning August 5th

52
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:24,384
2001 Los Angeles Califor

53
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:28,736
Richard ankrom and a group of friends were on the 4th Street Bridge

54
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,016
Of the 110 freeway

55
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,064
They were about to commit

56
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:35,392
Give me a high-profile dangerous situation

57
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:37,696
Natalie can I get arrested I could kill somebody

58
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,464
Really

59
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,744
Was terrified of that

60
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,768
But let's back up

61
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,072
About 20 years prior

62
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:48,192
Richard ankrom an artist living in Orange County was driving north on the 110 freeway

63
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:50,240
As he passed through downtown Los Angeles

64
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,800
Who's going to merge onto another freeway

65
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:53,824
Dye I-5 North

66
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,128
You missed the exit got lost

67
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,920
For some reason

68
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:58,944
It just stuck

69
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:06,112
Years later when Richard moved to downtown Los Angeles he was driving on the same stretch of freeway where he got lost at

70
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,136
Decade before

71
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:11,488
We looked up at the Big Green rectangular sign suspended above

72
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,280
I realize why I missed the exit

73
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:14,560
Because it wasn't

74
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:16,096
Adequately signed

75
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,632
Bad wayfinding

76
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:21,728
The exit for the I-5 wasn't indicated on the green overhead sign

77
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,520
There was even a big open

78
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:27,104
Space where there should have been a blue and red Interstate Shield

79
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,384
And above that

80
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,920
It should have said north

81
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,712
It was clear to Richard

82
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,480
Caltrain

83
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:35,040
California Department of Transportation

84
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,064
I made a mistake

85
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:42,208
Sir Richard and artist and sign painter decided to make the Interstate 5 North Shield himself

86
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:46,048
In the place he thought it should have been all along

87
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:48,096
High above the 110 freeway

88
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,936
You would call it an act of Guerrilla public service

89
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,728
I would like to do is to be

90
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,776
Public servant

91
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:56,544
Ord

92
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,824
Or actually to show

93
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,616
What you can do with artwork

94
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:03,968
You can put in plain sight have a functioning working thing for everyone to use

95
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:08,064
Richard started by studying LA freeway sign

96
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:10,368
Holding a Pantone swatches

97
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,392
Perfectly matched

98
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,160
The paint color

99
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:16,512
Did dangled over Bridges to measure the exact dimensions of other signs

100
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,047
And most importantly

101
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:22,911
He downloaded the Necronomicon of California road signage

102
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,447
Batkid

103
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,263
The mutcd

104
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:30,079
The manual on uniform traffic control devices

105
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:36,735
Quote to provide for uniform standards and specifications for all official traffic-control devices in

106
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,039
It's not a beach read

107
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,623
I have a lazy Sunday afternoon

108
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,927
All aspects around line so

109
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:45,951
People can

110
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,487
Bid on projects

111
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,279
Richard wanted his sign

112
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,559
To be built to the exact

113
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,583
Specifications

114
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:52,607
Caltrans

115
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,911
Which were designed to be read by motorists

116
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,191
Traveling at high speed

117
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:58,751
Chill with

118
00:04:59,007 --> 00:04:59,775
The five on it

119
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:00,543
3 ft

120
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,823
Roughly High

121
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:02,847
And why

122
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,407
Less than eight

123
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,175
7 inch barrel

124
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,991
It's still pretty strong

125
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,295
And above that it cuz the word North

126
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,087
And that was

127
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,367
I will. 14in

128
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,135
By 5 ft

129
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,951
And again I use the same typeface that we

130
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,999
Was there in the same signs I tried to match

131
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,791
Closest I could so

132
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,071
It wouldn't be obvious

133
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,095
Caltrans

134
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,167
Richard's brand new edition

135
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:29,983
Had to blend in perfectly with the existing signage

136
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,031
Which have been collecting dirt and smog

137
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:32,799
Decades

138
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,591
I sprayed the whole thing with a

139
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,127
Right then glaze

140
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,407
Gray

141
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,175
Can Knockdown

142
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,015
After he finished it Richard sign his name on the back of it

143
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,295
Black marker

144
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,343
Painter signing a canvas

145
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,903
Then came the next phase of the project

146
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,183
The installation

147
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:50,719
Cheap land

148
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,255
The Precision of a bank

149
00:05:54,047 --> 00:06:00,191
Ebody disguise a white hard hat and an orange vest so he'd look like a Caltrans worker basically looked at

150
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,727
Deportes as best I could

151
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:06,079
Animated decal for his pickup truck meant to look vaguely official that said

152
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,359
Aesthetic

153
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,383
Deconstruction

154
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,687
The night before the insulation

155
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:12,479
Richard drove out to the site

156
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,247
Kids movies

157
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,551
Supplies to the be easy to get to the next morning

158
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,087
Randolph Utah

159
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:17,855
He took me to the

160
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,623
The spot

161
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,391
Xiaomi

162
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,159
Stashed

163
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:23,231
Okay we're basically here

164
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:27,583
Right now the it isn't that fit but it was a lot thicker and I had

165
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:31,423
Play sweet but I not trade stash the ladder and the sign

166
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,983
After he hit his things

167
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,263
He climbed a tree

168
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,543
I just sat there

169
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,591
Don't do everything

170
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:43,199
I just heard calm myself down by being there and hang around with it and I

171
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:43,967
4

172
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,039
Richard was worried that he might drop the sign

173
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,599
Onto the road below

174
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,391
Drivers going 60

175
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:54,207
B+ miles an hour would have no time to react

176
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:56,255
Something landed on the road in front of them

177
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,303
Or Worse onto their car

178
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,095
That was a scariest

179
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,375
Saying about

180
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:02,911
Somebody got hurt

181
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,519
Project

182
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,567
It would have defeated the whole

183
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,591
Idea

184
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,383
But despite some reservations

185
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,151
Richard was

186
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:13,919
Pretty confident

187
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,199
Call the Whole Thing Off

188
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,223
And

189
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,759
He gone too far to turn back

190
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,879
And that brings us back to the morning of August 5th

191
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:23,903
2001

192
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:30,303
Richard did not act alone he asked several friends to film the insulation from different Vantage points

193
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:33,631
Amy inoue was one of the friends he Enlisted the film

194
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,655
We did it

195
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,703
6 a.m. or 7 a.m. on

196
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,471
Sunday morning

197
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,007
It was tense

198
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:39,775
Because

199
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,055
We all thought we were going to

200
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:49,503
Richard had chosen the Sunday morning to put up the sign knowing that there would be little traffic and The Morning Light Rising above

201
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,319
The skyscrapers would be just right for filming

202
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:58,975
What he hadn't anticipated was that Caltrans at also picked that morning to do work on the same stretch

203
00:07:59,231 --> 00:07:59,743
Batch of Highway

204
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:02,303
Yes they happen to be doing some other work

205
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,839
On the freeway

206
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:04,607
Just south of

207
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,423
When they saw the Caltrans workers

208
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,959
They thought about turning back

209
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:13,567
But I had surmised after all this is a pretty large city there be more than one sign

210
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,639
My assumption was that think the other guy was too

211
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,431
Richard Park his truck

212
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,735
When everyone was in position with their cameras

213
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,503
You went to work

214
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:24,063
The hardest part was getting over the razor wire

215
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,087
With the ladder

216
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:28,415
Once he was up on the catwalk really 30ft

217
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,183
About the highway

218
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,487
He started screwing in the new sign

219
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,767
Careful not to drop any

220
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:33,535
Screws

221
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,303
Cars below

222
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,839
Halfway into it

223
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:36,607
We just

224
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,887
Felt like okay

225
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:44,287
Lincolnway with it or what.

226
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,359
The whole thing took less

227
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,383
30 minutes

228
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,663
As soon as it was up

229
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,479
Richard pack up his letter rushed back to his truck

230
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:58,623
Blended back in the city awesome

231
00:08:59,135 --> 00:08:59,647
I think we all went out

232
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,487
We're super relieved in

233
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,255
Really happy

234
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:11,167
Only a small group of people knew that the Interstate 5 shield with the word North hanging above the 110 freeway

235
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,191
Was it work

236
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,751
He didn't stay to us Don't Tell Em

237
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,311
So our friends all knew about it

238
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,175
Happy

239
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,223
But it never

240
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,527
Tweaked-out

241
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,343
For a while

242
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,111
For a while

243
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,903
For nine months

244
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:34,207
The secret stayed within a small community

245
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,511
And then Richard sprengeri

246
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,791
Repeat the story

247
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:43,167
What the hell Gary why can't you be cool just be cool Gary Richard Secret

248
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,959
Without the Caltrans

249
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:49,567
And the Press from the fake magnetic sign on his beat up blue truck

250
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:55,967
Work order proclaiming rush but it is against the law to Capron says it has no plans at all without charge

251
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:58,527
Cards Against actually found out what happened

252
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,319
Apparently they sent a crew out there to inspect

253
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:04,159
Richard was hoping to get it signed back from Caltrans after they took it down

254
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:06,463
He was thinking you would hang it in an art gallery

255
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:10,303
But Caltrans didn't take the sign down

256
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,351
The Caltrans inspection

257
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,631
Cuz that's really that

258
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,399
Define elope

259
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,679
Cast of how am I

260
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,215
How good the artwork is

261
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,263
It stayed up for 8 years

262
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,823
9 months and

263
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,615
14 days I believe

264
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,639
It's not exactly

265
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,663
Pretty close to

266
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:31,039
Interviews about the incident with other news organization

267
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,831
Caltrans didn't exactly

268
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,623
Dawn Richard's handiwork

269
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,159
They were pretty kind about

270
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,951
Here's the Caltrans spokesperson

271
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:41,279
At the time he did a good job but we don't want him to do it again

272
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:45,119
And in fact you did such a good job that I'd like to offer him a job application

273
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,935
More than eight years after Richard sun went up

274
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:51,263
He got a call from a friend who noticed some workers taking it down

275
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:54,847
Richard contacted Caltrans to ask if he can have his signed back

276
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,639
By the time I tracked him down

277
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:57,919
It already been crushed

278
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,687
Bale

279
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,455
Going for

280
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,247
Who knows what it turned into

281
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,271
You could be a waffle iron

282
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:08,159
After Caltrans took down Richard sign they replaced it with a brand new one

283
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,695
But this time

284
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,487
Incorporated his ideas

285
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,767
Into the new design

286
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:15,327
They out of the 5 north and The Shield

287
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,351
Not only

288
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,375
That's fine

289
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,655
What to do additional one

290
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,423
Up the road

291
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,079
A little epilogue

292
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:30,687
Richard's highway sign is a happily Ever After Story the sign work

293
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,223
People appreciated it

294
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,759
No one got hurt thankfully

295
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:37,087
Even Caltrans was really pretty nice about the whole thing

296
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:43,999
There's another gorilla sign story out of New York City a group that calls itself the efficient passenger project has been hanging

297
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,791
Find in New York subway station

298
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:46,815
To tell people

299
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:50,143
Where they can board the train to make the most efficient transfer

300
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:55,007
The project is not at all affiliated with the Metropolitan Transit Authority

301
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:57,567
But the signs look just like MTA sign

302
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,871
Black with white helvetica lettering

303
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,895
They say things like

304
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:04,223
Bored here for best transfer to the 4 5 and 6 train

305
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,527
Board here for best transfer

306
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,063
F&M trains

307
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:14,463
It's the kind of knowledge that you build up over time as a regular Subway Rider and this gorilla sign maker is offering

308
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,743
To everyone

309
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,791
I know some of the plot of the signs

310
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,327
Not all New Yorkers are

311
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:22,143
These are secrets some say

312
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:28,543
People should have to earn unbalanced the cars they say leave signage to The Experts

313
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,335
The MTA for their parts

314
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,127
Is taking down the signs

315
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,407
As fast as they go up

316
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,711
MTA spokesman Kevin Ortiz

317
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,759
Told us in an email that quote

318
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,551
Posting of the signs

319
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,575
Is considered

320
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,343
An act

321
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,367
Vandalize

322
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:46,463
Point being if you decide to undertake an act

323
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,999
Guerrilla public service

324
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,279
Just know

325
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,071
It may not be received

326
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:51,839
That sucks

327
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:05,919
There been a bunch of fascinating extralegal Public Service intervention since we are this story a few years ago

328
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,455
A Roundup of those

329
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,479
After this

330
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:13,855
Between the beats

331
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:16,159
Bongs and chatter of our devices

332
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:16,927
We're immersed

333
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,743
In a cluttered World a man-made sound

334
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:20,767
If

335
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:27,167
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife isn't

336
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:31,007
All hearing.

337
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,031
Technology

338
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:32,799
You talk to us

339
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,103
It is a creation of Sonic trash

340
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:38,175
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

341
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:41,759
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

342
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,551
To make them more human

343
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,647
Turn the living room lights on

344
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,439
Okay

345
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,975
Dim the living room lights

346
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:51,999
50%

347
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:53,791
Okay

348
00:13:54,559 --> 00:14:00,191
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

349
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:02,495
Makes for a much more natural

350
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,263
Experience

351
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,055
Turn the living room lights on

352
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,383
Dim the living room lights

353
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,151
50%

354
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:16,831
We're presenting to special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

355
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:19,647
About how are soundscape is impacting our health

356
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,207
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

357
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:25,023
Look for them Friday is May 17th and May 24th

358

E9pay

360
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,679
We need to talk about something

361
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:38,079
Constipation abdominal pain and bloating yourself it's not that bad you take laxatives you modify your diet

362
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,895
Does routine but thinking about it all the time is frustrating

363
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:47,295
It doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again and you don't know why

364
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,599
Then it may be time to seek help

Flask podcast

369
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:07,775
The efficient passenger project isn't the only group that's gotten ambitious with modifying New York City subway signage

370
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:14,175
99p ice Kirk Olson is here to talk about a similar intervention and some other creative works of gorillas

371
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:19,551
Thank you actually led me to the story of a Rhode Island School of Design Sue neighbor Ryan Murphy

372
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,879
Also took up the challenge of Subway signage

373
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:27,999
And his project was pretty simple but also pretty clever he installed a bunch of signs

374
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:31,071
About exits at eye-level about 5 feet up

375
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,351
On stair risers

376
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:37,727
Daddy was that train passengers looking at the staircase from below could then figure out if those steps would take them

377
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,751
Where they wanted to go

378
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:42,847
Stair risers are basically the flat front of a stair that you see

379
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,127
From the front

380
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,943
Yeah so think you walking up the staircase it would be

381
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:53,343
Right in front of you and you just have to look at it and be like oh yeah that's the exit I want to be able to get a more easily find a way

382
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:56,415
The system is a lot of real estate that signs to Havant

383
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,439
Occupied all that much

384
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:00,767
Ashley and of course

385
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:07,167
Like the other sign project has got taken back down and clearly the empty is not particularly open to gorilla

386
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:14,335
Snopes there they're not have you covered a bunch of these on the website over the years ohyeah Super entry Buddies

387
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,871
Kinds of gorilla public service

388
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,687
And those unpaid activist who do them

389
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:22,271
Creative people who see everyday problems as Civic design Opera

390
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:25,343
And mostly of course there were cats removed

391
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:28,927
But in some cases these projects actually lead to something more permanent

392
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:31,999
Kind of like the highway sign that David talked about in our peace

393
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:35,839
Exactly end up here in Northern California there's another group called

394
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,143
The San Francisco transformation eejit

395
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,983
Which is of course a spoof on the city's Transportation agency

396
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:46,591
And their crew has illegally built a number of gorilla bike Lanes around the city

397
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:51,199
And often they just kind of Barclays out with ordinary orange traffic cone switch

398
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,991
So you can just pick up and haul off

399
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,807
Since I get taken away with a mainly due

400
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,087
Is highlight

401
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,111
Design problem

402
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:58,879
With the current

403
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,183
Yeah in a lot of cases

404
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:07,839
But in late 2016 they decided to create a protected bike lane on a stretch of road along Golden Gate Park

405
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,631
And they use what are called Soft

406
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,167
Or see if hit post

407
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,215
Which are fut High

408
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,495
Bezel reflectix

409
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:22,175
And these provide a visible and physical presence but they're also easy to knock over so they don't really pose a danger to

410
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,735
But instead of just taking the post

411
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:27,295
Style and the city did something pretty remarkable

412
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:31,647
They agreed to run with the idea and it's all protected van on that same spot

413
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:34,463
Legal reasons I couldn't just leave up the post-credit

414
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:36,767
Same idea

415
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:41,887
I mean it seems like a pretty big win for like a really small group of people that are activists for bike safe

416
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:45,471
Yeah it was totally a 3-point shot for these guys at the transformation

417
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:49,823
But there are three goals of one drawing attention to unsafe conditions

418
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:56,223
To increasing safety for cyclists and pedestrians and three getting the city on board with more rapid and effective safety

419
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:59,807
And so this is I mean we talked about ones that happening

420
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:00,831
California

421
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:03,903
Rena Ware particularly Rowdy bunch of

422
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:07,487
Leftists in such a mean does it happen another places

423
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:11,327
Yeah it does not totally unique to California and

424
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,143
Cruising your cabinet install gorilla bike Lanes

425
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:19,775
Ellen Seattle there's this group called The reasonably polite seattleites that actually made a lane

426
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:22,079
They got taken down with initially

427
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,639
He was like really nice about it

428
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:30,015
Politely offered to return the post to the installers and then finally they actually agreed that

429
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,295
Just put that girl away

430
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,063
Backup

431
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:38,463
There's activity andele there's activity in San Francisco activity in Seattle is this a West Coast liberal thing

432
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:44,863
It kind of seems like there's a lot of that I talked to you earlier this year

433
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:47,423
Call the San Francisco Public bench project

434
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:53,823
2nd and everything isn't so much about Road Safety is it is about just making the city a nicer place to live by installing free

435
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,591
Free benches

436
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:58,431
So I contacted their founder 499 Pi feature and he said

437
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:03,551
Basically like he's been on boards and committees he's worked on promoting public space but he really finds his

438
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:09,183
Building benches to be more rewarding and over the past 40 years he's actually installed

439
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,231
Or 70 benches around the city

440
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:13,791
And he keeps improving his design as he goes to

441
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,583
It's so how does that work as heat

442
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:21,983
Never gets permission to do emerges doesn't Rogue no matter what

443
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:28,383
Make them cheaper these loopholes in the city codes which allow for sidewalk Furniture if you can of meet the right guy

444
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:31,455
Criteria and you don't obstruct sidewalk so you have found a gap

445
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,223
To put them in

446
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:36,575
In most cases he requests a bench for a specific spot

447
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:38,367
And then they agreed to keep an eye on it

448
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:41,439
And then if the community feedback is positive the bench becomes the

449
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:47,583
Does permanent picture of the neighborhood and he also offers tablets instructions to anybody who wants to can I DIY this and

450
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:48,607
Take up the mantle

451
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:54,751
Okay so it's easier to beg for forgiveness than to ask for permission

452
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:58,335
3 got interventions and built spaces like roads and sidewalks but

453
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:02,431
Activity related to Green spaces to

454
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,455
Indeed there is

455
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:09,855
The freeze Guerrilla gardening covers a lot of ground but essentially refers to any active planting where people

456
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,135
Aren't supposed to plant

457
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:14,719
So give me a garden without a permit would be a sort of simple example

458
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:16,511
And these can be about

459
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:19,839
Beautification activism food production or a combination

460
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:22,655
Does Little League Grassroots reaction to

461
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,679
Top down urban planning

462
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:28,543
Yeah a lot of cases it can be pretty small-scale and incremental like filling in vacant lot

463
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,591
Where to get a nicer Greenery

464
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:34,943
I'm you can find actually recipes and design instructions online describing how

465
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:35,967
To build water called

466
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:38,527
Seed bombs

467
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,831
The typically are balls of clay

468
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:46,719
You know compost and maybe a combination of local or Regional wildflower seeds and people

469
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:47,487
Petoskey

470
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:50,303
Bombs Over fences and obedient

471
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,119
Is better hard to access Newton Billy be able to get to the

472
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:56,959
And not all the interventions are just about

473
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:00,799
Beauty really they're they're trying to create something functional on the environment

474
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:06,175
Yeah I'm into this group in San Francisco of gorillas grafters and their idea is I mean

475
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:10,783
We have a lot of greenery but it's mostly

476
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,599
Is they don't want fruit creating messages attracting animals

477
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:18,464
And these guys are grafting fruit bearing branches on the trees in the city

478
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,512
To try to provide like local food source

479
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:22,560
Wow

480
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:28,960
And they don't care about the food messes and stuff well I think I think that their idea is that you know the good outweighs the bad

481
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,360
So far these interventions have been about creating a better Urban environment for the public good

482
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:39,200
But not every single one of these sign changes are doing it

483
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:41,504
Solely for other people's benefit

484
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:47,392
Oh yeah I know know there's there's definitely examples on the other end of the spectrum and there's a guy in particular who just died

485
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,160
HIPAA news

486
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,952
From China who got caught

487
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:50,720
Painting

488
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:56,608
An arrow in the middle of the street and it was broad daylight

489
00:21:56,864 --> 00:22:01,216
And you know there's a turn arrow there already but he pointed this forward Arrow because

490
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:03,264
You know he wanted to make his commute

491
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,288
Basically

492
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:10,176
Pretty clearly self

493
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:10,944
Act

494
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,808
So we took a turning lane and turn it into a optional go forward and turning lane

495
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:17,344
And then he got fired

496
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:30,144

A five-part series from Bello radiotopia show the truth

517
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,792

518
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:02,816

00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,216
Might cost you your life

523
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:14,592
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

524
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:18,944
Or lose a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

525
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,272
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like

526
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,296
Adad

527
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:27,648
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

528
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:29,952
Actually if I'm being honest

529
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:32,000
I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that guy

530
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:39,424
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called immortal

531
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:43,008
Was found dead in my private gym

532
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:46,080
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

533
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,360
Even worse

534
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:50,944
The cops think that I had something to do with it

535
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,712
Now

536
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:53,760
I need to clear my name

537
00:24:54,016 --> 00:25:00,160
