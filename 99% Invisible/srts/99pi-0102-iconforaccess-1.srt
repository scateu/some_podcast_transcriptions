This is 99% invisible

24
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:08,864
I'm Roman Mars

25
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:11,680
There is a beauty

26
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:13,216
Do Universal standard

27
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:19,872
The idea that people across the world can agree that when they interact with one specific thing

28
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,688
Everyone will be on the same page

29
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,480
Regardless of language

30
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:27,040
Culture or Geographic locale

31
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,320
If I'm in Belgrade

32
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:30,624
Or Shanghai or Sao Paulo

33
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,488
I can look at a sign and know instantly without speaking a word of a local language

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,048
This floor is slippery

35
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,120
That the emergency exit is over there

36
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,912
And if that substance

37
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,192
Is poisonous

38
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,472
And I should not eat it

39
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:49,056
The group behind those internationally recognized logos

40
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,080
ISO

41
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:54,688
The International Organization for standardization best reporter Lauren over

42
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:57,504
And one of the most recognizable ISO symbols

43
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:00,064
Is the international symbol of access

44
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:03,136
What's the formal name of the blue and white logo with a

45
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,416
Stick figure in a wheelchair

46
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:08,000
Around the world you see the international symbol of access

47
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,024
Everywhere

48
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:12,864
Parking spaces on buttons that operate automatic doors

49
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,704
Bathrooms and on seats on the bus or at movie theaters

50
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:21,312
Anywhere where there's an indication of special accommodations made for people with disabilities

51
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:26,688
Prior to the late 1960s there is no universally agreed-upon accessibility icon

52
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:31,296
Everyone used a different symbol if they bothered to use one at all

53
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,856
But in the 1960s

54
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,136
The disability rights

55
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,672
Started picking up steam

56
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:37,696
In 19

57
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:40,000
68a group now called Rehabilitation

58
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,280
International announced today

59
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,304
Design contest

60
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,352
Create an international symbol of Acts

61
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:50,496
The logo would have to be readily identifiable from a reasonable distance self-descriptive

62
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:53,824
Simple unambiguous and practical

63
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:57,408
The winner was a Danish designer names to sonico fool

64
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:03,808
The modern stick figure in wheelchair logo that we know today is actually a slightly modified version from the original

65
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:06,112
That one didn't have a head

66
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:08,160
Within a decade the logo

67
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,696
The one with the head

68
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:13,024
Was endorsed by both the United Nations and ISO

69
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:17,888
Remember this is the group that sets iconographic standards across countries

70
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:20,448
It's overtime this logo

71
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:22,496
The international symbol of access

72
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:27,104
Begin to get embedded in the urban fabric of cities and towns across the world

73
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:33,760
People began to pay attention to the kinds of special building accommodations its basis needs to be inviting for p

74
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,040
People with varying degrees

75
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:35,808
Ability

76
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,856
And then in 1990

77
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:41,184
Congress passed the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act

78
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,256
Which President George HW Bush signed into law

79
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,584
Data was modeled on the Civil Rights Act of 90

80
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:48,608
54

81
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,632
The law

82
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,936
And I'm running this from the ATA website here

83
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:52,704
Quote

84
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:59,104
Prohibits discrimination and guarantees that people with disabilities have the same opportunities as everyone else

85
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,664
Participate in the mainstream of American Life

86
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:04,224
To enjoy employment opportunities

87
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,272
To purchase goods and services

88
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,552
Interpret dissipate

89
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:10,368
In state and local government programs and service

90
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:11,648
And quote

91
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,440
I think it's fair to say

92
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:18,815
Having a single attractive logo to signify a universal right for access

93
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,351
Helped create an Atmos

94
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,399
What's the built world

95
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:27,519
Could begin to adapt to new building parameters and regulations as specified

96
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,799
Pretty Ada

97
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,079
In many ways

98
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:33,151
Adoption of the international accessibility icon

99
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,687
Is a success story

100
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,967
In a simple design

101
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,015
Changing the world for the better

102
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,295
I think the current image

103
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,855
Always has to be lauded for its

104
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,623
Historic import

105
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:43,903
The form of waves

106
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,695
The form of easy navigation

107
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,511
You know it's historically

108
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,071
Profound I mean it's politically so important

109
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:54,399
But now you know you're guaranteed when you go out you're going to find one of these

110
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,167
Espaces that's

111
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:55,935
Reserved

112
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,727
You're able to count on

113
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,495
Accommodation

114
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,799
But this isn't the end of the story

115
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:03,103
Because it's the logo got absorbed into

116
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,383
The built environment

117
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,711
People with disabilities and their allies started finding it

118
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:08,735
Kind of like it

119
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:12,831
The shapes of the body in the body parts on that icon

120
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,879
Art squared off in geometric

121
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:15,903
And even though it

122
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:16,927
Does have a head

123
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:17,951
Had

124
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,487
Dangles from the neck

125
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,023
And the neck is in this kind of

126
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,559
Unnaturally erect

127
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,351
Posture there's not a sense of

128
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,911
Organic shapes of the body in space

129
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,447
That's her hedron by the way

130
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:33,567
My name is Sara hendren I'm an artist and design researcher in Cambridge Massachusetts

131
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,847
And I think a lot about

132
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:37,151
Prosthetics Adaptive Technologies

133
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:39,711
Disability studies and Disability Policy

134
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:44,063
Sara hendren is also a lecturer at RISD the Rhode Island School of Design

135
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,623
And most importantly for our purposes

136
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,951
Siri is the co-founder of the accessible icon project

137
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,487
This movement

138
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,767
Because that's what I think it has

139
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,303
Become a movement

140
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,351
Is made up of designers

141
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,119
Activist

142
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,655
Artist academic

143
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,191
And Disability Advocates

144
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,239
Old trying to change the conversation about

145
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,775
Disability in a community

146
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:07,359
Answer for starters the accessible icon project has

147
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,127
Take a name

148
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,407
At the standard blue and white

149
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,175
Wheelchair I

150
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:15,039
They've created a new icon that they hope will ultimately replace the iso standard

151
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,575
It's still a white

152
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:19,391
Figure in a wheelchair positioned in a blue field

153
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:22,463
But the head and body are tilted forward

154
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,511
The arm is angled back as if it's

155
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,279
Propelling you

156
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,327
And the wheel looks like it's in motion

157
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:32,191
The visible leg is also move forward and re angled so look more active

158
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,727
It doesn't just disappear into

159
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,495
The wheel

160
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,775
It looks modern

161
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:36,543
I'm asleep

162
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:41,151
You do a pretty good job picture in it if you imagine the new logo as the old logo

163
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,431
But italicized

164
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,247
Changing an ISO standard isn't easy

165
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,783
A proposal has two

166
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,831
To be submitted and reviewed by isos

167
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:51,647
Technical committee on graphical symbols

168
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:54,463
Then it has to be considered by symbols

169
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,999
Experts from around the world

170
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,791
And then finally approved

171
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,071
White Isis member

172
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,631
I talked with Barry Gray

173
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:02,911
The chairman of the two

174
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,959
Technical committee on graphical symbols

175
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,495
Oh my God I want very gray

176
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:10,591
He says he's seen the new logo and applauds the designers for the icon

177
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,359
Consignment

178
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:14,431
But he told me a lot of factors would have to

179
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,711
Taking into account

180
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,759
Before the current symbol could be replaced

181
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:22,111
Like whether this new icon might be confused with symbols used for wheelchair

182
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:25,183
So as much good as the current logo has done

183
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,975
300 among others

184
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,767
Text issue with how the logo

185
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,535
Portrays people

186
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:30,559
Disabilities

187
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,351
It has this a mobile

188
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,119
Talk to it

189
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,399
The figure in the image

190
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,423
Looks like it's waiting to

191
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,447
Pushed around

192
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,519
It's not that there's anything wrong with anyone who experience

193
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,055
What is mobility in that way

194
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:44,639
It's just that for hendren the implicit message the icons

195
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,943
Is it people with disabilities are helpful

196
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:51,551
In this new logo Grant a sense of autonomy to the figure in the wheelchair

197
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:54,879
And there's a clear delineation between where the person starts

198
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:55,903
And the chair begin

199
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,183
I think what the

200
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,231
Former icon lacked was

201
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:02,815
There just wasn't any definition of moving forward

202
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,863
You know it was just kind of

203
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:06,911
Stoic

204
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:09,215
Whereas this symbol

205
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:12,799
Shows that the malta Community is moving full-steam ahead

206
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,847
We are all moving

207
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:15,871
Full steam ahead

208
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:18,431
Gary Christenson is the mayor of Malden Mass in

209
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,967
The town of about 6

210
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:20,735
Mm

211
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:21,759
60000

212

Diverse residence

213
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:26,623
Mary Christensen work with a disability advocacy organization

214
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,647
Call Triangle

215
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:30,207
Replace the old symbol all over Malden

216
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,023
And he is really enthusiastic about it

217
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,047
He wants

218
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:36,095
To have every

219
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,119
Conceivable

220
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:37,887
Spot

221
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:38,911
Here in Malden

222
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,191
Replaced with this

223
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,727
Accessible icon project

224
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:44,287
As soon as possible to talk to Jeff Gentry

225
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:48,383
From triangle he would tell you that I've emailed them called them

226
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,407
Texting him

227
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,943
Pigeon carrier

228
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:54,783
To find out when we can replace every symbol here in the city of Malta

229
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,319
That's how eager I am to

230
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,599
To try and fulfill

231
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,879
This wonderful initiative

232
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,671
At this point in our conversation

233
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:05,023
The mayor handed the phone over to Jeff Gentry from Triangle Eye Lauren how are you

234
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,583
Together triangle and the mayor's office

235
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,119
The new logo at the

236
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,423
Talbots Distribution Center in Malden

237
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,447
And exarch

238
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,471
Shoes which has a

239
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,007
US headquarters in Newton

240
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,543
Not too far away

241
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,335
People with disabilities

242
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,919
Are no longer accepting separate but equal

243
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:25,503
Work school life opportunities they're moving forward towards a

244
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,039
Are richer future

245
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:30,623
And hopefully the icon creates dialogue around that

246
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:36,255
And I believe that the accessible icon is creating a more inclusive world like we're building here

247
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,791
In Malden when I ask

248
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,839
Pro new signage advocate

249
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,631
It's about how they're expanding its use

250
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,423
They would point to Local 6

251
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,263
Both Jeff Gentry answer hendren from the

252
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,543
Accessible icon project

253
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:53,151
Referred me to a guy named my name is Brendan Brendan Hildreth

254
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,431
A disability rights

255
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:55,967
In North Carolina

256
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,735
Hello

257
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,015
My name is Brendan

258
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:00,575
I am not a machine or robot

259
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:05,695
Brendan has cerebral palsy and hearing loss and speaks through an augmentative communication device or a talking

260
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:09,023
We reproduce to hear using an interview transcript

261
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:13,119
This project is way more than just a picture and assemble to me

262
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:17,727
The project to me shows that people with disabilities can be active and participate

263
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:21,311
It makes people understand about the disabilities Rights Movement

264
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:24,383
Brendan has been working to bring the accessibility sign to his

265
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,663
Downtown New Bern

266
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:30,527
I did a lot of speaking with television and radio stations locally about the new icon

267
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:34,111
I have a letter from the state to allow me to use the icon here

268
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:37,951
I have painted the new icon in several businesses in New Bern

269
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,999
And still have many more to do

270
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:43,071
People at the North Carolina state level like the new icon

271
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,631
They thanked me for bringing the icon here

272
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,399
Jeff

273
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,167
Brian

274
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:47,935
And Sarah

275
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:50,495
As in Jeff Gentry of triangle

276
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:53,823
And Brian glenney and Sara hendren from the accessible icon proud

277
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:57,663
Realized how many businesses I am getting to use the new like on

278
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:02,527
Then they made me Regional director of North Carolina for the icon project

279
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,575
Because I am kicking their butts

280
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,623
In getting the icon out in the world

281
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:10,975
Sara hendren said she's not interested in what she calls sign washing

282
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:14,559
Or getting the logo change just to be politically correct

283
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,863
She says this project is a process of

284
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,911
Consciousness-raising quote-unquote

285
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:21,727
So that each time the sign is officially changed

286
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,263
There's intention around it

287
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,543
And dialogue about

288
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,311
Disability

289
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:28,127
But a symbol meant to start dialogue and

290
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:33,247
Spread through Grassroots action is very different than one created to be at Universal

291
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:35,551
An internationally recognized symbol

292
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:41,951
There's a lack of clarity as to

293
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:46,815
Even though the law states that reasonable changes can be made to the symbol as long as it

294
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:49,631
That clearly displays the wheelchair and indicate sex

295
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,399
Affability

296
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:53,215
There are still questions about what constitutes

297
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,751
A functional equivalent

298
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:58,847
New York City had planned to adopt the new logo in all five boroughs

299
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:02,431
What does legal ambiguity cause them to hold off implementing it

300
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,455
At least for now

301
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:07,551
I think a lot of people end up buying that old original image because they're nervous

302
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:12,159
About complying with Ada code and I think what we're trying to do is say look

303
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,695
Functional equivalence

304
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:17,791
It has a kind of legal set of definitions and Contours

305
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:20,863
Doesn't think they're going to probably need to be worked out at the state level but

306
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:23,167
It's not as though functional equivalence means

307
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:26,495
Willy-nilly personal interpretation it means

308
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,263
As long as it's

309
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,823
Perfectly clear that you're indicating

310
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,615
Access for wheelchair users

311
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:32,895
You can

312
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,175
Do a different kind of

313
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,455
Version of the icon

314
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:39,551
All comes back to the question of what we are trying to accomplish through our symbols

315
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:44,159
Having one unified icon can tell one clear story all over the world

316
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,951
But sometimes stories change

317
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:51,071
We said earlier that the group behind the original call for an international symbol of Acts

318
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,095
It's called

319
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,887
Rehabilitation International

320
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,935
Well in the 1940s

321
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,471
It was known by another name

322
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,519
The international Society

323
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,055
The welfare of cripples

324
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,639
The meanings and associations that words have

325
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,919
Shift overtime

326
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:08,479
And sometimes the symbols need to as well

327
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,527
Reno universality

328
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,063
It does have an upside

329
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,367
Especially if you're in Belgrade

330
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,903
And you're about to accidentally

331
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:16,671

Send it

345
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:05,823
I still don't know that doesn't make sense to me at all. That's why you say that

346
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,615
Again

347
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,151

Bongs and Charter of our devices

353
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:31,423
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

354
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,447
If

355
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:38,847
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife is

All hearing. Voice

357

Technology talk to us

358
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,783
It is a creation of Sonic trash

361
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:55,487
To make them more human

362
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,327
Turn the living room lights on

363
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,119
Okay

364
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,167
Dim the living room lights to 50

365
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:03,935
2%

366
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:05,727
Okay

367
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:12,127
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

368
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,943
Makes for a much more natural experience

369
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,991
Turn the living room lights on

370
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,063
Dim the living room lights

371
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,087
50%
