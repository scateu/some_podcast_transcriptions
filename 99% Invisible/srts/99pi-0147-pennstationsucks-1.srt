I'm Roman Mars

48
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:33,696
New Yorkers are known to disagree about a lot of things

49
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:39,072
Who's got the best pizza what's the fastest subway route Yankees or Mets but

50
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:41,888
I would bet that if you pulled every New Yorker

51
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,448
All 8500000 of them

52
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,240
They would agree on one thing

53
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,312
Temptations suck

54
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:54,432
That's a never been our friend and reporter in New York who also hates Penn Station

55
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:57,248
There is nothing joyful about Penn Station

56
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,784
It's windowless

57
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,808
Airless

58
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,088
Crowded

59
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,696
650000 people have to suffer through it on their daily commute

60
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:09,536
Stuck more traffic than the Region's three airports combined

61
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,072
Luckily though

62
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,608
I'm not one of them

63
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,656
Where in Penn Station now

64
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:21,568
We tied along with our unlucky friend Jonathan menjivar he's a producer for This American Life and commutes from his home

65
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,616
In Jersey to Penn Station

66
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:25,920
His experience of Penn Station is like

67
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:28,480
Being a Black Friday sale at Walmart

68
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:29,760
Everyday

69
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:30,784
Always

70
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:37,184
I'm like the whole time people are pushing you squeezing through a tiny Stairway to get down to the tracks

71
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,208
Play sandwich

72
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:42,816
People are like actually touching your ass and you're not supposed to say anything about it

73
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:45,888
The air is off a hot stuffy

74
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:46,912
It feels like

75
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:53,312
Whatever Wizard of Oz is behind Lake that they are just watching in their little Tower and watching like

76
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:56,896
I'll look at them crush each other look at them on to eat each other

77
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,432
It's it's awful

78
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,456
It's off

79
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,528
And it's my best way to get home everyday

80
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,552
Poor guy

81
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:07,648
And you can also see some Penn Station hate in popular culture about New York

82
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,952
Lichenous episode of Broad City

83
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,744
Where one character Abby

84
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,768
Get dumped

85
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,048
Because her boyfriend

86
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:16,096
Would rather end a relationship

87
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:18,144
Then take a train out of Penn Station

88
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:18,912
Penn Station

89
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:20,704
Mercante

90
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,496
It's disgusting

91
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,056
It's kind of a dealbreaker for me

92
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:27,616
But here's the worst thing about Penn Station

93
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,408
This drab

94
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,688
Low ceiling

95
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,504
Uninspiring unexceptional building

96
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:37,088
Was once the opposite of all of those things

97
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,392
That

98
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,696
Space building itself was the

99
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:44,512
The fourth largest building in the world

100
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,864
That's Jill Jones describing the original Penn Station

101
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,656
Shirt a great book about it

102
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,936
Called conquering Gotham

103
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:55,776
The original Penn Station in New York City opened in 1910

104
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,312
It was Majestic

105
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:00,128
Imagine the Parthenon but for trains

106
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,456
The facade was a line of massive Doric columns

107
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:09,856
You walk through them descend down the grand staircase and into a waiting room design to remind you or

108
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:10,880
Roman Temple

109
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,184
Woody's very high ceiling

110
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,208
And very

111
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,000
Spectacular light

112
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:16,768
Coming through

113
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,607
That ushered you into all of these

114
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,911
Staircases that took you down into the

115
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,679
The train track

116
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:27,519
And the guy behind all of this was Alexander Cassatt

117
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,823
The Head of Pennsylvania Railroad

118
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,871
With the original Penn Station

119
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:38,271
Cuz I was fixing a problem that had planned to New York for years it was a complete pain in the ass to get from New Jersey

120
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,295
Jersey to Manhattan

121
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:45,695
People commuting from Jersey had to schlep Across the Hudson River on a slow Ferry

122
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:50,559
Train tunnel to run under the Hudson River it was considered one of the greatest engineering feats

123
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:56,447
Never I know we say that all the time but we really mean it this time Penn Station terminal

124
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:59,007
The crown his Monumental achievement

125
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:02,079
The architecture celebrate about the past and the future

126
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,127
It was a combination of this

127
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,407
Very ancient

128
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,967
Grandeur and

129
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,271
This extremely industrialized

130
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,319
Form of transportation

131
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,855
Really powerful

132
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:14,879
Pranks

133
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:21,279
Newspapers called Penn Station the 8th Wonder of the world people call a lot of things the 8th Wonder of the world

134
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,815
Everyone loved it

135
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:28,959
Everyone that is except for one other railroad family that owned a little station right across town

136
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,751
This then made

137
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,031
The existing

138
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,823
Grand Central Station

139
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:34,847
Which was

140
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,615
Owned

141
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:39,455
By the Vanderbilt family look really shabby

142
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,015
The time when the original Penn Station was built

143
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:46,367
Grand Central Station was not anywhere near as Grand as it is now

144
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,671
But the Vanderbilts just couldn't be outdone by the

145
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:54,303
Other train station clearly how embarrassing Grand Central needed a little touch up

146
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:58,911
The Vanderbilts decided to tear it down and build a newer shinier

147
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:01,215
Grandeur Grand Central Station

148
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,751
The one we know today

149
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:07,615
So there was this very early connection between the two

150
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,663
So Penn Station and Grand Central

151
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,455
Started out as enemies

152
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:17,599
But as the years passed they were like the last two drunks at the party trying to keep the night from coming to an end

153
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:21,439
Country was in a very different sort of mindset that

154
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:26,303
Who was good and flying was good and cars were good and transfer bad

155
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:30,911
Penn Station was only 40 years old at this point but already it's days were numbered

156
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:34,495
Passenger trains just weren't as popular anymore

157
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,823
Pennsylvania Railroad was just bleeding money

158
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,127
The company couldn't afford the upkeep

159
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,663
Penn Station's grandeur

160
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,223
Everything that I've been glorious about it really

161
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:49,087
I got sort of covered with Grime and it was dirty and they didn't fix a broken windows in there all these

162
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:54,463
Pigeons flying around it's really hard to wash pigeon poop off of Forestry Arch glass ceiling

163
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,231
So

164
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,511
People did not

165
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,303
Feel that this was this

166
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,839
Glorious place

167
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:06,239
They felt it was really crummy a lot of people Penn Station had become a money-sucking albatross of a stage

168
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:11,103
They also set of precious Midtown Manhattan real estate

169
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,663
Remember this is New York City

170
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,735
Real estate in New York is in the airspace

171
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:20,575
Pennsylvania Railroad Executives knew that they can make tons of money

172
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:25,183
If they could rent out the space above the station to a big tall building

173
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,023
There were proposals to build a parking garage Amphitheater

174
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,071
40 story office tower

175
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:37,471
But the one that one out was the futuristic sports and entertainment Palace known as Madison Square Garden

176
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:41,567
The deal that Pennsylvania Railroad cut with a developer Irving Felts

177
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:46,687
What's the keep the tracks below Penn Station and sell the rights to the airspace on top

178
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,711
And blow up

179
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,503
Penn Station in the process

180
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:55,135
Here's what I wish we could say that the whole city banded together to save the station

181
00:07:55,647 --> 00:08:01,023
But actually no one really cared except for a small group of activists architects

182
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,351
The action group for better architecture in New York

183
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,375
Agony

184
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,655
The terrible acronym

185
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,703
But definitely a cause I can support

186
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,751
Peter Sampson was one of those architects

187
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:13,055
I went over to his house on the upper west side

188
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:17,407
Let me look through old photographs from the only march to save Penn Station

189
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,175
Is me

190
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,991
Oh I think this was my sign

191
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,527
Right here that said

192
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,319
Don't sell LCD short

193
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,111
The date was August 2nd

194
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,647
1962

195
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,951
There were 200 Rowdy architects

196
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,255
We would have to wear

197
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,303
Respectable clothing

198
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,351
Cuz otherwise they wouldn't take us seriously

199
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:42,495
Just kidding about the Rowdy part these were Architects the men wear suits the women wear white gloves and pearls

200
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:45,567
Weed sort of pride ourselves on

201
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:52,223
I'm doing better lettering than the next sign they marched up and down 7th Avenue shouting powerstone tomorrow

202
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:56,063
Save Our Heritage things like that is what we would say

203
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,599
Keep in mind

204
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:00,159
We know none of us were ever on a picket line

205
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,951
You don't say still

206
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,511
The protest made the front page of the New York Times

207
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:07,071
Architects fight Penn Station plan

208
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,351
But it was too late

209
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,887
September 28th

210
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,423
1963

211
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,703
At 9 a.m.

212
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,031
Jackhammers Turin to Penn Station granite slabs

213
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,823
The demolition took a long time

214
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:18,847
About three years

215
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:21,919
Edward was like a great animal because

216
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,991
Are you saw the black on the outside

217
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:28,831
And then you saw the inside which was all this beautiful pink

218
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,135
So it was like the flesh

219
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,671
What's open now

220
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,463
With a knife

221
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:39,839
And after three years most of the original Penn station remains

222
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:42,911
Dark column the granite and travertine details

223
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,191
All of that

224
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:46,751
I've been dumped into a New Jersey swamp

225
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:50,335
And of course they gave us a new Penn Station

226
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:53,407
One that was summarily hated by everyone

227
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:59,039
1968 architectural historian Vincent Scully famously remark that whereas before

228
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:01,599
One entered the city like a god

229
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,647
1 skulls in now

230
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:04,671
Like a rat

231
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:12,351
How did the destruction of Penn Station mayor Robert Wagner created the first landmarks preservation Commission

232
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,375
1065

233
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:16,959
The group helped pass the city's first-ever landmarks law

234
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:21,823
Submit something as drastic as the destruction of Penn Station could never happen again

235
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,407
But the landmark laws were flawed it was a joke

236
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,943
New Yorkers are so blunt

237
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,223
That's Roberta Gratz

238
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:33,855
She wrote award-winning stories about the problems with the cities Landmark laws for the New York Post in the 1970s

239
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:38,719
For those of you who are too young to know that the New York Post used to be a really good newspaper

240
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:41,535
There are number of problems with the landmark laws

241
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:45,631
The biggest one though was that the landmarks commission didn't mean all that much

242
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,167
Playmat for 6 months

243
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:52,287
Every three years if you missed your window to get your favorite New York City building landmark

244
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:58,687
Tough luck and in the meantime the bulldozer operated at will has a lot of

245
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:01,759
Even after the landmark laws were passed

246
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:05,343
Like the singer building which was once the tallest building in the world

247
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,391
In the old Metropolitan Opera House

248
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,183
And the Astor Hotel

249
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,719
And then in 1968

250
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,791
Penn Station's old rival Grand Central Station

251
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:17,119
Was poised to be yet another pile of rubble

252
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:24,543
Beer in the casino like places of the terminal itself Robin heart of a nation's recovery

253
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:28,383
You have a right I love Grand Central Station

254
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:31,455
Hands down it is my favorite place in the city

255
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:34,271
Welcome to Grand Central terminal

256
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:38,367
Kent Barwick is just as excited as I am to be here

257
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:42,719
He's been involved in Saving New York City's historic buildings for decades

258
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:49,119
We're standing under Grand Central beautiful vaulted green ceiling which is decorated with constellations

259
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,167
I just love looking up at it

260
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:55,007
You and every other person

261
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,799
It's rare to communicate without

262
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,335
Finding somebody

263
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,127
Take me to picture or

264
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,407
Look this one races

265
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:05,503
Grand Central feels like a throwback

266
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:10,623
I feel like the old Penn Station must have been like just like the original Penn Station

267
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:13,439
Grand Central was a hard building to keep clean

268
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:16,511
Kent bar with points to a small patch of black

269
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:20,607
Far corner of the ceiling seems to be

270
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:24,959
A piece of dirty limestone in the piece of dirty ceiling I think that's the

271
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:25,983
Chose

272
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,031
But the ceiling was like

273
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:30,847
Which is essentially nicotine coatings

274
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:34,687
Hours for that everybody smoked all the time

275
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:40,831
That black ceiling Square was left on purpose to remind people what Grand Central was like back in the day

276
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:47,231
In the 1960s Grand Central history was almost a carbon copy of Penn Station's they were losing money

277
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:52,351
Because the building was so expensive to maintain and fewer people were taking trains

278
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:58,751
Just like Penn Station needed to sell the air space on top of the station and invite

279
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,799
Developers to build

280
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:07,199
When the 55-story office tower being nice on top of this baby

281
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,479
And most of its interior

282
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:12,319
But here's where the story of Grand Central and Penn Station The Verge

283
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,623
Remember those landmark

284
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,207
Happened in the years after the original Penn Station was demolished

285
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:24,351
They did manage to get Grand Central designated as a landmark

286
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:28,191
So the city denies the railroad executive plans

287
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:31,007
The owners of Grand Central were not placed

288
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,127
They wanted the money they were going to get from selling there are rides the space above Grand Central

289
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,663
So they sued the city

290
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,455
The case was a long one

291
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,503
It went on for nearly a decade

292
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,599
It was a bit of a nail-biter grand central nearly lost in 1975

293
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:49,695
With a state judge ruled against the city's designation of it as a landmark

294
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:53,279
The new mayor Abe beame almost an appeal the ruling

295
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:56,863
Saying that the city was poised to lose millions in court costs

296
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,399
Socat Barwick and others

297
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:04,287
Is created the committee to save Grand Central with one member who was a bit of a game changer

298
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:10,943
I think if you're is afraid effort even if it's at the $11 you can succeed and I think

299
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:17,343
And I know that that's what we'll do enter Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis

300
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:21,695
Grand Central Press Conference held in 1975

301
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:28,095
By the municipal art Society was at that press conference he says it was Jackie O soap

302
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,119
Currently involved

303
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:32,447
The fight went from a New York title to a national one

304
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:38,847
And people began to write in Iowa would a $5 bill and close

305
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:41,663
The case went all the way to the Supreme Court

306
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,455
And on June 26th

307
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,735
1978

308
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,271
Highest court in the land

309
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:48,831
Ruled in favor of New York City

310
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,111
Landmark laws

311
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:54,207
Justice William Brennan Road of Grand Central architecture quote

312
00:14:54,719 --> 00:15:00,863
Such examples are not so plentiful in New York City that we can afford to lose any of the few we have

313
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,935
And we must preserve them the meaningful way

314
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:04,959
Info

315
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:05,983
In other words

316
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:10,335
Grand Central would not suffer the same fate as its old friend and foe

317
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,615
Penn Station

318
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,967
To The Landmark laws with a lot of help from Jackie Onassis

319
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:16,991
Squeaked out a win

320
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:19,039
And all of these years later

321
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:23,391
One of the ways people Comfort themselves about the loss of the original Penn Station

322
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,927
Is with this idea

323
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:27,999
But the laws that came out of the destruction of Penn Station

324
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,791
Save Grand Central

325
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,583
So you know it's okay

326
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,119
Because it died for a Cause

327
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:37,215
I don't think Grand Central would have been saved without Penn Station

328
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,007
Penn Station

329
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,799
Sacrifice itself

330
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:47,455
So that grandcentral could live that was Peter Stanton you heard from him earlier he was one of the Architects that fought and fail

331
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,735
How to say Penn Station

332
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,039
But the tie between the destruction of

333
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:51,807
Penn Station

334
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,855
And the saving of Grand Central

335
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,903
Is actually kind of tenuous

336
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,695
Ferber the grass

337
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,975
It was Jackie O

338
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:00,767
Not the landmark laws

339
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,303
Save Grand Central

340
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,351
It's all very romantic

341
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,375
2

342
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,167
Assume that the demolition

343
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,959
Something so historic

344
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,775
Would have

345
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,055
Precipitate

346
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,335
Strong land

347
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:15,871
It just

348
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:16,895
Isn't

349
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:20,991
A sacrificial lamb like Penn Station can only do so much

350
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:24,575
People have to actually fight and win like they did with Grand Central

351
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,111
The laws that have teeth

352
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:28,671
Roberta Gratz was actually one of those people

353
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:31,487
The reporting she did on the landmarks Commission

354
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:36,095
Is just one of the things that led to the landmark laws ultimately being strengthened

355
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,887
And of course the Supreme Court

356
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:40,191
Holding those laws in the Grand Central case

357
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,727
Set an important precedent

358
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,775
Perceiving future landmarks

359
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:46,591
These days it's still a fight to save a building

360
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:49,919
But the laws are there and they're stronger now than they once were

361
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,991
So if you're a beautiful old building in New York

362
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:56,063
