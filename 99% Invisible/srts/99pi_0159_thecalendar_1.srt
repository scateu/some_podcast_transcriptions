This is 99% invisible

24
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:09,120
I'm Roman Mars

25
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:15,776
30 days has September April June and November February has 20

26
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:18,336
He ate alone all the rest have 31

27
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:22,688
Except in leap year that's the time when February's days are 29

28
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,224
That doesn't even rhyme

29
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,272
The poem I grew up with was

30
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:28,576
Slightly different

31
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:33,440
Thirty days hath September April June and November

32
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,976
All the rest have 31

33
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:39,840
Except for February which has 28 days clear and 29 in each leap year

34
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:46,496
Okay I think that rhymes actually worse both poems to say the same thing which is that months don't make any logical time

35
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,824
A month is hardly a unit of measurement

36
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:52,896
I can be anywhere from 28 to 31 days

37
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,432
Sometimes it's four weeks

38
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,712
10 * 5

39
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,480
1 * 6

40
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,552
You have to buy a new calendar with new dates

41
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,344
Every single year

42
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,136
It's a strange design

43
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:06,464
Well the year that we now have

44
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,280
And basically consider almost a writ of God

45
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:11,840
You know somehow it's just indivisible there it is

46
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:14,912
Actually has had an amazing history

47
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:19,008
That is David Ewing Duncan I am the author of

48
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:19,776
Calendar

49
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:24,128
Humanities epic struggle to determine a true and accurate

50
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:24,896
Goodyear

51
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:27,712
The calendar that the world really uses right now

52
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:29,248
Is mostly

53
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:32,320
A sort of joining of the Roman Calendar in the Egyptian calendar

54
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:35,136
It's basically when Caesar and Cleopatra

55
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,928
What kind of hanging out and doing their thing

56
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:42,560
Which is to say when Roman Caesar and Egyptian Cleopatra we're having a torrid love affair

57
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:45,376
This was before Cleopatra got together with Marc Anthony

58
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,656
She was 21

59
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:48,448
And Caesar was 52

60
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,264
But they got together and they did what lovers do

61
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,824
Discuss the true nature of the Earth

62
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,592
Flirtation

63
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,432
And Egyptians long before the Greeks came

64
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,712
Actually discovered

65
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,480
The true length

66
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:03,040
Of the year 365 days

67
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:05,600
The Egyptians knew about the length of the year

68
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:08,416
Because of the Nile River

69
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:12,000
It was basically a series of steps that went into the Nile

70
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:12,768
The Nile

71
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:13,792
Actually flooded

72
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,328
At the same height

73
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,608
Virtually every year

74
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,632
It's on the same day

75
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,680
And they were just simply Mark each year

76
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,216
When it hit its height

77
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:27,872
But the Egyptians also figured out that the year isn't always exactly 365 days

78
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:33,504
So they added an extra day every four years just to make sure that the calendar matched up with the season

79
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:34,784
In other words

80
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,576
They invented the leap year

81
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:39,136
And this was all fantastic news to Caesar

82
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:42,976
Because he had a feeling that the Roman Calendar wasn't quite right

83
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:47,584
The Roman calendar year at the time was around 354 days long

84
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,864
Obviously that's a few days show

85
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,400
11 days

86
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:51,936
How to Short

87
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,216
Natural solar

88
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,776
And when you lose 11 days

89
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,568
Year after year after year

90
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,616
The season starts

91
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,664
Spring in the winter

92
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:02,944
Winter in the fall months

93
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:07,552
And those 11 days were missing because the Roman Calendar had always been base

94
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,576
Based on moon cycle

95
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:13,440
Cleopatra inspired Caesar to switch to a calendar that would be consistent with

96
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,976
The Earth cycle around

97
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:15,744
The Sun

98
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,303
When Caesar return to Rome from his dalliance

99
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:19,583
Cleopatra

100
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,119
He introduced the leap year

101
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,143
Call Julian

102
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:25,983
Julius Caesar also added back those 11 missing days

103
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:29,823
And the Julian calendar was instituted throughout the Roman Empire

104
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,103
Just to say

105
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,663
Still a bit

106
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,455
Did you encounter wasn't entitled

107
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,479
Accurate

108
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,247
Itself

109
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,783
11 minutes 14

110
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,319
Each year

111
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,343
Eventually you had

112
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,879
We are losing days

113
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:43,903
And then

114
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,183
There was a week

115
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:47,487
And buy 1582

116
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,511
Pope Gregory

117
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,303
The 13th at the wherewithal to say

118
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,351
Okay we are actually we have an inactive

119
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,375
Your calendar will worship

120
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,655
All of our holidays

121
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:02,079
And with a few small adjustments to realign the year with the seasons we have the Gregorian calendar

122
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,615
Named after Pope Gregory

123
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,687
And that's what's on your wall or your phone

124
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,991
We all use it we don't think about it now

125
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:09,759
And

126
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,551
For that reason

127
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,087
There has not been a huge

128
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,367
Momentum to try to

129
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,135
Change things

130
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,159
Basically live with it

131
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:20,511
But there are a lot of smart people out there have been for centuries

132
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,303
And come up with better calendars and there are better,

133
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:28,191
One example of calendar redesign came after the French Revolution

134
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:31,775
The French decreed the first year of the Revolution was the year one

135
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:37,151
Animed the week 10 days long this was actually instituted for over a decade

136
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:40,479
Then Napoleon put the kibosh on that when he became emperor

137
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:43,807
And later another Frenchman created these so-called

138
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,575
Positivist

139
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:47,903
Calendar the positivist calendar was created in

140
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,951
1849 by Auguste comte

141
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:54,303
Organized mind of History

142
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:57,119
Moses Homer Aristotle Archimedes

143
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:57,887
Caesar

144
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:01,471
Saint Paul the great white men of history

145
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:02,495
Dante

146
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,263
Gutenberg

147
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,031
Shakespeare

148
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:10,431
That's my friends by the way my name is Mark Burns I am the visual editor for citylab

149
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,711
Wonder didn't really take off

150
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:15,807
It was mostly meant as an inspirational Memorial to glorify great thinkers

151
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,855
And Fina patriarchy

152
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,623
However

153
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:21,695
There was another radical attempt at calendar reform

154
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,719
That actually

155
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,743
Kind of happened

156
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,839
I wrote the death and life

157
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:28,863
13 month count

158
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:34,751
This was a highly rational 13-month calendar meant to appeal not too romantic

159
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,799
But to industrialists

160
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:42,175
Because the wonky weirdly divided Gregorian calendar was difficult for accountants

161
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:46,527
Who had to track monthly numbers and for the people who had to make the trains run on time

162
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,831
And Moses because it's worth

163
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,111
Was both of those people

164
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,183
Moses B cotsworth

165
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,719
Was analytics guy

166
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:56,511
Mostly working in the

167
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,791
Railway industry

168
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:02,399
Codsworth was a British Railway Man and he was all about efficiency

169
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,959
The Gregorian calendar wasn't cutting it for him

170
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:06,239
So it's a

171
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:08,287
There's a month where this extra Monday

172
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:11,615
What is a month for the next Saturday that would throw out the numbers

173
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:12,895
A month to month

174
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:15,711
And that kind of frustrated cotsworth

175
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,759
So he created his

176
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,039
13 month calendar

177
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:25,439
In 1902 codsworth presented a design for a calendar of 13 months worth every month was exam

178
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,231
Exactly 28 days

179
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,255
No more

180
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,279
No less

181
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,303
4

182
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,583
Perfect week

183
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,911
And this meant the dates were all standardized as well

184
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,727
You always know that V was a Thursday

185
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:38,751
No matter the month

186
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,311
First was always a fun day

187
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:43,359
Attempt was always a Tuesday

188
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,383
There be a Friday

189
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,151
The 13th

190
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:48,735
Every single month rational railway man we're not

191
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:52,575
Superstitious clearly all the months names would stay the same

192
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,367
And then that additional month

193
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,415
Another 28 even days

194
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,975
Would fall between June and July

195
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,511
And this additional month

196
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:01,791
Would be called

197
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:04,607
SOL SOL SOL

198
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,631
Standing for

199
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:06,399
The month where the

200
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,167
Somersaults

201
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:11,263
And leave your day would be added at the end of Soul not February

202
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,335
So every 4 years old would have 29 days

203
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,663
Alright so 20 days * 13 months

204
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,967
Is 364 days in a year

205
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,039
That is one day less than the actual solar year of 300

206
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,063
5

207
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,343
How to make it 300

208
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,111
65

209
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:28,159
Codsworth added a new holiday

210
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:31,231
Right before the new year for lecture day at the end of the year

211
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:37,631
Called your day and your day was just a floating day not part of any particular month and it would be a sword

212
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,911
Global Sabbath

213
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:44,031
And aside from your day all other vacations would be moved to a Monday

214
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:46,847
Holidays would always be practiced or observed

215
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,431
Don't worry about certain months where

216
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,735
Wednesday

217
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:59,391
And maybe since I have Wednesday off they want to schedule Thursday and Friday off

218
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,183
No Wednesdays off

219
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:04,255
Codsworth pitched his perfect calendar around the United States

220
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,303
Giving talks about its Myriad benefits

221
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,095
You can find many takers

222
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:12,447
Except for one of the wealthiest and most successful businessmen of that time

223
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,983
George Eastman

224
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,519
George Eastman

225
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,055
The founder of Kodak

226
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,847
Mr. Eastman had a lot of

227
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:25,247
Unique interest in addition to his company and his philanthropic work but this I have to say is probably one of the

228
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:31,647
Weirdest interest that he hadn't pursued Cathy Connor is the curator of the George Eastman house in collection in

229
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,415
Chester New York

230
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:37,023
When he had an interest in anything he always put a decent amount of money into

231
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:43,167
Getting other people to buy into his ideas as well and he did exactly that with the 13-month calendar

232
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:47,263
Eastman basically took it upon himself to promote cotsworth calendar design

233
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,847
And he started a calendar League headquarters in Rochester

234
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:54,175
Income tax office gave a little office to this

235
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,711
Calendar reform

236
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,783
Group and it was there that they

237
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:05,183
Published in printed some different Flyers to hand out a local businesses actually convince a few local

238
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:09,023
Benefits to switch to a 13-month calendar including of course

239
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,815
Mr. Eastman Zone company

240
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:14,911
They adopted it at the Eastman Kodak company in 1924

241
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:18,495
And they continue to use it until 1989

242
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:22,335
So that is 65 years

243
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,615
Until 1989

244
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,919
Apparently employees found it useful

245
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,711
When I did sales

246
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,991
Porting program

247
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:34,367
I didn't have to worry about love this is a 28-day month is a 31-day month is

248
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,719
I acclimated it very quickly

249
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:40,511
John saracco worked at Kodak

250
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:43,071
From 1986 to 1992

251
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,119
He actually like the calendar so much

252
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,679
He tried to bring it with him Beyond Kodak

253
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:52,543
A couple of times I've actually tried getting company that I work for

254
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,847
2 going use 8:30

255
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:55,871
Team.

256
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:56,895
You know

257
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,431
4 weeks * 30

258
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:02,783
Calendar but like Moses cotsworth in George Eastman beforehand

259
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:07,391
John Scirocco just couldn't convince other businesses to take it on

260
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,671
That said

261
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,951
Even within Kodak

262
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:13,791
Eastman couldn't fully Institute the 13-month calendar and it's

263
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:14,815
Truest form

264
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,119
The calendar as John do it

265
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,911
Was kind of a modified version

266
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:22,495
I only knew it as this is the financial calendar

267
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,287
Company

268
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:29,151
Kodak employees didn't observe solar year day or change every holiday to a Monday

269
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:33,759
It was like how some bankers work in quarters or some schools function in semester

270
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,575
Kodak's internal schedule with organized

271
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,855
It's a 13.

272
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,647
Just called. One

273
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,415
2. 30

274
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:43,743
Instead of saying that today was March 2nd

275
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,535
We would say that

276
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,815
Today is

277
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,863
The third. Date

278
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:49,631
3

279
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:56,031
They use the 13-month calendar as an organizational tool for planning finances and production schedule

280
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,567
We programmed in

281
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:58,591
You wrote In

282
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,383
Redesigned application

283
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,175
To work within

284
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,199
The Kodak

285
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,479
13.

286
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:10,879
But we'd still lived our life the way the normal Gregorian calendar was

287
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,927
The world was still on the Gregorian calendar

288
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:17,535
Renaming and reorganizing the days and holidays would have been a total drag

289
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:22,143
And this is basically the same reason why I would be so hard for the larger world to adopt

290
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,679
13 month calendar

291
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,471
The explanation

292
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,007
Forhow July 4th

293
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,543
It's kind of like

294
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:29,567
The perfect

295
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,847
Example of how Campo

296
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,407
Mentally adjust

297
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,199
New calendar

298
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,247
That's journalist Mark Burns again

299
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:40,319
Okay so on the 13-month calendar schedule

300
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,623
July 4th would have to be moved to a Monday

301
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,903
Like all the holidays

302
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,207
So then they'll really be July 2nd

303
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:49,535
But when you add in Soul and Shuffle the dates around accordingly

304
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:53,631
That actual day on the solar calendar wouldn't fall in July

305
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,959
It would actually be Soul 17 but

306
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,495
That falls on a Tuesday

307
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,775
You got to make

308
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:02,335
That Monday so would end up as Soul six

309
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,383
So there's nothing is

310
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,663
Patriotika celebrating

311
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,247
This is why the calendar and it's

312
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,039
Truest most regulated form

313
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,575
Couldn't fully work at Kodak

314
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:15,647
I mean you have to give your employees a vacation on July 4th

315
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,439
Even if it's not on a Monday

316
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:23,583
So Random holidays in off-days persisted

317
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,375
Kodak couldn't do it alone

318
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:28,959
He would have to convince the rest of the world to make the switch

319
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:31,007
He and mr. Cox worth

320
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,287
They went to bed

321
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,055
A few times

322
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:36,127
In front of a lot of different committees at Congress

323
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,943
And in our government to try to justify

324
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,479
Explain the rationale

325
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,783
And this was taken completely serious

326
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,575
Calendar reform

327
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:46,367
Became an actual

328
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,135
Issue of

329
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,159
Debate forum

330
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:54,559
League of Nations the League of Nations as in the precursor to the UN there are a hundred 85 plans

331
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,607
Before the League of Nations to look at

332
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,143
Four County reform

333
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,167
And

334
00:13:59,423 --> 00:13:59,935
Codsworth

335
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:00,703
Eastman

336
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,495
Puzzle was one of the

337
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:03,775
Few finalists

338
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:07,103
Even after George Eastman passed away in 1932

339
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:10,175
League of Nations continue discussing calendar redesign

340
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,199
Basically

341
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:13,247
League of Nations can come to a consensus

342
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,527
And then

343
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,831
The rise of Hitler and World War II made

344
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:17,855
Thoroughly

345
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,135
Unimportant to them

346
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,719
Hitler ruins everything

347
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,559
And we just haven't really considered calendar reform since

348
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,095
Perhaps because

349
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:32,959
When designing time and the way people operate you have to consider custom and culture

350
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,775
It has to be done entirely and completely

351
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,055
Or not at all

352
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:40,895
So who knows perhaps if everyone decided to adopt it

353
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:44,479
A regimented calendar could really work better for

354
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:48,319
No finances and planning but on the other hand

355
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:50,879
I think it's kind of fascinating that are year is not

356
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,903
Perfectly regiment

357
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,951
Out of our control

358
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,255
Sometimes your birthday is on a Tuesday

359
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,535
What time does the Saturday

360
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,583
The Gregorian calendar is this

361
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,119
Organic instruments

362
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:04,703
The Ebbs and flows with the season from the rotation of the Earth

363
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,031
Got to spend too much time in California

364
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,311
It's

365
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,335
Really

366
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,895
A bizarre anomaly of History

367
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,943
That this calendar the starter was his

368
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:15,967
Cleopatra that

369
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,015
Performed by

370
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:18,783
