This is 99% invisible

19
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:08,864
I'm Roman Mars

20
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,656
My fellow Americans

21
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:13,472
Memorial Day is a day of

22
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:15,264
Ceremonies and speeches

23
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:19,104
About America today we honor the dead of our Wars

24
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:21,408
Whatever you think about Ronald Reagan

25
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,736
They called him the great communicator for a reason

26
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:26,528
The Unknown Soldier

27
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,392
Who is returned to us today and whom we later rest is symbolic of all our missing son

28
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:38,048
This is him in 1984 during a military funeral at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington

29
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:39,328
10 National Cemetery

30
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,632
On that Memorial Day

31
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:46,752
Reagan was eulogizing the remains of an unidentified service member from the Vietnam War

32
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:51,616
The Remains would be entombed alongside three other unknown service members

33
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:54,688
From World War 1 & 2 and the Korean War

34
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,480
It was a big event

35
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,272
That's our own Joe Rosenberg

36
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,808
Horse-drawn carriage

37
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,088
Brought the casket to the two

38
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:04,160
Have 250000 on lockers

39
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:09,280
Putting hundreds of veterans who emerged out of the crowd to walk behind the remains on their way to Arlington

40
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,072
Most powerful part though

41
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:14,656
Reagan talks about through this unknown soldier might have been

42
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:17,728
Replay on some Street in a great American city

43
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,336

00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:35,136

A Broken Spoke

49
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,256
Next on the side of the term itself with words known

50
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,024
What you got

51
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,816
It's already moving

52
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,352
You knowing what we know now

53
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:45,888
Bat

54
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:49,472
Are the person being buried that day might have been unknown to the public

55
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,264
A lot about his identity

56
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:58,432
The government like we even knew that he had a family who would like to have his body back

57
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:01,504
But they buried him anyway

58
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:04,832
How to honor

59
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:07,904
Unidentified remains always been one of the great conundrums of War

60
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,976
The Romans were fond of honoring them with an empty sarcophagus

61
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,768
After the Civil War

62
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:19,168
Union buried 2111 soldiers in a mass grave in Arlington that they purposely built on top of Robert

63
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,448
Chinese Rose Garden

64
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:27,104
It wasn't until the 20th century that it occurred to anyone to bury a single Unknown Soldier in a public setting

65
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,640
This sort of

66
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,920
Memorialization

67
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:30,944
Came about

68
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,736
From our world war

69
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,272
This is Robert

70
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,344
The former executive editor for National Geographic

71
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,880
What a book about Arlington

72
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,672
Called on Hallowed Ground

73
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:43,232
What does World War 1 era of

74
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,000
Total War

75
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:44,768
And Matt

76
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:45,536
Participation

77
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,608
What's the combatants on both sides were mostly ordinary City

78
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,400
Anonymous Everyman

79
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,192
Unrendered literally anonymous

80
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:54,240
It's the violence of the Western Front

81
00:03:55,008 --> 00:04:00,640
Everything about the war not only the numbers but the nature of it was dehumanizing

82
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:03,968
Nobody who went through that war was ever the same again

83
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:07,296
And there was a British chaplain

84
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:11,904
Who was in the worst of the fighting on the front lines

85
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,696
Named David Ralston

86
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:20,351
Brokenwood spend his nights conducting funeral services over the remains of soldiers ripped apart by shell fire

87
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,375
Having them on the spot

88
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:24,703
In the giant craters the shells in Left Behind

89
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,983
And while

90
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:31,103
He was there he thought about how how terrible it was that they were these people who

91
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,151
Work essentially forgotten

92
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,967
Buried in their graves and nobody would ever

93
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:36,991
Remember

94
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,551
And that there should be something better than that

95
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:46,975
It was around this time the David Railton came across a temporary gray a few miles behind the front

96
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:50,815
Marked by a cross bearing the name of a regiment and the words

97
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,375
An unknown British soldier

98
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:54,911
And he realized

99
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,727
If you had a mass grave with

100
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,519
2000 people in it

101
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,847
Then it's a mass grave with two thousand people in it

102
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,383
It's not an individual

103
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,919
Who had a life

104
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:09,503
Something about having a particular person

105
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,807
Makes it more real

106
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:12,831
More human

107
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,391
After the war

108
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:19,231
Wilson advocated for a grave during the body of a single soldier

109
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:22,047
To bring the impossibly large tragedy

110
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,583
Down to a human scale

111
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:30,495
Soldiers anonymity without each person who came to the Grave to project whatever it was most important to them onto the mystery

112
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:33,567
It matter if you wanted to honor all those who served

113
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,591
Neely those who died

114
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,895
Those who volunteer doorbells overdraft

115
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,455
Reason why they were for the war or against it

116
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,271
Everyone was Freedom or in their own way

117
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:49,183
Sure enough when Britain dedicated the grave of an unknown warrior in Westminster Abbey in 1920

118
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,487
It was an overnight success

119
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:54,303
The dedication of loan attracted so many mourners

120
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:57,631
The line for viewing lasted 10 days

121
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,679
And Britain's unknown Warrior

122
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:00,959
Wasn't the only one

123
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:05,567
Britain France Romania Italy everybody at the same time

124
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,103
Jumped on this idea

125
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:10,175
Over 50 countries without a building similar Memorial

126
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:12,991
In part because the formula was so easy to follow

127
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:16,063
All you needed with the body of a single Unknown Soldier

128
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:19,903
The American Memorial is especially beautiful

129
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:23,999
It sits at the top of a hill that overlooks the rest of Arlington Cemetery

130
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,559
And starting in 1937

131
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:29,119
Has been watched over a day and night

132
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,911
Without a single interruption

133
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,191
Myloan guard

134
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:34,751
Forever marching back and forth

135
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,287
In front of the Tomb

136
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:39,615
No one knows which service The Remains are from

137
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:44,735
Soldier or sailor Marine they're simply referred to as the unknown

138
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:48,575
That anything that narrows the scope of who this person could be

139
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,879
Where exactly they were found

140
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,183
Is purposely withheld from the public

141
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,231
In order to make sure that they represent

142
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:55,999
Everyone

143
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:00,607
But you might become one of the Washington DC area's biggest

144
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,631
Tourist attractions

145
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,703
But in 1956

146
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:09,823
We made one small seemingly innocent changed the formula of the unknown

147
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,103
I would end up

148
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:11,871
Proving

149
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:12,895
Tricky

150
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:16,479
We began adding a new set of unidentified remains

151
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,015
For every subsequent War

152
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,319
World War II Korea

153
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,599
Eventually Vietnam

154
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:22,879
Each War

155
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,159
We get their own unknown

156
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,695
Which made sense

157
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,743
There were lots of unknowns to choose from

158
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,791
At least at first

159
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,327
In World War 1

160
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:35,935
There were something like a thousand 648

161
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,959
Unknowns

162
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,751
World War II

163
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:41,311
The unknowns were 8000

164
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,591
526

165
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,639
Korean War

166
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,175
848

167
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:51,039
And then the the last war in which we had an unknown

168
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,319
Vietnam

169
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:53,599
4

170
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:57,951
Things to improve Battlefield vacuolation tactics the Vietnam War produced or me

171
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:01,791
Four sets of unidentified remains that could potentially go into the two

172
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:05,375
As more information about those remains was discovered

173
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,935
Was down to three then down to two

174
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:08,959
The down to

175
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,727
Juan

176
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,287
One set of remains for

177
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,567
Paula Vietnam

178
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,103
Who was unknown

179
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:21,503
That single cell Remains the one Reagan eulogized in that moving ceremony in 1984

180
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,039
The public

181
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,831
Is the Unknown Soldier

182
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,623
What's referred to internally

183
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,671
As x26

184
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,463
His actual name

185
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:31,743
With Michael

186
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:36,607
There's not supposed to be favorites and families right

187
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:40,191
This is Patricia blasi

188
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,495
Has something about them

189
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,567
Michael blassie was Patricia's oldest brother

190
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:48,127
Is the oldest five actually in the Lassie family

191
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:50,943
So growing up in St Louis in 1960s and 70s

192
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:55,295
He was actually very good at anything that he did

193
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,087
Patricia says that Michael was

194
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:01,183
Constantly bouncing between activities mastering each one before moving on to the neck

195
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,231
Score music Sports

196
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,535
You know I think he could have

197
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,839
Done whatever he wanted to

198
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:11,935
But then he received an appointment to the Air Force

199
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:15,263
And he fell in love with flying at the Academy

200
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:20,639
Flight school Michael was assigned to fly a ground attack aircraft known as the a37

201
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,711
Dragonfly or sometimes the super tweet

202
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:26,271
Resign fly low over its Target

203
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,551
I would love it

204
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:31,391
Combat close to the ground the landscape rushing by the sense of flight

205
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:33,183
Speed of combat

206
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,207
Titan

207
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:39,839
To the uninitiated of course all these things may flying the a37 downright terrifying

208
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,399
But I don't remember Michael

209
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,423
Ever

210
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:46,495
Saying anything about being afraid of it

211
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,543
And so once he graduated

212
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,335
It was off

213
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,103
2

214
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:57,759
Pilot training that it from there it was off to survival training and from there it was off to be

215
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,527
Vietnam

216
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,575
And I remember

217
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:03,391
Seen him get on the aircraft

218
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,183
Is St Louis

219
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:10,559
And I remember him looking back and waving to us with that beautiful smile

220
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,607
And and and

221
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:16,447
I just remember thinking it all over him again

222
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,751
I think we all did

223
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:23,359
By 1972 and Michael blassie was

224
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:28,223
America's military presence in Southeast Asia with shrinking rapidly

225
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:32,319
There are fewer than 25000 US servicemen left in Vietnam

226
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:36,927
As opposed to over 500000 who have been deployed by the late 1960s

227
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:43,071
The war was in effect winding down but it was still dangerous and they were still out of combat going on

228
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,095
This is biltong

229
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:47,423
He's a reporter who wrote about Michael blassie for the Washington Post

230
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:51,263
He says that the American servicemen remain behind were stretched thin

231
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,799
How to do a lot with a little

232
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:55,615
That Michael was going to see a lot of combo

233
00:10:56,383 --> 00:11:00,223
He arrived in Vietnam in January of 72

234
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,783
And by May of 1972

235
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,855
He had flown something like 130 missions

236
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,671
So he's been virtually almost every day

237
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:13,023
He had at least one combat sometimes to combat missions

238
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:17,119
G37 that Michael flu had a good record up to that point Vietnam

239
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,655
If you'd gotten hit

240
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,935
When they were hit

241
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,983
Things could get ugly fast

242
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,031
Because it could take all kinds of

243
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:24,799
Fire

244
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,847
I mean you're flying 408

245
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,639
In the air and you get hit

246
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,943
Deductible parachute out of the plane

247
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,735
So that made it very dangerous

248
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:36,575
Michael would always take off and land from a protected Airbase near Saigon

249
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:40,159
Ignition Saturn flying over a lot of dangerous places

250
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:43,743
In the most dangerous was arguably a town in South Vietnam

251
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,023
Called and lock

252
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:50,143
In 1972 hanlock was occupied by the South Vietnamese military

253
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,447
Along with a handful of American advisors

254
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:59,103
But it was under siege by an invading North Vietnamese Army

255
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:05,503
Very very long time it went on for months and I encountered of guy who it was in and lock

256
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,783
Chris Calhoun

257
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:09,855
And she described it was like a scene out of Apocalypse Now

258
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,903
The city of van laack was

259
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,463
Totally leveled it look like Hiroshima

260
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,255
This is Chris Calhoun

261
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:20,095
Eustachian to unlock an Army Ranger during the majority of the siege

262
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:24,959
Often resorted to analogies as a way of explaining just how awful it was there

263
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:29,055
One point he described with their meager medical support

264
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:31,615
As looking like something out of the Civil War

265
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:35,199
Unlock was completely cut off from the rest of the world

266
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,247
We got food and ammunition by

267
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,551
Parachute drop everyday

268
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,855
We were under constant shellfire

269
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,391
Chris's Beauty

270
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,927
List of all this chaos

271
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,207
Call in airstrike

272
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:50,047
It was Michael blassie Squadron that was providing the air support

273
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:54,143
They were flying bombing runs over and lock nearly every day

274
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:57,215
Michael and Chris never actually spoke one-on-one

275
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,263
The time there didn't quite overlap

276
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:03,359
Chris did get snow a lot of Michael Squadron mates really well

277
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:10,015
And we would talk on the radio they read me stars and stripes Stars and Stripes at the US military's

278
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,551
Finally run daily paper

279
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,599
Why would they redo Stars and Stripes

280
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:16,159
What was my only contact with the outside world

281
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,207
But in an loc they would

282
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:21,023
Be over is almost 24 hours a day

283
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:26,399
And they kept the North Vietnamese off our back so these were people who I owed my life to

284
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:30,751
And it was on one of these bombing runs keeping the North Vietnamese off their backs

285
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:33,823
That Michael blassie flew his 132nd

286
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,663
Final mission

287
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:42,271
We'll never know exactly what happened on May 11th 1972

288
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:48,671
Witnesses recalled that day's fighting as being particularly intense and chaotic so a lot of what we do know comes from

289
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,207
Flappy's commanding officer

290
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:56,863
Was flying in a plane alongside black most of all

291
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:03,263
Call was how bright everything was spelled with these planes and helicopters for Target

292
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,591
Also Tracer rounds being fired from multiple enemy aircraft

293
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:13,503
And they were taking ground fire the whole time but because they were flying into the sun they could

294
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:18,367
See where was coming from so this just added to the confusion of the battle

295
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:22,975
And somewhere in the midst of the blinding sun in the chaos and confusion

296
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:29,375
Michael's plane was hit by ground fire remember Michaels playing as designer flight love

297
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,143
I got hit

298
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:35,007
There's no more than 500 feet above the ground he has lost control of the plane

299
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:38,591
Buses playing bien streaming fuel inverted

300
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:41,151
And it disappeared into the jungle below

301
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,943
And there was no distress signal

302
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,271
Which indicates that the pilot had probably been killed instantly

303
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:51,647
I just playing the crash deep in North Vietnamese held territory

304
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,207
Helicopter team tried to get to the crash site

305
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,743
But did Heavy enemy fire

306
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,535
I don't leave after just a few minutes

307
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,863
Rather than think of me anyway

308
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:03,423
Get the side or find out exactly what happened

309
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:06,239
Michael blassie declared missing in action

310
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,263
Resume.

311
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:12,639
The blasi family was informed that Michaels Body would not be coming home

312
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:13,663
But with

313
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:18,783
I don't edit the strangest thing that when there is no

314
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,111
Body there is no Gathering

315
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:27,743
When Michael died it wasn't the first time Patricia it had to deal with the loss of a close family member

316
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,303
Other parents came from big families

317
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,351
Advance and uncle's lots of funerals

318
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,911
End Time song passed away

319
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,727
They processed it by gathering together at the funeral

320
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,495
Talking

321
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,031
A person's life

322
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:40,799
They were

323
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,359
Bedtime

324
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,663
Without a body to place beneath the tombstone

325
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:46,943
Family Optics

326
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,223
Not that material

327
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:51,039
I mean there was a memorial Gathering but it was

328
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,343
Did it still wasn't the same

329
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:55,647
We didn't talk about it we didn't

330
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,951
Everyone just was

331
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,767
They was at 3 I remember it's just like quiet

332
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,095
And then it was just like we will go on with our lives

333
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:06,655
And and try to be normal well it wasn't Norm

334
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,215
Patricia says that Michael's death

335
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:11,775
Or rather they're not talking about Michael's death

336
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:14,335
Ended up putting a strain on her parents marriage

337
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,127
A leader separated

338
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:19,455
Patricia join the Airforce eventually attained the rank of Colonel

339
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:21,759
Life in other words went on

340
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:24,831
Even at the topic of Michael sat undiscussed

341
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,367
Finished

342
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:29,951
It was just sort of the put on an over on a Shelf

343
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:32,255
This thing that we didn't

344
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,791
Get to deal with

345
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:35,583
And

346
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,399
It didn't resurrect itself until

347
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:40,191
26 years later after he

348
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:43,007
Was killed we

349
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,543
Realize where he was

350
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:49,663
In 1994 more than two decades after Michael have been killed

351
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:52,479
Patricia and her mother received a phone call

352
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,271
Complete stranger

353
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,831
And he said I'm Ted sampley

354
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:59,135
And I am a former Green Beret

355
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,439
Who served in Vietnam

356
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:06,303
Get that we have sent passed away but back then he was sort of this minor celebrity

357
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,119
Champion the cause of Vietnam pows Mia

358
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:12,703
Just convince the government everything is new

359
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,287
I was calling Patricia with outlandish theories about Michael death

360
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:22,431
I mean there wasn't anything in his voice that was like angry or you know he would just matter-of-fact

361
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,479
But he said I started

362
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:29,343
Researching who was shot down on May 11th 1972 and

363
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:33,951
And you know what was found with him and would that be on a fighter aircraft

364
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:38,815
Evidence was circumstantial and his logic was long-winded but he said

365
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:42,143
I believe your brothers and the Tomb of the Unknown

366
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:48,031
But the body from Vietnam that President Reagan in buried with Pomp and ceremony in 1984

367
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:50,847
Wasn't unknown at all

368
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,127
That wasn't fact

369
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,663
Michael

370
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:58,783
First Patricia didn't know what to make of any of

371
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:00,319
Garcinia

372
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,367
The body never even been recovered

373
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:04,927
Remember she herself was in the Air Force

374
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,975
Getting off the phone with sample

375
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,279
She caught the Air Force cattle the office

376
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,583
Could this be true

377
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:14,399
Could Michael be in the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier

378
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,423
And

379
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:20,031
They said by no means is there anything to substantiate that your brothers in the two

380
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,567
I said but you know what

381
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:25,663
Thank you very much because that is the craziest story

382
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:29,759
That I could ever imagine that a known Soldier was in the time of the end

383
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:34,367
I mean that's the crazy is it it's just

384
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,415
It just didn't make sense

385
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,439
I thought

386
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:41,791
This is the best example of Internet conspiracy garbage I've seen to date

387
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:43,327
This is Ben's Gonzales

388
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:48,191
Through the young reporter at CBS Denver when he accidentally came across a post and family made on the internet

389
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:52,031
Lattice theory that Michael blassie have been buried in the Tomb of the unknowns

390
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,823
It was a 1997

391
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:56,127
3 years after the phone call with Patricia

392
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:59,455
He says yeah of course the First Tee totally dismissed

393
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:06,111
And I thought I'm going to print it out I'm going to show it to college classes When I visit and say this is why we say don't believe everything you read on the internet

394
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:09,183
And I did that I printed out had it on my desk at CVS

395
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:12,511
And then one evening I sat down and started reading it and I thought

396
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,327
Maybe I should check this out

397
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:20,447
Direct evidence proving that Michael blassie was in the Tomb

398
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:22,239
But that didn't make them wrong

399
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:27,103
Whatever was known about the remains of the Vietnam unknown has never been repealed

400
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:31,967
Was all part of the effort to make sure that the unknown could represent everyone who ever fought in the War

401
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:38,623
But simply have come across some secondhand accounts suggesting that America's only set of unknown remains for

402
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:44,511
From Vietnam have been recovered from the aircraft that have been shot down in 1972

403
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:50,399
And you only been able to find one missing plane that fully matched the description

404
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,703
Michael blasius

405
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:54,495
Still made it hard to believe you

406
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:57,567
It was not supposed to bury any one of the two

407
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:00,127
The chance you could be identified like this

408
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:02,943
So it's called few sources in the military

409
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,991
Not asking any hard questions

410
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,527
Just wondering

411
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,063
Embarrassed

412
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,111
Current government

413
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:13,951
Possibly bury a known person in the Tomb of the unknowns

414
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,743
Not tell anyone

415
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,791
One conversation in particular

416
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:23,167
Told me there was an attitude with in some parts of the military that might allow something like this to happen I called up

417
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:28,543
Researching The Pentagon and I tried to talk really around the issue I didn't want to let them know what I was working on

418
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,871
I finally said what if you could figure out who this was

419
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:35,711
What if we could go in and identify this person and give them back to his family

420
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:37,247
And his response was

421
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,015
Thought I would never

422
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,063
And I said but that would be the truth

423
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,367
And he said well the truth doesn't matter

424
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,903
He's not a human being anymore

425
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,255
He's a symbol in America's most sacred military Shrine and we would never let the

426
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,023
The happen

427
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:51,583
So I wrote down the truth doesn't matter on a post

428
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,887
Stuck it to my computer console

429
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,935
And I thought if there's a chance

430
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:59,519
You can figure out who this is and give him back to his family you should do

431
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,823
It's began filing for Eric

432
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,639
Try to get his hands on any government documents

433
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:05,919
About Michael blassie

434
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,479
But there were things I wanted it only family member

435
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,527
We needed an affidavit

436
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:12,319
So that was when I reached out to the

437
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,879
In contact with Patricia

438
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:15,903
Laid out of case

439
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,184
Like that

440
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,464
How do I pattern

441
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:24,608
And Vince and I started talking and I called my mom and I said you know what

442
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:25,888
It's somebody

443
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,704
And if it's Michael

444
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,752
You know we need to pursue it

445
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:34,336
Eventually gave instantly way to file yet another foia request

446
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:35,616
Special

447
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,176
Get some documents related to Michael blassie

448
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,712
I'm an Air Force Base in Texas

449
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:46,112
Not mentioning it to him not mentioning the Unknown Soldier just asking for anything with Michael blasts his name is

450
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,392
And

451
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:53,792
I got back to really thick envelope padded envelope which is more than I think I've gotten back from any other requests

452
00:21:54,048 --> 00:22:00,192
And I was actually back in Denver that point sitting in The Newsroom I opened it up and I was paging through it page after page and join

453
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:00,960
Oh my God

454
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:01,984
This is it

455
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:07,616
Cuz this wasn't just some small file continued Italy or a tantalizing clue

456
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:10,176
These were military documents showing

457
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:13,248
The entire Unknown Soldier selection process

458
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,296
When combined with his earlier research

459
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:18,368
Documents in Gonzales now held in his hands

460
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,160
Nearly complete

461
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,952
What the government do

462
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:24,256
Regarding the identity of the Unknown Soldier

463
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:26,816
Starting with something very important

464
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:29,376
Then known almost from the beginning

465
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:33,216
That Michael blasius remains had been recovered in Vietnam

466
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:35,776
And if they'd been recovered by Chris Calhoun

467
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,336
The Army ranger stations in the unlock

468
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:41,152
You know I don't really know exactly what went down

469
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,504
But I do I do know that everything pointed to me

470
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:48,576
Now remember telling didn't know Blackie personally

471
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:51,648
He was friends with a bunch of the other pilots in Michael Squadron

472
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,720
They were the guys reading the newspaper to Calhoun over the radio

473
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:57,280
It was on one of those Lonely Nights

474
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,048
Chatiw

475
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,584
They started telling them

476
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,352
Mount Michael

477
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:04,704
The only thing I know is they asked me that one of their Squadron mates have been shot down

478
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:07,008
They gave me the coordinates

479
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:10,592
And they wanted to know if we could get the body back

480
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:16,992
This was in October of 1972 over 5 months since blasts he's playing and disappeared into the jungle

481
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,808
They knew they were asking a lot

482
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,624
So I think if that Rapport wasn't there

483
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:26,720
Then the request would have never come and I would have never acted on

484
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,536
Christopher matter his regimental Commander

485
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:32,608
Who assembled a special South Vietnamese Patrol

486
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:33,632
Dressed up as the enemy

487
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,680
In North Vietnamese unit

488
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:37,728
Uniforms with

489
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:40,032
North Vietnamese weapons

490
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,568
And they went out

491
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,848
In no man's land

492
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,896
And they found the wreckage

493
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,712
And they brought back to me

494
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:50,784
What was left of the remains of Michael blassie

495
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,088
In a black

496
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,368
Plastic bag

497
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:57,184
It remains did not get this damn much

498
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,976
Just sixbones

499
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,280
But they also brought back other evidence

500
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:04,096
An inflated life raft with serial numbers

501
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:04,864
Parachute

502
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,400
Carmichael's flight suit

503
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,680
Critically

504
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:10,496
And that was a good shape

505
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:14,592
Pictures of him pictures of his family pictures of his sister

506
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,384
It was no question

507
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,432
The Remains were Michaels

508
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,504
Kristin Hannah the bag with everything in it

509
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,576
Awesome crew chief of the week's one outgoing helicopter

510
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:26,112
But he got the bag

511
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,160
The crew chief got the bag

512
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:31,488
And when you saw the remains I go in the chopper I mean

513
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,352
What was your girl we were we were sending him home to his fans

514
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,400
You know we were doing what was right

515
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,496
And of course those South Vietnamese rooster live stick

516
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,336
Get his body from the wreckage

517
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:48,640
Any deserve to go home

518
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:55,296
I just assumed that Michael's remains would be returning to his family

519
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:58,880
But according to Vince's documents that's not what happened

520
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:01,696
The Remains along with the survival gear

521
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:06,048
What eventually arrived at the Army Central identification laboratory in Hawaii

522
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,840
But not before the wallet

523
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:10,656
Continue the ID that could link the bones to blasi

524
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:11,680
Went missing

525
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:14,240
You know you knew about the missing wallet

526
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:17,312
Out of the lab using now outdated techniques

527
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:21,408
Determined that the remains did not match Michael blasius physical description

528
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:22,688
He's dead

529
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:24,224
Dedicated as

530
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,248
Btb

531
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,784
Believes to be

532
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,552
Michael blassie

533
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:30,880
Got a positive match to Army policy

534
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:34,464
Wacky family could not even be told that any remains have been found

535
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:41,632
Meanwhile pressure began to mount in the Pentagon to place a veteran from Vietnam in the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier

536
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:42,912
It was politics

537
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,960
There's also patriotism

538
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:46,752
Why there was a crass

539
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:48,288
Political angle to do this

540
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:50,336
To make nice with the Vietnam veterans

541
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:52,128
Are there was also a Feeling

542
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,968
Of we need to get someone in that tomb so the nation can feel around this

543
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:58,272
But by the 1980s

544
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:01,600
It was only one set of unidentified remains left

545
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:03,136
The ones labeled

546
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,928
Bleed to be Michael blassie

547
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,976
1980

548
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,560
Labs ordered to strip their main their Formal Connection with blassie

549
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:14,144
I'm taking the anonymous designation x26

550
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:15,936
1984

551
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:20,032
With the Reagan Administration eager to put someone on the tomb before election day

552
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,824
They were told to prepare

553
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,616
26 for burial

554
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:24,640
And I spoke with

555
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:29,248
Technicians at the Army lab later who said we gave them every answer

556
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,832
Possible to say don't do this the technology is coming

557
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:35,136
This is not an unknown set of remains

558
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:39,488
The lab technician stole the Pentagon that new dna-based technology was being developed

559
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:42,048
It would allow it remains to be conclusively identified

560
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:44,096
They also put into the artifact

561
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:46,144
Like the flight suit in the life raft

562
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,680
The record of missing wallet

563
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:51,008
All of which suggested that the remains were most likely blasius

564
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,336
But the push to put a Vietnam unknown in the Tomb

565
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,104
Overrode

566
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:58,432
And a general from the Army was sent to tell them

567
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:00,736
Everybody better get the hell out of the way

568
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:03,040
And that's when Michael blassie

569
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,320
1 into the 2

570
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:07,136
My fellow Americans

571
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,696
Memorial Day is a day of

572
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:11,488
Ceremonies and speeches

573
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:15,328
About America today we honor the dead of our Wars

574
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:19,936
And it's win President Reagan who may not have known that any of this it happened

575
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:25,056
Give a speech at a burial in Arlington invoking a powerful mystery

576
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,336
Did he marry

577
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:31,712
Expectantly to return

578
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:37,344
We'll never know the answers to these questions about his life

579
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,904
The file that means discover

580
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,464
13 years later in 1997

581
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,256
Showed that there never been

582
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,536
Any mystery at all

583
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:47,328
Armed with the documents

584
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:50,656
End up with veteran CBS correspondent Eric Anger

585
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:54,752
I talked to anyone they could find Who's involved in the unknown selection process

586
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,544
Monday felt they were ready

587
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,336
They presented their findings

588
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:01,920
And I asked my mom to

589
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:03,712
Call a family meeting

590
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:04,736
And I

591
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:08,576
We sat down and we looked at the documents together

592
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:11,136
And we discussed

593
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:11,904
You know

594
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,440
What should we do

595
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:16,512
Patricia wanted to go public with Vince and CBS

596
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,816
Her older sister Judy of anything

597
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,376
What's even more eager to blow the lid off the whole thing

598
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:22,656
George

599
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:24,192
Youngest brother

600
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,008
Michael's buried in a place of honor he pointed out

601
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:28,544
Make it stay there

602
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,824
And serves the unknown

603
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,128
Everyone else who's loved ones never come back

604
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:35,200
Tiebreaker was Michael's mother

605
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:39,552
She's a very it was a very patient Woman and

606
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:42,368
She would listen to

607
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,720
All of the opinions of you know her children are living children

608
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:47,488
And

609
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:51,584
Waited until we were done with our bantering or whatever

610
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:55,168
And and she just looked at us and she's

611
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:57,728
She said I want to bring my son home

612
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:04,384
Who sings the CBS Evening News

613
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,992
Tonight the results of an eye on America investigation lasting over half a year

614
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:15,648
Is it possible the government knows the identity of a Vietnam War casualty buried at the Tomb of the unknowns and

615
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:17,184
Arlington National Cemetery

616
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:21,792
Deliberately kept a secret from the public and even his own family

617
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:28,192
A seven-month CBS News investigation has found evidence of a long-running cover up

618
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:32,288
One story on Evening News he was more like a blizzard of stories

619
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:38,688
There are significant new developments tonight in the exclusive story that CBS News first broke on this broadcast in January

620
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:45,088
CBS is Vince Gonzalez uncovered new evidence an update tonight of our exclusive eye on America invested

621
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:45,856
Location

622
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:48,928
I think we did 15 or 18 pieces on this

623
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:51,232
It just was Non-Stop

624
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:53,280
And tonight is everything Burke tells us

625
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,048
There's more

626
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:59,168
The CVS in blasi family in just want the world to know that Michael as he was in the Tomb

627
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:01,728
I wanted the Pentagon to do something about it

628
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,080
Michael blassie sister Pat says the family wants the remains tested

629
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:09,152
Even if by some chance they aren't identified as my

630
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,968
Now Congress wants to investigate

631
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,296
If it's Michael we want bring them home

632
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:18,112
Edit certain point

633
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,416
They called us up

634
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,440
And they said

635
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,720
You're killing us

636
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:23,488
And

637
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:27,328
Day or two later they announced the team would be open to the remains were going to be

638
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,960
On May 14th 1998

639
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:39,360
The Department of Defense disinterred the remains of the Vietnam veteran from the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier

640
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:42,176
DNA samples were taken from Michael's mother jeans

641
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,456
Dexter Judy

642
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:45,248
Protected against the Romaine

643
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,296
They were match

644
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:50,880
And after the scientist were finished talking to my mother

645
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:56,000
We were wrapping things up cuz that my mother had to sign some papers and things like that and

646
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:57,280
And

647
00:30:57,536 --> 00:31:00,352
Then all the sudden man walked up and said well

648
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,144
When we opened the tomb

649
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:04,704
To do the DNA test

650
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:08,544
Michael's artifacts were in the Tomb with him

651
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:11,872
And what would you like us to do with them

652
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:18,528
The life raft in other items have been found at the crash in 1972 I mean the only physical evidence

653
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:20,064
Aside from the missing wallet

654
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,880
That could have tied the remains to Michael blassie

655
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:26,464
But it was to preserve the artifacts or to hide them

656
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:28,768
Someone at the Army lab in Hawaii

657
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:31,584
I put them where no one would ever think to look

658
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:33,632
The casket with Michael

659
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:39,520
I've been sitting in the two underneath the guards in the crowds in the Arlington soil

660
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:41,056
14 years

661
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,104
They were in a box

662
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:47,200
And so after we buried Michael in St Louis

663
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:50,016
There was a reception and then once everyone laugh

664
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:53,856
We sit around the table and my brother George

665
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,904
Opened up the box and started

666
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,952
Pulling out the life raft

667
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:00,000
Portions of his

668
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:03,328
Parachute portions of his flight suit

669
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:07,424
And I have them with me today I I keep it with me

670
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:12,032
I was really glad I'm really glad to have them

671
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:19,200
Today there is nobody representing Vietnam at the Tomb of the unknowns

672
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:21,248
And thanks to improved forensics

673
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,832
It will likely never be an unknown from Iraq

674
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:26,112
Or Afghanistan

675
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,904
Or any future War

676
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:34,816
Military is now in the process of using the DNA from the families of missing veterans to identify / 604

677
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:37,632
He sets of unknown remains from the Korean War

678
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:42,496
It's conceivable that they could use the same techniques on the Korean unknown inside the tomb

679
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:45,312
Guns from World War 1 and World War II

680
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:46,080
Safe

681
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:46,848
Now

682
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,896
Premier of 23andMe

683
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:49,920
Well

684
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,456
What's your Say anything's possible

685
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:54,016
You go to Arlington today

686
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,320
The Tomb of the unknowns is still there

687
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:58,624
Minus the remains for Vietnam

688
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:05,280
Datura still take pictures on their phones and the guard still make their rounds in perfect silent precision

689
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:06,816
Day and night

690
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:08,864
Even when no one is watching

691
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:10,912
And it really is beautiful

692
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:12,448
You should go see it

693
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:15,008
The Heyday of this unique

694
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,544
Form of remembrance

695
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:18,336
Has come to an end

696
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,640
Avenue

697
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:23,200
Like the dad knew that there is no

698
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:25,248
I know for Vietnam anymore

699
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:28,832
I I can't say that it saddens me

700
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:31,392
I can't say that

701
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,696
That I

702
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,024
I respect the Tomb of the unknowns

703
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:38,560
But it

704
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,352
In order to

705
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,656
Have an unknown

706
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:43,936
They made one

707
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,240
They took Michael's name away from

708
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,568
To satisfy

709
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:53,408
Something that I understand it was very important to our nation

710
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:59,552
But the first thing that you and I did when we met one another over the phone hi I'm

711
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:02,368
I'm Patricia and Pat hi I'm Joe

712
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:05,696
A name is very very important

713
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:10,048
Patricia still visits Batu

714
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:12,608
She said she's not sure why she does it

715
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:15,168
It means that she's got to know some of the guards

716
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:18,240
One of them lights holder that their mission

717
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,776
Gardenias

718
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:21,312
It's never really over

719
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:23,616
Michael's case

720
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:25,152
Just once

721
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,944
Their mission was completed

722
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:29,248
They're just looking out for him

723
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:31,040
We could go home

724
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:55,360
Joe talks me through the very precise ceremony that has evolved at the Tomb of the Unknown

725
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:56,896
After this

726
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,552
Between the beeps bongs and chatter of our devices

727
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:07,136
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

728
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,160
If

729
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:14,560
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife is

730
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:18,656
All hearing that voice

731
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:20,448
Technology talk to us

732
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,496
It is a creation of Sonic trap

733
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:25,568
Mets Joel Beckerman he's a sound designer and composer

734
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:29,152
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

735
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:31,200
To make them more human

736
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,040
Turn the living room lights on

737
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:36,832
Okay

738
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:39,392
Dim the living room lights to 50%

739
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:41,440
Okay

740
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:47,840
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

741
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:50,656
Makes for a much more natural experience

742
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:52,704
Turn the living room lights on

743
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:56,800
Dim the living room lights to 50%

744
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:04,224
We're presenting to special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

745
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,040
About how are soundscape is impacting our health

746
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:09,600
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

747
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:14,720
Look for them Fridays May 17th and May 24th right here on the 99

748
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:17,792
Okay

749
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:19,584
When I was a little boy

750
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,120
My parents and

751
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:22,400
I think my grandparents

752
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:24,704
Live just outside of Washington DC

753
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:29,056
They took me to Arlington Cemetery to see the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier

754
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:32,640
And I've seen a reason I remember it so well

755
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:34,176
And the reason

756
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:36,992
I became interested in the Tomb again more recently

757
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,600
Is not the mysterious soldier in the Tomb projecting

758
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:46,464
Whatever you want on to his anonymity exactly the gar

759
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:50,304
And it's not so scaredy of the Guard keeping vigil like

760
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,120
Solemn Duty as much as it is what the guard is

761
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:54,400
Physically doing

762
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:59,008
And what they're doing most of the time it's just taking 21 steps to the left

763
00:36:59,264 --> 00:36:59,776
Turning

764
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,824
Stopping for 21 seconds

765
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:04,384
And turning and stopping for another 21

766
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:07,200
Been taking 21 steps to the right

767
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:10,528
Stopping again turning again stopping again stepping again

768
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,832
Over and over and over

769
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:16,160
Until there's a guard change every 30 minutes to an hour

770
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,696
That's something very

771
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:18,976
Very precise

772
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,768
Yeah and actually that's me like

773
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:22,816
You say that but you have

774
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:28,960
Let me sell you on this by Lisa showing you a video of what this

775
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:54,048
Stripes on the legs

776
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:54,816
Zelda

777
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:56,864
Innovation

778
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:04,544
So is regimented as I was imagining it

779
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,312
Annies

780
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:11,712
Even more so he's like the innards of a Swiss clock the way that they move together and then they move in time

781
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:12,480
Stunning

782
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:16,320
Yeah I know and what is different kind of really appreciate it is just the way like

783
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:17,088
If you have liked

784
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:20,928
Taking away with

785
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:22,720
Precision it hasn't

786
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:24,000
This way of

787
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:25,536
Magnifying the silence

788
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:29,120
Around it is it kind of weird silence

789
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,144
To it

790
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,680
And apparently

791
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:34,496
To get this right they train and practice for months

792
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,544
Facility

793
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:39,104
Chinese it's almost meditative like you said like

794
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,944
Inside of the silence we hear the clicking of their shoes in there

795
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,224
Heels together

796
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:47,552
You do get this space that's created inside of it that's

797
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:48,320
Derry Medical

798
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:51,392
The word that just instantly came to mind is like Zen

799
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:53,696
You watch the market marching back and forth

800
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:55,232
And the guards

801
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:57,280
When you doing it they don't seem a lot

802
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,048
In the performance

803
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,072
Instead

804
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,352
At every step

805
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,632
They are totally present

806
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,936
They're completely aware of their surroundings

807
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:06,496
They're truly doing nothing

808
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:07,520
But this

809
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:09,568
Unless

810
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:11,104
You start laughing

811
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:16,224
It is requested at officers maintain an atmosphere of Silence

812
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,504
And respect

813
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,784
Adult time

814
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:31,584
Bert's out of nowhere and this is what happens if you get like kind of to rowdy

815
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,888
Are you laugh at the Tomb of the Unknown

816
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,240
Genre of YouTube videos

817
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:41,312
I'd like to guards yelling it

818
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,848
Visiting

819
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:47,968
Let's let's find it let's find another one

820
00:39:55,392 --> 00:40:00,768
And like what they catch. Up thinking like very their tone they can switch up the words a little bit

821
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:07,168
Agar depends on there may be there that day

822
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:15,360
Oh I love it just let him have it at this is this is one where are they they reprimands some parent

823
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:19,968
Visitors must keep their children behind the grape trains and rail

824
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:22,272
Thank you

825
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:29,184
Billy Beane Yankees back real fast sneak in

826
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,280
What kind of behind the rails you can get a few of them and then they're yelled at and then they just like

827
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:39,936
They freeze like like like chipmunks have been like caught out in the open and then just like

828
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,008
Terrifying

829
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:46,848
My favorite, though is it from YouTube user who said and I quote

830
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:51,456
When I was 10 years old I made the mistake of sitting down during The Changing of the Guard

831
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:52,736
I almost shat

832
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:59,136
Does any other National Monument have something

833
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:04,256
In like this where there's this 24/7 ritual white why in particular is it happening right here

834
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:07,072
Question because

835
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:08,096
The thing

836
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:09,888
About the tomb

837
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:10,656
Is it like

838
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:17,824
The way it is now is not the way it always was it evolve into all of this kind of Pomp and ceremony and

839
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:21,664
When it was first married in 1921

840
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:23,712
The big moment

841
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:26,272
Question because

842
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,296
The Sting

843
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:29,088
About the tomb

844
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:30,112
Is it like

845
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,232
The way it is now is not the way it always was it evolve into all of this kind of

846
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:37,024
Pomp and ceremony at home

847
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:40,864
When it was first married in 1921

848
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:45,728
With a big moment I think it was the first like Nationwide radio dress that the president

849
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:49,312
Ever gave was from the commemoration the Tomb of the Unknown

850
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:52,128
But it was just kind of a slow stones

851
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,663
Slab

852
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:55,967
End

853
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:59,039
Between a second-rate monument for a while

854
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:01,343
But people would picnic fare

855
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:04,927
And photographers would like cuz it has a great view of

856
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:07,487
Yeah I love both of them to surrounding area cuz it's fun

857
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:11,327
Is hell and photographers would actually kind of set up shop there and people would like

858
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:15,167
Who's on the 2

859
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:19,775
And people but apparently like veterans caught on to this and started complaining about it cuz

860
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:20,543
They saw that kind of

861
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:21,311
Keyboard

862
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:23,103
Treating it yeah like

863
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:26,943
Cigarettes on it

864
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:31,039
And so they kind of complaint about the Congress and eventually

865
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:33,087
The government has money to it to post

866
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:33,855
Guard

867
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:36,927
And then starting the 1937 the guard was

868
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:37,951
24/7

869
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:39,999
And I think a painting

870
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:43,839
Records on this one some say night since 1937 other say since 1948

871
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:44,863
The guard has

872
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:45,631
Never left

873
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:48,447
State Fair

874
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:51,519
And then nothing happened during that time is that

875
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,567
They always intended for there to be like Amour

876
00:42:54,079 --> 00:43:00,223
Updated fancy tune but it just took them forever to get around to getting the funding and spit events that they did

877
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:02,783
And so they built the kind of the giant sarcophagus

878
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:04,063
Annie 1931

879
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:07,647
And for that date they went to this query in Colorado actually

880
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:09,183
To ensure that they got the exact

881
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:11,743
Same marble as the Lincoln Memorial

882
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:16,863
And it wasn't designed by these guys it was sculpted like the actual physical problems by this light

883
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:19,167
Gorilla

884
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:21,727
Who were the Italian brothers

885
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:26,335
Who sculpted like everything is called the Lincoln Memorial and my favorite is a sculpted the two lions

886
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:27,615
In front of the

887
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:28,639
New York City

888
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:29,919
Wow

889
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,711
And then

890
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:33,503
In 1956 that's when we started

891
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:34,271
Adding is

892
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:35,551
Further

893
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,087
World War II

894
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:42,975
Excetera hangzhou just built and built and built

895
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:45,023
It has the image of

896
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:48,351
An almost Timeless tradition when you see it like this

897
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:50,143
But actually kind of

898
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:50,911
The fact

899
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:51,679
This is

900
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:52,959
Something that was

901
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:56,031
You know iterated upon and improved and

902
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:58,591
Given a little more weight over time

903
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:04,735
Aw appreciate it because I love when something iterative in the direction of honing towards austerity in LA

904
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:07,295
Internet

905
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:08,831
I'm feeling like clutter

906
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:10,111
Getting more casual

907
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:10,879
Or something

908
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:12,415
It's a fascinating

909
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:13,439
Place

910
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:14,975
Particularly because of the

911
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:16,255
Ceremony makes

912
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:17,279
All the more

913
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,047
Special

914
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:22,143
Have you ever had a chance to speak to one of the guards when you join the 40

915
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:24,191
I confess

916
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:30,847
Did not manage to Teresa guard in time for this coda

917
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:37,247
But

918
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:41,343
But I got the next best thing which is I found it one of the guards dude of course

919
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,111
Ireddit

920
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:47,487
And of course

921
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:53,631
What are things like when your reporter and you seen ask me anything thread you're like you go through it hoping someone's going to ask like

922
00:44:53,887 --> 00:45:00,031
Question you would ask only question I want to ask

923
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:02,335
Just doing the long 30 minutes long hour

924
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:03,871
Marching back and forth

925
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:06,431
Meditative state right

926
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:08,223
And to finally something like that

927
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:10,527
That's right and the guard responded

928
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:15,647
I wish I could say that while we were doing this job we're just meditating I wanted means to guard the unknown

929
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:17,695
We are human and we are on duty for long

930
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:20,255
It's our minds do Wonder quite a bit

931
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:24,607
Was so disappointing to read

932
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:26,911
No but it's really human you know

933
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:31,007
I know but you were here to hear the irony was like I realized like when I was doing the story

934
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:37,407
Whatever they want on to the mystery of love

935
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:39,199
I like that's of course my

936
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:42,527
Repertorial and being really conceited and thinking like I'm above that

937
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:43,295
I don't fault

938
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:48,159
Symbolism

939
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:52,511
Like what do I want to see like I'm a reporter at 9 x invisible live in San Francisco

940
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:58,911
I see like the den meditation

941
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:01,983
Of course like in the ask me anything. He's just like no no no

942
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:03,775
Whatever

943
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:06,079
Dinner is right

944
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:10,175
And so you know I guess the the tomb is working smash
