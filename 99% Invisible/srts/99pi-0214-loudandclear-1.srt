This is 99% invisible

18
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:09,120
I'm Roman Mars

19
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,912
And this is the sound of

20
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:13,728
Well. I'm going to play U2 sound and if you're old enough

21
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:15,776
You'll be able to identify it right away

22
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:24,992
That's the sound of a brand new cassette tape being unwrapped and put into a cassette deck

23
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:31,904
That's my friend and fellow radiotopia and Benjamin Walker he hosts the show Theory of Everything and he's definitely old enough

24
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,672
You know that sound

25
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:34,208
Yeah well so are you pal

26
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:39,584
Benjamin is sitting in a car a car that happens to have a tape deck

27
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,424
With andreea heart who works with these sub pop record label

28
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,448
Started doing

29
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:51,872
Every release you're not familiar with subpop it's kind of this small but between money record label that is signed to the best

30
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,920
Indie bands in the last 30 years

31
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,968
Nirvana sleater-kinney

32
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:57,760
Postal Service beach house

33
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:02,624
And Andrea has a job at sub pop that a lot of people might not imagine exist

34
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,160
Any modern record label

35
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,696
I work at sub pop records

36
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,232
Cassette printer

37
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:10,048
It's crazy as something of even held

38
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:10,816
Look at that in my head

39
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,352
For a long time

40
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:17,728
This job handling cassette production at some pop it disappeared completely for a while

41
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:24,128
The recently record stores and Distributors have been requesting sub pop to release their titles on cassette

42
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,712
And sub pop asked Aundrea to oversee the operation

43
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,040
2000 +

44
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,320
Teen

45
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,088
The plan is

46
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,112
For every

47
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,392
Your release is

48
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,416
To get a

49
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,464
If to get a kiss at release

50
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:45,888
I don't like this. It for the sake of it and it's clear to me why two sets of been replaced now a couple of times over by more

51
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:46,912
More convenient medium

52
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:49,472
Mediums where you can actually skip tracks

53
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,776
And you don't have to rewind when you're done listening

54
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:54,592
But I do think they're a lot of good things about the cassette

55
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:55,616
First off

56
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,664
You can fix a messed up cassette

57
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,944
With some patients

58
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,968
Pencil

59
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,248
Plus

60
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:03,296
There's never been a better way to make a mix

61
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:07,136
You can have a tape floating around on the floor of your car per year

62
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,672
And then throw it in your tape deck

63
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,952
And it sounds great

64
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:13,024
Well it's not okay and never really found a great

65
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,048
In any case

66
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:18,400
Subpop is betting that some of us will want to hear our favorite albums on cassette

67
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,168
Again

68
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:20,448
But

69
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:24,288
There is one population that never stop listening to music on cassette

70
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:28,128
That's filmmaker Alex Lambert we've been working together on this story

71
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,688
Actually I'm just going to hand it over to her now

72
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,808
The United States prison system has the largest prison population in the world

73
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,416
And when the more than 2 million prisoners in this country have access to music

74
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,696
It's often on cassette

75
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:45,280
Will my number 132 Chief around here is

76
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,560
My Walkman

77
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:47,584
My Chase

78
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:50,144
Legal papers

79
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,424
SF bottled water

80
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,216
Do they have everything together

81
00:03:54,752 --> 00:04:00,896
That's Adolfo Davis at 14 years old he was involved in a gang-related shooting he was tried as an adult and sentenced to

82
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:07,296
To life in prison is 39 now and he's serving his sentence at Stateville Correctional Center in Illinois

83
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:11,392
Listening to music on tapes is one of his only means of Escape

84
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:16,512
I made it so far because I have a good imagination is

85
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,351
I just closed my eyes to my earbuds

86
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,143
I just be gone

87
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:26,495
In 1990 the year Adolfo was incarcerated

88
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:29,055
Everybody was listening to music on cassette tape

89
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:35,455
Adolpho had some with him when he went to prison

90
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,479
Is

91
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,015
Big Mike's

92
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:41,343
Yeah when I leave for sale drugs I have a fanny pack

93
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:44,671
And I have my Walkman in my fanny pack with my taste

94
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:49,535
It obvious to the Walkman while watching out for security for the police

95
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,071
A fanny pack

96
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,375
Couch but

97
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:04,895
Just a few years after Adolfo was locked up the cassette tape would be all but replaced by the CD out here in the

98
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:05,663
The Free World

99
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,687
Put in prison

100
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,223
The cassette they've gone

101
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,295
I need to order cake

102
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,623
The younger generation that I can talk to

103
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:25,375
And not just any old cassette tape is allowed in prison require a very specific type of

104
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:28,703
Cassette tape has to be clear it has to be

105
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:32,031
Sonically welded so it can't be taken apart and put back together

106
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:36,127
And the box that goes in has to all be also be perfectly clear

107
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,407
That's deep step

108
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:42,271
Owner of National Audio company America's pre-eminent manufacturer of cassette tapes

109
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:45,343
The reason you can't have a 5 screw cassette

110
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,903
Or maybe a colored cassette that's opaque

111
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,183
Is they don't want

112
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:54,815
Does a razor blade are Narcotics or something else to be enclosed in a cassette

113
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:58,399
They do have people in the correctional facilities who

114
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:03,519
Look at and inspect incoming materials and they have to be able to see through or they won't allow them at

115
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:09,919
Steve has gotten familiar with this subfield of cassette tape manufacturing even though it is not the focus of his business

116
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:13,503
Mostly he makes normal cassette tapes for a number of different markets

117
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,063
Music labels spoken word audio books

118
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:20,927
See's factory in Springfield Missouri produces both blank tapes

119
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:23,487
And tapes with audio already on them

120
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,815
Machines Kool-Aid all those parts together

121
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:29,375
Transfer the cross on a conveyor

122
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:32,447
And then wrap them with cellophane and put at airstrip in

123
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,031
Steve was one of the first people in the cassette industry

124
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:38,591
And he's one of the only people still in it

125
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:44,223
We're the only people I know of most of the people left in the cassette industry are

126
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,575
Mom and pop shops are small operations

127
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:51,903
If you purchase a cassette recently from anywhere

128
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:58,303
RadioShack are from the merch table of some pump and you just so live it probably started out in Steve's Factor

129
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:02,143
His company ships out up to 100,000 cassette today

130
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,983
Any small number of those cassettes are special orders for prisoners

131
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:08,543
Made with clear plastic and without screws

132
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:11,615
Once the tapes leave here we don't really see where they end up

133
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:19,295
As for why cassettes have stuck around in prisons all these years

134
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,599
It's hard to get a definitive answer

135
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,391
Because every prison is different

136
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,951
But there's one Theory we heard from a few different people

137
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:29,279
Tapes are allowed because CDs are easier to weaponize

138
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,559
They say that

139
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,351
It's the most safest way

140
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:36,703
For them to listen to music through the CD you can break and maybe cut somebody with

141
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:41,311
That's Chris Barrett this Abraham was recorded a couple years ago for a short film

142
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:46,943
Chris used to run a service that help families send packages to people in prison in New York state

143
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:51,039
Get a warehouse full of items that had already been approved by the prison authorities

144
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,575
Everything from food

145
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,343
Clothing

146
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,367
Boxer shorts

147
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,647
Gazette

148
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,927
Instead of CDs

149
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,999
Three never really understood the logic behind it

150
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,535
They let me sell

151
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,071
Tuna fish cans

152
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,095
That

153
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,631
You know you pull off the top

154
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,167
And that thing is metal like

155
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:10,239
Much more dangerous and a CD is my point

156
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,519
Tuna fish canned india

157
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,567
I don't know why bae

158
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:18,687
Come up with some of the rules and they come up with we just try to stay

159
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,223
Within those guidelines

160
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:25,343
Chris whose package sending service recently went out of business

161
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,903
Also sold a lot of cassette Walkman

162
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:31,743
Walkmans used to be available for purchase in prison commissaries

163
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,279
They generally heart anymore

164
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,583
Which makes them extremely coveted items

165
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:40,447
Max my Walkman break I'm out of there so I'll take good care of it

166
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,239
Blinky lights

167
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:48,639
And wear-and-tear is not the only threat to the life of a Walkman

168
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:54,783
But when it's like amazing shake down and they bring other officers from other institutions

169
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:58,623
They will just break your TV break your radio

170
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:01,951
Take those cheesy take your radio take your cassette tapes

171
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:02,975
Washington

172
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,511
Destroy my Walkman

173
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,815
I cannot get another Walkman

174
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,911
This is probably one of the most prized

175
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:11,935
Items

176
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,543
It'll try to hold out as much as they can

177
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,335
Singapore checked in as much as possible

178
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,639
That's efren paredes Jr

179
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:25,503
He was a fifteen-year-old honor student when he was tried as an adult on a murder charge

180
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:29,599
And sentenced to life without parole he's always maintained his innocence

181
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:35,743
Efren is 43 now and during his 28 years in prison he amassed a pretty big collection of music

182
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:39,327
Call my favorite Kendrick Lamar

183
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,631
I like Young Jeezy Rick Ross

184
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:42,911
Meek Mills

185
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,703
I like Lil Wayne

186
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:51,359
At Muskegon Correctional Facility in Michigan where Ethan is serving his sentence

187
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:54,175
Prisoners can actually have MP3 players

188
00:09:54,431 --> 00:10:00,575
Inmates can purchase an MP3 player through the prison commissary and then download music to it through a kiosk provided by

189
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,623
Company called access entertainment

190
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:07,999
Before downloading the app to transfer money to the company and receive a credit for a certain amount of songs

191
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,791
But there's a catch

192
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,351
Michigan there's a policy that

193
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,655
They try to restrict as much

194
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,703
As much music

195
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,751
What do

196
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:21,055
Labels at parental advisory

197
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:26,175
In other words the state of Michigan will try and sentence a 15 year old as an adult

198
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,223
The winning becomes an actual adult

199
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:31,551
State won't let him purchase music deemed inappropriate for a teenager

200
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:35,135
It's interesting that you know that the Department Corrections has never

201
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,719
Taking any steps to restricting

202
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:40,511
Cassette tape purchases

203
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:45,631
We couldn't confirm that there were no restrictions on cassette music but efront hasn't encountered them

204
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,959
And that's why he says a lot of inmates still prefer cassettes

205
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:53,567
They listen to them all the time on their personal walkmans and sometimes out loud

206
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:57,151
Actually as long as we're talking right now

207
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,711
A gentleman in the bathroom

208
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,991
Washing clothes

209
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,039
What is radio on

210
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:04,575
Playing

211
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,623
The song play at your own risk

212
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:14,303
Writer needs a part of the prison or Ephraim is locked up is the one that houses the prisoners in solitary confinement

213
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:20,191
Who is here guys all the time yelling up to music

214
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,727
Rick Ross

215
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,519
Turn on Meek Mills

216
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,055
This what they been waiting for

217
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,871
You know something so they can hear down there

218
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:29,663
Something

219
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:32,223
Music from upstairs

220
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,527
I used to pray

221
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,551
Times like this

222
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,343
So I had to

223
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,671
I like this in a matter of

224
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,695
Time I spent

225
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,511
Patty wagon

226
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:56,031
Prisons tend to be late adopters of technology so maybe one day all prisons in the US will just make the switch from cassette

227
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:56,799
To digital

228
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:59,103
Or maybe they'll go to CDs first at the beach

229
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,895
The logically chronological

230
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:06,015
Whatever the format the most important thing about music to Efren and Adolfo

231
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,551
Is escape and connection

232
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:13,183
Here's Adolfo again

233
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,207
Music

234
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:16,767
Allowed to escape from this place

235
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,815
I can't I can't

236
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:22,911
Do without my music in a day

237
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:27,007
I bought Walkman with somebody else

238
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,031
Slot go to sleep

239
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,847
The days that you don't have you

240
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:36,735
I play my Walkman like 3 days then I'll let it rest like 2 days

241
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:39,807
He rests his Walkman

242
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,831
That is love

243
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:52,095
99percentinvisible was produces week by Benjamin Walker and Alex Lambert with Katie mingle Sam Greenspan Sharif Youssef

244
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:55,423
Pickles that Delaney Hall Avery troubleman and me Roman Mars

245
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:59,775
The audio you heard from Chris Barrett the guy who sent packages to prisoners

246
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:03,615
What's from the film the prison in twelve Landscapes by Brett story

247
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:08,223
For more information about where and how to see that film go to prison Landscapes. Com

248
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:12,575
Special things to Elyse blennerhassett she introduced us to both Adolfo antifa

249
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:17,695
Slightly different version of this story will air on Benjamin Walker's Theory of Everything

250
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:22,559
Benjamin is one of my oldest friends and radio and you should definitely be friends with him too

251
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,863
But in case you don't already listen

252
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:29,215
This is one of my favorite Clips Miss program that has a little bit more Benjamin Walker in it

253
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,087
There's this painting

254
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,623
That I keep with me

255
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:47,647
Always

256
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:50,975
It's one of those little postcard reproduction

257
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:54,303
I've even made a gold frame for it out of balsa wood

258
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,607
The painting is called

259
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,631
The artist

260
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,911
In his Studio

261
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,471
It's by John Singer Sargent

262
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,031
I brought it with me here to the studio

263
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,591
I have it right here in front of me

264
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,895
Propped up next to the microphone

265
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,455
The painting

266
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:14,783
It takes a Man painting a picture in his Studio

267
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,343
But this artist studio

268
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,135
Is not an ordinary Studio

269
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,439
It is the artist home

270
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:24,511
The man has his painting propped up

271
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,303
On the bed and the bureau

272
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,095
There is no easel

273
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,399
You get the idea that

274
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:33,727
The only things in the room are the bed the bureau

275
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,519
And the chair upon which the name Sid

276
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:41,151
The man is confined to extremely small quarters

277
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,943
The setting is grim

278
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:47,039
And it contrasts with the painting that the man is working on

279
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,575
Alliance k

280
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:51,135
The man is painting a landscape

281
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:55,743
Horses Meander through a soft Green Meadow

282
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:58,047
And the trees are Lush and full

283
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:01,119
The Blue Horizon is dotted with clouds

284
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:09,567
Most Sergeant commentators dismiss this pain

285
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,639
They consider to be nothing but a silly joke

286
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:16,479
An artist painting landscape it is cramped doleful bedroom

287
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:19,039
But I consider this painting

288
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:24,159
Because it captures the idea that through ART

289
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,951
Man is able

290
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,975
Transcend

291
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:27,999
Is this MO

292
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:28,767
Squaw

293
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:29,791
Surrounded

294
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,423
This painting

295
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,447
Is not a joke

296
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:39,007
This artist is not painting

297
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,031
A landscape

298
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,591
This artist is painting

299
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,615
A window

300
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,247
Look out this window for a moment

301
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:52,319
Here let me move out of your way

302
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,367
You'll find The View

303
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,159
It's breathtaking

304
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,423
I spend

305
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:10,495
My entire life looking for the way

306
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:13,055
To get to the other side of this window

307
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,847
I've Been Told

308
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,639
Time and time again

309
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:18,431
That I'm wasting my effort

310
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,735
But I've never given up

311
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:24,063
Always known that there is a way

312
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,343
The break the glass

313
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,367
In crawl

314
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:28,415
Over the window sill

315
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,975
Always been certain of it

316
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,511
And I made a vow

317
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,047
That I would never give up

318
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,839
Until I discovered

319
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,119
The secret

320
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,215
Your snickering at me

321
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,519
Well go ahead now

322
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:46,335
You think I'm crazy for believing that there

323
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:48,383
On the other side of this window

324
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,663
Well I'm not

325
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,455
The reality

326
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,735
On the other side

327
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:57,087
Is just as real as the one we stand in right now

328
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,879
Sometimes

329
00:16:59,391 --> 00:16:59,903
I think

330
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,695
It's even more real

331
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:05,535
But we do not have to go into that now

332
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:08,351
I have not brought you here to this window

333
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,655
Discuss the metaphysics of reality

334
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:13,215
Brought you here to this window

335
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:13,983
Because

336
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,031
I need your help

337
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,311
UC

338
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,591
I believe

339
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,639
Finally

340
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,663
Discover

341
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:22,943
The secret

342
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:28,063
So I'm going to go to the other side of the studio now

343
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,599
I need you

344
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:32,159
Ted Leo down here and in the front

345
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,487
I'm going to count to three

346
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,279
And on three

347
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,327
I'm going to run towards you

348
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,863
And you are going to

349
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,887
Lift me

350
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,191
Into the air

351
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:45,983
You're going to

352
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,007
How to fold me

353
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,031
Through

354
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,055
The window

355
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:52,639
Kennewick

356
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,711
With your help

357
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,503
I'm going to break the glass

358
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,039
Everland

359
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,319
On the other side

360
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:02,879
Stop

361
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,439
On three

362
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:12,863
1

363
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:19,263
Who

364
