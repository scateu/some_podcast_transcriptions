Have this habit

26
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:42,144
Walking into any

27
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,424
Door if it's unlocked

28
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,496
Actually

29
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,032
Does me well here in Macau

30
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:48,800
Capital because

31
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,848
You start poking around

32
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:53,664
Going into doors and you find the coolest

33
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:00,064
You have to appreciate the Moxy of someone who can wander around the Federal Building open up a random door and announce to whoever's on the other side

34
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:00,832
Hello

35
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:07,744
Hi I'm Andrea Seabrook with NPR you didn't catch that that's in VR Congressional correspondent Andrea Seabrook

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,768
Reporter

37
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,816
Poking around looking it

38
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:11,840
Secret

39
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,120
Things

40
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:16,448
I am so in love with Andrea Seabrook right now

41
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:22,848
Woman on the other side of the door tells Andrea that she needs to leave and that walking into random doors in the basement of the US Capitol building

42
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,640
Is not what she supposed to be doing

43
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:27,968
And that's 99percentinvisible Zone Sam Greenspan

44
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:30,016
He went with Andrea to the Capitol Building

45
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,576
I'm so jealous pain right now

46
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:35,136
That's not what we're supposed to be doing

47
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,584
I don't care what they think I'm supposed to be doing

48
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,120
I'm here

49
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,168
The governor of the United States

50
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,984
Frankly I see this is part of it

51
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:05,088
Even if you try to set aside its role as the Hub of Western democracy the Capitol building itself just the building

52
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:07,392
Is an overwhelming structure

53
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:10,464
6000 people who work in this complex

54
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,304
That's including the staffers though not including the politicians I mean it

55
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:17,632
A huge City and it has one

56
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:18,912
Function

57
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,448
Can call it a function

58
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:22,752
And that is running low

59
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,544
Legislative branch government

60
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,616
You know riding the bills and cleaning the toilet

61
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:30,688
As if we could tell the difference and my rights

62
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:39,904
The capital is known for its Grandeur of the Rotunda Statuary Hall the Crypt the marble staircases as places

63
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,464
Unbelievably ornamental

64
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,864
The walls upstairs kept gorgeous freezes you know with birds and squirrels and gorgeous

65
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,632
Gorgeous

66
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:52,192
Lilting beautiful paint work

67
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:54,496
And that's all the stuff we're supposed to say

68
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:58,336
But when you're an inveterate door knob Turner and Snoop like Andrea Seabrook

69
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:01,664
You also get to know the capital below the surface literally

70
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,432
The basement

71
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:07,296
Down here there's a whole bunch of Engineers Unilock HVAC engineers in

72
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:11,136
Blue uniforms it's a like you know Joe on them

73
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:16,256
The purpose of the building the business of government trickles down to these lower levels

74
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:19,071
The members of the House

75
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:22,655
Republican caucus and sometimes a Democrat meet in the basement

76
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:27,263
For there should have closed or secret strategy sessions and

77
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,591
It's a really good place to

78
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,687
Place to get

79
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,247
Tip from

80
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,295
Members that you know about what's going on

81
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:44,927
The main reason we're here is to see a little bit of the architectural Grandeur that is trickled down here to

82
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:47,487
PLS checking to be engineers

83
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:59,263
School is dumb

84
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:05,151
Andrea is leading me through the serpentine route of Ali's doorways and really in the oh my gosh

85
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:10,271
Here we are it's amazing and then there's these

86
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:11,551
Bathtub

87
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,111
It's amazing

88
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,135
Beautiful

89
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:19,999
Marble bathtubs with marble steps that lead up to them and Brass fitting

90
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,047
Beautiful

91
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,327
Bathtub

92
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,887
Just to describe it a little bit it's

93
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,167
It's sort of o

94
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:31,263
White Ivory marble that has this luster

95
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:34,335
It reminds me of the Venus de Milo or something

96
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:37,919
Trying to close a little bit and it's got very faint

97
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:40,479
Black beans in it and it's just

98
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,759
Gorgeous

99
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:45,343
The Curves in it are so

100
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:51,743
Gentle and continuous the tubs possess the room itself is the exact opposite

101
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:55,327
This place was supposed to cool off Senators now it cools

102
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:58,143
And he eats the entire Capitol building stairs

103
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,679
Big HVAC equipment in

104
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:02,239
Computer servers and large steel cabinets

105
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:06,847
Containing god-knows-what even though the bathtubs a little the sink and toilet were here first

106
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,895
They're the ones that seem out of place

107
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:11,455
The bathtubs were installed around 1860

108
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:13,247
During the expansion of the capital

109
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,623
DC is known for its swampy Somers and Legend has it that Senators could be banished from the chamber

110
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,903
If they were too smelly

111
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:23,487
It still reeks but yeah back that it was less figurative

112
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,791
And most people the time even politicians

113
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,583
Didn't have indoor plumbing come

114
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:32,191
So Congress needed a place where the politicians could go and wash up

115
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:35,519
Andrea reads from an informational card beside the tub

116
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,543
Okay here we go

117
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:39,871
Each bathtub and I am standing in one right now

118
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,431
Was carved in Italy

119
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,967
From a single block

120
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:45,503
Of carrara marble

121
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:51,135
3 bathtubs were shipped from Genoa Italy in July 1859

122
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,951
Unreached Baltimore in November of that year

123
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,487
July to November

124
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:58,815
The other three were shipped from Leghorn Italy

125
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:04,447
In September of 1859 and arrived in New York in January of 1860

126
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:11,871
The precise date for the bathtubs arrival and installation at the capitol or uncertain but the Senate bathing room is no

127
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,663
Don't have been in operation as of

128
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,223
February 23rd 1860

129
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:19,295
Each of the six tubs cost 90 bucks in eighteen

130
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:22,111
Which is around $2,500 up

131
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,135
Peace today

132
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,159
And that was justified

133
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:27,231
You got to figure out shipping from Italy

134
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:31,839
Receive them at the Port of Baltimore transport them to Capitol Hill and then you had a

135
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:34,655
Build a bathing facilities suitable to a senator

136
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,191
An oak wood paneling

137
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:36,959
Plaster

138
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:40,543
Cornices Minton tile egg and dart molding

139
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,823
Of the Six Original tubs

140
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,359
Only two are left

141
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,639
And what has a piece of

142
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,431
Plywood over at that props up some

143
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,199
Padlock

144
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,479
Steel mystery box

145
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,271
It was decommissioned years ago

146
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:53,855
This place is a total Collision of Heroes

147
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:56,159
Not just old vs new and I know that

148
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,439
Just a little bit ago

149
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:00,767
We were considering the Capitol Building as just a building

150
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:05,887
It's impossible to look at this room and not see a metaphorical debate right here in the basement

151
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:11,007
We are having this great debate in our country whether you're in the Tea Party or the Occupy Movement

152
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:15,615
Both share the same concern about who the government is

153
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:16,639
4

154
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:17,919
And

155
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,735
But I think the politicians

156
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,783
Have tried really hard

157
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:26,111
To make it look as if the government is for the people and not

158
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,391
4

159
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,975
The gorgeously appointed bathers of the world

160
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:36,607
For example when Newt Gingrich took over the house speakership in 1995 after

161
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,679
You know a giant sweep of the 94 elections

162
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,495
They found that

163
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,287
There were

164
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,591
Buckets of ice

165
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:49,663
Still being delivered to every

166
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,687
Single

167
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:57,087
Member of Congress has office even though they all had refrigerators with ice makers it was back from the top

168
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:59,135
Time when you had to buy I separately in

169
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:02,463
Today should have shut down all that stuff at the same time

170
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:05,023
They got rid of the house historian

171
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,559
Lady funded

172
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,607
All of these things they thought of as

173
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,143
Luxuries

174
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,167
And

175
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,215
They got rid of a lot of

176
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:16,543
The funding for saving things like this

177
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:22,943
Is Andrea puts at the spending versus austerity question is really just the modern form of the quintessential

178
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,991
American question of government

179
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,015
Which is

180
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,319
How much government should exist

181
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,111
What is it there to do

182
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,391
And

183
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:34,975
At one point about a hundred and forty some-odd years ago

184
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,047
There was this idea of

185
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,071
The government

186
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,167
Being an important institution one that would have

187
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:46,751
Gorgeously appointed baths

188
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,799
And now

189
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,335
We're sitting in a

190
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,871
Boiler room and

191
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:56,479
Beautiful Minton tile has been painted over with industrial gray paint

192
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:57,759
And

193
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,527
The walls are

194
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,831
Our kind of dirty and it's loud and

195
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:01,599
And

196
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:04,415
There's no way to pay homage to it anymore it's

197
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,975
Talked in a corner and dirty

198
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:10,303
And there's a roach trap on the floor

199
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:15,423
Sparkles a little bit if it's

200
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:21,823
A little bit clean master

201
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:28,223
Are bluegill persuasion they would advocate for the installation of luxurious $3,000 marble bathtubs for senators

202
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:34,623
As lovely as a baby bathtubs.

203
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:41,023
Ornate marble bathtubs are already there

204
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:47,423
What represents the people know

205
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:53,823
It's likely not going to be restored know unless we had some

206
00:10:54,079 --> 00:11:00,223
Resurgence in respect for the government

207
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:06,623
Give it $500,000 to be crazy just to restore this area and maybe

208
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,463
A lot more than that actually come to think of how much you did

209
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,279
I don't know

210
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,191

Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

236
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:38,687
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

237
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:42,015
Now I need to clear my name

238
