I'm Roman Mars

27
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:41,376
Here at the San Francisco Main Library

28
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:46,752
And that is Dennis paoletti you walk into the library as a five-story atrium

29
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:49,312
He's an acoustic designer

30
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:53,152
And it also is very hard and reflect

31
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,176
All of the

32
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:56,992
Plaster concrete reflective material

33
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:59,296
Companies hire him to make their buildings

34
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,320
And boardrooms

35
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,600
In cathedrals

36
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,880
And public spaces

37
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:03,904
Sound better

38
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:10,304
When an early scheme had the architect had the main information desk bright in the

39
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,072
Little Havana

40
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:14,144
Floor plan in the center of that five-story atrium

41
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,704
The commotion that would go on

42
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:19,008
It would be disastrous for

43
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,336
People had to work there to try to hear

44
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,384
The visitors coming in asking for

45
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:25,664
Trying to communicate

46
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:31,808
One of the things we recommend was it just

47
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,856
Bad information desk

48
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:36,672
Of the atrium

49
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:37,952
Tuck it under

50
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:38,976
Some of the mezzanine

51
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,256
Pretty simple

52
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,280
Pretty minor but

53
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,584
To make this made such a big Improvement

54
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,608
I would like that

55
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:53,568
Set smart and Simple Choice to tuck the information desk over to the left side

56
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:56,384
So patrons and Librarians could actually hear each other

57
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,408
Created the

58
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,944
Wide open

59
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,480
Circular entryway

60
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,784
And no one really knows how to walk

61
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,344
Bumping into someone else

62
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,880
So this beautiful

63
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:10,464
140 million dollar building has an added feature

64
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:13,536
That certainly was not on the architect's plans

65
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,304
It's a hat

66
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:15,840
Jankity

67
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,888
Retractable movie theaters

68
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,936
Hairstyle Velvet Rope partition

69
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:20,960
Helps

70
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:22,496
Create the proper traffic

71
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,824
And right there are 15 feet apart from one another

72
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,104
A minor Triumph

73
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,640
And a minor failure

74
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:29,664
Of design

75
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,368
In the Epic of Gilgamesh

76
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,416
The god gets so infuriated

77
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,696
With annoying

78
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,976
Cast of their human Neighbors

79
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,280
If they send a flood to wipe us all out

80
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,840
And when you walk around the city

81
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,376
Pretty easy day

82
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,680
Side with the Gods in that scenario

83
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,704
What is noise

84
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:55,264
Noise very simply is unwanted

85
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,032
Sound

86
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,616
Did used to be called environmental noise

87
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,712
People are beginning to get interested in looking at

88
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,992
The city's environment

89
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,528
Has something unique to that

90
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,576
In San Francisco

91
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,648
The cable cars are always interesting point of

92
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:14,464
Discussion is that sound or is that noise

93
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,768
Well for tourism business examples

94
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:23,935
That sound that's good that's money but believe it or not we've been called into people who are annoyed

95
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:26,495
Goodbye the sound of those planking Bells

96
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:29,055
Or the cables that run under the street

97
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:32,639
The job of acoustic design is not just to make things quieter

98
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:35,967
Sometimes the best way to design a space to have less noise

99
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:39,039
If the add more sound a reading room in a library

100
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:39,807
Quiet quiet

101
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,343
It is so quiet

102
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,135
Anybody

103
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:47,231
Flipping a page in a book turns out to distract everybody else

104
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,023
The problem acoustically

105
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,815
The background noise level

106
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,119
It's literally too quiet

107
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:57,727
We often come into spaces like that and add background noise

108
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:02,847
And that's why small parks and cities usually have fountains and if they don't they need one

109
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,639
They may be visually pleasing

110
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,687
The sound might even matter more

111
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,223
Fountains give you this

112
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,783
Comfort level of acoustical privacy

113
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,575
Masking

114
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,623
Unwanted noise

115
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,415
What's your noise

116
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,951
China Merchants Bank

117
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,487
When I'm home in

118
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,279
That's my place to relax

119
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:24,351
The neighbors always start mowing the lawn

120
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,679
Thorax Anatomy the days to listen

121
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,727
Little people people are annoying

122
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:32,543
Listen to the city and let me know what's your favorite sound

123
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,567
And what's your noise

124
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,871
And how is it enhanced or drowned out by

125
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,663
The design of the city that you live in

126
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,711

Series from Bellow radio TV show the truth

Might cost you your life

138
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:16,575
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

139
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:20,671
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

140
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:25,279
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like a dad

141
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:29,631
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

142
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:33,983
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that kind of

143
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:41,407
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

144
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,735
Was found dead in my private gym

145
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:48,063
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

146
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,415
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

147
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:55,743
Now I need to clear my name

148
00:06:55,999 --> 00:07:01,119
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes
