What you're about to hear is the second part of a two-part series

32
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,928

Purple rest of you

36

Here's a recap

37
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,120
It was a beautiful image

38
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:41,888
Underwear

39
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,704
A new alternative for living in cities

40
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,336
But the people who give him love you give him space down below free the ground

41
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,664
After World War II

42
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,504
Modernist Architects offer people a new vision for urban planning

43
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,808
The so-called city of the future

44
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:06,464
Or people would live in high-rise apartment buildings and cars with drive on elevated road so that the ground could be

45
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,744
The open for recreation

46
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,048
Housing shopping and traffic

47
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:13,376
Would all be separated out into distinct zones

48
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:16,192
It would mean the end of congestion

49
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:18,496
It should be kind of smooth

50
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:22,848
Lies machine where you're very comfortable

51
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:28,992
These new modernist ideas for Urban Design were used to some degree in developments all over the world

52
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,272
But in Amsterdam

53
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:33,088
They took this modernist idea really

54
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:35,136
Far

55
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:41,536
HD apoptosis of modernist thinking it was the best

56
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,072
Two bills

57
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,608
The city of the future

58
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:48,960
But in the late sixties and early seventies as the first residents moved in

59
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:51,776
The belmermeer was not living up to its promises

60
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:58,176
The waiting list disappeared really fast the desperate people

61
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:01,504
You should have said stop building more

62
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,296
Units because they'll be

63
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:06,112
Standing empty

64
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,464
When it was completed in the mid-seventies

65
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:14,304
The belmermeer or the Belle Mer as locals, for short

66
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,424
Was a massive expanse of 31 concrete Towers arranged in a honeycomb pattern

67
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,472
13000 apartment

68
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,264
And many of them were unoccupied

69
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,544
Just sitting there

70
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:25,824
Totally empty

71
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,128
Senior producer Katie Mingle

72
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,408
We'll take this way from here

73
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,344
There are so many planes that fly over the belmermere

74
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:43,744
It's a route to the airport airport schiphol airport

75
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,144
Producer Chris buy a Mojito reported this story with me I'm only asking questions

76
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:53,216
Speaking in Dutch and waiting for planes to pass

77
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,240
Is he toxic

78
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:59,616
Ball out of the Belle Mer

79
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:03,456
If Chris was standing outside the Belle Mer in the 1970s

80
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,992
YouTube heard the same thing

81
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,016
A lot of planes

82
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:10,112
Many of them would have been coming from across the Atlantic

83
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:13,696
Termination on the northern coast of South America

84
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:20,351
Call Suriname

85
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,935
It was like a sport

86
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:30,079
That's Kelly Costner he lived in Amsterdam in the 1970s but he's originally from Suriname

87
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,039
I'm a Dutchman

88
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:42,367
But in my heart and in my soul I am super animes

89
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,439
Beautiful country with very special

90
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,207
People

91
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,999
Define metastasis tropic

92
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:54,399
That tropical climate is part of what attracted the Dutch to Suriname back in the sea

93
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,423
1600s

94
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,215
The Netherlands colonized

95
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,495
Is part of South America

96
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:01,567
As well as a handful of islands in the Caribbean

97
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:07,199
And for a couple hundred years in these places the Dutch used slave labor from Africa

98
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,991
To grow tropical crop

99
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,271
Like sugarcane

100
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:16,671
Slavery was abolished in the Dutch colonies in the 1860s and many years later in the 1950s

101
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:22,815
These Caribbean colonies including Suriname were incorporated into the kingdom of the Netherlands

102
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,143
All the people were given Dutch citizenship

103
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,703
And allowed to live in whatever part of

104
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,983
The kingdom they wanted

105
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,543
I'm so Gillie Costner and his family chose

106
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,335
To move across the Atlantic

107
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,383
I left when I was

108
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,663
6 years old

109
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,711
This was 1960

110
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,783
So Gilly was already living in Amsterdam

111
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:49,183
When in the 1970s suddenly a lot more people from Suriname started moving to the Netherlands

112
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,487
5000 people

113
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,351
Sometimes maybe I exaggerate a little bit

114
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,375
Unlock

115
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,679
3000 at least

116
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,447
Every month

117
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:06,591
A movement has started with in Suriname for independence from their former Colonial rulers

118
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,127
And people got

119
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:10,431
Scared that the upheaval would be bloody

120
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:13,247
And the people lose their ability to live in the Netherlands

121
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,367
They talk while we have to go now if you if you wait too long week we have to stay in Suriname

122
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:22,719
That's Dan Decker who wrote a book about the belmermeer you met him in the last

123
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:25,791
So it was The Exodus

124
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:32,447
Surinam eventually did become independent in 1975 and around this time it's estimated that

125
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:34,239
More than a quarter of the country

126
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,287
We're about a hundred thousand people

127
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,567
Move to the Netherlands

128
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,871
Before the government was ready to show cause

129
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,199
Housing problems in the Netherlands and

130
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,479
Dade

131
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,063
Didn't know where to place all those people

132
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:53,183
Of course there was one place with housing available in the 1970s

133
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,719
A brand new development

134
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,767
Thousands of Empty Apartment

135
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:58,815
The belmermere

136
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:06,495
Kelly Koster was already living in the belmermeer when the major migration from Suriname started in the night

137
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,263
1870s

138
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:10,591
And he says that the apartments were nice enough

139
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,127
Large modern

140
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:14,175
But the outside was not

141
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,199
Pretty

142
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,479
Big and ugly

143
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,503
It was like

144
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,831
They created a monster of Frankenstein

145
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:23,391
At that time there were several Housing Association

146
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:28,511
It managed the different buildings at the Belle Mer and even though they were having trouble filling up the apartment

147
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,815
With white middle-class Dutch people

148
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,607
Some of these associations

149
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,679
Quotas on the number of surinamese they take

150
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,447
Lieutenant

151
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,471
The housing

152
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:40,287
Corporation the Ballmer which set

153
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,615
Are we only want 10% of Syria time using our Flats

154
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,151
Gazelle

155
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,455
It would be K mighetto here

156
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,783
How is that legal

157
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,855
Panther Lake anti-discrimination laws or something

158
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,903
Are we talkin about the seventies

159
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,439
Different butts

160
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:02,815
The West wasn't any regulation in that way and that was racist and without a doubt

161
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:07,935
But there were already a few surinamese people living in the Belle Mer

162
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:10,495
Including Gilly and a guy named used

163
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,263
Madre

164
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:15,359
My Drake is no longer living but Gilly remembers him well

165
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,151
Math today

166
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,455
Dish guide

167
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,991
Statue of Liberty

168
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:26,879
Dewey says that magic saw all these people coming in from Suriname being squeezed into tiny flat

169
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:33,279
Downtown Amsterdam and he's supposed to live

170
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:36,095
He also saw that a building

171
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,631
Close to his house was

172
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,191
Almost empty or at least

173
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,495
30% or 40%

174
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:46,847
So magic organized the group to squat apartments in one of the building

175
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,383
Kelly was part of it

176
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,943
I was in the pussy to squat the houses

177
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,551
Break open the kitchen window

178
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:59,647
Sneak

179
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:02,207
Can you put a chair in it and from that moment

180
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:08,095
Process to get you out of the house

181
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:15,263
Ultimately a lot of the squatters were given legitimate leases

182
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,079
An overtime more and more surinamese Dutch

183
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,359
Move to the Belle Mer

184
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,639
Not just a squatter

185
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,919
What is regular tennis

186
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:28,319
I have never seen an idiot In Harm's Way so many black people were living in Coppell square kilometers

187
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,111
To be young

188
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,159
What's a really great

189
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:35,231
It's am really grateful for that. Because

190
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,511
You know we

191
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:39,071
Play all music

192
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:39,839
Loud

193
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:43,423
Because other synonyms people were used to

194
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,471
Heading music

195
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:49,055
Julie talks about his particular building at

196
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,847
Ballmer really fun Lee

197
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:53,663
Cuz there were a lot of artists and musicians there

198
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,199
The guy he knew used

199
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:58,015
Projecting movies from his balcony to the wall across

200
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:58,783
The courtyard

201
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:04,159
And people could sit in the summer on their balconies and watch Laurel and Hardy

202
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:08,511
The wildest Artemis were finding homes in the Belle Mer there were still some white.

203
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,535
People who live there

204
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:12,607
And they weren't all thrilled about the newcomers

205
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,399
They were that happy day

206
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,447
A lot of people from shooting Nam

207
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,287
Arrived there with their own style of listening

208
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,567
Making more noise

209
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:24,639
Oh my God that was like

210
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,919
Invasions

211
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,455
Of immigrants

212
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,759
From the West Indies from

213
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:30,783
Suriname

214
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:31,807
.

215
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,087
Invade it

216
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,367
The Belmont Manor

217
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:35,647
Because

218
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,207
That wear lots of

219
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,511
Empty Apartments

220
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:46,911
That's Peter Brown that architect you met in part one of the story who helped design the belmermeer and was

221
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,703
Living there in the 1970s

222
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,287
It's stigmatized the area overnight

223
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,663
An immigrant

224
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,431
Area

225
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:03,551
But the thing is the surname he's weren't technically immigrants

226
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:09,951
They were Dutch citizens would grown up speaking Dutch and learning the history of the Netherlands in school

227
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:14,815
Decapoda all the cities ever figure knew everything about the Meadowlands

228
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:18,655
And it's all said they would be welcome in the Netherlands

229
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,703
But when they arrived here

230
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,727
They didn't

231
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:26,335
Cell death welcome and Dede Alsace also saw that

232
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:29,919
What did the people in the Netherlands

233
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,967
Didn't know anything about tsunami

234
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:36,575
In any case when the surinamese started moving into the Belle Mer

235
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,623
Peter Brown saw them as

236
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,927
Well here I'll let him say

237
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,975
These poor people

238
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:47,583
We're coming out of the Jungle Day by not used to live in high-rise

239
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,375
Sophisticated

240
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:52,703
Flat buildings with central heating on

241
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:56,543
Miss refuse Chutes and they couldn't

242
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:57,823
They couldn't

243
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,919
Understand the sophistication of living in such a

244
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:06,015
Machinery of a building they threw that refuse over

245
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,063
Over the balcony

246
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,087
Advance

247
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,623
Like a ghetto

248
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,415
What about Mimi was never

249
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,695
But again

250
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:17,535
People called it the ghetto

251
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,095
Yes the rib problems adapting to the system

252
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,631
Yes we have to find out

253
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:25,215
You can go with 12 people in an elevator

254
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:31,615
Yes we've had to find out that you're out of the balcony

255
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,663
A serious and in phloem.

256
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,735
People living in some apartments 20

257
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,503
People

258
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:40,575
So what to do apartment 20 people

259
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:46,463
Julie doesn't really dispute that the surname he's Dutch had a different way of living than the white

260
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:53,119
But he points out and I think rightly that the belmermeer was failing before the surname he's showed

261
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,655
So here's a bunch of

262
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,959
White guys

263
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:14,111
And working with physically separated

264
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,927
Spandex jackets

265
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,463
This was the idea

266
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:26,655
The idea fell apart Gilly says when no one who could afford to live in the Ballmer actually wanted to live in the

267
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:29,727
I must be out of my mind

268
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:44,063
White Dutch people didn't want to live in the Ballmer and so it increasingly attracted the people who couldn't afford

269
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,599
Ford housing anywhere else

270
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,879
Or who are being Des

271
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:47,647
Discriminated

272
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,671
Elsewhere

273
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,719
Overtime thousands of Gabe's

274
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,487
People move there

275
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,511
An immigrant

276
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:55,583
Places like turkey Morocco and Ghana

277
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,631
Who came to the Netherlands for work

278
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,471
But the fact that the bomber had become undesirable

279
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:05,567
The people with the means to live elsewhere was really disappointing

280
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,103
Are the people who designed it

281
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:11,711
Who thought they were creating a better kind of City a utopian Paradise

282
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,991
People with lineup

283
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:13,759
To live in

284
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:17,087
In the late 1970s some of them are still working on

285
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:19,135
The project including the lead architect

286
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,415
Siegfried nothung

287
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:23,999
Here's dandekar again who wrote a biography of Ness

288
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,815
What's a big disappointment from a really big

289
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:31,679
Didn't want to give interviews about it's even with his best friends he didn't talk about the Belle Mer

290
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:35,519
And then one day in 1979 NASA just

291
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,287
Quit

292
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,335
Not just working on the Belle Mer

293
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:40,127
But quit being a narc

294
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,919
You walked out of the office

295
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:45,503
I didn't even say goodbye to everybody and never came back

296
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:49,343
The Visionary behind the belmermeer had given up on it

297
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:52,927
But there were still a lot of people living there

298
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:56,511
And their story was far from over

299
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:03,935
1980 the Metro train connecting the Palmer to the rest of Amsterdam finally came

300
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:08,543
Five years later than planned and a shopping Center opened up nearby

301
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:11,871
But still the Belmont didn't fill up

302
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:15,199
At the highest point vacancy in the 1980s

303
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:18,271
3200 Apartments were sitting empty

304
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,551
Or about 25 per

305
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,831
Percent of all units

306
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:25,695
Because of vacancies in a vulnerable population that couldn't always make rent

307
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:31,071
The Housing Association that controlled the buildings was broke and couldn't do routine maintenance

308
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,351
The place was

309
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,375
Falling apart

310
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,935
There was heroin

311
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:40,543
Real decline of the Belmonts start of the whizzer heroin that came to Amsterdam

312
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,079
In the 1980s

313
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:44,127
Heroin use was at a peak in it

314
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:50,271
Amsterdam and when the government decided it had enough of the heroin dealers and users in the city center

315
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,551
I push them out

316
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,575
And they found

317
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,855
Perfect place to go

318
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,391
20 minutes away

319
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,671
The belmermere

320
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,719
It was full of vacant apartments

321
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:02,559
Neglected common spaces and various other good places

322
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,327
Hide

323
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:06,655
Maybe fish

324
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,935
You can say your name

325
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:11,007
Sadis bio

326
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,543
That's because you're a survivor.

327
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:18,943
Talking with Chris out of the Belle Mer to hear a live there as a kid and she says there were a lot of heroin users who hung out on the

328
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,015
The top floors of her building where there were more vacancies

329
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:28,671
She was constantly afraid that the elevator would accidentally take her up there

330
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:31,487
And I stepped in the elevator I was always

331
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,511
Praying like

332
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,047
Please don't go up

333
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,583
Please don't go up

334
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:42,495
One day when Tahira was around 11 she was playing outside with her little three-year-old brother when she noticed that he was

335
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,311
Carrying around something strange that he

336
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,847
Picked up off the ground

337
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,383
A heroin needle

338
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,199
I mean I was small I didn't know it was

339
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,479
A drug needle

340
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,575
I went to a mother and I showed her

341
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,111
And she was like

342
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,135
Okay

343
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:02,719
This is the limit we're moving

344
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:06,559
The hero's family did eventually leave the Belle Mer

345
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:09,375
Lots of other families did the same thing

346
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:13,471
The turnover rate was high 40 to 50% in some buildings

347
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:18,847
Other numbers weren't great either in 1987 the burglary rate in the Belmont

348
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:23,711
Two and a half times that of Amsterdam and almost ten times the rest of the Netherlands

349
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,271
And over half of the bombers residence

350
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:28,831
That's where they can move crime in 1988

351
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:33,439
The belmermeer have been talked about during it

352
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:36,255
Conception as a city of the future

353
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:41,119
But by the 1990s it would come to be known as the quote drain of Dutch

354
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:41,887
Society

355
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:46,239
Over the years various small measures have been attempted to help the Belle Mer

356
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:49,311
Maintenance security cameras subsidizing runs

357
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,359
But nothing seemed to work

358
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:54,943
Finally the government decided they had to do something dress

359
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:58,527
Maybe it was time to demolish some of the building

360
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,343
But before they could start

361
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:06,975
Something horrible happened

362
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:13,375
On October 4th 1992

363
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:19,775
Left Amsterdam schiphol airport Bound for Israel and almost immediately lost two of its

364
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:26,175
They needed to return to the airport for an emergency landing

365
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:26,943
But

366
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,479
They never made it back

367
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:32,319
It's hard to make out but about 15 minutes into their flight

368
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:38,719
Pilot can be heard saying going down 1862 going down

369
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:43,839
From an altitude of about 4000 ft

370
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:49,727
Flight 186 to nose dive straight into an apartment building at the belmermere

371
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:57,663
So can you tell me something about the 4th

372
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,199
October 1990

373
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:01,759
Tobias 1992

374
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,063
Soviet together with friends

375
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:04,831
At home

376
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:08,159
When we fell in love

377
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,207
Loud names

378
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:15,839
That's Susie ampofo an immigrant from Ghana was in the building when the plane hit

379
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,119
She and her friends

380
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,679
Escaped but she never saw her apartment

381
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:20,959
So you lost

382
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,751
Nathaniel has everything

383
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,287
I lost everything

384
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:26,847
You lost everything

385
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,895
The only thing we get this our life

386
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,991
Many people didn't get their lives

387
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:39,391
It was a Sunday night at the Belle Mer and so a lot of people are home having dinner or smoking cigarettes on their balcony

388
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,183
It was an

389
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:41,951
Phil is

390
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:44,511
The deadliest plane crash in the country's history

391
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:50,143
The official record says that 43 people died including the three crew members on the plane

392
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,959
But the number may actually be much higher

393
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:54,239
A lot of undocumented

394
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:58,591
People were living in the building and it was hard for the government to get an accurate count

395
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:02,431
I'm so nobody knows exactly how how many people

396
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,247
I'm dead

397
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,391
So what did change

398
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:12,927
After

399
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:17,791
That's Chris talking with you

400
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:21,375
Urban sociologist who worked on the renewal of the belmermere

401
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:27,263
After the plane crash the city waited a couple of years to make any major changes to the Belle Mer

402
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:30,335
People were traumatized and needed time to recover

403
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:36,223
But eventually a massive renewal began which included tearing down many of the original high rise

404
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:36,991
Apartment building

405
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:38,527
It was decided

406
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,087
To tear down 1/4

407
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:45,183
And so they started taking down building

408
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,719
But not all at once

409
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:49,279
Buildings came down over about 15 years

410
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:54,143
One after another after another so that people could be relocated

411
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:59,519
And the buildings weren't dynamited like the infamous housing project pruitt-igoe in St Louis

412
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:06,431
They were taking apart Story by story to avoid the imagery and metaphor of a neighborhood being blown up and for sale

413
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,199
Bacon

414
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:10,015
Because they weren't just going to tear down the belmermere

415
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,807
They were going to redesign it

416
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:12,831
Make it better

417
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,623
And that's what they did

418
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:15,903
Are we going to see a street with

419
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,976
Small houses for

420
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,512
Here on the water side with

421
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,048
5 story high building

422
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:26,400
Eventually a lot of the high-rises were replaced with smaller building

423
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:28,448
Between 1 and 5 stories

424
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:35,104
Shops were relocated to be closer to the housing and the 31 parking garages were mostly torn

425
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,152
Down because no one was using them

426
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,200
For much besides drug dealing

427
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:44,576
Even though the original designers were sure the car would be the primary mode of

428
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,600
Transportation

429
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,624
For people of the

430
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,392
The future

431
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:49,184
City of the future

432
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:51,744
We all come in by our without cars

433
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,048
Instead of parking garages the redesign made

434
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,840
Places for bikes because

435
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:59,424
Let's be real the Dutch are ultimately way more into bikes

436
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,192
Bicycle song

437
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,472
Very important

438
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,520
Inn in Amsterdam

439
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:07,104
And you want to put your bicycle in a safe place inside

440
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,152
Some people do Drive

441
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:11,968
Cars of course but they tore down the elevated Road

442
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,272
Now people drive at ground level

443
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,808
The funny thing is we're now standing at

444
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:17,600
That's one of the original Flats

445
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:19,136
A car is moving

446
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:26,304
Impossible no cars in this kind of areas was strictly forbidden

447
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:29,120
We are looking for mixing finches instead of

448
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,656
Taking them apart

449
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:36,032
Mixing functions or mixed-use development is happening all over the world

450
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:41,408
We seem to have come a hundred and eighty degrees away from the modernist idea of separating

451
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:45,760
Now Urban Design is focused on creating neighborhoods

452
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:49,856
That have shopping and Recreation and housing all mixed in together

453
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,648
No car needed

454
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,440
And we realized something else

455
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,208
About cities

456
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,768
It's not a machine he's not a machine

457
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,560
That's city planners desk

458
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:04,448
Hey Ma you heard him in part one of the story and he says yeah people want their Apartments to be quiet

459
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:06,240
They want their cities to be safe

460
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:10,080
But they don't want the city to be a well-organized

461
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:13,664
Machine crowded cities congested cities

462
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,944
Mixed-use

463
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:17,760
A lot of improvisation

464
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:19,808
And a lot of stupid things

465
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,088
People love it

466
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:24,416
Yes people seem to love that they love the chaos

467
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,184
Fastidious

468
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,976
Yeah of course because

469
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,512
Life is chaos

470
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:29,536
You want a piece

471
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,096
Otherwise life is boring

472
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:34,400
Also

473
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:37,984
People realized they didn't want to live in humid concrete structures

474
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:41,312
Almost immediately after the belmermeer was finished

475
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:46,176
Another neighborhood in Amsterdam was also redesigned and rebuilt from the ground up

476
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,456
But not with concrete

477
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,248
But bricks

478
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,016
It's

479
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:50,784
What they want

480
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:53,856
And I remember it was very expensive

481
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:56,672
Building and bricks update water breaks

482
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,976
Give the people brick

483
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,512
Yeah give them breaks

484
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,608
Nice

485
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:06,912
And it's feels warm

486
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:12,288
But this this modernist

487
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,592
Kohl's kitchen architects

488
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,128
Aesthetics

489
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:19,456
It's not what people really

490
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:26,368
In this way the belmermeer and maybe a lot of modernism

491
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:28,160
Was architecture for Arctic

492
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:31,744
That was probably always part of the problem

493
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,280
Yeah Yeahs Aragon

494
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:36,096
Is very active

495
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:37,888
Impersonality

496
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,424
Didn't you better

497
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,704
Andy Woods

498
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,984
Take care of

499
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,568
And build them homes

500
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:48,128
And they would show them how to live

501
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:55,296
The redesign of the belmermeer area did not make this mistake

502
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:58,880
The community was heavily involved at various levels

503
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:02,464
And the physical environment was not the only thing that got attention

504
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:07,840
Programs were set up for job training and education and special housing was opened for

505
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:08,608
A heroin addict

506
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:12,960
Now the belmermeer is a nicer place to live

507
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:15,008
It's not perfect but

508
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,032
It's much better

509
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,104
My house welcome

510
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,896
Even to hear I moved back

511
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:24,224
His family left after her three-year-old brother was found playing with

512
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,248
The heroin needle

513
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,040
Living room

514
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,832
Open kitchen

515
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,368
This used to be close

516
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:33,696
Tahira actually lives in one of the original high-rise

517
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,720
Apartment buildings

518
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:41,376
The outside of her building was repaired and on the inside all of the apartments were gutted and sold completely

519
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,656
Empty and Bare Bones

520
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:45,216
For the buyer to remodel however they wanted

521
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:48,800
In Holland we say Bluetooth straight and Tran

522
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:50,336
Black sweater

523
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,152
Is in this apartment

524
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:56,224
Making it financially possible for

525
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,064
For people to become homeowners instead of renter's has also been up

526
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,600
Priority of the redesign

527
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:04,928
There's a growing black middle-class there now

528
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,720
The bummer is still one of the most

529
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:08,768
Inverse areas in the Netherlands

530
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:12,096
Over a hundred different nationalities are represented there

531
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:15,168
Including still a lot of surinamese.

532
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:18,240
We created the Belmont

533
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:19,264
It is

534
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,056
Today we created it

535
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,848
We were never the problem

536
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,688
And we made something from it

537
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:28,480
Julius Wright

538
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:31,552
The surinamese Dutch really are the people who stuck with

539
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,832
The Belle Mer all alone

540
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,624
After the white people left

541
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,416
And the lead architect asserted it

542
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:39,488
And the public declared it the drain of Dutch Society

543
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:42,304
The surinamese and later immigrants

544
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,840
From all over the world

545
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:44,864
Raised families

546
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,656
Open businesses

547
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:47,936
Immediate future

548
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:50,240
Ferocity that didn't have one

549
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:12,512
Coming up Kurt and I talked about one of the design strategies for making the Belle Mer a better place for everyone

550
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:13,792
Right after that

551
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,168
Between the beats

552
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:21,472
Bongs and chatter of our devices

553
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:25,056
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

554
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:30,688
If I'm in room listening to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexa

555
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:36,576
Talking to me and my wife is in another room and another hearing. Voice

556
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:38,368
Technology talk to us

557
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,672
It is a creation of Sonic trash

558
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:43,488
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

559
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:47,072
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

560
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:49,120
To make them more human

561
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,216
Turn the living room lights on

562
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:54,752
Okay

563
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,800
Dim the living room lights to 50

564
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:57,568
80%

565
00:27:58,848 --> 00:27:59,360
Okay

566
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:05,760
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

567
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:08,576
Makes for a much more natural experience

568
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,624
Turn the living room lights on

569
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:14,208
Dim the living room lights to 50

570
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:15,488
2%

571
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:22,144
Representing two special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

572
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,680
About how are sounds gay

573
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,216
Is impacting our health

574
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:27,520
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

575
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:30,592
Look for them Friday is May 17th and May 24th

576
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,360
Right here

577
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,640
NPR

578
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,992
We need to talk about something

579
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:39,552
Constipation abdominal pain and bloating

580
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:45,952
You tell yourself it's not that bad you take laxatives modify your diet and exercise routine but thinking about it all the time is free

581
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:51,584
Frustrating but doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again

Is Katie discuss the Dutch are tackling the redesign of the belmermeer in different ways

587
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:12,832
Import they're trying to figure out

588
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:13,856
How to go from

589
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:16,928
A one-size-fits-all approach to something more individualized

590
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:24,096
Sort of this ongoing Urban experiment and talk about that remodel the belmer building that terrorists

591
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:24,864
The Bayou

592
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,632
Featured in the piece

593
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:27,424
Recently moved back into

594
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:31,520
Right so that building that to be removed into there's actually talk of demolishing it

595
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:37,152
But a few years back Consortium of Architects and developers pitched a plan to revitalize it

596
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:37,920
But instead

597
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,736
They got approval and they went to work on the exterior and

598
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:41,504
Common areas

599
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,040
Started sandblasting The Conch

600
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:46,112
Facade and renovating the halls and elevators

601
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:50,464
And they also move the storage up from the ground level to make that first floor livable

602
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:54,304
But the actual private Living Spaces were gutted

603
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,584
And left unfinished

604
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:57,888
People moving in had to start from

605
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:00,448
And when you say unfinished him what are we talkin

606
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:02,496
No shower

607
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:04,032
No kitchen

608
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:06,080
Nowruz at all basically

609
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:07,872
Total blank slate

610
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,664
And lead of the project

611
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,432
Cool spot

612
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:12,736
Hughson being touched

613
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,528
That sounds like a rough

614
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:20,416
Situation to move into a special you're not a do-it-yourself inclined at what is the appeal of An Unfinished

615
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:22,976
It's partly about flexibility

616
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:26,816
And sustainability like there's less waste when people you know

617
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:29,376
Don't move

618
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:31,680
What a big driver is affordability

619
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:38,592
Developers often add premium materials and fixtures to justify higher prices and Baton turn prices

620
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:41,664
To some buyers out houses

621
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,200
People can make their own decisions

622
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:45,504
About how and when to finish their homes

623
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:48,320
Presidents who want something more luxurious can have that

624
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:50,368
But others can pick more Spartan Ops

625
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:56,768
Or just you know add incrementally as they have the budget to do it starting with the basics and working the right from there

626
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,048
So causes mange

627
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,840
How much more affordable are these

628
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,656
From what I read

629
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:04,704
Those bilmar units were put on the market

630
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,032
Around 1200 Euros per square meter which is

631
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,568
Cheap for the Netherlands

632
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,896
And really cheap compared to Amsterdam where places can cause

633
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:13,920
Multiple times.

634
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:16,224
In this kind of DIY housing

635
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:18,528
This is something that is actually a larger trend

636
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,160
Absolutely there's a British nonprofit for example called naked house

637
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:26,464
Which is also working on strip down home

638
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:32,608
They clean their houses will actually go for 30 to 40% less than other homes of similar sizes on the market

639
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:35,168
So yeah that's a pretty huge potential saving

640
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:38,752
And part of their design strategy is to build in some double Heights

641
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,568
The idea being that people can build them out over

642
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:42,336
Time

643
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:44,384
And traditional floor space

644
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,408
When they need room decor

645
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,712
So you move in and

646
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:48,992
Your bottom floor is

647
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:51,808
Yeah

648
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:58,464
Yeah you get this kind of mezzanine level so you got this nice I want space but if you really need that floor space you can add the floor joists easily and it

649
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,256
Turn all outfit it's that easy

650
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:04,864
Reminds me of the story we did into a

651
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:05,888
Half a house

652
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,424
That we did about a year ago

653
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:09,728
Yeah exactly element all

654
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:10,496
As used

655
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:12,032
A similar approach in Chile

656
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:14,080
Basically they frame and roof

657
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,872
The house on both sides

658
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:18,688
But they only enclose one side with exterior wall

659
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:24,576
The open half can then be built into overtime and even those faces that are initially enclosed

660
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:26,112
Are there bones

661
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,648
They're missing

662
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:31,488
Basically everything except for the kitchen sink on painted drywall

663
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:33,536
Unfinished floors no appliances

664
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:35,584
I think there's a real intellectual

665
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,120
Appeal to this kind of approach

666
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:40,192
But it's definitely raised some questions and empiricism

667
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:40,960
2

668
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:44,032
It has in some of those are very legitimate

669
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:46,336
One of the most common is that

670
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:48,640
To make the place livable in the first place

671
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:50,432
DIY home buyer will have

672
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,968
Refuse them their upfront savings

673
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,760
To purchase materials database

674
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:56,576
Ml generally be paying retail rate

675
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:59,136
Because they can't tap into the same economies ask

676
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:01,184
Fat Developers

677
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:04,000
Pause some people of course

678
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:06,816
Don't have the skills or the time to work on their own

679
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:13,984
But you don't for people with more time than money or would you experience building things these kinds of DIY

680
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,544
Why options can really make housing more accessible

681
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:18,848
They give people choices to

682
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:21,664
Build things out that they want

683
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,200
In their own time at their own

684
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,992
In this exact

685
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:26,016
Opposite approach

686
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:27,040
Set the modernist

687
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:28,576
Originally doing what

688
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:31,904
With the Belle Mer making everything the same in attempt to be

689
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:34,208
Their version of egalitarian

690
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:35,744
Yeah I mean

691
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,280
Turns out one size

692
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,560
Fits all approach

693
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:42,400
Doesn't actually fit everyone equally

694
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:47,776
Rap-up

695
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:48,800
Tie into this

696
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:51,360
Two part episode of the Belmar can you describe what you tok

697
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:57,504
Yeah so basically this set of Articles traces the career of Le corbusier that famous European architect

698
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,320
To co-founded the international Congress of Modern Art

699
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:05,952
And the first piece explores his early houses designed to be quote machines for living in

700
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:11,072
II that covers his utopian radiant city which is all about this sort of separation of Funk

701
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:12,096
And idea

702
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,632
And the last one tok

703
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:14,400
About

704
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:15,680
So this mixed-use

705
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:17,216
Units of habitation

706
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,032
Vertical micro cities that

707
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:22,592
Actually got built around Europe and For Better Or

708
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:23,616
Possibly worse

709
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:27,200
Le corbusier helped lay the conceptual groundwork for the bilmar

710
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:29,248
Understanding each other build projects

711
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:31,040
Can kind of show you how modernism

712
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:31,808
Simply. Indifferent

713
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:39,744
So if you enjoyed your trip to the Belle Mer and ones I've even deeper into modernism functionalism and Le corbusier
