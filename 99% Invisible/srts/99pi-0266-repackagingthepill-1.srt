I'm Roman Mars

30
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:33,184
In 1960 a new wonder drug hit the US market

31
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:36,256
And while a lot of new drugs promise dramatic results

32
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:40,864
This one would actually transform millions of lives and radically shift

33
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,888
American culture

34
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:44,192
It was called an oven

35
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,728
It was the first

Cindy answer to all the problems agency approves the first birth control pill and 19th

39
00:01:55,456 --> 00:02:00,320
It helped set in motion forces that will soon change the social mores of the world

40
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:06,208
In just two years 1.2 million American women were taking the birth control pill

41
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,000
That's reporter Leila Turner

42
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,536
Within 5 years

43
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:12,864
Is the poet become the most popular form of birth control in the country

44
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:15,424
It let women choose if

45
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,216
And when they wanted to have children

46
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,264
I give them more freedom

47
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,544
SuperSU careers

48
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,872
And it helps us learn the free love era of the late 1960

49
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:25,920
It was a big deal

50
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,224
And even if you never taken the pill

51
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,272
You can probably picture its Packaging

52
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:34,368
There's the round plastic package that opens like a shell and looks

53
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,160
Kind of like a makeup compact

54
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:39,232
There's also the more low-key rectangular pillow sheets

55
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:42,816
What do you spell arranged in for neat rows for every day of the month

56
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:48,704
It's hard to think of other prescription drug packages that are as widely recognizable as those of the birth control

57
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:52,288
But the pill didn't always have special package

58
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:57,408
The first birth control pill to hit the market came in a simple glass bottle of loose tablets

59
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:59,712
Like any other prescription drug

60
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:04,832
They come in big bottles or a year's supply smaller bottles for a month

61
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:05,600
Apply on hair

62
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,904
Is the pill went from nondescript bottles

63
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,440
What's to the iconic pill package

64
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:13,024
It came to represent larger Trends in American Medicine

65
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:16,352
Women were beginning to take more control of their own body

66
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,936
And their demands for a new standard of patient autonomy

67
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,472
Would go on to affect

68
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,520
Description packaging of all kind

69
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:28,128
It all started with a family in Illinois

70
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:31,456
In 1961 David and Doris Wagner

71
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:34,016
We're a middle-aged couple with four kids

72
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:36,064
They didn't want any more of them

73
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,880
And so they were thrilled to learn about the pill

74
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,416
Doris got a prescription

75
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:42,464
The pills came in a big bottle

76
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:45,280
Instructions said to begin the pill on the

77
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,072
5th day of her period

78
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,376
To take one pill every day

79
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,400
20 days

80
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,448
Followed by a 5-day break

81
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,472
For menstruation

82
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,336
Is Doris lost track of recycle or if she forgot whether or not she had taken a pill that day

83
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:01,152
She was instructed to pour all the pills out of the bottle

84
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,944
Count how many pills were left

85
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,504
Subtract that from the original number of pills

86
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,040
And consult the calendar

87
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:09,600
Not as super user-friendly design

88
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,880
And if she missed a pill

89
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,672
She risk getting pregnant again

90
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,208
David Wagner

91
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:17,280
Noticed that his wife Doris was often

92
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:22,399
Should have concerned about taking her pills and he was also concerned about whether or not she was

93
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,423
Taking her pills

94
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,471
The Wagner Simpsons passed away

95
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,263
But this is Carolyn Hiser

96
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:30,335
A women's health expert whose research the Wagners

97
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,639
And their role in the history of birth

98
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,407
Control package

99
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,735
So he thought I'd do something

100
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:37,503
About this

101
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:41,599
David Wagner was an engineer for a tool company in Illinois

102
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:44,159
And he was used to solve any mechanical problems

103
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:49,791
He figured he could create a packaging system that would make the pill taking process easier for his wife

104
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:52,351
First he tried something really simple

105
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,143
He took a piece of paper

106
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,471
And he wrote out the days of the week and put the pills

107
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:00,287
On the piece of paper along with the days of the week

108
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:03,615
Turn it make it into a bit of a calendar and that works pretty well

109
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,407
At least for a few weeks

110
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:08,223
Then I guess the story goes something

111
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,271
Fell on the dresser and the pills

112
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,575
Got scattered and fell on the floor

113
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:14,367
And that was that that made him think

114
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,671
Maybe I can make a package

115
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,719
Say you could

116
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:22,047
Throwing your purse throwing your bag take with you and

117
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,583
Keep everything in order

118
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,655
So what he came up with

119
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:31,263
Is today very familiar to anyone who's probably use the birth can

120
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,031
Control pill

121
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:36,127
Is a curator of the extensive birth control archive

122
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:38,175
Smithsonian Museum of America

123
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,199
Can history

124
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,479
And we actually have some of the

125
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,015
The prototypes over

126
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:42,783
Here

127
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,855
Widener's original prototype was made out of two discs

128
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:46,879
Clear plastic

129
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,951
In a snap Fastener that he borrowed from the child's toy

130
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,999
The bottom disc held 20 pills

131
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:57,631
Which could be rotated each day to expose

132
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:00,447
The correct pill along with the corresponding day of the week

133
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:05,055
Having this system that made pill taking more intuitive Health Dorset David

134
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,127
This is David

135
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:10,431
Wagner writing in

136
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,247
January 16th 1995

137
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:16,319
This is a letter Wagner sent the Smithsonian Museum

138
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,855
For their birth control archive

139
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,647
Both Doris and Ike

Listed wonders for our

142
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:25,791
Kinship

143
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,863
Wagner successfully received a patent

144
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,631
For his design

145
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:33,471
But he had trouble convincing Pharmaceutical

146
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,751
It's to get on board

147
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:38,335
He actually took it around to some of the big companies and most of them said

148
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:41,919
Sort of things like what we don't need that that's kind of gimmicky and everything

149
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:46,015
At the time drug companies were known for the boring sameness of their first

150
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:46,783
Action Packaging

151
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:50,879
Wagner was told that a special package just for birth control

152
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,671
Sounded kind of commercial

153
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,439
Flashy

154
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:56,511
A design was turned down by every company he approached

155
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,815
But then just a few months later

156
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,351
One of the companies he met with

157
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,143
Cold Ortho Pharmaceutical

158
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,935
Release their first broken

159
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:08,287
And these pills came in a circular plastic container

160
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,567
With a dial

161
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,847

164
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,175
It was called the dial

165
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,967
To David Wagner

166
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:16,991
The dial pad

167
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:17,759
Look very

168
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:18,527
Familiar

169
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,831
Maybe a little too familiar

170
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,135
Wagner and threaten a lawsuit

171
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,183
In December of 1964

172
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,743
He signed an agreement with ortho Pharmaceuticals

173
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:30,559
$10,000 in a promise not to sue

174
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:34,911
Another company called Cyril soon began pain Wagner royalties with rice

175
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,703
Similar pill container

176
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,007
Pretty soon all birth control manufacturer

177
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,335
We're coming out with a version of this circular design

178
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,639
Cheers Diane went again

179
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,687
Reading from the letter Wagner Road to

180
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,711
Smithsonian

181
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,783
He said some people have wondered how I made out financially

182
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:57,183
I spent about $30 on the six models I made in my basement and the rest of my cost for legal fees

183
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,231
Over the life of the patent

184
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:01,279
He says he netted about

185
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,303
100000

186
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,071
London royalty

187
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:08,191
Eventually David Wagner got tired of chasing royalty application

188
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,215
From Pharmaceutical

189
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:12,543
Coal companies and he sold the patent rights to Ortho Pharmaceutical

190
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,615
You returned to his quiet life in Illinois

191
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:16,895
What is design

192
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:17,919
Camping National

193
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,687
Sensation

194
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:25,087
As pharmaceutical companies began marketing these new birth control pills they faced a couple Lobster

195
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:28,927
Obstacles that the packaging design would help overcome

196
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:33,279
First of all the pill marked a big turning point in the pharmaceutical industry

197
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:37,119
Before birth control only sick people took pharmaceutical drugs

198
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:40,703
The birth control pill was one of the first prescriptions intended to be

199
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,495
My healthy America

200
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,775
And so

201
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:48,127
Pharmaceutical companies design the packaging to look and not like medicine

202
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:50,943
But instead like an ordinary everyday objects

203
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:56,831
The begin packaging the pills and circular plastic cases that looked a lot like makeup

204
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:00,415
They were decorated with bright colors and graph

205
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,207
I would say

206
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:06,815
Flowers and butterflies are probably the most common on them

207
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:10,143
I was kind of wonder about that why

208
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,495
They didn't get a little more edgy at Lisa time

209
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,847
Pharmaceutical companies also experimented with Packaging

210
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,151
Make daily pill taking normal

211
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:25,503
One pill company went so far as to bundle up

212
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,551
Toothbrush and a bar of soap with h

213
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,319
Description

214
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:31,647
You know what is brush your teeth wash your face take your pill

215
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,671
It's kind of

216
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:35,231
You know another part of a daily routine

217
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:40,863
The other challenge that pharmaceutical companies face as they rolled out this groundbreaking new medication

218
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,679
Was the conservative Outlook of some doctors

219
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,215
In the 1960

220
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:50,079
Doctors were overwhelmingly male and some were worried about the Revolutionary in

221
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:53,151
The birth control pill would have on sex and gender roles

222
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,711
The subject for this afternoon

223
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,247
Continuing discussion

224
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,271
Of the pill

225
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,807
Is the power

226
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:00,831
Prescribed

227
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:07,231
In 1967 a group of doctors gathered in San Francisco at a symposium called the pill and the

228
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:07,999
The Puritan

229
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,559
The Explorer the moral in

230
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,327
Applications

231
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,607
Stop the birth control pill

232
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,143
Dr Donald mink

233
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,959
A leader in Women's Health and Family Planning

234
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,751
Describing the challenges

235
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:19,775
The pen presented

236
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:20,799
Preposition

237
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:23,615
Who might be uncomfortable with changing attitudes

238
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,895
Towards premarital sex

239
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,711
How can you maintain his emotional

240
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:28,991
Neutrality

241
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:33,087
In the face of rapidly changing values among his younger patient

242
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,879
Who's code of conduct

243
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,159
Often will different mark

244
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:40,255
The ethical dilemmas posed by the demand in the oven

245
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:46,399
Contraceptive advice Among The Young and unmarried has generated a good deal of anxiety and

246
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,167
Discomfort

247
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:47,935
In the minds of

248
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:53,055
Not only were Physicians grappling with stuff that was actually none of their business

249
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:55,615
They also thought that some of their young female patients

250
00:10:56,127 --> 00:11:00,479
Might not even be responsible enough to manage their daily pill-taking regimen

251
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,015
Here's another doctor at the

252
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,063
Dr. Albert law

253
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:07,135
The girl who can't remember to take a pill every morning

254
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,463
This is this is one of the problems with the pill

255
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,231
We have to have

256
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,791
A patient who will understand how it is you

257
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,071
Correctly

258
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:22,239
Pharmaceutical companies needed to market the pill to skeptical doctors who might not be totally comfortable with the idea

259
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:25,055
Kia of women taking control of their reproductive health

260
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,335
Once again

261
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:28,895
I use the pills packaging to help them do that

262
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:33,759
Pharmaceutical companies produce dozens of ads that targeted Physicians

263
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,807
They marketed the new pill pack

264
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,111
As a way to help female patients

265
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,391
Take the pills correctly

266
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,439
Advertise the device as

267
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,999
The package that remembers for her

268
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,535
Or the Fool Proof

269
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:51,935
Each company insisted they are pill package design would help the female patients

270
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,471
Stay on schedule

271
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:57,055
Which was true the packaging did help women stay on schedule

272
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,335
What the marketing

273
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,359
Of these so-called

274
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,127
Compliance

275
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,687
Played into some doctor struggles

276
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:06,271
Birth control at a time when their cultural Authority was weakening

277
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,831
Here's medical historian Dominique Toby

278
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,367
Prior to the introduction of

279
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:14,463
Oral contraceptives the image of the physician-patient relationship is really

280
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,743
One in which

281
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,815
Patients with a male or female would really kind of just

282
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:23,167
Do what the physician said it was like this. Of medical paternalism

283
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:23,935
That

284
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,215
Physician Knows Best

285
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,007
With the introduction of the

286
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:27,775
Pill

287
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:34,431
The idea that a woman would go to the doctor's office and Demond of particular prescription that was

288
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,479
Something that was quite new

289
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:40,831
As the 60s progressed more and more women begin to

290
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:41,599
Taking the pill

291
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:45,695
The series of Supreme Court cases also helped establish that women

292
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,487
Unmarried and married

293
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:48,767
Heading legal right

294
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,303
Two contraceptive medication

295
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,607
The invention of the pill and Lisa

296
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,631
Subsequent legal victory

297
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,935
Were hailed as feminist mosto

298
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,727
But there was a darker

299
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:58,495
Car sign to the

300
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,287
In the store

301
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,359
Would be to one more major Revolution

302
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,639
Pharmaceutical package

303
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:09,247
Pill of the 1960s is not the same time we have today

304
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,039
The old Tale

305
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,831
7 times more s

306
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,367
And this

307
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:17,695
High dose of estrogen cause some negative side effects

308
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,999
Slight dizziness and nausea

309
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,815
As well as more serious problems like

310
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:23,839
Blood clots

311
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,375
High risk of cancer

312
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:29,215
Some of these problems have been apparent in early birth control trials

313
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:32,799
The trials have been conducted in the 1950s in Puerto Rico

314
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:35,871
The pill was primarily tested on low-income women

315
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:39,967
Many of them were not even aware they were participating in a medical term

316
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:43,039
Researchers mostly ignored their complaints

317
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:47,903
As the pill moved into the mainstream most women do not hear about this house

318
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,183
Are there doctors

319
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,231
I know it's hard to Fathom that the

320
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,767
Pill that Kim and pink paws

321
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:53,535
Compaq

322
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:57,631
The pill that millions of women carried around in their purses

323
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:59,423
The doz pills

324
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,447
Could be dangerous

325
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,751
Then in 1969

326
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:03,519
A book was

327
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:06,079
Barbara Seaman who is a journalist

328
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:09,919
At the time wrote the doctor's case against the pill which

329
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,711
Which documented

330
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:14,271
What she and others believe was really kind of

331
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:19,391
Play the greatest treatment by drug companies and positions on the FDA the failure to

332
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:23,743
Knowledge these serious risks around the pill as women learned about these risks

333
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,767
They got angry

334
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:27,839
Most didn't want the pill to be taken off the market

335
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:31,167
But they did want more transparency about the

336
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:31,935
Side effects

337
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,471
In 1970

338
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:38,847
Barbara Seaman's book inspired Congress to hold hearings to investigate the safety of the birth control

339
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,151
But no women

340
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,455
To testify at these hearing

341
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,503
It was a panel of men

342
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,271
Whiteman

343
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:53,183
And this not surprisingly was really al-amin to semen and other feminists

344
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:53,951
About time

345
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:54,975
And so

346
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:59,839
They protested that those hearings and demanded that their voice be heard about the pill

347
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:04,447
Each morning of the hearings a group of women from the activist group

348
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,263
DC women's Liberation convened up

349
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,031
Capital

350
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:10,591
With prepared questions and bail money

351
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:11,871
Tucked into their socks

352
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:16,479
Truman strategically place themselves in the middle of audience rows

353
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:19,039
And repeatedly interrupted the hearings

354
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,575
Demanding marching

355
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,343
Parents

356
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:27,743
Because they can justify why don't you get top priority

357
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:33,119
Was really remarkable show of activism and can

358
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,143
Showcasing

359
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:40,543
Capitalism of medicine at that time

360
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:45,407
Inconvenience

361
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,431
This way

362
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:53,087
You ladies with the

363
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:59,487
These hearings reveal that some doctors had long been aware of the negative side effects of the pill

364
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:03,071
And many had failed to adequately alert there female patient

365
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,399
The situation left many women feeling torn

366
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,959
They were grateful for the freedom and

367
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:09,727
Economy the pill

368
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:10,495
Forgive them

369
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:17,151
But they also felt betrayed by the doctors and pharmaceutical companies that had failed to warn them about the

370
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,175
The possible risks

371
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,223
