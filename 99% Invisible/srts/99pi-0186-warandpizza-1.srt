A few years ago anastacio Mark still Salcedo was making lunch for her kids

43
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,256
And

44
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:38,816
So like most moms I will Lotto

45
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:39,840
Lunches

46
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:40,608
And

47
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:42,144
When I do that I usually

48
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,424
They trying to find a balance

49
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,192
Between

50
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,848
Healthy and not so healthy not quite so healthy side she might pack some cheesy crackers

51
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:53,664
Depend on the healthy side she make her kids a sandwich

52
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:57,760
Or at least she thought the sandwiches that she was making more healthy

53
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:00,576
Until she look closely at the ingredients

54
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:01,600
I realize that I

55
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,368
Cold

56
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,928
The packaged deli meat out of my fridge

57
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:07,488
Brad came for my bread box

58
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,280
And I've been sitting there for awhile and it

59
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,584
Sit in the supermarket and then

60
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,352
I've been

61
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,376
Way back when

62
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,168
Anastasiia got to thinking

63
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,752
It is kind of a natural for food to last this long

64
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,056
Is this really a healthy lunch

65
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:24,384
Butts Tina Antolini hosts of The podcast gravy

66
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,664
Helping us tell the story

67
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,504
Anastacio looked at the package deli meat the store-bought sliced bread

68
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,528
Processed cheese

69
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,832
As it happens she's a journalist

70
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,624
She writes a lot about food

71
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,672
And so she started looking into it

72
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:40,256
I went through all of those ingredients that you just sent me including them

73
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,024
The EMES

74
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,560
Start and the mayonnaise

75
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:44,096
At least two of the items

76
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:46,656
The packaged deli meat and the supermarket bread

77
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,704
Docker research ultimately

78
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:49,728
To this

79
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,520
Skier US Army base

80

The Natick Soldier systems center

81
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:58,176
This is very strange what is the Army doing in

82
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,200
Considered

83
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:01,504
What the Army is doing in food is

84
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,040
Of course feeding the troops

85
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,832
And by strange extension

86
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,112
You and me

87
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:12,000
Military organization did actually been involved in food production ever since the earliest combat rations

88
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,304
The first combat rations

89
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,584
We're probably

90
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:16,864
Eaten by the Sumerians

91
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:20,192
Beijing carry with them into battle garlic

92
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,728
Kegs beer

93
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,752
Green onion

94
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,568
Back in the early days of organized Warfare

95
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,640
If you were marching into battle and didn't know when you get home again

96
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,688
You needed to bring something that would keep

97
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,968
All of these rocks

98
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,736
War base

99
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,040
Traditional

100
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:37,856
Methods of preserving food

101
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:38,880
Drawing

102
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,160
Saltine

103
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,208
Smoking at pek

104
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:45,536
But the real Innovation with coming up with a preserve protein

105
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:49,120
Ancient Egyptians went to war carrying dried fish with them

106
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,936
And in the 11th and 12th centuries

107
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:52,704
The Mongols

108
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,728
Preserve their meat

109
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,288
By storing it under their saddles

110
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:58,336
And the salt from the horse

111
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:02,944
Would enter the Meet the Press

112
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,992
Secret this preserve me

113
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,808
Salted by horse sweating

114
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,856
Impressed by your butt on the saddle

115
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:17,024
Mongolian method designed for some 2000 years military food rations pretty much stay the same

116
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,047
Flower

117
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:18,815
Beans

118
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,351
Hunk of salted meat

119
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,375
And some hard

120
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,679
I kind of twice baked biscuit

121
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:26,239
Or in the case of Napoleon's Army

122
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:30,079
Soldiers would just go plunder the countryside and eat whatever they found

123
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:34,175
Which became a problem when soldiers went MIA trying to get food

124
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,455
And there was a battle to fight

125
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:41,855
And so in 1795 the French government and the agriculture Department decided they needed a new way to

126
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,391
To preserve food for the troops

127
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,183
They announce the contest

128
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:48,767
12000 francs to anyone who could come up with a new method

129
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,327
A man named Nicolas appert responded

130
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,143
He was at the time these celebrity chef

131
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,935
He cooked for kings and queens

132
00:04:56,447 --> 00:05:00,543
And a pair of found a way to cook and preserve food using Glass and Metal containers

133
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,079
This is canon

134
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,615
And it revolutionized the war

135
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,015
This was the first time that the military had taken on a big problem in food technology and solved it

136
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:14,623
The military's would continue to innovate around food for Soldiers & Sailors

137
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:17,695
Fast forward World War in the United States

138
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:21,279
During World War II the country had

139
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,583
To ramp up for feeding

140
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,351
400

141
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:27,423
Thousand soldiers to ultimately

142
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,191
11

143
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,215
Sex

144
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:29,983
Million

145
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:35,103
American troops had packs of meat and cheese and crackers as well as canned goods of course

146
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:38,943
But these Russians didn't survive the rigors of War II well

147
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:44,831
They really haven't been sufficient to feed so many soldiers in so many different locations

148
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:47,391
In so many different climates and conditions

149
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:51,487
The military had been unprepared to feed their soldiers during World War II

150
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,279
The government said

151
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,839
We don't ever want to

152
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,447
Just horrible to have to ramp up

153
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,215
So let's

154
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,495
Maintainer cell

155
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:05,055
In a state of preparedness

156
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:09,151
And so preparedness became policy after World War II

157
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,687
The support that

158
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:14,015
They created a system of 700 Federal Laboratories

159
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:17,087
All devoted to developing military Technologies

160
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:23,743
And one of them is the Natick Soldier systems center outside of Boston

161
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:30,143
Pretty much like Suburbia with the exception of the

162
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:36,543
Intense electric fence except for that barbed wire fence

163
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,335
Shenzhen the guard posted at the gate

164
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:41,663
The Natick Soldier systems center looks like a normal office

165
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:46,015
But this Office Park is the epicenter of the modern military diet

166
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:48,575
Is the home of the combat feeding Direct

167
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,879
Which has been here since the 1950

168
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:56,511
First of all can I have you introduced yourself to me secretly I'm Steven Moody the director of combat feeding

169
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,047
I hear at the Natick Soldier

170
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,095
Development and engineering center

171
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:04,703
Steven showed me how military food technology has evolved over time

172
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,983
Ken's for instance

173
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:09,311
Since been replaced by flexible lined pouches

174
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:15,967
Because can they're bulky and heavy troops have been eating their meals out of those pouches

175
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:17,759
And what are called MREs

176
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,295
Meals ready to eat

177
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:23,903
The first MRE contain a lot of freeze-dried components

178
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:27,231
A freeze-dried meat Patty that you would have to add water to

179
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,023
And then heated and

180
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,583
Having having eaten a few of those in my time

181
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:37,983
As an active-duty soldier at you had to get it just right it was always either a little bit too soggy or a little bit crunchy at the end of

182
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:44,383
The combat feeding directorate has been tasked with overcoming certain challenges inherent in

183
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,151
In food

184
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:45,919
It's spoiled

185
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,199
It grows more

186
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,479
It loses flavor

187
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:55,135
And if you're trying to feed a vast number of people in climates ranging from the desert to the human jungle over long.

188
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:55,903
The time

189
00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:00,767
You have to figure out ways of making food that will avoid its natural tendency to go bad

190
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,047
So

191
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:05,631
The combat feeding directorate has whole teams of microbiologist

192
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:06,655
Engineers

193
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:09,983
Leather scientists working to extend the lives of food

194
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:13,311
Food engineering preservation and stabilization for instance wood

195
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:19,199
Be the ones that would would try to figure out how to make that product shelf-stable for

196
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,479
Two three

197
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:23,807
5 years five years without Refrigeration exact

198
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,367
And then there's the little detail of

199
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,135
Taste

200
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,695
Making the stuff actually palatable

201
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:34,815
The modern MRE has come a long way from that chewy freeze dried meat Patty

202
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:37,631
Today's high-tech pouches come with another pouch

203
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:42,239
Instead chemically heats the ration the US military now offers 24 different entrees

204
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:45,311
It's from cheese tortellini to lemon pepper tuna

205
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,335
2

206
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,615
Jambalaya

207
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,919
Jambalaya for instance

208
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:52,735
Trying to make sure that jambalaya Atwood would laugh

209
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:53,503
4

210
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:58,879
3 years at 80° in a pouch is a challenge so we we tweaked the spices

211
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:04,767
Tweak the ingredients so that we can make sure that the flavor is optimal at the end of the shelf life

212
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:05,791
As well as the beginning

213
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:10,911
So that Soldier on a mountain in Afghanistan can enjoy a flexible pouch

214
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,447
3 year old jambalaya

215
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,751
I mean that's the goal

216
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,335
But it's not always the reality when you open an MRE

217
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,407
That it was I just like this gelatinous BBQ Beef

218
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:26,527
Does pungent smell to it Louisiana native Ben Armstrong spent five years in the Marine Corps

219
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,855
Don't even get him started on the jambalaya MRE

220
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,415
For a Louisianan

221
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:33,695
I'll never try

222
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:38,303
Into the military isn't just working on MREs they're also trying to blow up foods that

223
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,839
Look and taste more like

224
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:41,887
You know what you

225
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,679
Eat it 3 a.m.

226
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:48,031
You're like really really hungry and your judgment is somewhat

227
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,823
Impaired

228
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,359
We actually took

229
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:56,991
Something like a Hot Pocket that you find in the freezer at the grocery store and made one that was shelf-stable

230
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,575
And we did that by controlling the water activity and the

231
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,855
The pH of the

232
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,391
Components within the product

233
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,463
So that they wouldn't allow bacteria to grow

234
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:09,791
They packaged it up with something called an oxygen scavenger

235
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:13,631
A little packet of iron filings that absorbs oxygen

236
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:17,215
Keeping it away from the bread from old wouldn't grow on the bread

237
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,775
And we designed hurdles to each

238
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,311
Step within the process

239
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,847
That might allow spoilage

240
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:27,455
To the point where we now have a sandwich that will last for 3 years at room temp

241
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:31,551
And this leads us to the Holy Grail of military food diet

242
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:34,367
An item that soldiers have been requesting

243
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,415
Since time immemorial

244
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:37,695
Pizza

245
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,743
Pizza that is shelf stable

246
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:40,767
For three years

247
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:45,631
This is a pilot plant even took me inside a massive industrial kitchen

248
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:48,447
Full of giant kettles mixers ovens

249
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,263
I see a worker and a lab coat and hairnet

250
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,311
Standing over an enormous pot

251
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,847
Stirring vigorously

252
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,711
In another corner of the pilot plan

253
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:02,271
A different worker is slicing up a pizza topping

254
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,295
Bad at first

255
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,087
I thought I misheard

256
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:08,159
Did you call this as Maroni

257
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,695
Asma Rani

258
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,463
Cosmo room

259
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:13,535
Is Moroni or osmotic pepperoni looks

260
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,095
Like a roll of toilet paper made of meat

261
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,911
Athena sheet of beef rolled up

262
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:21,983
The layer of plastic to prevent it from sticking to itself

263
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:25,055
It's preserved using osmotic dehydration

264
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:28,383
The technology basically involves running thin sheets of meat

265
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,663
Special water bath

266
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:32,223
It removes water from the meat itself

267
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:32,991
Preserving it

268
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:40,415
Oh I probably somebody just serve me that I would not have even questioned what it was

269
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:46,559
It tastes like pepperoni I would probably increase the amount of pepperoni flavor but those are some of the things that were working on

270
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:51,935
The Army is a mean to have shelf-stable pizza in combat zone by 2017

271
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,959
And maybe

272
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:53,983
Soon after that

273
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,519
In your local grocery store

274
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:58,335
This is another part of the combat feeding directorate

275
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:01,151
Ever since its Origins after World War II

276
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:07,039
When the military decided it needed to create a back-up plan to feed troops in the event of a sudden War

277
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:12,415
And so the US government made it a requirement for these labs to share their findings with the commercials

278
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,207
What we trying to do

279
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:18,303
When we come up with a new technology is make sure that it's not military specific

280
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:22,911
So that there are commercial applications for a 10 and that can only help us

281
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,447
With economies of scale

282
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:28,543
If something is military unique and it's only produced for the US Military

283
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,591
The cost of going to be a lot higher than ever

284
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,615
It's produced for

285
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,383
The commercial said

286
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,175
As well and it's not just caused

287
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:37,503
If there's ever a large demand for these combat rations

288
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,039
Like in a time of War

289
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:45,439
It's good for the military if there are companies out there that already have the technology to make these kinds of products

290
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:50,303
And of course if the private sector has these Technologies they'll use them

291
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,839
Oh no

292
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:55,167
This means there is evidence of the Army's insulin

293
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,959
All over the grocery aisle

294
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:01,567
For example your children can thank the armed services for their favorite food

295
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:08,991
Cheese powder in the mac and cheese and then you'd have it also in me TV snaps

296
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:13,855
Might be around

297
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:15,647
Starting with her children's lunch

298
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:18,207
Read a book called combat-ready kitchen

299
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,999
How do US military ships

300
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,023
The way you eat

301
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,559
So at this point

302
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:27,679
Chicken walk into a grocery store and point out all the foods that have the military's fingerprints on them

303
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:30,239
Which is exactly what she did with me

304
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:35,103
TV dinners turkey tetrazzini

305
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:42,271
Meatloaf and gravy and turkey pot pie the TV dinner the Frozen entree was developed by an army

306
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:44,063
Contractor to feed bummer troops

307
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,343
On overseas flights

308
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:49,951
This prompted the military to come up with what became the microwave

309
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,231
Yes

310
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,791
The microwave is a military innovation

311
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:56,607
The military also developed freeze-drying technology

312
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,399
So instant coffee teas

313
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:01,215
Soups the Army also Hit Upon a game changer

314
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,775
What they call intermediate moisture food

315
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:09,407
Foods that are moist and also bacteria resistant in energy bars

316
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:15,807
Calories sliced bread and packaged cookies one thing that cookie makers that is once they understood

317
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:21,183
Just started making this soft and chewy cookies in the olden days

318
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:24,255
As you go through the grocery store

319
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,791
Anastacio stops in

320
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,071
Squeezes packages

321
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,375
She gets excited about a package of

322
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:31,935
Thai Basil and sweet chilli stir fry sauce

323
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,727
OK Google

324
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,519
To feel the packaging

325
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,055
This is a retort pouch

326
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,359
Which was developed

327
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:45,759
By the Natick center of the same packaging from the MREs but now it's bruised

328
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,295
Easy applesauce and yogurt

329
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:53,183
Tuna and sauce packets a little bit hunting with you go grocery shopping

330
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:59,583
Military everywhere I started to feel like I was walking around looking at ghosts of

331
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,703
Russian time I think about it when I when I'm with my kids because they do seem to prefer this

332
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,799
It's not just anastassios kids

333
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:12,127
These food products are beloved and ubiquitous

334
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,407
Panchito's

335
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,943
Chewy granola bars

336
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:18,015
Military innovations have a tendency to get work

337
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,039
Ginger diet

338
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,319
And most people don't

339
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:24,415
Stop to question our packaged cookies you can remain soft for eternity

340
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:30,815
Okay I'm not going to worry about it

341
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:31,583
We go for that

342
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,119
Anastacio says

343
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:37,727
Unclear how or if these food preservation techniques are affecting our health

344
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:40,799
There a lot of ways that the military has changed the chemistry of differ

345
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,615
And not all of them have been studied

346
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:44,895
But

347
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:47,711
She's definitely hesitating before putting these types

348
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:49,759
Foods in her kids lunches

349
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:55,391
The average civilian doesn't need food to stay preserved for years at a time

350
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:58,463
But it's showing up on our shelves thanks to military

351
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,743
And we're buying it

352
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,535
This is what we're giving

353
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:06,911
Be shelf-stable and the mold resistant meticulously designed to stimulate the fresh

354
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:07,935
And the familiar

355
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:13,567
So if in a few years you happen to buy a shelf-stable pizza in your local supermarket

356
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,591
Be prepared

357
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,383
That pepperoni

358
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,663
Might actually be

359
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:18,943
