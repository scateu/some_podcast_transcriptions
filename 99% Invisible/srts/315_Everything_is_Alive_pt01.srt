NPR quiz show wait wait don't tell me or as the co-host of the now-defunct podcast how to do everything

22
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:46,240
Which I just loved is such a good show new podcast out right now launching this week and it's delightful

23
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:52,384
Delete weird well the show is called Everything Is Alive and it's an interview show

24
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,968
In which all the subjects are inanimate object

25
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,528
So I talk to things

26
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,880
So what made you want to do a show like this

27
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,672
Well a couple things like

28
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:06,464
One I think it's just like

29
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:10,816
We just sort of think this way like you know

30
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,352
I'd get up from a chair and

31
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,632
Think about

32
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:14,400
What a

33
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:17,216
Terrible job the chair had and liked

34
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:23,360
And like how the chair must feel about being sad on all the time and then I think

35
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,664
Producing for so long

36
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:27,456
You're always trying to get to like the

37
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,480
Primary source

38
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,248
You know

39
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,808
And my girls looking for experts

40
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:35,136
I thought it would be really fun if like

41
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:36,928
You know your

42
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,464
Putting the other piece about

43
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,048
Rainbows or whatever and like rather than talk to the

44
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,840
Physicist to understand rainbows

45
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,144
If you could actually talk to the rainbow

46
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,680
Tuff Stuff County idea

47
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:54,592
I know that was going to deny 10% invisible are fully capable of accepting that even the most mundane objects are

48
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:58,944
Infuse with great meaning and can say something about us as humans but

49
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:05,600
You may not be prepared for that object to actually talk so I asked me in for a primer on how to listen to everything is a lie

50
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:10,208
You know if I was talking to a candle say like a bedroom candle

51
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,000
Like it's not

52
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:15,584
Every candle it's not speaking for every candle

53
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,424
It is one candle that is sad on one night stand forever

54
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,192
And like

55
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:26,592
Been blown out by one person forever and has a relationship with that person they're kind of aware of their

56
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:30,176
Object communities like it knows more about candles than

57
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:30,944
We do

58
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:33,760
It also has like a very distinct

59
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,296
Lifetime of experiences

60
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:38,112
But the things that says are all

61
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:40,928
Actual I think I was surprised by that when I first heard

62
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,744
The episodes that I have the same flavor

63
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,512
Yeah

64
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,792
They know things

65
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:48,608
They know real things about their world

66
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,144
For the most part

67
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,192
They're the

68
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:57,824
Inanimate object version of the person at the party who like always has an anecdote for everything

69
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,640
They're very aware of history and

70
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,408
Stories of

71
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:02,688
What they are

72
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:06,784
So even though the situation is quite absurd on the face

73
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,856
When you hear a fact it's a true fact yeah

74
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,392
There's so much about

75
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,440
Personal life of the object

76
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:16,256
That you know you know isn't

77
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,536
Exactly real

78
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,351
When I'm telling a story about something real I don't

79
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,935
Yeah I don't tell you what like

80
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:24,959
And so

81
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:27,519
We're just letting the objects behave in the same way until

82
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:30,079
There's probably you know there's going to be some mystery and

83
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:32,127
Hopefully people will Google +

84
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,919
Figure out if things are real or not

85
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:36,223
This is everything is alive

Hosted by in Tagalog

87
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:41,855
Let's just start settling have you

88
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:46,463
Introduce yourself horse my name is Luis and I am a can of gotu Kola

89
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,999
That's a store brand

90
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,279
Go to go

91
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,047
2

92
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,095
Similar to

93
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,375
Coca-Cola similar

94
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:56,447
People call it a knock-off I've been called The Best of the worst

95
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:57,727
You know if

96
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:01,311
You want to get my honest opinion I believe in a blind taste test

97
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:06,431
Your average person wouldn't be able to tell the difference between me and a can of regular Coca-Cola but

98
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,991
Bottom shelf

99
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,599
We can describe the comfortably is bottom shelf I'm at peace with that literally on them

100
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,135
What's the time now

101
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,183
Well

102
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:22,303
There's a lot I want to talk to you about that dude need anything water anyting

103
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,583
Completely self-contained

104
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:29,727
I want to ask you about your time before you ended up in the fridge or in now

105
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:33,567
So you are you I take it were you were in a supermarket

106
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,335
Yep

107
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,895
And what where were you are going to Safeway

108
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,199
I was bought at a case

109
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:41,503
So there were 24 of us

110
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,575
We were all purchased together and actually

111
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,855
Our next

112
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:50,207
Residence was a bowling alley for a 12 year old's birthday party

113
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:55,583
I saw most of the rest of my case drunk at that party

114
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:56,863
I was not drunk

115
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:00,959
I was saved for later and brought home and put into refrigerator

116
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:04,287
And then forgotten about for a few months placed in the back of fridge

117
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,567
Sure

118
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,127
I froze in the fridge

119
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,271
I was in the very back and the temperature got very cold I didn't freeze all the way through but

120
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,319
I had a frozen couple of weeks

121
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,087
Pretty learn

122
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,903
You are slushy inside always like inside

123
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,695
And

124
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:26,815
I had a brief Adventure when they realize I was still in the fridge and they took me out for a road trip

125
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,351
I got to sit in the front

126
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,399
Seat cup holder you know

127
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,679
And I took a little

128
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:35,519
Fun road trip down to Florida and then back again

129
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:40,127
I never got around to drinking me on that trip then they put me back in the fridge and that's where I've been ever since

130
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:44,479
It sounds like you were almost chosen so many times

131
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:48,575
What does it feel like when your play at this birthday party

132
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:49,599
And

133
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,647
You're waiting for your moment

134
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,023
Rivers in the movie Jaws

135
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:57,791
Yeah

136
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:03,935
So you know the story that that Robert Shaw tells to Rob Roy Scheider and

137
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,215
The other guy

138
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:08,799
Anyway you know the story about the USS Indianapolis

139
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:11,103
Reason the water and the sharks are coming and

140
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:16,735
He's waiting to be picked off and he's waiting and having that long dark night and one by one is in his friends go

141
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,551
That's kind of what it was like for me

142
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:26,463
Irvine and on the one hand I was very angry at you and being sore being in this position to consume us

143
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:31,071
And then on the other hand I was also very angry how come you didn't want to consume me

144
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:32,607
Yeah

145
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:37,215
When you when you think about being consumed by human

146
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:40,031
Do you think about the human that you want to be in

147
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:46,431
If and when I'm finally consumed I hope I'm consumed by someone who enjoys

148
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:53,855
But I like to imagine that if you're drunk immediately that instead of be

149
00:07:54,111 --> 00:08:00,255
Being a painful process there's the sort of first moment of release the can is cracked open

150
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:06,655
All of this internal fizzing that I have going on finally

151
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:13,055
Somewhere to go just for them to round out

152
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:19,455
Your external can we have that last moment where you're feeling to purpose and beginning to

153
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:25,855
Blend in with his human being and you become part of their story

154
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:32,255
Truthfully here's how I expect to go assuming that I am

155
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:38,655
Consumed I'm expecting it's going to happen

156
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:45,055
Blow the night we're not waiting for it and someone's going to open the fridge and pull me out and that'll be that

157
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:52,223
It would be nice to be poured into a nice big pint glass you know

158
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:56,831
Frosty mug would be pretty good way to go happy Pleasant you know

159
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:04,255
I doubt that's going to happen though they don't Reserve Frosty mugs for gotu Kola so that's just another one of those Facts of Life

160
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,679
How did you see jaws

161
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:18,079
The human being who lives in my house was watching Jaws they took me out of the fridge and kept me on the table

162
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,639
I thought this is at this is my big moment

163
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:27,295
Kind of part of me there was the Robert Shaw scene when he's telling the story of the Indianapolis and I was thinking boy this is just too perfect

164
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,575
This would be amazing

165
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:34,975
He was reaching for me was going to go for me and then at the last minute you know another human being came into the house and

166
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:38,047
Scolded him on not drinking soft drinks by pulling back in the fridge

167
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,071
Wow

168
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,375
Yeah I would have been perfect huh

169
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,655
Damn

170
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:46,495
I should ask you there there's a lot of talk right now about

171
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:50,335
Beebe health effects of stop suffering people tend to think of

172
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,639
Of them is very unhealthy

173
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,663
Sugaring

174
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:56,223
Do you feel unhealthy

175
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,527
Do I feel unhealthy

176
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:06,463
It's hard to say because I think if you were feeling the way I feel

177
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,743
You would feel unhealthy

178
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,023
Red

179
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:11,071
But I feel like me

180
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,631
I can't say that that means I feel good

181
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:17,983
But but you go back to your question you know on healthy drinks or not like

182
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,775
The new thing by any means

183
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,567
Have you ever heard of RAV4

184
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,615
RAV4 RAV4

185
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:27,199
All right I was so back in the twenties there was an energy drink with radium

186
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,991
Cold r84 okay

187
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:32,319
It energy idea was it just radioactive material

188
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,343
In water

189
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:36,159
They claimed radiatore give you energy and cured a bunch of

190
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:36,927
Thanks

191
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,719
They also implied

192
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:41,279
That radius or increased male virility

193
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,839
Raiders are also killed him people

194
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,399
So you people just drink

195
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:49,471
Radioactive material dissolved in water

196
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,799
I'm just looking it up here

197
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,871
Actually there's an eBay ad

198
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:58,687
There's a bottle of RAV4

199
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:02,783
For sale come on now currently $659

200
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,575
Got to be kidding me

201
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,599
Excelsior

202
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:10,463
This certified radioactive water was advertised as a quote

203
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:15,839
Cure for the living dead and quote Perpetual sunshine

204
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:16,863
It goes on

205
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,399
One guy who used it

206
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,935
Eben Byers

207
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:26,335
Died from radiation poisoning and they had to bury him in a lead-lined coffin that's what you get when you drink

208
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:30,687
Active material so they made a beverage which not only killed a man

209
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:34,783
But his dead body would have it had they not taken precautions

210
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:41,439
I killed all life around him yes presumably his dead body is still radiating the poison said he drank from ready Thor

211
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:44,767
In fact that the ad goes on

212
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:51,423
They exhumed him for study in 1965, his remains were still quite radio

213
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,191
Active

214
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:56,799
It didn't mention that the developer of radiator was not an actual medical doctor

215
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,847
Yeah that sounds about right to me too

216
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,895
Also the bottles in very good condition

217
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,455
So there's your original Power drink for you

218
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,247
How you got to

219
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:08,319
Did to me more about human beings that it does about soft drinks

220
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,599
To be perfectly honest

221
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:13,439
Are our willingness eagerness to

222
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:17,023
Find something that your chronic search for potency

223
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,095
That's my valuation of humanity

224
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,143
Chronic search for potency

225
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,543
Hello

226
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,079
And calling for Jeff

227
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:31,615
Yep

228
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:34,943
Hey Jeff you're you're the man behind the

229
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:37,247
Bygone times vintage right

230
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,551
Haha yeah I'm guilty

231
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,343
I noticed

232
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,879
One of your eBay listings

233
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,951
So you put up the RAV4

234
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:47,999
Tradutor

235
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,279
Yeah

236
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,583
Yeah is that is that for real

237
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,607
Oh yeah

238
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:55,935
What happened was I was at a flea market and I found

239
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:59,007
Ascent of about 20-25 of these

240
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,543
Okay

241
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,823
It was like a

242
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,383
Shipping crate or something

243
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,943
And

244
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,223
So yeah I have sold

245
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,247
A few of those

246
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,527
The end of the

247
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:13,343
Is it a reproduction or is it an original bottle

248
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,903
These are original

249
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:17,695
Original

250
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:20,255
Did you check them with a geiger counter

251
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:24,607
I have not I don't know

252
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:28,447
I just assumed they wouldn't have any there's no contest

253
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,215
Tilapia

254
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,775
But I haven't no I didn't

255
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,823
Geiger counter

256
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,895
I suspected something from the 90

257
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,175
2018

258
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,479
Done gone

259
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,831
Maybe it wouldn't be gone

260
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,903
I don't know maybe they would I don't know

261
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,303
Capital Mall

262
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,839
Under a blacklight or something

263
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,631
Hope

264
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,399
Still

265
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,423
Actor that would

266
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,239
That raises the

267
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,799
Interesting questions

268
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:10,687
Did you know much about rathore when you

269
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:13,759
You know when you know now you know I got on

270
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:19,135
Fortunately now we have the internet Google is quite helpful it's really an interesting

271
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:22,975
Story I don't know if you've taken the time to to look into it but

272
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,255
Bats mating

273
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,815
Yeah I just I just heard about it it's

274
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,095
Crazy that we

275
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,631
We human now

276
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:32,447
I like the story about the guy who

277
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,799
Died from it and then they dug him up in the 60s in his leg

278
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,079
Lion coffee

279
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,871
You are still Radioactive

280
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:46,527
That's why I wear I feel like you should maybe get checked out your head think I will yeah I think I will

281
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,551
Really

282
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,855
Glass with holding his assets

283
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,743
Yeah radiation you don't want to mess around with I guess when it comes down to

284
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,279
Now I hear you

285
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:05,215
Hey I have to I'm driving and I don't want them getting on so busy at road now so I need to unfortunately hang up on you

286
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,751
Got it yeah be safe

287
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,287
Okay bye

288
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:13,919
Lewis one quick thing I want to ask you about I have in my life

289
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,199
Occasionally

290
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,223
Dropped a can of

291
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,759
Soda know you

292
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:21,599
I said I'm having you all it's awful experiences

293
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,391
Philip I mean obviously very shaken

294
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,439
There's a rush

295
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:31,839
I guess I'm a human being terms to be like a rush of adrenaline and for a while you're feeling just very

296
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,631
Reverse

297
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,423
Hyper after the shakeup

298
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:40,799
And then you start this recovery Saddleback to a neutral state but you have this awful kind of nauseous

299
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:43,359
City sleepy feeling after the fact

300
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,895
And you feel kind of

301
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:51,295
Dumb you know the shake up kind of like rattles you a little bit and takes a little bit of time for your intelligence to come to come back to you with an offer

302
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,063
Experience

303
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:55,903
Imagine two like we often after that happens

304
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,439
We will tap on

305
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,719
What would be your head

306
00:15:59,231 --> 00:15:59,743
Don't

307
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,791
Doesn't do anything

308
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:08,447
There's no reason to do it it doesn't do anything to the carbonation all it does is Annoy Us in a very sensitive moment

309
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,751
Don't do that

310
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:17,151
You're listening to everything is alive on 99percentinvisible

311
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,687
This might be

312
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:25,087
Awkward to talk about but I feel like there's a hierarchy to sodas at least in terms of how humans think about them sure at the

313
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:27,391
Doctors you know Coke and Pepsi

314
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:30,719
And then there's 7Up and Sprite and then there's

315
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:33,535
Destino like your son casting

316
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,303
Great

317
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:37,119
Soda Fanta that are kind of at the

318
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:41,727
Bottom I wonder if that does that hierarchy does it mean the same thing to you

319
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,775
But let me tell you something I Fanta

320
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:48,127
I mean sure here in the US it's not the most sophisticated soft drink but overseas

321
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,151
Its huge

322
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,687
Vitapan euge

323
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,967
Fanta Fanta

324
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,247
In Thailand

325
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:57,855
It's all over the place if you walk down the street there you'll see half open bottles of fanta everywhere

326
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:00,927
Strawberry Fanta in particular everywhere just hanging out

327
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,719
Just like sitting on this

328
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:05,023
The street yeah just on the street because

329
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:08,351
Youmans there you Strawberry Fanta as an offering

330
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,143
Two ghosts

331
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:13,727
So they leave it out on the street because

332
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:18,335
They're giving it to go yes friendly ghosts according to local custom

333
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:20,383
Love sweet red soda

334
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:24,479
So if you leave it out it attracts them and they hang out around your house and protect you from

335
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:26,783
I guess whatever unfriendly ghost might come around

336
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,087
Who I guess don't love sweet red soda

337
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:29,855
Right

338
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:35,487
Do you know what it is about Strawberry Fanta in particular because of the color

339
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:42,143
So there's a theory that it's because I can't do blood offerings anymore until Strawberry Fanta which is another you know red

340
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:48,543
Viscous liquid will be the next best thing Strawberry Fanta among the sodas available to us looks the most like blood

341
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,847
Yeah which I personally don't see

342
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,407
Okay but you know I tok Thailand thing

343
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:56,223
We humans we think a lot about

344
00:17:56,991 --> 00:18:03,135
Spirits or at least you know what might happen to us after we die do you as a cold

345
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,671
Do you think about that

346
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,207
The afterlife

347
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,743
Yeah oh yeah

348
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10,047
I do not think that all the time yeah

349
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:16,447
Reaching that age myself are probably not to be around that much longer

350
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:19,007
You are a mean you are recyclable

351
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,799
Which opens up a whole other

352
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,079
Conversation

353
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,895
You know my my body McCann

354
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:28,223
Will almost certainly be repurposed

355
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:35,135
That leads me to you know ask questions of like well have I already been repurposed I don't know you could have been any number

356
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:41,535
Sodas or or anything else and airplane I could have been I actually when I was younger I used to have a return

357
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,559
Recurring nightmare

358
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:46,399
That I was there was a plane crashing

359
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,935
There's no trying to be

360
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:52,031
And in that it was nighttime and it was raining and there's a plane crashing on the beach

361
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:59,199
And I used to like to think that in a previous existence I was part of an airplane and this was some sort of

362
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:03,039
Memory that had traveled with me maybe as part of like a

363
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:06,367
Ventilation system on Board of Ed 747 or something

364
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:11,487
You referred to your your can is your body or your body is your candy

365
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,511
Is there

366
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:18,655
Equivalency between you know what humans talk about Body and Soul his is

367
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:20,959
That I'm sorry

368
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:26,079
I'm only saying because I wish I had the answer to this question is there an equivalence yes

369
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:31,967
Yes the body mind problem that youman beings have been dealing with since the days of Descartes

370
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:37,087
Something all too familiar to us cans of soda am I

371
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,623
Toucan

372
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:44,255
A my soda what does it mean to be soda and my part of the larger

373
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:50,399
Potion of soda out there am I just the individuated so damn isoda interacting with a can in like

374
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,167
Cancer

375
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:56,287
Being slowly eaten Away by the soda inside me I thought about this alot

376
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,055
Yeah

377
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:01,407
I don't have an answer but it's something to wrestle with all the time what am I fundamentally

378
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:05,759
What's the sodas gone like an remains but bye-bye me

379
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:06,527
I think

380
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:12,159
Who knows who knows these are the mysteries of permeate every level of existence

381
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,439
As far as I know

382
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:19,583
I have to say I think I think about the type of can you are with the pull tab

383
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:25,983
And then I think about other cans in the kitchen you know like a soup can I know if you know any soup can

384
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:29,055
And it occurs to me you are

385
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,591
So lucky

386
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:32,127
Because

387
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:35,455
You think about the way a soup can gets open

388
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,223
That

389
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,271
That I can opener to me

390
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,063
Seems like a torture device

391
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:46,975
It is let me tell you something else to I thank God everyday of my life that I was not born in a can of minute

392
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:47,743
Macaroni soup

393
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:50,559
I at least

394
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:53,119
I have lived a life I know where I've been

395
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:59,519
You know I'm not all of my dreams may have necessarily come true I may have taken a couple of bad turns here and there

396
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:02,591
But at least at the end of the day I've been witness to my own life

397
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:05,407
These poor bastards are stuck in the Soup cans

398
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:07,199
We talked about hermetically sealed

399
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:11,551
They lose all sense of time and perspective when you open a can of soup

400
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:12,831
When they wake up

401
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:18,720
I have no idea how much time has passed there like astronauts coming out of cryogenic freeze

402
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:25,120
They're all spaced out in the completely disoriented they don't know what's going on and their wake-up call is being

403
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:26,400
Torn open

404
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:30,240
Buy these damn can opener is what a nightmare of an existence

405
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:34,848
The Flash is literally busted open only to wake up into a world that they don't know anything about

406
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:42,528
All the rest of us stay away from the cans of soup and I'll be honest with you I feel awful about it but whenever I try to talk to a can of soup

407
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,576
They are weird

408
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:51,488
You mentioned that you're you're feeling like you're nearing the end of your life hell yeah

409
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:54,560
What do you feel older

410
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:59,168
And how very much I know for a fact I'm old I can look at my aspiration to it

411
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:01,984
Okay and it can I ask

412
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:05,824
How close you are T minus 2 weeks to go my friend

413
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:07,872
Wow

414
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:09,664
So what

415
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,480
But you could keep going on after that that's just

416
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:14,016
I thought it's not recommended

417
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:14,784
But I could

418
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:19,904
Desert C I mean I think about this with you because

419
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,952
And I'm sorry if I have

420
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:28,096
This isn't the right way to put it but it seems like your purpose is to be consumed by a human

421
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:33,472
And so you know we all want to serve our purpose we all want to be useful

422
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:39,872
And yet for you the moment of your youth is the moment where you are no more and I wonder

423
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,176
That's something you anticipate

424
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:44,480
With optimism or if it feels like

425
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:48,576
You know approaching me and it's a paradox isn't it is

426
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:52,928
On the one hand

427
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:54,720
I do surgery

428
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:57,536
Dread the idea of being consumed

429
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:01,888
All beings Endeavor to persist in their own being

430
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:04,192
Spinoza said that

431
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:07,520
I heard about that from a a cup of coffee

432
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,824
On the other hand

433
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:13,152
I guess on some level I still hope that

434
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:21,344
That I will kind of official Myself by being consumed do you know I think that dream is still is still very much alive

435
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:24,672
Know if I'm being perfectly honest with you

436
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:25,696
You know I do

437
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:28,512
I do sometimes fear that that moment has passed

438
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:33,120
I feel weird saying this but

439
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:36,448
I could drink you

440
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:39,776
Right now

441
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,312
Yeah

442
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:43,104
I mean I want

443
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,968
I want you I am thirsty but I also I want this to be a good moment for you

444
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,064
I want you to be read I don't want you to do it if you're not ready

445
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,392
Well

446
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,464
I'll make a deal with you

447
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:02,048
I've always said I wanted to go with my eyes wide open

448
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:08,960
I'm prepared to ended here if you promise me that even if you're disgusted by I taste you will finish the can

449
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:11,520
I will make you that promise

450
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:15,104
Is there anything you want to say

451
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,128
2

452
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:18,432
The humans you've encountered the Kansas

453
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:19,968
Encounter the

454
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,248
Countertops

455
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,528
You've known

456
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,064
I think

457
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,416
I think overall I would say life is a gift and a blessing

458
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:33,280
And I don't believe anything is but everything simply transforms into the next thing

459
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:37,120
I would say

460
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:40,448
If I can be a little bit soft hard and sentimental for a moment or two

461
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:45,568
It's a gift to get to be anything at all

462
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:55,040
Well maybe what we'll do in that just in the interest of Journalism is all

463
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:57,344
Drink about half

464
00:24:57,856 --> 00:25:01,952
Animal check in again do you want to talk while I'm drinking you I don't

465
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:02,976
No

466
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,000
Okay

467
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:06,560
No I want to have the full experience

468
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:09,120
Okay I'll check in with you at the halfway mark

469
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,680
Alright so

00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,984

471
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,264
I'm picking you up

472
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,384
Give me one second

473
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,392

Thank you

You're very gentle

484
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:10,048
This is

485
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,864
Trippy feeling I'm not going to lie

486
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,656
Alright my first report

487
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:20,544
Feeling very spacious inside right now if you got back I got room to be

488
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:24,384
But I'm also

489
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,688
I'm feeling the warmth of the tummy

490
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:33,344
Very strange thing I'm in two places at once spaces in my own body was feeling warm and securing your own tummy

491
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,232
All the sudden I find myself

492
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:41,536
Thinking about my body

493
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:45,632
I'm thinking about my body and I'm hoping that my body is a good place for you

494
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:46,912
I think so

495
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:52,800
I don't mind telling you my first impression of the inside of your own tummy you seem to be taking pretty good care of yourself

496
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,080
Yeah

497
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:08,160

Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices

510
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:23,424
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man made sound

511
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:24,448
If

512
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:30,848

Okay

523
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:04,384
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound make

524
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:06,944
For a much more natural experience

525
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,992
Turn the living room lights on

526
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,088

00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:39,712
We need to talk about something constipation abdominal pain and bloating you tell yourself it's not that bad

532
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:46,112
Take laxatives modify your diet and exercise routine but thinking about it all the time is frustrating but doesn't have to Define you

533
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:52,512
Constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again and you don't know why and it may be time

534
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:58,912

Oh my God. Info podcast oh my God

536
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,288
Flask podcast

537
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:07,872
What attracted you to tell the story of

538
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,920
Louis the

539
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:14,016
Generic Cola as the first episode of everything is alive

540
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:18,368
I think I imagined that a can of generic Cola wood

541
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:20,160
Maybe have a chip on his shoulder

542
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:25,280
It's always been compared to like the big guy you know

543
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:27,328
It's even been made to try and

544
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:29,120
Trick people into thinking it's Goku

545
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:30,400
Coca-Cola

546
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,960
You know it has its own identity

547
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:33,728
Maybe that

548
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:35,264
Makes it bitter

549
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,592
I mean that in the emotional sense not a new flavor sense

550
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:45,760
But because there's a relationship between generic things and non generic things that it would like

551
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:48,832
It would already have some personality that made sense

552
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:53,184
The conversations are like they're real interviews like we don't scrap them

553
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,976
We just like ask a person

554
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:56,512
2

555
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:58,048
Do a little research

556
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:59,584
Or like we give them research

557
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:04,192
And then I interview that I don't know and so like things where at

558
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:10,080
You know where there's a little bit of character already to the thing I think it's more fun and it's easier for the actor

559
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,360
The Voice app

560
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:13,152

564

567
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,048
Yeah he's real he's okay I'll tell you that

568
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,448
Cuz he's a he's a very good character

569
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,984
Yeah that's amazing

570
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,800
Annie's fine though

571
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:46,432
I said I started to do a little research about like if glass would actually

572
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:47,712
Old radiation

573
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:53,088
And I actually don't know the answer to that but but I can pay for his cases

574
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:56,160
Can you tell people what to expect

575
00:31:56,416 --> 00:32:02,560
In this season of Everything Is Alive we have a number of things were talking to or talking to a

576
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,096
Lamppost named Maeve

577
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:06,144
There's a bar of soap named Tara

578
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:09,472
Right now I'm working on an interview with Jake

579
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:10,240
Who is

580
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,264
A mailbox

581
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:14,080
A mousetrap

582
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:14,848
Who

583
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:17,408
Actually

584
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:19,200
She has to use a pseudonym

585
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:24,576
She's having

586
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:26,368
The Mousetrap is having a lot of

587
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:28,160
Second thoughts about what

588
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:29,440
She's asked to do

589
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:31,744
She doesn't she does not want to kill mice

590
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:35,584
She has a lot of other ideas about what

591
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:36,608
She could

592
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:37,888
Do instead

593
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,936
Given the form she was given

594
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:43,008
None of which

595
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,288
Are as good as

596
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:48,640
Mousetrap mousetrap

597
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:53,504
They're all really going to be different and we really

598
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:56,320
I want them all to be different things

599
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:59,904
They're going to be deep thinking objects and they're going to be

600
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,440
Superficial objects

601
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:03,744
And I think they're going to be unlikable object

602
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,072
They're certainly objects you don't like me

603
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:07,840
Very much

604
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:11,936
And

605
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,472
So

606
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:17,312
Yeah I mean I think our goal is is just that it be a

607
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:19,872
Diverse community of

608
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:20,640
Thanks

609
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:21,920
And I'm so

610
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:24,224
Do they not like you on principle or

611
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:29,344
Through the action of you interviewing them it's through me interviewing them

612
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,160
It's funny though like

613
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:38,048
I realize cuz I really I feel the same interviewing a thing as I do interviewing a person

614
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:44,704
I really do and sometimes it will be after the interview

615
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,752
Realize there was something I was afraid to ask

616
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:53,152
What was wrong with me

617
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:54,432
Like why

618
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:57,504
Why was I afraid of offending that.

619
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,272
I'll

620
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:06,976
