This is 99% invisible

32

I'm Roman Mars

33
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:41,888
We went to the Portland airport recently when I got off the plane

34
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:42,912
Picture of my feet

35
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,960
In keeping with the local custom

36
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:45,984
A foot selfie

37
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:52,640
That's producer Julissa Bhatia host of the podcast render formerly known as destination DIY

38
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,176
She lives in Portland

39
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:57,504
And I almost always take a foot selfie when I'm at PDX

40
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,528
Portland Airport

41
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,600
I think I do it most often when I come home like

42
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,648
Here I am I'm back in Portland

43
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,768
The feet are actually not the most important thing about a portland-airport foot selfie

44
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,864
It's actually what's under your feet

45
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,424
The famous PDX airport carpet

46
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,288
It's allowed decidedly 80s teal color with a repeating geometric pattern

47
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,664
Like any carpet you might see in an airport or hotel lobby or an office building it

48
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,480
Probably not what you choose for your living room

49
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:35,392
The design I'm told is based on the way the runways and lights look from the air traffic control tower and also on

50
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:41,792
On the radar screen that the air traffic controller sees with that sweeping line going around and around and the dots

51
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:45,120
Are the little blips representing airplane

52
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:51,520
It's hard to say if it's the pattern people are responding to what the bright teal background color but one thing

53
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:57,920
Is for sure the carpet is very very beloved there even sign the airport

54
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:00,736
Right now it's saying your feet with the hashtag

55
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,016
PDX carpet

56
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,552
And it goes deeper than that

57
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:04,832
Meet Emma

58
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,368
She actually has

59
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:08,672
A PDX carpet inspired tattoo

60
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,976
It hurt a lot

61
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:17,376
21 year old Portland native which means a lot of the carpet in the airport is actually old

62
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,400
Older than she is

63
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,216
She got a tattoo of the carpet pattern on her back

64
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,264
The side so yes my last

65
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,056
Emma travelled a lot as a kid

66
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:27,872
Her parents are divorced and her dad lives in LA

67
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,152
I think the first

68
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,944
Time I ever took

69
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:34,528
Flight as an unaccompanied minor

70
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,832
Mama's probably 11

71
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,880
And freaking out

72
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,696
But the carpet had this kind of calming effect on her

73
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:46,816
On my way that was kind of like my send off the carpet was there and that you knew that

74
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:49,632
That would probably be there when I got home

75
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:54,752
Several years later when Emma decided to take the plunge and get a tattoo of the Portland carpet design

76
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:56,032
She realized

77
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:58,336
She was not the carpets only admirer

78
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,616
Not by a long shot

79
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,920
When I got the tattoo

80
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:02,944
I

81
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:05,504
Posted a picture of it on Insta

82
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,808
And one of my followers

83
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:10,112
Tagged at PDX carpet

84
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,416
Upon further inspection I was like

85
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,696
Oh my goodness

86
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,744
The carpet has an Instagram

87
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,791
The carpet has a Twitter and a

88
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:18,815
Facebook page

89
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,607
And that's kind of when I knew it

90
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,887
That it was

91
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,959
This kind of notorious Portland

92
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:25,727
Entity

93
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:32,639
It's important to note that the airport Communications Department says they are not running any of the social media accounts.

94
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,919
Devoted the PDX carpet

95
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:39,039
Emma says that occasionally people on social media make fun of her tattoo

96
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,367
Sitting back and

97
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:46,207
Letting people say what they want about it

98
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,767
I'm in love

99
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,071
I used to live in Boston

100
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,911
I cannot imagine telling boss tonight's like

101
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:57,215
I'm obsessed with the airport carpet

102
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,519
Logan

103
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,823
And having someone go yeah me too

104
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,871
Jeremy Dunn is a designer in Portland

105
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,407
And he's another fan of the carpet

106
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:09,759
A couple of years ago he decided to have some socks made with the carpet pattern on them

107
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,575
He said about $500 on the minimum order

108
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,855
Which would 72 pair

109
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,671
So he was hoping some people would want to buy them

110
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,487
Posted them on our Instagram account

111
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,511
Think it was

112
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:25,119
An hour maybe two hours and they were all sold out

113
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:31,007
The carpet socks were so popular that Jeremy quit his day job and opened up a retail space

114
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:33,567
Jeremy socks are actually told in the airport now

115
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:37,151
Alongside many other items emblazoned with the carpet pattern

116
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:43,551
T-shirts coffee mugs throw pillows tote bag stickers keychains bike helmets water bottles

117
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:46,879
PDX carpet IPA from a local Brewery called Rogue

118
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:50,463
That's what's so interesting to me about this whole carpet phenomenon

119
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:54,047
It's great for Pediatrics it's basically free marketing for them

120
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:58,143
But if the airport had tried to create this kind of fervor for the carpet

121
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,191
There's no way it would have caught on

122
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,471
At least not like this

123
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,775
I love this carpet

124
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,079
Like a big thing ever by socks

125
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:13,247
It just kind of represents for tonight if we're kind of known for this at our airport this carpet makes traveling a little bit more enjoyable

126
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,551
I guess what I'm in the airport selfie

127
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,319
The foot

128
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:19,135
But maybe there's something they should secretly magical about it

129
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:22,975
People having

130
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:28,095
Stream unprecedented inordinate amounts of affection for the carpet at PDX

131
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:31,167
When you ask people why they love the carpet so much

132
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,471
They pretty much all say the same thing

133
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,007
When they see it

134
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,799
It reminds them that their home

135
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,079
And that's sweet

136
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,127
But like so many great love stories

137
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,407
I'm afraid this one

138
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:43,455
Is coming to a tragic end

139
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:50,111
That is the sound of Portland heart being ripped

140
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,391
Out of its chest

141
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:55,487
Speaking of PDX workers are replacing the airports

142
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,023
Famous carpet you know that

143
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,583
Teal with the red

144
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:05,983
And purple and blue accents it's hard to say goodbye especially for travelers with an emotional attachment

145
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:11,103
A person came up to me and said oh I love your tattoo

146
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:13,919
Did you know that they've already started

147
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,711
Tearing it up and I just kind of

148
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,015
Felt my heart sank

149
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:24,927
Free carpet it's actually had a pretty long life the oldest sections of carpet have been in the airport since the late 1980s

150
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,463
Are things that

151
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,231
You just can't reach

152
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,535
Pair can't dispatch your way out of it

153
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,583
It really just looks

154
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:32,607
Tired

155
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,447
That's Robin McCaffrey

156
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,519
She's an engineering project manager at the Port of Portland

157
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,311
The agency that controls the airport

158
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,383
She's in charge of the carpet removal project

159
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,919
Starting late January

160
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:52,319
Can you describe what you're doing

161
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:55,135
To the carpet so the machine can pull it up

162
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,439
Mike mackley works for

163
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,719
4M Floor Covering

164
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:03,839
Actually he helped install the carpet here at the end of the C Concourse in the mid-1990s

165
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,119
I laid all of this

166
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,959
1995 for rubenstein's contract carpet

167
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:13,567
So do you have any kind of attachment to it

168
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,871
You're not sorry to see it go

169
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,663
Just carpet that's my opinion

170
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:24,319
The machine are using to remove the carpet looks like a cross between a motorized wheelchair and a Zamboni

171
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,111
It's called a panther

172
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:29,951
You attach the carpet to the machine and drive it forward to pull up the

173
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:32,255
Huge sections of carpet all at once

174
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:39,935
Most of this work will be done at night so it can have minimal impact on Travelers

175
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,751
It's going to take a long time

176
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:48,127
13 acres of Corvette does not get Panther. Away overnight

177
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,663
If all goes well

178
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:53,247
Perfectly it will be earlier than November

179
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,015
But

180
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,039
We're giving it a healthy

181
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:55,807
A window on Word

182
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,343
For

183
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:04,511
When the carpet is all removed most of it will be sent back to the manufacturer and recycle

184
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,279
But not

185
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,047
All of it

186
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:09,887
They're giving away for 1000 square yard pieces

187
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:12,703
Businesses will have to submit proposal to get one

188
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,751
Outlining what they plan to do with the carpet

189
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,543
In the meantime

190
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:19,103
And how they will eventually make it available

191
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,127
To the General Public

192
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,943
Whatever happens to the old PDX carpet

193
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,479
One thing is for sure

194
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,783
Its replacement has some big shoes

195
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,855
FFL people are going to hate it

196
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,391
Well hopefully not

197
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:35,487
It might be a perfectly great tonight but people will still hate it though

198
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:38,815
Why didn't you replace all the carpet and use the same beloved design

199
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,607
If they had decided to

200
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,887
Just recarpet

201
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:45,215
With the same design that would have been cool

202
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:48,287
Yeah it does seem like the most obvious solution

203
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,871
But the decision to replace the carpet was made back in 2008

204
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:54,687
Before all the foot selfies and hashtag PDX

205
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,967
Carpet I don't

206
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:57,759
At that time

207
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,783
There was an awareness

208
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,551
So that Grace

209
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,623
Ready for the carpet

210
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:03,903
That we became

211
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:04,671
I'm aware of Maurice

212
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,439
Somali

213
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,975
Did you ever consider

214
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,791
Replacing carpet with the same design

215
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,839
I think that we

216
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:12,607
Had

217
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,887
Thoughts about

218
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,423
People asking that question

219
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,215
Once we were well into it

220
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:17,983
I had already come

221
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:18,751
Come up with

222
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,031
A conceptual design

223
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:25,663
Now when you walk through the airport you can actually see a sizable Swatch at the new carpet

224
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:30,783
It's a darker green with a repeating geometric motifs it's reminiscent of the old carpet

225
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:37,183
But busier the busyness of the new design actually helps hide dirt and other wear-and-tear in fact there's a cup

226
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,719
Different versions of a new design

227
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:42,303
One that's extra busy that they'll lay in higher traffic areas

228
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,583
It looks like a

229
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,655
Tropical Jimmy Buffett version of the

230
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:50,495
Of the airport carpet and not in a good way

231
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,287
Jeremy Dunn the stock maker

232
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,311
Is not a fan

233
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,871
Seems very swoopy and like

234
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:58,431
You know what has more curves to it and

235
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:02,015
It's a little bit different green

236
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:06,623
And it's a little has some yellow in there and I think those are all

237
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,159
To me those are all things

238
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,207
Are not as

239
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,487
Appealing

240
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,535
Are you going to make socks with a new design

241
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:17,119
Yeah probably not

242
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,167
Yeah I think it's tough

243
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:19,935
People don't have it

244
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,727
Love everybody

245
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:22,751
Wishes that there

246
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,519
Design work was

247
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,847
Michelle Bo is a partner at hennebery Eddy

248
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:31,199
The Firm that took on the unenviable challenge of Designing the

249
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:33,247
Home carpet design work

250
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:36,063
There's a lot of thought and consideration that went into it

251
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,111
The inspiration for this

252
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,671
Had a lot to do with what you see from the air as your

253
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,439
Coming in

254
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,743
Green color that

255
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,023
It's the main background

256
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,071
Is much like

257
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,095
Static Spray

258
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,423
We have a unique situation here

259
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:54,751
Coming into Portland The Greenery of

260
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,031
Our surroundings

261
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:58,079
Come right up to the doorstep of our city

262
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,871
And those soupy lines

263
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,895
Also we're looking at

264
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,223
Flight path that pattern event

265
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,247
Curvatures

266
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,015
Flying in

267
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,319
If you were to look at

268
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,367
Kind of the way that aircraft

269
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,647
Curve around

270
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,999
Did you ever think about how people's feet with

271
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,279
On the new carpet

272
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,119
I didn't

273
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:28,287
Even with all this thought in care designer Michelle vo is fully aware that this new carpet is going to be a

274
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,055
Hard Sell

275
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:32,895
But she hopes it will grow on people over time

276
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,943
Can you carpet going down as something that will

277
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,479
Become enduring night

278
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:39,807
I hope that it will and maybe it won't reach cult status until

279
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,343
20 years out when it's time to

280
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,367
Replace it by

281
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,647
You know that's okay

282
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:49,535
You can't manufacture a cult following for an airport carpet

283
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,815
It has to happen on its own

284
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:56,703
You don't say but I do think that part of the reason that people fell in love with the carpet is because

285
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,263
People have a lot of love for the airport itself

286
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,823
Which is kind of become a microcosm of Portland

287
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:04,639
Good local restaurants and food carts in the terminal

288
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:07,967
There's even a mini farmers market in the C Concourse

289
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:13,855
And so maybe the new carpet will eventually become a part of the airport the same way the old carpet did

290
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,903
Crucial to the experience

291
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,439
I'm coming home to Portland

292
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,719
Then again

293
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:19,743
Maybe not

294
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,023
It's a lot like

295
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,375
Just having anything in your childhood replaced

296
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:31,263
With something your kind of resentful towards the new whatever it maybe

297
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:38,175
And you could potentially grow to like it but it'll never be the same as the original

298
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,711
Things that you loved

299
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:46,623

Americorps in microbes that control the force

302
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,255
And

303
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:56,095
No there's no way I'll ever like it

304
00:13:56,351 --> 00:14:00,447
You hear me George Lucas I'll never liked it you ruined it you ruined
