I'm Roman Mars

23
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,352
When people critique

24
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,120
Cul-de-sac

25
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:44,192
A lot of time there actually critiquing the suburbs more generally

26
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:47,776
The cul-de-sac has become a sort of like the mascot of the supper

27
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:50,080
Mike Epps Suburbia had a flag

28
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,360
It would have a picture

29
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,896
Have a cul-de-sac on it

30
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,808
I can still remember how strange that words sounded to me when my mom told me we were moving from the city of Atlanta

31
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,856
To the suburbs of Denver

32
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:04,416
And that we'd be living on one of these

33
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:05,440
Things

34
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:08,768
Hey that's pretty sure Katie mingle do my work this week

35
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:11,584
The cul-de-sac is a French term literally meaning

36
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,864
The bottom of the back

37
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,400
Or the ass of the back

38
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:18,240
So it's no wonder the French themselves prefer to use the word

39
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,008
Empath

40
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:23,872
Another fun fact the plural of cul-de-sac is actually culs-de-sac

41
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:27,712
But Katie and I have agreed that it isn't possible to refer to them this way

42
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,480
Without

43
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,528
Sounding like a couple of aspects

44
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:34,368
I've always felt a little embarrassed by my Suburban roots

45
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,416
By the cul-de-sac especially

46
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,184
Which

47
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,488
With its uterine shape and having the words

48
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,512
Sock in it

49
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:44,608
Give me the feeling that I spent my early years coddled and sheltered

50
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,400
In an asphalt womb

51
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,936
Living on a cul-de-sac

52
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,728
Has come to symbolize

53
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:53,312
Got everything that young hipsters or

54
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,848
People who are

55
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,664
I don't see Suburbia as the American dream

56
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,992
I've come to despise and it's taking on the symbolic role

57
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,016
That's Matt Lassiter

58
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,808
And I think he just called you a hamster

59
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:06,368
Yep I think you did

60
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:08,416
Epitomized Suburbia both in it

61
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,208
Busting the myth of the

62
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,304
Going to happy nuclear family American dream and in the way that critics

63
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:15,840
Condemned it as a

64
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:16,608
Facade

65
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,936
That teaches a history of the suburbs course at the University of

66
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:24,032
And the great age of the cul-de-sac is the 1950s and 1960s

67
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:30,944
Matt says that by the 70s and 80s our faith in the nuclear family and in the Suburban American Dream

68
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,736
Was starting to break down

69
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:35,552
And it's evident all over Pop Culture

70
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,600
Like in the 1980's classic

71
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:38,624
E t

72
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,160
At the beginning of the film

73
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,208
We learned that Elliott's parents are

74
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,256
Divorcing his father is down in Mexico

75
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,024
The car with him

76
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,048
Girlfriend

77
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:49,632
Is Mom's there alone in the family sitting around the table

78
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:53,728
And they're very sad

79
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,968
Maybe you ought to call your father and tell him about

80
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:06,528
I can't

81
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,064
He's in Mexico with Sally

82
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,880
And then et qualms

83
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,416
From outer space

84
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,464
You almost like a savior figure

85
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,768
To bring happiness back to this

86
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,047
Sad broken

87
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,327
Suburban family

88
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:23,935
And I think it's really striking in the film The Way That

89
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,215
Elliott can

90
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,519
Confine

91
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,287
Freedom

92
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,079
And excitement

93
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,895
In the suburbs by riding his bicycle

94
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:36,479
Note to the end of the cul-de-sac and then beyond Into the Woods

95
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,271
In the kind of magical

96
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,295
Friends

97
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,575
Where the subdivision

98
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,855
Stops in the

99
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,391
And the wilderness

100
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,671
Again

101
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:46,975
E t

102
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:51,583
Is devastating to me and I get last year's point about ET providing the escape hatch

103
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:56,959
3 horrible oppressive cul-de-sac but I also think you can't deny the fact that the kids in E.T

104
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,495
Ruled the neighborhood

105
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:02,079
I mean the boys outmaneuver the feds on their dirt bikes

106
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,151
It's a great place

107
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,735
To be if your 7 years old and you want to ride your big wheel

108
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,271
Out in the street

109
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,831
But it's not a great place to live

110
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:15,647
I would argue if you're 14 years old

111
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,439
And want to get out of

112
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,463
The neighborhood

113
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:20,511
And you don't have a car then you start feeling

114
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:23,071
Trapped cul-de-sacs do tend to be iced

115
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:23,839
Oscillating

116
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,631
They aren't connected to other streets

117
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,935
And they're far away from town centers

118
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:32,287
But even though cul-de-sacs are experiencing a backlash right now

119
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,359
They were themselves part of a design backlash

120
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:38,943
Against Urban living and the traditional grid pattern streets

121
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,735
That make up most cities

122
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,015
We think about

123
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,807
The cul-de-sac Bass

124
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,831
Subdivision

125
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,879
And it's obvious

126
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,927
Which is the urban grid pattern

127
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:53,023
But if you go back before World War II there was a third alternative

128
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,327
Which was the early Garden suburbs

129
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,375
That had curvilinear Street

130
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,423
But they were designed

131
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,471
The fit in with the landscape

132
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,263
To create buffers

133
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,543
Between the houses

134
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,847
To integrate people into Park

135
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07,615
Send

136
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,919
Lakes and other natural features

137
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:13,759
And so it was the opposite of the grid pattern but it wasn't

138
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,039
The

139
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,599
Cul-de-sac

140
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,367
Bass

141
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,903
End of the road

142
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,183
Dead end pattern

143
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,743
Are the streets almost always came back around

144
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,023
The other Street

145
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,607
It was when the suburbs became mass-produced

146
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,911
The war that the worst aspects

147
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,215
Suburban design began to dominate

148
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:36,287
Little boxes on the hillside

149
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:42,687
Little boxes made of ticky tacky little

150
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:47,295
Whether or not you buy the idea that cul-de-sacs

151
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:51,135
Psychologically oppressive or stifling to the freedom of those that live there

152
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:54,207
They have some real quantifiable design flaws

153
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:56,255
Great Lake imagine me a garbage

154
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,535
Butter or streak

155
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,607
Instead of driving down one Long Street

156
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,655
And collecting all the garbage from that street and then

157
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,935
I'm taking a right under the neck

158
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,215
Street and so on

159
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,263
You to turn around and all of these

160
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,031
Cul-de-sac

161
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,311
Over and over again

162
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,383
It takes more time use more gas

163
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:16,479
They're expensive to maintain some governments

164
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,783
Like the one in the state of Virginia

165
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,575
Are starting to ban them

166
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,111
In all new develop

167
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:51,551
Chicago.

168
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:00,255
About speeding cars

169
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:06,911
Wait here we go

170
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,679
My mom

171
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,447
Hey Mom

172
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,471
Hey honey

173
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,311
Research about

174
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,383
I guess I'm wondering

175
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,623
You love to call the

176
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,695
Because it was

177
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:32,767
Place where

178
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:37,887
You know you were allowed to go out there all hours of the day and night and play

179
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,447
Be pretty much unsupervised

180
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,983
Oh she sounds nice

181
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,007
She's the nicest

182
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,567
And it's true I did love the cul-de-sac

183
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:50,175
I didn't like school and I didn't fit in there but none of that seemed to matter on the cold

184
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:57,087
The cul-de-sac it was all about ghost in the graveyard and signing the guts to launch off the skateboard ramp

185
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:59,391
And that was a world I shined in

186
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:02,463
My parents they always seem like they live there too

187
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,231
Just for me

188
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,279
And after I moved away

189
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,071
Eventually they did to

190
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:13,727
Now my mom and dad live in a new development that urban planners would refer to as

191
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,751
Mixed-use

192
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,847
That's shops and houses and restaurants all mixed in together

193
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,127
I love it

194
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:22,175
They live right above the gap

195
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:24,479
There's a library within walking distance

196
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:27,551
My dad helps little lecture series and their condo

197
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:32,927
And I like that as they get older they won't need to be dependent on a car to get what they need

198
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,463
It's perfect for them

199
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:35,743
The frick kid

200
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,095
When they play

201
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:45,727
The one family that I'm thinking of who live up

202
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,775
Fifth floor

203
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,359
Their children are pretty young and they have talked

204
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:55,455
They go to different parks around the area

205
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:04,159
Going to parks with Mom and Dad doesn't sound nearly as cool as taking over an entire Street every night

206
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:07,743
What type of suburban development that's organized

207
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,535
Around the needs of

208
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,095
5 year olds or 8 year olds or 10 year olds

209
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,911
That's the last straw use that we shouldn't be design in our neighborhood

210
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,215
Exclusively around the needs of 5 year old

211
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:20,287
A new studies are showing that as gas prices rise

212
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:22,847
People become more ecologically conscious

213
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:29,503
We're already seeing a reverse fight back out of the suburbs and into cities there are even fears

214
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:34,111
Where's the suburbs will turn into Ghost Town slums and ghettos of the future

215
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,695
I really give ghost in the graveyard a whole new Edge

216
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:50,751
99% invisible was produced this week by Katie mingle from the great Third Coast International audio Fest

217
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,031

Those reviews kept me in the top 50 ranking for Arts podcasts

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:42,783
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

I'm having I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

279
00:13:55,071 --> 00:14:01,215
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main got to know how to do that kind of thing if you

280
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:07,615
