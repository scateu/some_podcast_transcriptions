In the US there called line

31
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,368
In Canada are called lineup

32
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,904
Sometimes and I was once

33
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,208
Interviews live on Canadian national

34
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,512
Radio and they started talking about whine up

35
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:13,376
We had a conversation about the police for 5 minutes until I realized what they were talking about

36
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,168
But pretty much everywhere else

37
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,192
It's known

38
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,240
As a q

39
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:21,056
That's Benjamin Walker

40
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,848
He's obsessed with Hughes

41
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:25,920
Keep sending me emails with links to YouTube videos

42
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,712
Of queues you have

43
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:31,808
Ecology students filming their surreptitious Q experiments

44
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:34,368
You have Asian road rage videos

45
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:40,768
You've got people filming fights that break out and accused

46
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:46,400
So understand that I'm not getting out of it

47
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,312
I'd like to call YouTube

48
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,848
Q hole

49
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,456
And when I found this lecture by dr. Q eye immediately

50
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,480
Made an appointment

51
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:01,504
To go and see you

52
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,576
And the reason I'm a professor at MIT

53
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:06,624
And I guess my nickname is Doctor Q

54
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,904
Dick Larson

55
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,696
Is aqi theorist

56
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,000
Just about every day we experience

57
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:12,768
Queuing

58
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,304
In some aspect of Our Lives

59
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,888
Dick Larson studies the mathematical and psychological models

60
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,424
Of cueing systems

61
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:20,448
Unfortunately

62
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,752
The dolphin times too many Q's

63
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:23,776
On a day-to-day basis

64
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:27,104
Dr. Q's able to put his Professional Knowledge to work

65
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,640
Everywhere he goes

66
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,664
I have my own ways

67
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:36,576
Supermarkets particular if you got to go to the deli counter and get a number

68
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:39,904
And then you start walking around and doing the regular shopping and you watch all the numbers

69
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:43,232
And then as soon as it gets close to yours then you go back

70
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,000
So that's a

71
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:46,816
Q that's been avoided because it's a queue within a q

72
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,096
Little ideas

73
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:50,144
Like this dr. Q

74
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,936
Hates waiting in line as much as

75
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:54,240
You and I do but he does respect

76
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,520
The well design

77
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,152
The Machiavellian

78
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,736
Spirits of cute design are people at Disney World in the Disney property

79
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:07,040
They have mastered the idea

80
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:11,904
That people can be happy waiting 40 minutes in line for a 4 minute ride I think

81
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,672
It's fantastic

82
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,047
Disney is very serious

83
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,327
About cutest

84
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,631
They employ about 18 or so operation

85
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,399
Researchers

86
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,423
Imagineers

87
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,983
These imagineers have mastered

88
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,263
The golden rules

89
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:31,871
Q design the first is to keep your customers entertained while I wait in line

90
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:32,895
Their guests

91
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:36,991
Think that the amusement has started before they actually sit in the ride

92
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,807
Don't have video screens along the Q route with

93
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:43,903
Games and if the lines are getting really ugly a park manager will

94
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,671
Saint Denis

95
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,695
Sweaty man

96
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,463
Full body

97
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:50,559
Yeah it so they're entertained and they're amused while they're waiting in line

98
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,583
The second rule

99
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,863
Manage expectation

100
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,679
Always manage your expectations such that you'll deliver

101
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,215
Butler performance

102
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:57,983
You say so

103
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,519
Prince and sip the wine says

104
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:02,079
You can anticipate 45-minute wait for

105
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:02,847
If the line is out

106
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:03,615
To this point

107
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,919
But really it might be only 35

108
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,711
So therefore if you

109
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,735
Look at your watch

110
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:12,319
In 35 minutes to get it on the line and then the dad and the mom and the

111
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,879
Go to kids at Hayward 10 minutes ahead of schedule

112
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:20,255
That's great you waited 35 minutes and you say we just save 10 minutes because we thought we're going to have to wait

113
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,279
For 45 minutes

114
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,887
Q series about a hundred years old now

115
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,447
But it wasn't until the 1950s.

116
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,215
Set the profession

117
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:32,543
Really came into its own after World War II they were saved

118
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,567
I burst of economic

119
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,335
Activity log

120
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,103
More high-rise

121
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:35,871
Buildings

122
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,431
High-rise hotels and offices and all of a sudden

123
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:40,223
Owners of these buildings are getting

124
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,039
Complaints about rush hour delays for elevators

125
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,111
In those days of course they didn't have microprocessors to

126
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,647
Go to optimized

127
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:51,487
The movement of the elevators been available babies actually had humans as operators

128
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,255
Pilots

129
00:05:55,327 --> 00:06:01,471
The professor University of Pennsylvania sent one of his research age to New York City to check out these complaints about elevator delays

130
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:07,103
And indeed he found out that there were rush hours for elevator like 8 to 9 in the morning or 5 to 6 at night

131
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,383
Just like rush hour for cars

132
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,455
So is the traditional engineering approach

133
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:18,111
Dynamite this building it start over again with twice as many Elevator Shaft because you've got more demand than you have capacity

134
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:18,879
When is rush hours

135
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:22,719
Am I experienced Engineers are a lot more crafty than that but let's just go with it

136
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,303
But then in our stroke of Genius

137
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,095
He said maybe the

138
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:33,471
Problem is frame the wrong way maybe the problem isn't the 90 seconds of wait for the elevators

139
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,543
Maybe the problem is the complaints about the noise

140
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:43,967
If we can reduce the complaints substantially maybe we'll solve the problem and then another stroke of Genius

141
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:47,039
What if you give somebody a distraction and diversion

142
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:49,087
Let's try floor-to-ceiling mirror

143
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,391
Next to all the elevators in an experimental build

144
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,951
They got the money with the mirrors in

145
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,743
Watch for a month and guess what

146
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,791
The complaints drop to near-zero

147
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:03,935
Men who are wearing ties could have just their ties that women could make sure their hair was organized okay or vice versa

148
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:04,703
Sometimes

149
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,983
Men and women treatment center

150
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:12,383
The flirt occasionally through the reflection I guess it's less provocative the night I contact the complaints dropped in their zero problem solved

151
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,919
The statistical dwai

152
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:14,687
Unchanged

153
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,967
Ingenious

154
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:22,879
Mirrors won't work at McDonald's are Whole Foods though many fast food restaurants and most grocery stores use parallel

155
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:27,231
Accuse what does a bunch of open lanes and you're forced to pick one and stick with it

156
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:31,071
The one that's you could be going faster for any number of reasons and it's

157
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,607
Totally frustrating

158
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,143
Are you staying your line

159
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,679
And you play the hand you're dealt

160
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,471
But there's another way to do it

161
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,775
A single Serpentine line

162
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,823
That feeds all of the open Regice

163
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,871
It's first come first

164
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:44,639
Serve

165
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:47,199
It's a cute design for equality

166
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,223
Fairness

167
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,807
And when there's one line both blatant and inadvertent

168
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:52,575
Queue jumping

169
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:53,599
Is minimize

170
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:55,391
We call them slips and skips

171
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,927
An American company

172
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:57,695
They used to

173
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,975
Pride themselves

174
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:02,047
On designing these more egalitarian queues

175
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:04,351
Wendy's is very proud that they're the first ones

176
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:07,423
Fast food that had the single Serpentine line American Airlines

177
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,471
Is Ray proud they claimed that there was a

178
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,239
The first ones I've seen

179
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,031
Single serving wine in airport solo

180
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:14,335
British Air argues with them they say

181
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,103
Well they they've got

182
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,407
BCB Bank in New York

183
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,175
Chemical Bank

184
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,455
And they used to claim that they were the

185
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:20,735
Still have that

186
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,015
And their Bank lobbies

187
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,551
That's what is a certain Pride

188
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,087
To getting rid of

189
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,135
It is written line jumping by

190
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,159
Does skips do I have

191
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,231
But today

192
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,255
Cute design

193
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,023
Is changing

194
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:36,863
More and more we're encountering cues that are designed so that

195
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,423
Different levels of service can be provided to

196
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,959
Two different groups of people

197
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:45,055
Priority queues and given certain people priorities over others

198
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,591
You can see it in

199
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,639
Amusements like

200
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,175
Like Disney but more seriously

201
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,735
It occurs in some life-and-death situation

202
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:53,503
Like

203
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,551
Queuing for organ donation

204
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:57,855
My hypothesis

205
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,927
Is that this design change is connected to the

206
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:01,695
Cure

207
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,255
It's becoming more and more commonplace

208
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:07,327
And available to watch for free on YouTube

209
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:11,167
And I also believe that understanding this new Q Theory

210
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:13,727
Will better help us understand the enemy

211
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,519
Quality Inn disparity

212
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,055
It's on the rise in this

213
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:22,431
Why should somebody with a lot of frequent flyer miles

214
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,711
Automatically bumped up

215
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,479
The first class

216
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,527
Cuz I found out I recently was

217
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,807
Hudson flights

218
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,367
And therefore have to escape

219
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,927
The TSA q44 in airport

220
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,743
And I feel a little bit guilty about that

221
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,047
And it just yesterday I did this twice

222
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:42,911
And and I felt a little guilty because they're like 30 people in line and I went right to the front of it

223
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:48,287
Why is this fair just because I flywheel but want more than the others do

224
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:52,383
I think your question is is a deep one and requires some more

225
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,407
More thought in the sky

226
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:08,767
99percentinvisible was produced this week by Benjamin Walker and me Roman Mars got to tell you about Benjamin Walker again

227
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:11,071
Too much information from WFMU

228
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,631
Understand that will make your life better

229
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:20,287
This is a project of kalw 91.7 local public radio in San Francisco and the American hits

230
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,823
Do architects in San Francisco

231
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:28,223
This program is distributed by PRX the public radio exchange making public radio more public find out more

232
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,503
IPR x.org

233
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:36,159
This week and every week I'm aided and abetted by Sam Greenspan working all the way over in Baltimore Maryland Home of the

234
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,719
The third-best city flag in the country

235
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:39,999
Look it up

236
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:46,655
You can find the show and like the show on Facebook I tweet at Roman Mars

237
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,983
Going to catch up with us and tell us your cute stories

238
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,775
At 90% invisible

239
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,543
. org

240
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:54,495
Before we go I want to tell you about the body genius a five-part series from fellow radiotopia show the truth

241
00:11:54,751 --> 00:12:00,639
The body genius is a Dark comic mystery that whines through a treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

242
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,175
We're looking the part

243
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,711
Might cost you your life

244
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:09,087
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

245
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:13,439
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

246
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:17,791
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like a dad

247
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:22,143
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

248
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,495
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that kind

249
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:32,895
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action

250
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:39,295
The movie called Immortal cop was found dead in my private gym crushed inside a high-tech

251
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:45,695
Wait machine even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

252
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:48,255
Now I need to clear my name

253
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:54,655
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes to find them

254
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:03,615
