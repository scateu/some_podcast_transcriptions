I'm Roman

36
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:35,488
It was the night of March 30th 2005

37
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:40,096
And the Powerball jackpot was 25 million dollars

38
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:45,472
On TV the white ping pong balls rolled out one by one as the host

39
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,288
22

40
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,056

43
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:54,176

00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,456
42

45
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:57,504
That's producer Avery trufelman

46
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,552
When are the winter in Tennessee

47
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,600
But the way the Powerball drawings work

48
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,648
They're usually some second-place win

49
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,440
Guess all of the numbers

50
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,976
Except for the very last

51
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:10,304
On average there are three or four of these play

52
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:13,376
But on March 30th 2005

53
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,424
There were 110

54
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,448
2nd place winner

55
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,312
Was there a computer glitch that played all the same number like someone compromise

56
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,848
This is journalist

57
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:26,176
Jennifer 8 Lee Lottery officials are planning to know because

58
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,456
Like something

59
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,224
Izzat

60
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,320
So the next day as the winners around the United States came to collect

61
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,112
The Powerball officials asked

62
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,392
So where'd you get

63
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,416
Your number from

64
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:39,488
And each of them have the same answer

65
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,792
They'd gotten their numbers

66
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:42,560
From

67
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:43,584
Fortune cookie

68
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:46,400
They were different cookies in different states

69
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,448
But they all had the same fortune

70
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,984
And the same lucky numbers

71
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,008
Very

72
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,032
F****** numbers

73
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,312
And so destructive

74
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:55,872
Made you realize like how

75
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:58,176
Much Portuguese and Chinese food

76
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,968
How to become an American

77
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,528
Chinese food along with

78
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:08,416
Pizza in the Frankfurter has been adopted in modified to become American Cuisine

79
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:12,512
Rooted in some good old-fashioned American xenophobia

80
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,352
The early waves of Chinese immigration in the 1850s

81
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:20,704
The new Chinese population work mostly As Miners and farmers and laborers

82
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:22,752
Americans as ever

83
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:25,568
We're concerned about these new immigrants

84
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:27,104
Taking away jobs

85
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:30,944
And it was actually only after huge anti-chinese backlash

86
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:33,760
That the Chinese actually moved into field

87
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,552
When was laundry is Handy one

88
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,320
Was

89
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,112
Restaurant Chili's for cleaning and cooking

90
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,160
They were saying

91
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,440
No longer

92
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,024
And as their livelihood depended on it

93
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,120
Chinese restaurant owners made up dishes to cater to American tastes

94
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:53,472
American basic like things that are sweet and their fry dinner chicken

95
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:56,800
And that's how dishes like Chop Suey were invented

96
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:59,616
Chop Suey the name actually means

97
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,640
Sordid peace

98
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,176
Like odds and ends

99
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:06,016
Chop Suey the biggest culinary joke that one culture is ever played on another

100
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:08,576
Chop Suey is not real Chinese dish

101
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:09,600
At all

102
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,392
It's as American as apple pie

103
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,440
And speaking of apple pie

104
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:16,512
Americans want to start because we are American and we waiting for

105
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,791
Are sweet and fatty

106
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:24,191
She needed a dessert and as Chinese desserts go there aren't that many options that the American pallet wood go for

107
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,727
The Chinese desserts like

108
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:31,615
There is a Mooncake which like taste and looks like a hockey puck but like there's there's not there's not a lot of stuff

109
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:37,503
And so rather 1920s the fortune cookie somehow enters the American Chinese restaurant culture

110
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:40,575
Where they came from originally is a bit of a mystery

111
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:41,855
But we'll get to that

112
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,391
First let's make this

113
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,415
Perfectly clear

114
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:45,695
The cookies

115
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,463
Arnott

116
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:49,535
From China I don't know why the Chinese

117
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,071
They don't need a fortune cookie

118
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:54,911
Steven Yang is founder of Yang's fortunes Incorporated

119
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:58,751
Chinese people in China don't eat fortune cookies

120
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,311
But Americans consume billions of them

121
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,615
Which means great business for season

122
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:08,479
Because he prints a lot of the paper fortunes that go inside fortune cookie

123
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:11,551
If a phone anyway I would have New York Boston

124
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:14,111
Houston anyway all you can see my fortune

125
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:17,183
Including all the fortunes for Panda Express

126
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:19,487
That's definitely Steven biggest client

127
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:23,327
Stevens tiny Warehouse in San Francisco's Dogpatch

128
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,375
Is filled with boxes

129
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,399
Also

130
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,679
Stuffed full

131
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,959
Of tiny strips

132
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:29,983
Fortune paper

133
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,263
Each box

134
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,567
Contains 300,000 paper

135
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,335
Portuguese

136
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,615
Alpena Lottery

137
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:36,639
Econo Lodge

138
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:43,039
See and Stephen Prince all these boxes and boxes with only five other employees and Lisa

139
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,063
Stevens daughter

140
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,343
Writes all the fortune

141
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:48,159
When I visited she was away on maternity leave

142
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:52,511
But she is written most of it companies 5000 unique fortunes

143
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,887
This is amazing because we think about it fortunes are deceptively difficult to ride

144
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:02,495
The messages have to be really really generic because they could be four

145
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,519
Anyone

146
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:09,407
You can't read messages like you will meet a tall dark stranger because an eight-year-old could read that and be like

147
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,687
I don't want that

148
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:11,967
Why would we

149
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,039
And fortunes also have to be careful not to offend

150
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:18,111
Famously there was once of Fortune that said lighten up

151
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,647
And a lot of customers were like

152
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,183
Is this cookie calling me fat

153
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,231
Intercourse no bad predictions

154
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:25,279
Americans like their fortunes

155
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,047
Sunny

156
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,095
So fortunes 10w Vape

157
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:31,679
Or just generally uplifting like tomorrow will be better

158
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:34,239
Or the fortunes are nab's from quotation books

159
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,031
Just whatever Lisa can find

160
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,567
Stephen doesn't really care

161
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,335
He doesn't read them

162
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,895
I don't know why the American people didn't like it

163
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:43,711
He said he would do when they got a 14

164
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:45,759
After eating dinner

165
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:46,783
Keeping the water

166
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:47,807
The keeper

167
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,087
Yeah that's true

168
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,391
Some people do keep the fortunes in their wallets

169
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:56,767
When I asked around it turns out a few of my friends do this or can recite their favorite for it since from memory

170
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:00,095
And it's crazy because a lot of these fortunes are Stevens

171
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,631
Written by his daughter

172
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:02,655
Lisa

173
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:05,727
But there are a few ways to tell we're abortions come from

174
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:12,127
If you get one with blue corners on it that was printed by a giant company in New York called wonton food

175
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:19,295
They make over 4 million cookies a day and we're responsible for the cookie that made all those Powerball

176
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,831
Winners in 2005

177
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:23,135
If your fortune has smiley faces on it

178
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,695
It was probably printed by a Chinese company

179
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,231
For the American Market

180
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:27,999
Of course

181
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:34,655
And if the fortune doesn't have blue corners or smiley faces chances are it was one of the many thousands that Steven

182
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:35,935
And all different

183
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,959
Colors and fonts

184
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,519
And send the factories all over the country

185
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:45,407
Including the Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Company in a tiny Alleyway in San Francisco's Chinatown

186
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,223
The Golden Gate fortune cookie

187
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,015
Company is pretty touristy

188
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:54,367
It charges visitors 50 Cent's of photo and doesn't actually have a very big cookie

189
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:57,951
Actually calling this place a factory is kind of an overstatement

190
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,743
It's just one narrow room

191
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:03,583
With most of the space taken up by three hulking Fortune Cookie Machine

192
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,655
Versions of machines that were invented

193
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,935
By Edward Lewis

194
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:11,519
My father used to call his submachine like this fourth child

195
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,567
He had three sons and then the 4th what's his

196
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:14,335
Baby

197
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:16,639
Memory one of Edward Three Sons

198
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,687
Met me at the Golden Gate fortune cookie

199
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,759
Company these fortune cookie machines are pretty simple

200
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:24,831
Fix bottom round absorb outer onto a conveyor belt

201
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:29,439
In a worker sits next to this Bell and fold the hot cookies around the paper fortune

202
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,463
One by one

203
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,487
My hand

204
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:32,511
And

205
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:35,071
We pick them up as you see them doing here

206
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,447
Hold it and put them on a conveyor named learned how to fold the cookies when he was around eight years old

207
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,775
The Lewis family used to have a fortune cookie company of Their Own

208
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,055
It was our whole life

209
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,591
Even during dinner

210
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,615
Which upshifts

211
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,663
Somebody eats the other one work

212
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,943
That's how we did it.

213
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,247
We used to call ourselves the prisoners

214
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,527
That was a famous saying

215
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,575
Help I'm a prisoner in this

216
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:57,855
Fortune cookie

217
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:03,743
Ming's father later developed the next generation of Fortune Cookie Machine

218
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,535
Fully automated version

219
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,071
Which also.

220
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,631
And because of this technology

221
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:10,655
Fortune cookies

222
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,935
Is are widely available

223
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:12,959
And cheap enough

224
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:15,263
At restaurants can give them out for free

225
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,847
No one in the movie Family really question where the cookies originated

226
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:21,919
But it was a mystery that other people try to solve

227
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,967
People like Sally Osaka

228
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:27,039
She knew they were not invented in China

229
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,599
What do you mean the Chinese fortune cookies

230
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,623
Japanese

231
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:33,951
Sally osaki is California born and raised

232
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:38,047
But her parents came from Japan in the early 1900s

233
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,583
When I was a child

234
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,119
Fortunes

235
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,911
Used to be in Japanese

236
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,703
Rather than the Chinese character

237
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:47,007
And the cookies weren't something you get

238
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,543
At the end of a meal at a restaurant

239
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:49,823
They come in a bag

240
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:54,431
And mostly I know who we got them when I was a child

241
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,735
Was we would go see Japanese movies

242
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:59,551
Sew-in Sally's California childhood

243
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,343
The cookies were a casual snack

244
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,647
But if you chase them all the way back

245
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,671
To their Origins

246
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,695
In Japan

247
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,231
You actually find them

248
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:08,255
At a shrine

249
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:13,119
There you will be able to find

250
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:19,775
Is Japanese Bakers grilling fortune cookies

251
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:22,335
Shrine in Kyoto specifically to dry them

252
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:25,919
But they're not like the fortune cookies we see in the United States are like

253
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:32,575
Bigger and Browner and they're actually kind of everything nutty Savory flavor so they're more cracker like

254
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:35,391
But still there that same iconic fortune cookie

255
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,927
U-shaped we all know

256
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:40,767
There's actually an old Japanese image of a baker folding a cracker

257
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:43,327
That dates back to 1878

258
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,655
Decades before the first reports of American fortune cookie

259
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,703
One of the bakers that I spoke to

260
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,471
Thought that

261
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,775
Fortune cookies they designed

262
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,567
She look like a bell in Part B

263
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:56,127
Because her Bells all along the path

264
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:57,919
Come to the shrine

265
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,967
But then why don't we eat it after sushi

266
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:03,039
Cuz I keep or not eating sushi in like 19

267
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:09,951
When Japanese immigrants were opening businesses in the 1920s there was no market for Japanese food again

268
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,231
Like a Chinese immigrants

269
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:11,999
Before then

270
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,791
They Pander to American taste

271
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:16,351
So a lot of the Japanese families

272
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,143
Ran a lot of Chinese restaurant

273
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,471
And these Japanese families ran American Chinese rest

274
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:25,055
Full of Chop Suey and other Pho Chinese cuisine

275
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,847
Annie's Japanese owners

276
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,895
Would throw in a fortune cookie

277
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:29,663
For dessert

278
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:36,063
When Sally was a kid fortune cookies were still made in Japanese bakeries in both LA and San Francisco

279
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,623
And the fortunes were still in Japanese

280
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:41,951
And then something happened that completely disrupted

281
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,999
Everything about Japanese American Life

282
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:44,767
Life in this country

283
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:50,399
And I don't know if you know that the Japanese-Americans hundred

284
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,679
20000 of us

285
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:54,751
During World War II were sent away

286
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,847
I was nine years old when we got sent to

287
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,943
Sally and her family were farmers

288
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:03,967
In Fresno

289
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,759
They were summoned to a train station

290
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,063
And sent off to a camp in Arizona

291
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,623
You had to carry whatever your day

292
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:13,695
That was a child I would carry that much

293
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,231
Pictures of small suitcase

294
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,023
And I remember my mother

295
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,047
Took me

296
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,583
To Us store

297
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,119

She heard that

299
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,471
Victorian era

300
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,031

301
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,079

Scorpions in

Rattlesnakes Young

305
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:41,855
In the camper parents were given jobs at her and hardly any money

306
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,391
Valerie lesbian

307
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,927
$16

308
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,207
Are $18

309
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,535
For 4 years

310
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,583
From 1942

311
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,863
1946

312
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,167
California's Japanese

313
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:57,471
And Japanese American community

314
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,007
He was marooned in the desert

315
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,287
Out of sight

316
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,823
Attitude acacian

317
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,847
And out of business

318
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:06,943
Including a lot of Japanese Bakers & Japanese restaurant owner

319
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,503
My recollection was that

320
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,551
After we came out of the camps

321
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,111
What was the Chinese fortune cookie

322
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,671
The Chinese actually

323
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,207
Commercialized it

324
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,231
And

325
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:22,047
Did all the Chinese restaurants that are deserving

326
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,839
Thanks to Chinese business owners

327
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:24,607
And later

328
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,143
Edward Louie fortune cookie

329
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:26,911
Machines

330
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,447
The Chinese American fortune cookie

331
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:29,983
As we now know it

332
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,263
Flourished

333
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:38,431
It's nearly impossible to pen the Americanization of the cookie to one specific Japanese-American

334
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,735
Baker or Chinese American Restaurant

335
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:47,391
The transfer from Japanese cracker to American Chinese cookie was a larger phenomenon that occurred

336
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,159
Or less

337
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,439
Across California

338
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:52,255
And then swept the rest of the United States

339
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,791
And then the world

340
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,071
Except

341
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,095
For China

342
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,143
They still don't eat pork

343
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:07,359
99percentinvisible was produced this week by Avery trufelman with Katie mango Sam Greenspan Kurt Kolstad and Mero

344
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:11,711
This episode was largely inspired by Jennifer 8 Lee

345
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:18,111
The fortune cookie Chronicles which goes into even more depth about the origins of American Chinese

346
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:21,951
Cuisine and believe me now our way deeper depth

347
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,231
It's Gregory

348
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:27,327
Has Jennifer got a new passion project that needs your help designers

349
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:33,983
Weed is great project at the White House in your public library or inviting everyone to redesign covers for public domain books

350
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,799
Still need covers for titles like Peter Pan and The Secret Garden

351
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:39,103
You can learn more about it a recovery in the class

Between the beats

362
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:22,111
Bongs and chatter of our devices

363
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:24,415
We're immersed in a cluttered world

364
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,695
A man-made sound

365
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,719
If

366
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:31,327
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexis

367
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:37,215
Talking to me and my wife is in another room and a kid is another remedy for all hearing that voice

368
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:37,983
Technology

369
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:38,751
She talked to us
