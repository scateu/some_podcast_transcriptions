90 years later this Photograph by Lucia moholy

46
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,416
Is one of the most famous images of the German article known as the Bauhaus

47
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:05,952
Meaning the word

48
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:06,976
Build in German

49
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,024
And house meaning

00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:15,936
The Bell House was founded by architect Walter gropius in 1990

52
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,776
The school start diffuse art with industrialization

53
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:22,336
Do use new ideals of modernism

54
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,616
To create beautiful

55
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,640
Functional things

56
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,176

In the beginning of the Bauhaus Rose From the Ashes of World War 1 end

59
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,344
There was a

60
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,624
Very hopeful

61
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,672
Bear utopian. Of

62
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:41,536
Craftsman and artist all creating together

63
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,584
Teach architectural design history at

64
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,864
At The courtauld Institute

65
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,144
Art in London

66
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,168
But I'm America

67
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:54,336
The Bauhaus was a magnet for European designers Architects and artists of all kinds in the early 20th century

68
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:57,664
Many of whom would go on to achieve International acclaim

69
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:02,272
The photographer Lucia moholy did not become one of those famous

70
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:08,160
She joined about house in 1923 but not as a teacher or as a student

71
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,976
Her husband Laszlo moholy-nagy

72
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,536
I've been hired on to the faculty of the Bauhaus

73
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,328
And so Lucia said off of them

74
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,864
To become part of this new

75
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,216
Exciting place they come to the bath

76
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:25,824
Lucio like the wives of the other about house faculty did what was expected of her

77
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:29,920
Which was to do some kind of work that would help fulfill the mission of the sea

78
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,456
Unpaid of course

79
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:34,016
Lucia had some training in photography

80
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:36,064
She had the darkroom skills in

81
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,088
Should really

82
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:43,232
Excellent technical skills of the. Kind of document

83
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,768
She made portraits of the

84
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,072
People their of the things that they made

85
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,376
End of the architecture of the school itself

86
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:52,704
Walter gropius design school with campus in Dessau

87
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,776
And those buildings became a major theme of Lucy is work

88
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,312
Cheap photography workshops

89
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:59,360
The dormitories the Masters houses

90
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:05,248
She said about showing the spaces where these new methods and philosophies of design we're being met

91
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,112
You can see the way in which this year's photographs of Walter gropius is architecture

92
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:13,184
Express the same ideas that he wanted to express in the Arctic

93
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,208
Textured self

94
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,000
And this is not by chance

95
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,583
Lucy is photography like gropius is architecture

96
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,911
Is all about Clarity and simplicity of form

97
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,191
It is utilitarian

98
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:26,239
Document in the world as it is

99
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,519
And it's all so beautiful

100
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,287
Revelling

101
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:30,335
Can clean lights in stark contrast

102
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,175
Only what's needed and nothing more

103
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:39,551
From the dark room in her and Lazlo's home on the Bauhaus campus Lucia Master collection of

104
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,319
Fibrous

105
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,599
100 photographs

106
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,159
And she couldn't have known them the impact

107
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,183
These images

108
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,719
Would have on the built world

109
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,767
Or on her own life

110
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:55,935
The Bauhaus aspired to lift Society up out of the wreckage of World War 1

111
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:58,239
And into a new world of rationalism

112
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,263
UT

113
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,031
Good art

114
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,055
And good design

115
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,359
To bring its braniff utopianism

116
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,639
Into the World At Large

117
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:08,479
But for all their efforts the world did not become more Utopia

118
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:15,135
The national socialist government put the bath under increasing pressure in 1933 it was closed down

119
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:15,903
I'm by the Nazis

120
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:18,463
Many members of the Bauhaus for force

121
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,999
To flee immediately because they were

122
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:20,767
Jewish

123
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,559
Or because they were involved

124
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,839
In very last

125
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,375
Radical politics

126
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,655
Text and they had to go

127
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,215
Amidst all the turmoil of the Nazis rise

128
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,775
The power Lazlo and Lucia had separated

129
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,567
Lucia started dating

130
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,847
The Communist Party member

131
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,615
Parliament

132
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:40,479
One day in 1933 he was arrested in Lucy's apartment While She Was Out

133
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,247
Sochi

134
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:44,575
Was not able to return to her apartment because she had

135
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,343
Interfere

136
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,135
That she was arrested immediately

137
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:47,903
T2

138
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:51,231
Somebody told her don't get back to your apartment

139
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,767
This is Ross socks

140
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,351
He teaches at the University of Czar broken in Germany

141
00:05:56,607 --> 00:06:02,751
And he knew Lucia moholy she had to emigrate immediately so what you did was free to her check

142
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,519
Text Emily

143
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,311
So she went to Prague first

144
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,615
And then she went to Paris

145
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,383
Via

146
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,407
Austria

147
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:13,503
Via Switzerland eventually Landing in London in 1933

148
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,623
Lucia had left behind nearly everything she owned including the glass negatives of the Bauhaus

149
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:22,207
As she fled the country for an uncertain fate of broad

150
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:26,303
Lucy left the legacy of the Bauhaus to an uncertain fate

151
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,071
At home

152
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,911
Lucia weathered out the war in London

153
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,447
She arrived in the city

154
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,471
Basically nothing

155
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:38,079
And it wouldn't lost everything again when her apartment was bombed by German war planes

156
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,383
But even in all the chaos of War

157
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,919
Lucia found ways to work

158
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,479
She wrote a book about the history of photography

159
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,271
100 Years of photography

160
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,343
Ghost published by penguin United 39

161
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,159
And at the same time she was

162
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:52,927
Baidu

163
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,207
Successful

164
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:57,279
Portrait photographer for the high society

165
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,351
And for the most part she put the Bauhaus

166
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,119
Behind her

167
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,399
Set

168
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:07,007
To me that she didn't know that the bowels was more than an episode in her life

169
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,055
She stopped thinking about it

170
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,615
At least until after the war

171
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,991
I supposed it in Nadi 46th Street received amoma catalog of 90

172
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:17,759
238

173
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,295
That must have been the first

174
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,063
Hidden Falls

175
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:24,159
Back in 1938 completely unbeknownst to Lucia

176
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:28,511
Walter gropius had work with the Museum of Modern Art in New York MoMA

177
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,815
To put together an exhibition on the Bauhaus

178
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,375
And because the war was still going on at the time

179
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:36,703
Moma hadn't been able to get many of the Bauhaus as objects

180
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,727
Out of Germany

181
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:41,567
And so the exhibition was comprised mostly of photographs

182
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,615
Images of the products they design

183
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:47,199
The people who made them and the buildings were they worked and lived

184
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,247
Images of the dormitories

185
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,015
The Master's house

186
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,039
The workshop

187
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:55,903
Photos that use interesting angles to transform Stark rectilinear structures

188
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,951
Do striking asymmetric

189
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,719
Composition

190
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,255
Those photographs

191
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:02,303
Published in the museum catalog

192
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:04,351
The book that accompany the exhibition

193
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,375
She whips

194
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,911
Seen her own photograph

195
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,703
But not her name

196
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,495
The 1938

197
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:13,055
Catalog and other catalogs

198
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,871
And books coming out from the US do not credit

199
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,919
Again historian Robin Schulz

200
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,223
She also begins

201
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:20,991
See

202
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:24,063
New articles that mention the Bauhaus that are

203
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,879
Do streams good reproductions ever photograph

204
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:30,975
Following World War II there was a surge of interest in the Bauhaus

205
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:36,863
All of their ideas about rationalism and modernism had caught on among both were Architects and designers

206
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,143
More and more books

207
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,519
Articles about the Bauhaus we're getting published and Lucy is photographs kept getting circulated

208
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:48,383
And the quality seem to be better than you'd expect from duplications of old prints

209
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,431
Lucia begins to think that

210
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,711
Just maybe

211
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:54,015
Recollection of 5 by 7 in

212
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,039
Glass negatives

213
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,343
Might have made it through the war after all

214
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,903
And she begins to think

215
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,719
What are negative might have

216
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,487
Somehow

217
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,255
Survived

218
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,791
So she starts to try to get

219
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:06,815
Are negatives back

220
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:11,423
Lucy's first move is to write to her ex-husband Lazlo

221
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:14,751
Woodson's emigrated To America with his second wife sibel

222
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,031
Lucia asked

223
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:19,615
If he had any clues about where the negatives she had left behind

224
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,639
Might have ended up

225
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:23,199
Sibel couser that they in fact left

226
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:25,759
These cumbersome negatives and gropius house

227
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,527
Ingrid Pierce

228
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,295
Just basement

229
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,063
Gropius

230
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,111
Completely unbeknownst Lucia

231
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:33,439
Actually taking her negatives with him to the US

232
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,999
We need emigrated more than a decade earlier

233
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,559
Likely because he had friends who were higher up

234
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,583
UPS in the Nazi party

235
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,631
And so when gropius left room

236
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,679
He didn't have to flee in a hurry

237
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:46,495
He was able to carefully pack up his belongings

238
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:49,311
Lucy is heavy fragile glass negatives

239
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,079
Among them

240
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,103
And bring them with him

241
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:51,871
The harbor

242
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:53,663
Where he recently got a job

243
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,455
Lucia right to gropius

244
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,991
These negatives

245
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,015
Irreplaceable

246
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,295
Commence

247
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,063
Be extreme

248
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:00,831
Only useful

249
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:01,855
Now or

250
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:04,159
Walter gropius right back

251
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,439
Long years ago in

252
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,231
You gave all these naked

253
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,815
These photographs are extreme

254
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,423
So I hope

255
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,703
Deprive me

256
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:20,031
Lucia response to gropius same basically

257
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,823
I never gave you my negative

258
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,591
Shirley

259
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,871
You did not expect me

260
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,151
To delay my departure

261
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,431
Order to draw up

262
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,455
Formal con

263
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,735
Stipulating

264
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,319
No formal agreement

265
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,855
Could have carried more weight

266
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,391
Friendship

267
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,927
It is this friendship I have

268
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:37,695
Always relied

269
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,231
And which also is

270
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:39,999
I am now in Boca

271
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,815
But when invoking friendship didn't work

272
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,351
Lucia hired a lawyer

273
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,631
Orochi gropius

274
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,935
Did his holding onto Lucy is negative

275
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:53,055
Was like a firefighter saving a house and then claiming ownership of all the stuff inside

276
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:56,127
But still gropius was not giving them back

277
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:58,687
You stood never anything for anybody

278
00:10:59,455 --> 00:10:59,967
Except

279
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:05,087
He didn't have her you wrote some very kind letters set yes yes

280
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:09,439
We have to think about it we have to think about it we have to think about it and he did not

281
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:16,863
This whole argument raises the question of who owns the image of a building

282
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:20,191
Intellectual property law on photography has evolved the years

283
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,983
And it still varies by country

284
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,007
But generally

285
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:26,079
If you take a picture of a two-dimensional thing like a painting

286
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:28,639
Doesn't show any Artistry on your part

287
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:31,967
And therefore you have no claim to the ownership of that image

288
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:34,527
But if you take a picture of a three dimensional thing

289
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,551
Like a building

290
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,087
You're making decisions about

291
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,135
Position angle lighting

292
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:39,903
Framing

293
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:43,231
You're not just reproducing with quote-unquote really there

294
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,535
You're making something entirely new

295
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,815
And so generally

296
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,351
Copyright on those images

297
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:52,959
That is not just the negatives but also the prince that broke his would have been making from

298
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,495
Legally

299
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,519
That all belong

300
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,311
In any case

301
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,103
Gropius kept making prints

302
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,383
Kept publishing them

303
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,687
Kept circulating her representation

304
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,991
Kept telling the story of the Bell House

305
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,783
Through lucias photography

306
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,367
Architecture is

307
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:14,207
In many ways understood and consumed through photography

308
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,743
We don't get to simos

309
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,023
What's the world's iconic

310
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,559
Weezy pic

311
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:23,167
And this turned out to be especially true of the Bauhaus

312
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:26,495
Because after the start of the Cold War the West

313
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,775
Access to the Bauhaus

314
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:30,335
Campus was cut off by the Iron Curtain

315
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:34,175
Even in East Germany it was incredibly difficult to photograph

316
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:40,575
These buildings yes because there was no possibility of visiting them properly and there was apps

317
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:43,391
Absolutely no chance of taking a photograph with

318
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,415
I've been there

319
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,207
For the first time in my life

320
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,487
The 1970s

321
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:50,047
I went to desl on whenever

322
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:54,655
Took off my camera somebody came up and said no you can't photograph here because

323
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,191
The Bauhaus building

324
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:58,751
Set that time was surrounded by Soviet

325
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,031
Military building

326
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:03,359
Photography was banned at the Bauhaus campus and Dessau

327
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,407
From 1950 until 1980

328
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,967
And then later after reunification

329
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,503
The buildings were altered

330
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,271
Slightly

331
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:12,063
I'm so to this day

332
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,855
Scholars like Robin Schulz and Fry

333
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:18,463
Say that Lucy is photographs are the best representation we have of the Bell House

334
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:20,767
In a way it's like those photos

335
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,047
AR

336
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:22,815
About house

337
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:25,631
And so even the slides that I myself was

338
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,167
Thought about the Bob house

339
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,447
In the 19

340
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,727
Mid 1990s

341
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,519
Many of them are still these

342
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:34,079
Black and white images because they are such good

343
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,383
Quality after years of legal disputes

344
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,735
Lucia moholy finally succeeded in getting nearly 300 of her negative

345
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,271
But it was

346
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,551
Innocence too late

347
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,599
For her and so

348
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,391
I think that part of

349
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:49,183
This story is unfortunate

350
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:52,511
Lucia moholy died in 1989

351
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:55,583
Turn negatives went to the Bauhaus archive in Berlin

352
00:13:56,095 --> 00:14:02,239
It is from Lucy has photos that Architects and designers Drew inspiration to rebuild the postwar world

353
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:05,567
People who rebuilt Europe Drew on the ideas

354
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,335
Of the Bauhaus

355
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:10,175
They look to its modern rectilinear asymmetric architect

356
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,199
As a counter

357
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:11,967
To the building

358
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:12,735
What's the Nazis

359
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,551
Fascism head use this kind of new class

360
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:16,575
Aesthetic

361
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:20,415
Court houses that were built in the postwar period In America post office

362
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,463
These buildings were all built in the modern style

363
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,255
And this is where

364
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,303
The modern-style does finally take off

365
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:29,119
Our modern world owes a debt to the Bauhaus

366
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,935
And the house was it that to Lucia moholy

367
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,983
Whether anyone knows her name or not

368
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,519
But we should know it

369
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:37,823
Today

370
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,151
About 90 Prince of Lucia moholy Bauhaus

371
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,967
Rafi are housed at the busch-reisinger museum at Harvard

372
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,271
They were donated by Walter gropius

373
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,807
And are considered part of his art

374
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:52,415
The museum has overtime actually been going through this archive

375

Umbrella Omar says if there's a revolving door and you use the one next to it isn't evolving then you're a monster

Weird backdoor pilot

423
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:14,495

428
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:45,471

431
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:59,039
Marketplace

432
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:02,879
Hello everybody Welcome to Smart stuff

433
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,415
I am your host

434
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,695
Justin McElroy

435
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:10,815
I joined it's always stay by Roman Mars what smart thing we discussing today

436
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:16,703
Well this week I was excited to learn why there are so many time races in swimming so in the real games

437
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:23,103
Last week there were three second place finishers at the exact same time in the men's 100-meter butterfly

438
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:26,943
The most Olympic events are measured in thousands of a second

439
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,223
3 units by the Dozen

440
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:31,295
But swimming is only measured in the hundredths of a

441
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:37,951
And the reason is because of the pool itself it's virtually impossible to construct a swimming pool with lanes that are eggs

442
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:42,047
Exactly equal International Swimming regulations allow for a variability

443
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:44,095
About to 3 centimeters in length

444
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:44,863
Breeze Lane

445
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:49,471
This is enough of a difference if you can't guarantee that a swimmer is thousands of a second

446
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:51,263
Or that the lane is

447
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:56,895
Just like a centimeter short so they drop that third digit to the right of the decimal point in only measure

448
00:18:57,151 --> 00:19:00,735
In the hundredths of a second only measure in hundredths of a second

449
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,527
Leavenworth High races

450
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,831
LML

451
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:11,231
Well folks that's all we have time for a smart stuff today

452
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,887
If someone can get Roman Mars

453
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:23,519
Cut out this bit of the podcast and actually try and fill in the blanks there that would be stellar

454
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:29,407
My brother my brother and me between the McElroy Brothers coming hard on the maximum fun Network

455
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,367
Between the beats

456
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:40,671
Bongs and Charter of our devices

457
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:44,255
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

458
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,279
If

459
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:49,887
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexis

460
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:55,775
Talking to me and my wife is in another room in a kid is another hearing that voice

461
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,567
Technology talk to us

462
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,615
It is a creation of Sonic trash

463
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:02,687
That's Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

464
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:06,271
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

465
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:08,319
To make them more human

466
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,159
Turn the living room lights on

467
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:13,951
Okay

468
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,999
Dim the living room lights to 50

469
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:16,767
2%

470
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:18,559
Okay

471
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:24,959
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

472
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:27,007
Makes for a much more natural

473
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:27,775
Experience

474
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,823
Turn the living room lights on

475
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,895
Dim the living room lights

476
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:33,919
