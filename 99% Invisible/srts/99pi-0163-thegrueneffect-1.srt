I'm Roman Mars

27
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:12,704
We've all done it

28
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:16,800
You go to the store for a pair of socks and come out with a mega pack of soda

29
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:20,640
Go out to get shampoo and come back with a fancy razor

30
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:22,944
It's hard to stick to what's on your list

31
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:24,736
I challenge you to go to IKEA

Just try to buy a lamp without buying a cutting board it can't be done

34
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:36,512
You absolutely knew this but retail spaces are designed to do this to you

35
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,816
Producer Avery trufelman

36
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:42,144
The store is trying to look so beautiful

37
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,168
So welcoming

38
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:47,008
The items so enticingly displayed in such vast quantity

39
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,288
That you cannot help

40
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,312
Be drawn in

41
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,872
And then drawn towards something you don't need

42
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,176
This is the Gruen effect

43
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,968
The Gruen effect

44
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:58,272
Or sometimes called the Gruen transfer

45
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:03,904
If that moment when you walk into a store and the design of the store is so overwhelming and

46
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,928
Dazzling

47
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,232
That you being mindlessly consuming

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,560
The Gruen effect is named after Victor Gruen

49
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:11,584
The who was growing

50
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,168
He's a complicated complex contradictory guy

51
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:17,984
Jeff Hardwick wrote the biography of Victor Gruen

52
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,056
Who is born Victor grunbaum born in Vienna

53
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,848
In 1904

54
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:27,200
And he is Jewish in Vienna leaves

55
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:29,248
1038 good call Groupon

56
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:31,040
And makes his way eventually

57
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,064
2

58
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,088
New York City

59
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:37,952
Once a New York grew and made a name for himself designing shops and Retail spaces

60
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:41,792
And this was a particular challenge during the lean years of the late 30s

61
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:44,096
People had no money

62
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:46,912
I just wouldn't go into shops at all

63
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:49,728
Accruent figured out how to lower people inside

64
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:53,824
Basically by using amazingly appealing window displays

65
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:57,152
Go into these window

66
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,944
Display area

67
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,480
Look at

68
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:01,760
Jewelry

69
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,296
Handbag

70
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:04,832
Chocolate

71
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,368
And then you die

72
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,136
Tempted

73
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:07,904
Lured into

74
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,208
The store I mean that's the Gruen effect

75
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:13,280
Gruen argued that good design equals good profit

76
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,560
And he

77
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:15,584
Equate though

78
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:16,864
Wonder Woman

79
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,912
You do more

80
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,448
People are going to stay there longer

81
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,216
And spend more money

82
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:27,616
Bruins started making storefront all over the country and he moved from New York to Los Angeles in 1940

83
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:30,688
Gruen was from the beautiful city of Vienna

84
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:34,272
Which is lined with shops and Greenery and places together

85
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:38,624
Most Americans were just riding around in their cars all the time

86
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,672
Cut off from the city in from each other

87
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,464
He knew this problem was

88
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,232
Even worse

89
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,256
In the suburbs

90
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,864
The sub herb black what sociologist Ray Oldenburg calls

91
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,888
Food places

92
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,448
I think of home as a primary place

93
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,984
Work as your second place

94
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:58,080
And that third place is where you go to build communities hang out

95
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,128
To Simply feel connected

96
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:02,688
Gruen wanted to give the American suburbs

97
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,224
Third place

98
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:09,088
Image of living conclusive communication with other people

99
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,624
Image of

100
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:14,208
Heading see possibility from work to one place to another

101
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:17,791
That's archival footage of Ruin from the University of Wyoming

102
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:22,655
See image of participating in events outside of your own little house

103
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,959
Become a desired effect

104
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:28,543
Victor Gruen imagine designing an environment

105
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,079
Full of greenery in shops

106
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,615
An indoor Plaza

107
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,151
A modern for him

108
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:35,967
Island of connection in the middle of the sprawl

109
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:38,783
One that would only be accessible to pedestrian

110
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,319
Because

111
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:43,903
Old man Victor Gruen hated cars

112
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,439
He Rants and Raves

113
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,719
Against cars

114
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:53,887
One technological event has one that is advent of sale rubber wheeled vehicle to private

115
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,679
Car photography playlist

116
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:58,495
As means of mass transportation

117
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:03,615
The human life intense is Justice great

118
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,151
Effect of exposure

119
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:11,039
It's hard understanding with the tape hiss in the accent but what Gruen is saying there is

120
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:15,647
The threat of cars that human life and health is as great as the

121
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,415
Supposed

122
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,183
Sewer

123
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:22,815
So gruhn's objective was to get people to park their cars far away from these third places

124
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:23,839
And walk

125
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,375
Troll with in them

126
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,655
Has grew inside

127
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:29,471
His structure would be an architectural Panacea

128
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,519
It would remedy Environmental

129
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,823
Commercial and sociological problems

130
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,847
With the creation

131
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,127
I'm a single building

132
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,247
And so Gruen presented his solution for America

133
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:42,783
The shopping mall

134
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:48,159
Good actually wanted the shopping mall to be more than just shops

135
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,719
You want some be mixed-use he want

136
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,255
Apartments

137
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:56,863
Send offices or medical centers attached to the shopping center he

138
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,143
Cases that have

139
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,959
Childcare facilities Library

140
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:02,239
Bomb shelters

141
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,287
A whole range of

142
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,311
Different

143
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,079
Function

144
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:11,199
Ingrown dreamed and wrote about the enclosed shopping center way before he ever built one

145
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:15,295
Until he finally land the commission for the very first

146
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:18,367
Indoor climate controlled Shopping Center

147
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:23,487
In Edina Minnesota a place not known for its welcoming climate

148
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:27,583
Southdale represents an entirely new and dramatic

149
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,119
Didn't retail merchandising

150
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:33,215
Southdale Center opened in 1956

151
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,519
And it was the mother of all shopping malls

152
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:36,543
Seriously

153
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:41,663
Gruen subsequent malls were all mostly based off this original Edina design

154
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,943
When he's doing

155
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,247
The first enclosed shopping mall

156
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,015
Southdale

157
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,551
In Edina Minnesota

158
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,855
Gruen really emphasized

159
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,647
And with the media ends up

160
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:52,671
Celebrating

161
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:53,951
Is this massive

162
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:54,975
Center Court

163
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,279
This court is in close in sky like a

164
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,815
Store

165
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,607
Photoshopping cyborg

166
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,935
In fact the whole area in front of the stores

167
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:09,311
Is air conditioned and temperature control a year-round climate of 72 degrees

168
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,591
4 Gruen

169
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,615
He's creating a

170
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:12,895
A Town Square

171
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:15,711
Southdale Center wasn't quite mixed-use

172
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,991
Migraine imagine

173
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,271
People didn't live in it

174
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,575
And something like a daycare center or Apple

175
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,367
Post office couldn't afford that rent

176
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,671
What Southdale did have local shops

177
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,439
Sival kind

178
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,463
And plenty

179
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,255
Southdale

180
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,047
Tomorrow's Main Street

181
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,071
Today

182
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,631
But from the outside

183
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,935
Southdale Center is not much to look at

184
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,471
I mean it looks like a mall

185
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:40,287
Ominous Amorphis boxy shape

186
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,823
In designing a shopping mall

187
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:45,663
Gruen ended his Razzle Dazzle storefronts and window displays

188
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,199
Southdale hardly has a

189
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:52,063
Exterior windows at all the moves away from the original concept that in some ways they're going to

190
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:52,831
Attract

191
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,111
By being Austin

192
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,439
The drawn now is what's inside the mall

193
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:00,511
Congruence mind it should have

194
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:04,095
Pretty much of a blank facade no signage on it

195
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,143
And then you enter that

196
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:09,727
Space and then you walk into the shopping center and that's that

197
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:16,127
Set of transformational Gruen transfer moment muldaur designed as the sort of suburban pilgrimage sites

198
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,151
Which of course

199
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,687
You have to drive to

200
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,223
It's a commitment

201
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,271
You're driving 20-30 minutes

202
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:25,087
You're parking your getting out of your car your walking in

203
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,135
Good new that Americans love to drive

204
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,927
To the mall with his compromise

205
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,999
You had to walk and stroll once you're inside

206
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:34,047
But the customers could drive over

207
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,583
So he just hates

208
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,399
The automobile but he never will acknowledge

209
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:41,983
That he's creating the shopping centres which are

210
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,775
Largely

211
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,079
Only accessible through car

212
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,895
Was Ryan

213
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:50,687
Americans loved

214
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:55,039
Driving to his Smalls he got commissions for them all over the country

215
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,575
But over time

216
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,879
Truancies that in erecting these malls

217
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,415
Is Tiny Suburban cities

218
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:03,231
Is helping to drain the real City

219
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,535
So for a while

220
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,327
Current shifts his Focus

221
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,863
Urban planning

222
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,143
B12

223
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:10,911
Qrcp

224
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,959
Which because we have neglected

225
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:20,383
It's a Gruen ends up being involved in urban renewal project

226
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,151
I swear

227
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,199
He draws directly on

228
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,991
The Lessons Learned in his

229
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,783
Suburban shopping malls and

230
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,319
Proposes bringing him back down

231
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:33,695
Municipality Tire Gruen and Associates to make their downtown's more like malls

232
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,743
Gruen turn City centers into

233
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,279
Pedestrian-only spaces

234
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,815
Full of public art

235
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,095
And Greenery and line

236
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:40,863
Wood shops

237
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,399
He made plans for Boulder

238
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,959
Fresno Fort Worth Kalamazoo

239
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:45,983
Actually

240
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:49,823
His plan for Kalamazoo became the first outdoor pedestrian shopping mall

241
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:56,223
Open the u.s. to turn Fifth Avenue into a pedestrian Mall

242
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:59,039
Close down 5th Avenue for a couple weeks as a test

243
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:01,855
What is City's downtown is not a mall

244
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:08,255
Not so easily quote-unquote fixed not so perfectly designed and controlled cities were

245
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,791
We're going to become the Pleasant

246
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:13,119
Sterile shopping environments That Grew and wanted them to be

247
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,911
After

248
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:21,823
The Riots of the 60s he is shocked into the taken aback by those and it was

249
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,591
It's very much

250
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:29,247
And I think that may have been somewhat of his reason for the retreat to Vienna

251
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:35,903
In 1968 Gruen from Los Angeles back to Vienna back to the greenery and Plaza

252
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,695
I've been trying to imitate

253
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:40,767
But he could not Escape his own creation

254
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:43,839
There's a shopping mall that's being built on the edge of Vienna

255
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,887
And he points to that

256
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,447
As how that shopping malls destroyed

257
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:49,983
Downtown Vienna

258
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:53,823
Congruent mind Vienna was already perfectly planned

259
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:57,407
It didn't need a mall like the broken American suburbs did

260
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,943
As he saw it

261
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:05,087
His original Vision had been completely skewed after being in Vienna about 10 years

262
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,111
He gives

263
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:06,879
The speech in

264
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,439
Paper where he says

265
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,231
I refuse to pay alimony

266
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,255
Is bastard

267
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,071
Victor Gruen the mall maker

268
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,375
Became the foremost Mall critic

269
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:21,215
Meanwhile America's love affair with Mall's continued

270
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:27,615
Do you want to catch them all pretty girl like you doing sitting alone in the middle of this Monument to consumerism

271
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:32,479
I know I remember in my own experience

272
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:38,879
Growing up in New Jersey when the first Mall opened anywhere near me when I was in high school this is Ellen Dunham

273
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:44,767
Jim Jones she's a professor of architecture and Urban Design at Georgia Tech it was cool to go to the mall

274
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:47,583
But I mean literally it was air condition

275
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,167
My home wasn't air-conditioned my school wasn't there conditions

276
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:55,007
Today most of us are

277
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,127
Spending our days and our nights in completely thermally controlled environments

278
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,687
A lot of us are craving

279
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,735
Being able to

280
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,271
Be outdoors

281
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:12,671
In recent decades our tastes have beard away from climate controlled environments and away from the indoor mall

282
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:17,791
Small construction actually peaked in 1990 it's been declining ever since

283
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:18,815
And

284
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,631
By 2006 those really the last

285
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,911
Brand new

286
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,959
A standard conventional Mall

287
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,239
That's been dealt in the US

288
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,799
And a new product has entered the scene

289
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:34,175
I kind of shopping center that the icsc the international Council of shopping centers

290
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,967
Called a lifestyle

291
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:39,039
Lifestyle centers started appearing

292
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,319
In the 90s

293
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,111
And they

294
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:44,671
Tend to be open air

295
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:47,231
So when you don't have that roof anymore

296
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:52,351
But you have a lot of boutiques and a lot more restaurants

297
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:55,679
Lifestyle centers are malls disguised as main streets

298
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,727
And even though they're full of chain stores

299
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:01,311
Lifestyle centers are sunny and walkable and bustling

300
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,359
And kind of what Victor Gruen imagine

301
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:06,687
And some of the old style indoor shopping malls

302
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,711
Are being repaired

303
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:10,271
Several of them are being

304
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,063
Retrofitted

305
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:15,391
Into the Hispanic community centers

306
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,671
Like in Plaza Fiesta

307
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:17,695
Outside of Atlanta

308
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:23,839
A lot of the stores have been cut up into much smaller mom-and-pop

309
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:30,239
Small shops selling Western Wear selling quinceanera dresses Plaza Fiesta also has a steady

310
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,263
The events calendar

311
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,287
Performances

312
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:39,711
In this two was kind of what growing imagined

313
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:44,063
We sort of community malls are truly places together and spend money

314
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:46,367
In the Shell of the failed design

315
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,671
Most people architectural historian

316
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,439
Especially

317
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,487
Hickory when was a horrible Act

318
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,279
And you know

319
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,327
I I can see where they're coming

320
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,887
Because exteriors of his building

321
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:59,679
Are uniformly boring

322
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:02,751
It's a grueling that wasn't the point it was the interior

323
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,031
We're really the point

324
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:06,591
Does fountains the cheesy statues

325
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:09,407
Elevator music piped in through all those speakers

326
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,455
Those are all part of the Gruen effect

327
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:17,599
And they helped turn shopping malls into spaces where we felt comfortable staying and spending time and money

328
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:21,183
A lot of the original indoor malls are abandoned now

329
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,743
Growing weeds inside

330
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:28,863
If your website this becomes a graveyard of dead malls called deadmalls.com

331
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:32,703
Users can log on to submit stories of the Dead malls in their towns

332
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:37,823
There are around 450 malls listed are submitted as sort of oral history

333
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,103
In particular what

334
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:41,663
Interesting I think about deadmalls.com is

335
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,943
How to spell check

336
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,527
A lot of fishes and it does make sense

337
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:53,439
So many Suburban communities became the de facto Town Center it was really the center

338
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:55,743
Sure of social life other than the school

339
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,303
I would be very sad if all the

340
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:01,375
Victor Gruen Smalls were demolished we should certainly

341
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,655
Work to preserve

342
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,447
At least one

343
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:12,895
The most famous Mall in Minnesota maybe the Mall of America with its roller coaster at zipline at the

344
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,431
Aquarion water park

345
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:18,015
The most architecturally significant law its grandfather

346
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:21,343
Is it one that's just a 12 minute drive away

347
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,367
In Edina

348
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:35,423
Jeff Hardwick book is called Mall maker Victor Gruen architect of an American Dream

349
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:38,751
An Ellen dunham-jones book is called retrofitting Suburbia

350
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,287

Oakland California

355
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,143
Between the beats

356
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,447
Bongs and chatter of our devices

357
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:12,031
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man made sound

358
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,055
If

359
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:19,455
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife is

360
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:23,295
Another word for all hearing.

361
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,319
Technology

362
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,087
He talked to us

363
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,391
It is a creation of Sonic trash

364
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,463
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

365
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:33,791
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

366
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,839
To make them more human

367
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,935
Turn the living room lights on

368
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:41,727
Okay

369
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,775
Dim the living room lights to 50

370
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:44,543
