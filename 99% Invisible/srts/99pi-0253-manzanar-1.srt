This is 99% invisible

18
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,864
I'm Roman Mars

19
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:14,240
When were in for a tiny was going up in Los Angeles in the 1950s

20
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:17,824
He sometimes heard his parents refer to a place they once spent time

21
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,104
Place

22
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,128
They called

23
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:20,896
Camp

24
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:24,736
You know Camp reference for me what summer camp for the Y Camp

25
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:27,808
So what is this camping they keep talking about

26
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:32,160
The fact that it's brought up here and there but not elaborated on

27
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:34,976
You can't help but wonder if there must

28
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:36,512
Be much more to the story

29
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:40,608
Warren was right there was a lot more to the story

30
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:42,144
Producer Emmett Fitzgerald

31
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:47,520
During World War II the US government incarcerated Warren furutani parent

32
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:51,360
Along with over a hundred and ten thousand other Japanese Amer

33
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,152
Remote Detention Center

34
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:54,944
When they talked about

35
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,712
Camp

36
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,992
That's what they meant

37
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:02,624
In college in the 1960s Warren got involved in the civil rights movement and the Asian American movement

38
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,976
And as he got more politically active he started the research his people's history

39
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:12,352
He wanted to find out what happened to his parents and other Japanese Americans during the war

40
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,984
One day he was at a Vietnam war protest with his friend Victor shibata

41
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,872
And they started talking about how they wanted to organize a March for the Asian American community

42
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:26,176
But they didn't know where to go

43
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,480
And Victor and I support

44
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,504
This is Cam

45
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,320
But our parents were what what are these camps

46
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:35,648
We started talking to some people

47
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,744
About this place called Manson I what's the closest Camp to Los Angeles

48
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:43,072
It was a damn it we better just go up there

49
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,096
And just fine

50
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,656
It wasn't going to be easy to find

51
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:50,240
After World War II manzanar had been completely dismantled

52
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:53,568
By 1969 there were hardly any signs of it left

53
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:00,224
Warren injectors but with some people from their parents generation and learn at the camp had been located a few miles past the town

54
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,248
Town of Lone Pine

55
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,784
Off Route 395

56
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,112
And then a big green Auditorium building but still standing

57
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:09,184
Being used by the highway department store machinery

58
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,584
And sew on a clear fall day the two men hopped in Victor shibata old Triumph convertible and when

59
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,632
Looking for this place called manzanar

60
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,704
They drove North out of La about 4 hours

61
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,496
For the Sierra Nevada mountains

62
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:25,312
And ended up in a High Desert Valley

63
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,848
It was totally deaf

64
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:31,200
But a few miles outside of Lone Pine they found the Green Building

65
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,528
And they turned off the highway onto a small dirt road

66
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,808
Tumbleweeds

67
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,600
No trees

68
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,904
Lot of underbrush

69
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,208
In the background

70
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,256
What's the Sierra Nevada mountains

71
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:47,328
Covered in snow it was a traumatic

72
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,120
A landscape as you could imagine

73
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:52,960
The two men continued driving to the desert and then suddenly

74
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:55,520
They came across an old white pillar

75
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,056
With Japanese lettering on it

76
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,848
Just was funny

77
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:01,408
Like it was waiting there to be discovered

78
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:06,272
It was the original pillar marking the manzanar cemetery

79
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:09,088
And it was surrounded by faded gravestone

80
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:11,136
People who had died while in the can

81
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,696
As they explored the area further

82
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:18,559
Warren and Victor eventually came across a big pile of debris

83
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:23,167
And we found all of these broken dishes and on the back of the dish

84
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,959
Said Army

85
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,495
Dinnerware with dates

86
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:30,591
Indifferent things we found it was like an archaeological dig

87
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,127
And reveal

88
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,943
Historical reality kafka

89
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:43,135
The two young man that found the remains of a camp in only a few decades earlier had imprisoned over 10,000 Japanese

90
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:43,903
These Americans

91
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:50,303
And in the process they were helping uncover a dark chapter in US history that a lot of people at the time would have run

92
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,071
Rather forgotten

93
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,911
The incarceration of Japanese-Americans during World War II

94
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:59,007
Wasn't even mentioned in most high school history textbooks in the 60s

95
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:01,055
There was no books don't stories

96
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:05,407
No information can find it in the card catalog in the library

97
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,455
So we started writing our own history

98
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:13,599
And part of writing that history meant drawing attention to manzanar itself

99
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,647
When Warren and Victor found it

100
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:19,999
The place had no historical designation no sign and no plaque

101
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,559
But that was all about to change

102
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:31,519
Warren and Victor go back to Los Angeles but they knew they wanted to come back and bring more people with them next

103
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,591
And there's a thing in Japanese call hockemeyer

104
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:37,919
Will you have a pilgrimage back to important place

105
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:41,759
And sew on a December morning in 1969

106
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,551
Over a hundred and fifty people

107
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:46,623
Piled into cars and vans and buses

108
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,671
On a pilgrimage to manzanar

109
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:52,511
Going to that part of California

110
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,071
At that time of year was just stupid

111
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:56,607
Cole

112
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,399
It was so cold

113
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:03,007
But the Shivering pilgrims followed Warren and Victor's directions to the cemetery

114
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:08,639
So we cleaned up the cemetery and we brought paint and then wire brushes and

115
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:12,223
Scraped everything down and repainted The Monuments

116
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:14,783
We did a lot of work

117
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:17,343
In terms of refurbishing the area

118
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,879
We knew we were coming back

119
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:23,231
Most of the people on the pilgrimage were younger Japanese-American

120
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:25,023
We never spend time at camp

121
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,351
But there were a few people there that day

122
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,143
Do it actually lived at manzanar

123
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:33,727
One of them was Sue kunitomi Embrey

124
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,495
Los Angeles

125
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:40,895
The story of how she ended up in this desolate Valley begins in 1941

126
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,223
Fire was saw 18

127
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,551
I have finished high school in January

128
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,343
And I was helping my mother

129
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,951
Take care of a small grocery store with she had purchased the Delta Air before

130
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:57,023
Sue Embry died in 2006

131
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:02,399
This audio is from an interview she did with densho the Japanese American Legacy project

132
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,935
Back in 2002

133
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:09,567
And I noticed that came to our neighborhood was dated May 3rd and we have to move on May 9th

134
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,359
Which country had about five days

135
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:16,223
5 days to pack up all their belongings and report to manzanar

136
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:24,415
The camp was one of 10 set up by the US government to imprison Japanese-Americans during World War II

137
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,463
Following the bombing of Pearl Harbor

138
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:30,303
Anti-japanese racism reached a fever pitch in the United States

139
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:36,703
Military leaders repeatedly question the Loyalty of all people of Japanese descent without evidence and then

140
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:41,823
In 1942 President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066

141
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:47,455
Paving the way for the incarceration of thousands of Japanese-Americans on the West Coast

142
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:51,295
Here's a clip from the 40s propaganda film justifying the decision

143
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:55,647
When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor

144
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:58,975
Are West Coast became a potential combat zone

145
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:03,327
More than a hundred thousand persons of Japanese ancestry

146
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,375
Two-thirds of American citizens

147
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,167
One-third aliens

148
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:13,567
We know that some of potentially dangerous

149
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:19,455
Most families had to sell property quickly

150
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,759
Often at a fraction of its value

151
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:25,343
Some rented out their homes or left them with friends

152
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,415
But others abandon them all together

153
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,719
On May 9th Sue's family

154
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:35,071
Her widowed mother and her six brothers and sisters all went to the train station

155
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:38,655
They were told that they could only bring what they could carry with them

156
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:44,543
We all kept thinking we're American citizens and they're doing this to us and we have no rights nobody to

157
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,079
Speak up for us

158
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:50,431
They arrived at manzanar in the dark

159
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:53,247
And found their way to their assigned barracks

160
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:58,111
The camp was divided into 36 residential blocks each with 14 barracks

161
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,135
To which means

162
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,159
In a mess hall

163
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:04,255
Families were usually allowed to sleep together

164
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,303
All kind of cars

165
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:10,143
Known partitions of any kind we all slept in one big room

166
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:16,031
In total there were 800 buildings and over 10000 people packed into one square mile

167
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,335
One of the hardest parts of life at camp

168
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,383
Was the total lack of privacy

169
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:23,711
The latrines were completely open and exposed

170
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:27,807
With no stalls or dividers between the showers or toilets

171
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,087
Thunder beginning

172
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:31,647
People like my mother with stay up late

173
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,183
Hoping to take a shower

174
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:39,583
Well where our neighbors went to wrong but they all stayed up late Hotel wanted to take the shower and privacy

175
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:46,239
A 5 strand barbed wire fence encircled the entire camp

176
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,775
Petite guard Tower

177
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,055
Around the perimeter

178
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,615
Each guard Tower at a Searchlight

179
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,663
And a soldier with a machine gun

180
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,943
I remember

181
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:55,711
Going

182
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,759
All one day one night

183
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,319
Searchmont follow me all the way to the lake train

184
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:03,391
And I think everyone remembers those searchlights

185
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:07,487
Manzanar with undoubtedly a prison

186
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:12,095
With the people inside did everything they could to turn it into a livable City

187
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,631
They had schools

188
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,911
Churches in plugs

189
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:17,215
Baseball fields in basketball court

190
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,263
Courts people built Rock Garden

191
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:24,639
And planted flowers and vegetables

192
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,663
And I think it

193
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:28,223
Whittier Health the morale of the people

194
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,319
The camp also had its own newspaper

195
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:35,135
Ironically called The manzanar Free Press

196
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,951
Pursue Embry worked as a reporter and editor

197
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:41,023
Manzanar operated through the end of the war

198
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:44,095
During that time there were several legal challenge

199
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,119
Acoustic amps

200
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:50,495
But each time the courts upheld the constitutionality of Japanese American incarceration

201
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:57,407
On November 21st 1945 a few months after the US bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki and nearly four

202
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,455
4 years after the camp at first opened

203
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,735
The government closed

204
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,015
Manzanar for good

205
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,551
And dismantled the camp

206
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:06,111
Families were forced to move once again

207
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,671
People who can afford to leave on their own

208
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:11,231
We're giving a bus ticket in $25

209
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,791
Often they didn't have a home to go back

210
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:20,703
When Sue embry's parents return to Los Angeles they found that their old grocery store and house had been

211
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,471
Demolished

212
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,543
After sukuna told me Embry left camp

213
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:28,639
She moved to the Midwest for a little while but ultimately ended up back in Los Angeles

214
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:34,271
But it bothered her how little people talked about what Japanese Americans had been through during the war

215
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:38,367
So when she heard about a bunch of young college students making a pilgrimage to manzanar

216
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,903
She decided to join them

217
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:46,047
Which brings us back to that winter day in 1969

218
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:50,399
Went around 150 people travelled to manzanar to draw attention

219
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,679
To what happened there

220
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,471
The media showed up

221
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,007
At this pilgrimage

222
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,543
In December

223
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,335
Wind howling very cold

224
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,871
That's Bruce Embry

225
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,639
Suisun

226
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:01,663
He says

227
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:05,247
His mom and another person who had also been imprisoned at manzanar

228
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:09,087
Began telling reporters what life had been like there during the war

229
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,391
And it caused an uproar

230
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:14,463
I mean people were just completely

231
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,255
A cast

232
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:17,535
That

233
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,071
Anyone would speak

234
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,887
To the broader public

235
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,703
Outside the confines of the Japanese American community

236
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,983
About what happened

237
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,799
The older generation they were mad

238
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,591
Again Warren furutani

239
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,871
Who helped organize the poker

240
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,919
Why are you bringing this up

241
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:37,503
It's better left forgotten you know it's

242
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:40,319
The hatchets been buried leave it buried

243
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,903
But these activists were just getting started

244
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,439
Especially Sue Embry

245
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:47,231
I think the pilgrimage

246
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,279
Made her understand

247
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,351
How important the site was

248
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:53,887
2

249
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:54,655
The community

250
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:57,983
And I think in particular how

251
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,031
The community itself

252
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,847
Had to come to grips with what happen

253
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:11,551
Following the 1969 pilgrimage Sue Embry Warren for a Tony and others formed the manzanar committee

254
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:16,159
With the specific goal of getting the site recognized as a Historic Landmark

255
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:19,487
We felt that we needed Society to acknowledge

256
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:20,767
This fact

257
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,327
Knott's let it be buried

258
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,167
In the back pages are in a simple paragraph in the history book

259
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:32,287
They lobbied hard for 3 years all the while continuing yearly pilgrimages to the side

260
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:36,895
In 1972 the state of California designated manzanar a state landmark

261
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:39,199
And agreed to install a bronze plaque

262
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:43,551
It was one of the first public acknowledgment of what happened there during the war

263
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,087
So the warden of the plaque

264
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,647
Became a huge issue

265
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:51,231
Particularly the question of what to call Mandarin

266
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,535
Was it a concentration camp

267
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,815
An internment camp

268
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,607
A relocation Center

269
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,399
Is it still contentious today

270
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:03,519
Some people don't like the term concentration camp because it's associated with a Nazi Genocide

271
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:04,543
Then again

272
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,823
Internment camp

273
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,359
Feels like a euphemism

274
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:10,943
Don't let my mother-in-law I hear someone call it internment camp

275
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:12,735
And Jesus

276
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,527
93 year old

277
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,063
White haired

278
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:16,831
Petite

279
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,367
Dynamo Shield

280
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,391
Kick your ass

281
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:26,047
In the end after a few fiery meetings the manzanar committee convinced the state

282
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,839
The plaque should read as follows

283
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:30,143
In the early part of World War II

284
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:36,543
110000 persons of Japanese ancestry were interned in relocation centers by executive

285
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,591
Order 9066

286
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:45,247
Manzanar the first attend such concentration camps was bounded by barbed wire and guard towers

287
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,295
Confining 10000 persons

288
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,855
The majority of which being American citizen

289
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:56,255
Maybe in justices and humiliation suffered here as a result of Hysteria of racism

290
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,047
And economic exploitation

291
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,839
Never emerge again

292
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,655
California registered historical landmark

293
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,679
Number 850

294
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:09,311
1500 people attended the 1973 pilgrim

295
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,591
To watch the plaque

296
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,615
Get installed

297
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:16,479
But it didn't go over too well with some folks who lived in nearby towns

298
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,527
Within weeks

299
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,319
They've shot it below

300
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,855
Shotgun pellets

301
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,903
Someone Took an Ax to it to try and

302
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,183
Chisel off

303
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,975
The word racism

304
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:30,303
You can still see the bullet holes on the black today

305
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:35,679
But Sue Embry in the manzanar committee or undeterred

306
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,983
The fact they were already thinking bigger

307
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:41,567
They wanted manzanar to be a National Historic Site

308
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,407
It's important to know that all this was a crying alongside a larger

309
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,455
Find for redress and reparations

310
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:54,111
Several Japanese American organizations had demanded an official apology from the US government and payments for the

311
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,415
Those who have been incarcerated during the war

312
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,207
And in 1988

313
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:00,767
President Reagan signed the civil liberties Act

314
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:06,143
Getting $20,000 in reparations to every living person who had been sent to a camp

315
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,679
Piano payment

316
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,983
Can make up for those Lost Years

317
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:14,591
So what is most important in this bill has less to do with property than With Honor

318
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,151
Or here we admit a wrong

319
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:21,503
Here we reaffirm our commitment as a nation to equal justice

320
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,527
Under the law

321
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:31,999
Sue embree was very involved in the redress movement and she wanted to keep the momentum going in the fight to get manzanar turned

322
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,791
Into a National Historic Site

323
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:39,423
But the manzanar committee face stiff opposition from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power

324
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,983
The DWP actually own the land

325
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,519
And the rights to its water

326
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:46,591
So here comes the middle-aged woman

327
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:52,991
Saying know this land is really significant to us our community and to

328
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,295
The region is south

329
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,343
And we won

330
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:01,695
It to be a national park while the DWP didn't want to have any part of that

331
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:05,535
The manzanar committee ended up drafting legislation for Congress

332
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:11,935
And Sue Embraer flew to Washington DC to testify before the US Senate subcommittee on public lands National Park

333
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:12,703
In forest

334
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,519
She says democracy is a fragile concept

335
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:19,359
Only as good and strong as the people who practice it

336
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,175
Let us tell the world that we are a

337
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:22,943
People

338
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,735
Strong

339
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,295
And resolute

340
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,647
Acknowledging the errors of our past

341
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,207
In order not to

342
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,743
Repeat them in the future

343
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:40,095
And this is the Legacy which we believe the master instructs site

344
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,399
Can leave for future Generations

345
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,703
The legislation passed

346
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:46,239
And on March 3rd

347
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,519
1992

348
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,847
Manzanar was declared a National Historic Site

349
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:54,175
But apart from the cemetery there was hardly anything there

350
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:59,039
The National Park Service had to decide how they wanted to memorialize this Injustice

351
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:03,135
They formed a committee that included people who have been incarcerated at manzanar

352
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:09,279
And the committee decided that they didn't just want to museum where visitors could read about what happened on placards

353
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,351
They wanted to rebuild portions of the camp

354
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:14,655
Exactly as it had been during the war

355
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:17,983
So that visitors could feel what life had been like

356
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,031
C-walk in it's a

357
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:25,151
Empty room although we have a cot in the stack of army blankets and a stack of mattress covers

358
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:27,455
The bunch of cots up against the wall

359
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:31,295
This is Alyssa Lynch of the manzanar National Historic Site

360
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:33,087
Showing me a rebuilt bearing

361
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,903
She says they tried hard to get it right

362
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:39,487
But it's still not as harsh as it would have been when people arrive to

363
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,279
You're back in 1942

364
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:43,839
Give me the should be dirt blowing up to the floor

365
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,631
The building should be creaking

366
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:48,703
The thing is we have the option of either

367
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,239
Don't make a mess they were

368
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,055
But not allowing people to walk in

369
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:56,127
Because they wouldn't be safe for people to come into

370
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:58,431
Or we could rebuild them

371
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:02,015
2 earthquake standards accessibility standards

372
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,807
And that's what we chose to do

373
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,647
Outside there's a dirt basketball court

374
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:12,511
With white metal hoops and a one-way Road tracing a long and winding circuit

375
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,535
Through what used to be the

376
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,303
The camp

377
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:18,143
Signposts along the way show where specific buildings once stood

378
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:24,799
In some places cracked concrete foundations and the remains of Rock Gardens are still visible or have been

379
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:25,567
Earth

380
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:28,895
In the distance you can see a rebuilt guardtower

381
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,431
Is 40 ft tall

382
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:33,503
With lattice wood sides and a giant Searchlight at the

383
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:36,063
The top it was very controversial

384
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:39,391
Because a lot of the locals especially

385
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:42,207
Did not want it to have a guard Tower because

386
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:46,303
People don't want it to reflect badly on the community

387
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:50,911
The park service continue to seek guidance from folks who would actually lived at the camp

388
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:57,567
Overtime people have said over and over the most important thing to show by the guard towers and the latrines

389
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:00,383
I've had people literally say you know

390
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,431
We're glad you have the visitor center

391
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,479
We really like to have the barracks

392
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:06,783
But no one will ever understand

393
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:09,087
Until they go in and see that row a toilet

394
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:12,927
Alyssa Lynch takes me to the site's newest edition

395
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:15,231
A replica of a woman's latrine

396
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:20,351
The building wasn't open to the public when I visited but she showed me inside

397
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,143
It's just an open room

398
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,447
Does a long trough sink

399
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:26,239
And a row of five toilet

400
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:27,519
With no dividers

401
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:28,287
Between them

402
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:31,103
You hear over and over about the humiliation

403
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,151
You know I've heard women talk about

404
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,455
Having your first period in public

405
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:40,319
You know which I think is a very personal thing to all people all women

406
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,111
And

407
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:44,159
There's no privacy here

408
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:48,511
Lynch has spoken with hundreds of people who lived at manzanar

409
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:50,815
And they all have different perspective

410
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,095
It's on their time at camp

411
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,679
Some people fondly remember the friendships they built here

412
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:59,775
Others say the experience tore their family apart

413
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:01,567
Yes it had baseball teams

414
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:04,895
It also had a hundred and twenty armed soldiers

415
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:08,735
You know yes it has beautiful gardens but it also had guard towers

416
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:14,111
She just wants the site to show the full Messi history of what happened here

417
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:18,208
I think the national parks represent America at its best

418
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:20,256
And Americans at their best

419
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:26,144
And I think it's also good that we look at the times and we haven't been our best and it's the lesson

420
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,424
For the future

421
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:33,056
This site existence national park exist because of the efforts

422
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:36,384
I'm Ordinary People to make sure this their story wasn't

423
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,432
Swept Away by the wind

424
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:40,224
Or buried by

425
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,760
Those that don't want to be

426
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,040
I reminded of

427
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,320
Of the weaknesses

428
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:46,112
Of some in our past

429
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,160
That's Bruce Emery again

430
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:54,816
Every Spring he's one of the hundreds if not thousands of people who come to manzanar for the annual pilgrimage

431
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:57,632
The one that started back in 1969

432
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:01,728
They hold religious ceremonies and drumming performances

433
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:04,032
And remember what happened here together

434
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:07,104
But it's not just for Japanese-American

435
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,640
The lately

436
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:10,176
Ever since 9/11

437
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,736
The pilgrimage has

438
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,528
Almost always had

439
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,600
A speaker from the Muslim Community

440
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:25,024
In recent years the activist who lead the pilgrimage have tried to connect the wartime discriminate

441
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,072
Nation against Japanese-Americans

442
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:29,376
With contemporary discrimination

443
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:32,448
Against Muslim Americans in the name of security

444
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,056
It's really important that the parallels to what's happening today get raised

445
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,080
And

446
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:42,432
This is story I think that needs to be Amplified and and

447
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:47,552
Shout it from the rooftops so that America doesn't embark on some of the same

448
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,088
Non productive

449
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,624
Dove racist Behavior

450
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:55,488
This year's pilgrimage will happen on April 29th

451
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,024
Andrew stinks

452
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,560

Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices were immersed in a cluttered world of man-made

Sound

476

To make them more human

482
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:09,120
Turn the living room lights on

483
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:10,656
Okay

484
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,704
Dim the living room lights to 50

80%

486
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,264
Okay

487

It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

488
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,480
Makes for a much more natural experience

489
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:26,528

You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath
