This is 99% invisible

21
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,864
I'm Roman Mars

22
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:12,960
Back in the 1980s

23
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:17,312
Cuqui Skinner was reporter with a newspaper called The Arizona Republic

24
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:19,616
Cover the drug trade and the Border

25
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:22,688
They spent a lot of time in different parts of Mexico

26
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:27,040
He was getting tired of traveling and a being a stranger and every place he went

27
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:29,856
He wanted to actually settle down in Mexico

28
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:30,880
How to make a life

29
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,928
That's when I thought about well

30
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:34,976
I would like to be part of a community

31
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,256
In Mexico

32
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:40,352
What was going on

33
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:46,240
Tokidoki move to Agua Prieta a town right on the border where he done some reporting before

34
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:52,384
Agua Prieta at 6 just across the line from Douglas Arizona the two cities are contiguous

35
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,688
One urban area that spans the Border

36
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,760
/ towering rust colored metal wall

37
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,040
Steve concrete ditch

38
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,832
A line of concertina wire

39
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,112
A mesh fence

40
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,928
Antioquia

41
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,488
He settled down and made a life there

42
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,280
Methrone Delaney Hall

43
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,560
He built a house

44
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:11,840
Married a Mexican woman

45
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:17,216
Continued mastering the slaney Spanish of northern Mexico and ended up having five

46
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,776
Aprieta became his

47
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:24,640
And the thing I like that I will put it that it wasn't prison Orient it all

48
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,432
It was very Mexican community

49
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,760
And I was very intrigued by the town for that reason

50
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:35,392
Keoki ended up scaling back his full-time reporting job so we could open a smoothie shop and juice bar

51
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:38,720
What better way to get to know this city then to have a business here where

52
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:41,024
People will come in and hang out and talk

53
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,168
You could listen in observing probably pick up a few good ideas for the occasional freelance story that came as way

54
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,960
He named his smoothie shop

55
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,240
El mitote

56
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,032
Wishing in Spanish

57
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:55,104
It means like a gossip spot or there's a

58
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:58,688
A Ruckus going on for example of sirens going down the street

59
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,992
Everybody kind of runs out to see where the

60
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,784
Where the cop cars are going

61
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,832
And that's like the where's the meat

62
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:07,136
And what what's going on it's a hubbub.

63
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:12,512
Keoki pick the name because on occasion that he'd been accused of being a meatball dedal

64
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:13,792
Meaning of nosy

65
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:14,816
Someone who

66
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:15,584
Prize

67
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:21,472
He wasn't working as a full-time journalist anymore but that didn't mean he wasn't a reporter at heart

68
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,520
He loved collecting bits and piece

69
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:24,800
Information

70
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,080
And asking questions

71
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,128
Figuring out what was really going

72
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,944
And so that's how I got

73
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,736
The name for my business

74
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,016
And

75
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:34,784
Stuck

76
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:38,368
It's stuck in fact to this day how many years later

77
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,488
I'll run into people that get a gas station and they'll see me and they'll yell at me in Spanish

78
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,096
Blonde

79
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,120
Gossiper

80
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,704
I don't know my name but they know I had them

81
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:57,312
If it's kind of perfect though because it's also where you first started to

82
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:59,616
See evidence of this big

83
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,920
Conspiracy that was going on

84
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:04,992
Yeah there was things going on there that

85
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:08,064
Wasn't hard to start picking up stuff

86
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,136
So that would eventually lead karaoke

87
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:14,720
To one of the biggest and strangest stories he'd ever cover

88
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:18,559
In other news today something that one Customs agents called something out of James Bond

89
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:24,959
The story involves the cocaine trade

90
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:28,287
El Chapo Guzman has been the most Wanted Man in Mexico

91
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:32,127
Marijuana cocaine meth heroin and murder are all part of his business

92
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:35,455
And an incredible feat of engineering and architecture

93
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:37,503
That would change the drug trade

94
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,271
Forever

95
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:50,559
It was 1989 when keokee first started noticing some new customers in the Juice Shop

96
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,863
Guys he haven't really seen before

97
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,143
They have a certain

98
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:54,911
Swagger

99
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,935
Attitude

100
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:58,239
And he says they often had bodyguards

101
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:01,567
Which is not typical for an outing to the Juice Shop

102
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:04,639
Keoki describe them as Sinaloa Cowboys

103
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:10,783
So just when you said you Sinaloa Cowboys would come in like what they look like what do they act

104
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,575
Real high-end

105
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,343
Cowboy boots

106
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:17,183
The Levi's the leather vest that the white hats

107
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:17,951
What they wear

108
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,999
Pickup trucks with Sinaloa plates

109
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,839
They all feel like they're Cut Above the Law

110
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,399
They double Park out in front of my place

111
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,679
No they didn't give

112
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,447
Give a damn

113
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:33,055
Everybody just kind of stayed away from him because they knew what was going on that these guys were

114
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,335
In town for summer

115
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,359
Some something

116
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,407
Back in the late 80s

117
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,455
The Sinaloa cartel wasn't quite Beast

118
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:43,039
Falling dominant criminal organization it's become today

119
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,831
But it was headed in that direction

120
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:51,231
The cartel controlled a lot of the drug trafficking Corridor that ran through the Mexican states of Sinaloa and Sonora

121
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,535
Then across the border into Arizona

122
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:57,119
I don't update distribution points like Phoenix and Los Angeles

123
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:00,447
El aprieta FL ride along that corridor

124
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:06,335
Can you get suspected that these guys in his Juice Shop buying their smoothies with hundred dollar bills

125
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:08,127
Were part of the cartel

126
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,919
He began observing them

127
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:10,687
Cautiously

128
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:11,967
From a distance

129
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:15,551
But he also wasn't above marketing to their sensibilities

130
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,855
And the big thing we hyped with them was a

131
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,135
We had drinks

132
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,927
That we called AR-15

133
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,207
I love that one

134
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:24,255
And then we had what we had Alfalfa drink

135
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,815
We hiked it as being real good for hangovers

136
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:30,911
So they would come in and drink fresh Alfalfa mixed with pineapple or whatever

137
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:33,983
You know they bought into my advertising scams you know

138
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,263
And that's what they would have

139
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,823
This keoki says is

140
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,615
One of the Rules of Order.

141
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,991
Even if the theory of trickle-down Economics doesn't really hold up in other places

142
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,527
It's in the works here

143
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,855
You're dealing with border towns and drug trafficking

144
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,391
Trickle down economics

145
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,695
Pictures of valid idea because

146
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,487
In Mexico

147
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,023
These guys don't hoard the money

148
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,303
It gets better

149
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:01,375
On stuff like big houses and fancy cars

150
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,935
Not to mention Brides the local cops and

151
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:04,959
Politicians

152
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,983
And businesses

153
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,775
It's where the narcos launder their money

154
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,823
In general Kioki set

155
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,615
Drug traffickers tend to be

156
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,639
Pretty flashy

157
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:16,735
But there was one guy that stood apart from the Sinaloa Cowboys

158
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:19,039
Text with their leather vests and high-end boots

159
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:21,343
This guy dressed more like a businessman

160
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,671
His name was Francisco Rafael Camarena Macias

161
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:29,791
And one day he offered keoki his business card and told him a little about what he was doing in town

162
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:33,119
Call in a claim to be a lawyer out of Guadalajara

163
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:37,471
The story that I got from him when he came into my juice bar at one time

164
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:40,287
Was that he was a contractor and he was

165
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,311
Going to build

166
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:43,103
Houses in Agua Prieta

167
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,151
Oh, then I also Tokyo

168
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:48,991
That he was pursuing some business opportunities just across the border

169
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,295
Enalaprilat is sister city

170
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,831
Douglas Arizona

171
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:55,391
And at that point I didn't know of

172
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,695
What the score was I thought he was pretty legit

173
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:02,303
It wasn't yet clear to keokee that, Donna was also in the drug trade

174
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,607
Enoteca mosto year for that

175
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:07,423
Become a parent to the entire city of Douglas

176
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,471
And by then

177
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:12,543
Madonna had already turned the little town

178
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,311
Upside down

179
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:21,759
Douglas a small about 14,000 people lived here back in 1989 when Camarena for showed up

180
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:24,063
It doesn't have a whole lot of attractions

181
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,879
One of the main ones is the Gadsden Hotel

182
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,183
First built back in the early nineteen

183
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,487
The area was more of a magnet

184
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,279
The Cattleman Ranchers

185
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,047
And Mining type

186
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,607
It has a grand marble Lobby

187
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,887
Annie's gorgeous

188
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,935
Tiffany-style stained glass window

189
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,751
They depict the surrounding Sonoran Desert

190
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,543
It's saguaro cactus

191
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,335
Ocotillo and creosote

192
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:50,431
Today that desert landscape is heavily surveilled

193
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:53,759
A network of towers equipped with cameras and sensors

194
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,575
Watch the southern border and all of Douglas

195
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,111
Pretty much 24 hours a day

196
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,927
Border patrol trucks with tinted windows

197
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:01,951
Cruise the streets

198
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:05,535
There's so much history here because this all started with

199
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,815
Mister Douglas

200
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:07,583
Are you already taped

201
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,607
Reported me

202
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,631
Is that okay

203
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,703
On the north side of town There's a shop called Douglas

204
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,751
Diesel it's a big Brick Warehouse

205
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,543
Ceiling stucco filled with

206
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,103
And it's owned by the sky

207
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:19,871
Gary James

208
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:22,431
Maybe we better just start all over

209
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,455
Well

210
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,735
First of all

211
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:27,039
What's your name and what when were you born

212
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,367
My name is Gary James I was born

213
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,415
131 51

214
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:35,743
Gary grew up in Douglas and his live here almost all his life

215
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:40,095
Kilz fixing service the semis and trucks that pass through the Port of Entry

216
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:42,911
Pulling clothes Electronics window blinds in car parts

217
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,447
Manufactured in Mexico

218
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:49,567
About 145,000 personal vehicles and more than 2000 trucks

219
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,359
Cross the border every month

220
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,407
So a lot of my business is

221
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,175
From

222
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,479
From Mexico I'm fact I would say probably

223
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,015
80% of my business

224
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:58,783
This is from

225
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,063
South of the Border

226
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:04,927
And Gary says that when your customers are people who work in the cross-border trucking

227
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,487
A certain number of them will have

228
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,511
Tiles to smuggle

229
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:11,583
When you have a foreign country that butts up to the United States

230
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,911
And the drug problem that we have in America

231
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:17,471
You're going to have these kind of transaction

232
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,751
All the time

233
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,287
In all kinds of business

234
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,079
And so

235
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:25,151
Many of times I know people coming in my shop

236
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,687
May not

237
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,991
B-Legit 100%

238
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,807
But it's still a business

239
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:32,831
I'm Legit

240
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:33,599
So I

241
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,879
I seldom depart

242
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:38,719
But when Gary first met Rafael coming rain out at a local bar

243
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:42,559
He says he didn't suspect that, Rana was involved in any smuggling

244
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:45,119
I remember him being dressed very well

245
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,167
Was very professional

246
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,727
Never look like he ever got

247
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,311
Excited or upset and never said anything that would

248
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,335
Make you

249
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,919
Question who he was

250
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:02,527
Doug's Diesel

251
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,623
Amanda was outgoing and social

252
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,951
And he became friendly with some of Douglas's most prominent citizen

253
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:14,559
That included the chief of police and local Justice of the Peace who owned a lot of

254
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,631
Actually bought a plot

255
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:20,191
Near an industrial part of the Border

256
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:22,495
I also bought the local businesses

257
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,823
The business was called Douglas Ready Mix

258
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:30,175
Sand gravel and concrete for construction projects

259
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,991
Madonna higher Jerry to Help Services

260
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:37,599
And so I was seeing Mister, Dana at least on a weekly basis

261
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,391
At least Gary

262
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:42,463
Camarena's business appeared to be above board

263
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:44,255
So the Douglas Ready Mix

264
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:46,815
Was actually bidding on federal contracts

265
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,631
City contracts State contracts

266
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,423
For all kinds of

267
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,215
Materials that are needed in

268
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,775
Road building a bridge building

269
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:58,591
And so it looked like a very very legit business

270
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:01,151
And I mean he was employing people in so

271
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:05,503
So we were all happy because at that point in time there wasn't much industry in Douglas are

272
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:12,927
Really right downtown

273
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,487
Real close to where all the

274
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,047
DEA and Customs people

275
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,327
Crustaceans

276
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,375
It's right under their nose pretty much

277
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,447
QT scanner is giving me the Douglas

278
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,775
In his 1973 VW Bug

279
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,543
Which has a

280
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,335
Flapping canvas roof

281
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,639
The bumper sticker on the back that says

282
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:35,455
Make America Mexico again

283
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:38,015
With the map showing the US territory

284
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:40,063
That used to be part of our Southern neighbor

285
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,599
Okay this is

286
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,415
This Warehouse Right Here Right Now the city

287
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,719
Has been using at the store

288
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:49,279
Some of their buses in their bands

289
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,815
That run around

290
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,095
Rat run around Douglas

291
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,375
In front of us

292
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:56,703
Is a beige Warehouse surrounded by a chain link fence

293
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:59,263
Madonna constructed this building for her

294
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,287
Ready mix business

295
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,823
Back in the late 80s

296
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:04,639
He stored his trucks and equipment and material

297
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,711
The Border fence is about a hundred Paces away

298
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,247
Mexico is right

299
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,527
There

300
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,575
I'm through the fence

301
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,599
Just over the line

302
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:15,391
We can see another proper

303
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,671
That used to be, Dennis

304
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:20,255
It's a ranch style home in a wealthy neighborhood Developers

305
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,583
Medina built a house on a vacant lot

306
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,655
Which he reportedly bought for $90,000

307
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,679
Cash

308
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,471
Was a little bit over and above

309
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,519
Market price to say the least

310
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,567
It raised some eyebrows

311
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,639
This guy was throwing around a lot of money

312
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:40,223
And then there was the enormous hole behind them

313
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:46,623
It was going to be a swimming pool But as time went on then realize it was starting to fill up

314
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,647
Erdogan

315
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,671
And so

316
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,975
One day I was in the neighbors told me

317
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,279
You know that big ole butt

318
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,071
Weltall filled hit

319
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,863
No pull head materialize

320
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:59,935
You know there was a lot of construction activity at the house

321
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:02,751
Swift trucks going in and out and Hauling dirt

322
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,287
And at this point

323
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:10,687
Because Douglas and Oliver Prieta are both relatively small towns and everyone knows everyone else

324
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:13,503
Rumors were beginning to circulate

325
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,527
Matilda

326
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,807
Okie dokie

327
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:22,975
People were saying that, Rana wasn't just building a warehouse on the US side and a nice residential home on the Mexico side

328
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,279
He was building some kind

329
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,303
Tunnel

330
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:33,983
That dirt that slowly refill the swimming pool hole apparently it has been dug out of a passageway that ran

331
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,519
Under the Border

332
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,639
US Customs official

333
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,943
Spin Douglas and then in Phoenix

334
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,759
Eventually received a number of tips from inform

335
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:50,623
They learned that, then I was using the passageway to smuggle drugs from his

336
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,415
Is home in agua prieta

337
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,975
Across the border to his Warehouse in Douglas

338
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:58,303
But before law enforcement could go into the Wii

339
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,095
The search for the tunnel

340
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:03,423
They needed to establish that the smuggling was actually happening

341
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,983
So they stayed out, Dan has Warehouse

342
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:11,359
Ameritas business was located one block away from the US Customs headquarters

343
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:14,431
This was later chronicled in an episode of Unsolved

344
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,479
It was very dramatic

345
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:20,831
Early 1990 we initiated 24-hour surveillance

346
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,111
Of the Douglas Ready Mix

347
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,391
Company

348
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,439
Forgot something

349
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:29,023
Agent steak.com brightness business for over 2 months

350
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,071
Yes, day

351
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:34,655
Law enforcement eventually followed a flatbed truck

352
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,959
That they'd seen leaving, Tennis Warehouse

353
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:40,031
And they trailed it to a property outside of Phoenix

354
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,567
Where they conducted a ray

355
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:47,199
Redo the farmer Camarena struct adenosine

356
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:52,575
Agencies over a ton of nearly pure cocaine

357
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:55,903
Street value over 100 million dollars

358
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:58,463
The cocaine have been transported inside of

359
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,487
Hidden

360
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,279
Beneath the trucks bed

361
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:06,143
The rain confirmed with the drugs that come from camarena's Warehouse

362
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,215
In May of 1990

363
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:13,823
Law enforcement rated Comer in his Warehouse in Douglas and his home in Agua Prieta

364
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,847
They heard there was a

365
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:15,615
The tunnel

366
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:18,943
But they didn't really know exactly what it would be like

367
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:21,247
The first reaction was like

368
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,039
Okay

369
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:26,367
A tunnel is it's going to be some little bitty hole

370
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:28,159
Gopher Hall at these guys are

371
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,439
Crawling through

372
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,975
This is Terry Kirkpatrick

373
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,279
He worked with the US custom services

374
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,583
At the time and he was there the night of the raid

375
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,911
First agent entered the warehouse on the US

376
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:39,679
Side

377
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,215
And in the middle of the floor

378
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:45,055
Was probably about a 2-foot by 2-foot great

379
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:50,687
Well that great just having to be the shaft leading down into the tunnel

380
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,015
Once they found the tunnel entrance in the Douglas Warehouse

381
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:56,319
Some of the agents headed over to Agua Prieta

382
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,879
Where they were joined by the Mexican Federal Judicial

383
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:03,231
They discovered that, Donna and his family had already fled

384
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,511
His house with them

385
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,303
No one was there

386
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:12,959
But there was no access to the tunnel they couldn't figure it out we weren't sure how to get into it either

387
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:15,775
The agents went into what looked like a recreation

388
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:16,799
With a pool

389
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,615
And when they pulled away the carpet

390
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:22,175
They could see there was something unusual about the

391
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:27,039
It looked as if there was a separate concrete slab underneath

392
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,063
The pool table

393
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,111
Kind of enormous trapdoor

394
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:33,439
Agent started looking around for some kind of button

395
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,975
Lever that might open it

396
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,535
And someone else has pulled out of jackhammer

397
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:42,655
And I just happened to be the one that took the Jackhammer start Jackhammer in the floor

398
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:44,703
On top of where the pool table was

399
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:49,055
As I'm standing there jackhammering it all the sudden it moved and

400
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,335
Started go up

401
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:51,615
And then it stopped

402
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:54,175
And so everybody kind of froze

403
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:57,247
We said okay who touched what

404
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:00,063
Well it just so happened that one of the

405
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:04,671
Policeman outside was trying to get a drink of water out of an outside water spicket

406
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,719
Return that spicket

407
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:08,767
That's what was a control lever

408
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:11,071
That allow the pool table to go up

409
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:16,447
Valve triggered the pool table to rise up to the ceiling on huge hydraulic lift

410
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,239
Like something in mechanics

411
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:23,103
Revealing a set of stairs underneath which descended into the tunnel

412
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:26,943
Same one they found an entrance to on the Douglas side of the Border

413
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:30,527
The tunnel was located about 30 feet underground

414
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,575
Once agent at the bottom

415
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,599
It was a package

416
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:37,695
About 270 ft long 4 ft wide

417
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,975
5 feet high

418
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:42,815
Just tall enough that a person could walk through slightly stoop

419
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:46,143
Pushing a wheeled cart full of bundles of cocaine

420
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:49,215
The tunnel had concrete walls and a curb

421
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,495
Concrete roof

422
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:53,311
It was a ventilation system and rudimentary lighting

423
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,103
So this wasn't just a gopher hole

424
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:58,687
This was clearly a sophisticated engineering

425
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,479
Jess

426
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:01,247
The

427
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:04,319
Complexity to this whole tunnel

428
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,111
Was something that had been

429
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:08,671
Unseen before unheard of

430
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,999
And no one I think in the United States government

431
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:15,583
Especially in law enforcement realize anyone it has ever existed

432
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:18,143
Will federal agents on patrol along the mechs

433
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:24,543
Mexico Arizona border said today that they discovered a major drug smuggling Ruth where they have never looked but enough

434
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,847
2 million dollars worth of construction

435
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:28,127
Discovered last night

436
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:34,271
Concrete steel reinforcing bars electrical Arizona five feet high 4 ft wide the length

437
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,551
Of a football field

438
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:40,415
Agency discovery of the tunnel was pretty much the biggest thing that had happened

439
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,183
And Douglas

440
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:42,463
Everybody

441
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,487
I was paying attention

442
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,023
I mean everybody

443
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,047
And we had

444
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:48,351
Congress people come out to Douglas Arizona

445
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,911
And you know America's Most Wanted and

446
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,959
Unsolved Mysteries and

447
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:57,311
We just had a lot of activity here for at least the first year

448
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,103
After the tunnel was

449
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,639
Discovered it was constant

450
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:01,919
I was just concerned

451
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,455
I hear the helicopters

452
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:07,551
Black Hawks Landing all the time will who is it today

453
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,623
Hillside Grand Central Station in that place

454
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:14,463
Keoki started reporting in between shifts at the Juice Shop

455
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:18,047
Gary cab service in semis but was also hired by the federal government

456
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:22,399
To help maintain and secure the warehouse site so law enforcement could come and go

457
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:25,727
The customer service undertook a massive investigation

458
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:30,335
And people started printing t-shirts and bumper stickers would said I saw the tunnel

459
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:33,663
And selling them to all the visiting politicians and journalists

460
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:34,943
And everyone

461
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:40,063
Government officials reporters law enforcement ordinary citizens of Douglas

462
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:42,367
They were all asking the same question

463
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:45,695
First Who provided the money to build

464
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:50,047
It was estimated to cost one to two million dollars to create

465
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,399
The project clearly had the financing of a much bigger operation

466
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,703
And the other question was

467
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:58,751
Who had the expertise

468
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:02,335
Someone with engineering Noel have been involved

469
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,895
Someone who knew how to build a tunnel

470
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:05,919
Undetected

471
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:08,223
Stretch the length of a football field

472
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:12,575
And ran under the massive border fence in concrete drainage ditch

473
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:15,135
But separated Mexico from the US

474
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:17,440
So right away everybody was talking like

475
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,464
Who invested

476
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,512
Who is the Kingpin

477
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:21,792
This operation

478
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,840
And of course his name starts coming

479
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:28,192
The name was Joaquin El Chapo Guzman

480
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,728
And eventually

481
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,520
As the investigation progressed

482
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:34,080
Someone else started coming up to

483
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:35,616
Anarchist

484
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:40,224
The arrival

485
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,760
Of the architect

486
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,040
After this

487
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:51,232
Between the beats

488
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:53,536
Bongs and Charter of our devices

489
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:57,120
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

490
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,144
If

491
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:04,544
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife isn't

492
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,640
Another

493
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:10,432
Technology talk to us

494
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:12,480
It is a creation of Sonic trap

495
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:15,552
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

496
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:19,136
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

497
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:21,184
To make them more human

498
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:25,024
Turn the living room lights on

499
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:26,816
Okay

500
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,864
Dim the living room lights to 50

501
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:29,632
80%

502
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,424
Okay

503
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:37,824
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

504
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,640
Makes for a much more natural experience

505
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,688
Turn the living room lights on

506
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,784
Dim the living room lights to 50%

507
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:54,208
We're presenting to special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

508
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,744
About how are sounds gay

509
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,024
Is impacting our health

510
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:59,584
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

511
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:02,656
Look for them Fridays May 17th and May 24th

512
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:04,704
Right here on the 9th 9 p.m.

513
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,288
Right now in New York

514
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,336
Massive trial is underway

515
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:12,640
Joaquin Guzman loera

516
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:18,272
Better known as El Chapo is one of the most powerful drug kingpins ever to face prosecution

517
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,064
This trial is a

518
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,856
Huge deal for the US government

519
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:24,928
Which tried unsuccessfully for decades

520
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,232
Capture El Chapo and hold him accountable

521
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:30,304
El Chapo escape from Mexican prison

522
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,072
Not once

523
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:31,840
But twice

524
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:34,656
Before finally being arrested again

525
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:36,448
Annexed related to the US

526
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:41,568
Now when he's being transported from the federal prison in Manhattan where he's being held

527
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:44,384
The courthouse in Brooklyn where his trial is happening

528
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,456
He's locked in what basically sounds like a coffin

529
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:53,088
The drug lord is said to be locked inside a security capsule which is fixed to the floor of an armored vehicle

530
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:59,488
Protected Inside by a team of officers with automatic weapons and escorted in a commando-style convoy

531
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:01,280
Capable of repelling attack

532
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:06,144
In an effort to prevent an assault in a caravan and risk another Chapo Escape

533
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,752
Authorities are closing the Brooklyn Bridge while delivering him to court

534
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:13,312
Early on in the trial back in November

535
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:15,360
As prosecutors began to lay out the

536
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,640
Scope and scale

537
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,688
The Sinaloa cartel's operation

538
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,992
Jurors were given a video tour

539
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:21,760
Of the Douglas

540
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,808
One discovered back in

541
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,904
The footage released to the public doesn't have sound

542
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:30,464
But it shows agents walking stupid

543
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:31,488
To the concrete

544
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,256
Passageway

545
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:35,328
And it shows the concrete slab below the pool table

546
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,400
Floating up from the floor on its hydraulic lift

547
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:44,800
Under the leadership of El Chapo de Sinaloa cartel became known for their creative smuggling method

548
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:46,848
Especially their tunnels

549
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:51,456
The one in Douglas became a kind of prototype for many tunnels afterwards

550
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:54,016
And the person who oversaw its construction

551
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:56,320
Was a man named Felipe de Jesus

552
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,856
Corona beer batter

553
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:03,744
The tunnels really started with a guy named felipe de jesus corona verbera

554
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,280
Who was an architect

555
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,560
He graduated

556
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:11,680
From the University of Guadalajara in 1980 with an architectural degree

557
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:16,032
And there's not much known about his early life beyond that fact

558
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,568
This is Monte real

559
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:23,712
He was the South America correspondent for the Washington Post and he's written about transporter Tunnels for the New Yorker

560
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:27,552
And he says that while Raphael, do not may have been the

561
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:29,600
The frontman for the tunneling project

562
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,416
Behind the scenes it was code on Eva Tavares

563
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:34,208
Who provided technical expert

564
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:37,280
Corona beer peritonitis

565
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:43,424
We'll get into that a bit more later but he was convicted of conspiracy and drug smuggling in his own federal trial

566
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,704
2006

567
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,288
A lot of what we know about him is based on testimony from natural

568
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:52,896
Stories that have been collected from contract workers who helped him with certain

569
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:56,224
Construction projects and also from testimony

570
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,272
From former cartel members

571
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,856
Cartel members like Miguel Angel Martinez

572
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:05,184
Worked as a pilot and later is a lieutenant for El Chapo

573
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:06,976
Before turning State's Witness

574
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,512
And entering Witness Protection

575
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:11,072
Back in the 1980s in mind

576
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:13,632
Martinez helped to manage El Chapo's business

577
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,752
4 time he coordinated cocaine deliveries from Colombia to Agua Prieta

578
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:21,312
When he testified against Corona

579
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,360
He described him as being

580
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:25,664
The only guy that he ever knew

581
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:28,224
Within the Sinaloa cartel who addressed

582
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,272
Chapo with the pronoun to

583
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:34,624
Instead of the more formal and deferential usted so he was

584
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:39,744
Considered a guy who just was very close friends and very familiar

585
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:42,560
With Guzman but I'm not sure

586
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:44,352
If anybody

587
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:46,656
Really has the story of how they met

588
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:50,496
We may not know that story but we do know generally speaking

589
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:52,544
LCM Architects come to work

590
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,568
For drug traffickers

591
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:55,872
Basically it's like in any business community

592
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,152
This is Yuan Grillo

593
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:59,712
British journalist based in Mexico City

594
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:03,296
He's cover the drug trade and the drug war for almost 20 years

595
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:05,344
Like if you were going to build a house

596
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:08,672
And you say you need knock text you my ask around

597
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,000
I need some Marketplace

598
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:15,328
If you have somebody coming up an offering

599
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,608
Are we good buddy

600
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,680
Will you might normally make

601
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:21,216
It could be enough for this

602
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:21,984
Basalt reviews

603
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:28,640
Because cartels are such extensive and elaborate operations they need many kinds of sub special

604
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:32,224
They end up hiring not just Architects and engineers

605
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:33,760
But also accountants

606
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:34,528
Lawyers

607
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:35,552
It expert

608
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:39,136
I need a musician to write ballads about the exaggerated

609
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,672
Exploits a certain Market

610
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:43,744
Many of these people are employed for one-off

611
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,512
Jobs

612
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:45,536
Like contractor

613
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:47,584
Do you have professional killers

614
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:50,144
The highest paid a wage

615
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,680
I'll pay for it

616
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:53,472
You have

617
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:55,008
People who have

618
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:57,056
Woke up

619
00:27:57,824 --> 00:28:00,640
Anna paid normally per backpack they take over

620
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:03,200
Do you have people who have paid

621
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:04,480
2 Bill Tuttle

622
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,808
Until I paid for the job

623
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,392
According to Miguel Angel Martinez

624
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:12,928
The former cartel member

625
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:19,584
The architect Cotto never worked on a number of building projects for El Chapo before embarking on the Douglas

626
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,656
And his first projects were

627
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:24,704
Just kind of construction jobs

628
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,008
Within Mexico that weren't related to

629
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:27,776
Tunnels

630
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:31,104
He had built a couple of residential homes

631
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:37,504
For Guzman and he had to help design a farm with a zoo where Chapo kept some of his exotic pets

632
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:43,648
Mini designed a grocery store where the Sinaloa cartel had some offices up in the top

633
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:44,416
Floor of it

634
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:49,024
And all these projects weather at four more a home or a grocery store

635
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,304
At a certain

636
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:51,328
Flair

637
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,632
The one thing that all of those

638
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:55,424
Project had in common

639
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:58,752
Was that they featured hiding places

640
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:00,800
That we're all access by these

641
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:02,336
Hydraulic system

642
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,920
There's a playfulness almost

643
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:10,272
To the sort of systems that Corona verbera design

644
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:12,320
He was very creative in

645
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:18,720
Kind of developing ways to access the secret passageways that somebody who walked into it

646
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:19,744
House would never really

647
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:20,768
Guess

648
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:26,144
In 1988 Corona bedroom move from Guadalajara

649
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:29,728
To the Douglas Tower Prieta area with his wife

650
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:30,496
3 kids

651
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:35,616
And in the federal trial his defense team maintained that it was to work on legitimate project

652
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:42,016
They argued that like a lot of people in the area Corona berbera inadvertently got caught up doing business with people

653
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,552
HuHot cartel connections

654
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:46,624
But they didn't actually design or build the tunnel

655
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:53,024
They brought in an expert to testify that the tunnel look more like a work of a structural engineer and not an architect

656
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:58,912
The trial transcripts kept very detailed and jardini with references to things like control joint

657
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,448
And curing comp

658
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,240
Inlet structure

659
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:08,640
Eventos corruption in the area was rampant and it was Corona beer barrels Misfortune to be in the wrong place

660
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:09,664
The wrong time

661
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,712
And there is some evidence

662
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:13,760
Said there were other Specialists involved

663
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:14,784
The tunnel

664
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,088
A senior Customs agent told me that

665
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:20,928
One of the informants who tipped him off to the tunnel with a Mexican engineer

666
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:26,816
The engineer claims he been hired by the Sinaloa cartel to research possible tunnel locations

667
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:28,608
Create tunnel designs

668
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:30,912
Which were then handed off to Corona beer

669
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:33,728
That detail is hard to fact-check

670
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:35,264
But it comes from a credit

671
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,032
Source

672
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:40,384
Even after being convicted and serving more than a decade in federal prison

673
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,224
Corona verbera still denies being involved with the tunnel

674
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:50,368
Is attorney told us that he also denies involvement in any previous Chapo Guzman projects

675
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:56,256
We asked one of their better for interview but through a friend he told us that he's not willing to speak at this time

676
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,096
Despite pleading Not Guilty Crown a betta with seen at

677
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:01,632
Key tunnel locations

678
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:04,704
Including both the warehouse on the US side

679
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,008
And the residential home on the Agua Prieta

680
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:07,776
Decide

681
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,080
Number of local contractors in worker

682
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:13,408
Recorded interacting with him at those construction site

683
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:19,296
They described him as somebody that they would talk to you all the time who is always around

684
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:20,832
And it's

685
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:23,648
Funny a lot of people actually describe him

686
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:25,184
In glowing terms

687
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:31,328
Present there was a contractor who described seen the plans that Corona Barbera have for the warehouse

688
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,352
And

689
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:35,680
He kind of pause in his testimony said they were beautiful plan

690
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:42,080
They kind of respected this guy as an architect he kind of had this air about him

691
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:46,176
That people looked at him as somebody who knew what he was doing

692
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:51,296
But there were also a few signs that this wasn't an ordinary construction project

693
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:54,368
For instance the drains in the floor of the warehouse

694
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:57,184
One worker raised questions about their size

695
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,280
And the fact that they didn't appear to lead to a clear drainage system

696
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:06,656
This was because they were actually going to feed into the passageway the connected to the tunnel

697
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:10,240
And one of the workers said you know these trains they don't

698
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:14,080
There's something not right with them where does the water go he was kind of

699
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:15,104
Questioning

700
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,664
The design and crunch berbera

701
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:20,992
Basically said you know mind your own business

702
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:23,040
I'm in charge here

703
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:28,672
The Sinaloa cartel had handpicked the our Prieta Douglas border as a tunnel side

704
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:29,952
Review reasons

705
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:30,720
One thing

706
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:33,024
Hotel was already operating there

707
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:36,352
They had established networks in an established operation

708
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:39,168
And they'd already been moving drugs across the border

709
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,472
Above-ground mostly in Vans and trucks

710
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:42,752
With hidden compartments

711
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:46,336
And they were able to move about 3 tons

712
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:47,104
Per month

713
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,408
Across the border that way but

714
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:51,200
Guzman wanted more efficiency

715
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:57,088
And understand why El Chapo Guzman wanted more efficiency we need to take a little side trip

716
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:58,624
Miami

717
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:04,000
Back in the early 1980s cocaine was coming into the US not

718
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,024
From Mexico

719
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,304
But from Columbia

720
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:12,960
And a Colombian cartels preferred smuggling drugs into the country on boats and small planes through cities inside

721
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:13,728
South Florida

722
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:19,616
Like Miami Miami is the source that supplies two-thirds of America's drug habit

723
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:22,944
And the drug trade was helping to fuel a surge in crime

724
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:28,064
And so the Reagan Administration started something called the south Florida task force

725
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:34,464
The fight it looks like a war Customs agents On Assignment ready for combat I Spy

726
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:40,352
Cobra helicopters from the army with marijuana leaves painted on the side each leave a successful drug bust

727
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,448
Reagan's goals for the task force were very ambitious

728
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:49,824
Our goal is to break the power of the mob in America and nothing short of it

729
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:54,944
Winning the end their profits imprison their members and cripple their organization

730
00:33:56,736 --> 00:34:01,088
But the reality is the harder we make it for Smugglers to get Goods across the border

731
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:04,160
The more money ends up getting pumped into the system

732
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:06,720
Militarizing our border over many decades

733
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:09,024
Hasn't ended illegal trafficking

734
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:10,816
It's just help

735
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:12,096
Professionalizing

736
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:14,144
The more you crack down on it

737
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:15,168
Sahara

738
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:16,704
Eoin Grillo again

739
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,984
The hotter it gets

740
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:19,264
Price goes up

741
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:22,336
The more the price goes up the more money is

742
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,664
The more money is made the more criminals want to do it

743
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:27,456
The Crimson attached to it

744
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:29,760
NR Witcher I'm O+ ization

745
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:35,136
And the Mexican cartels were about to get a lot richer and more powerful

746
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:39,744
Thanks in part to Reagan strategy of increased enforcement in South Florida

747
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:46,144
Because when the Colombian cartel saw that they were losing their product in drug bust in Miami they just looked

748
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,424
Two different border

749
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,472
Criminal collaborator

750
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:50,752
Sanya tattoo Mexico

751
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:53,568
Name is agreement made where they would pay the Mexicans

752
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:55,616
Take the cocaine from them

753
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:57,920
Mexican Woody had a big trafficking group Encino

754
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,248
Cool the kilometer to Mexico

755
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:05,600
Mexicans could take it and then take the United States and deliver it to them

756
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:08,416
At a price per kilo

757
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,184
Pun

758
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,720
What a negotiating

759
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:12,256
So suddenly

760
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:15,840
A lot of the cocaine that have been traveling around or over me

761
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:17,632
Mexico was now traveling through

762
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:18,400
Through it

763
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:21,216
And then across the southern border into the US

764
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:24,032
Which meant a lot of new money

765
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,056
Pouring into the mix

766
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,080
Can cartels

767
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:28,640
Border agents in Arizona like

768
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:29,664
Karey Kirkpatrick

769
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,456
Could see the effects of this on the go

770
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:34,272
It hit it was just like

771
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:36,576
Every car instead of marijuana

772
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:37,344
Had cocaine

773
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:40,928
Just like a thousand pounds at a time 4000 lb

774
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:43,488
We got over run so fast

775
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,840
And as the US continue to crack down on cartels in Colombia

776
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:53,472
Eventually opened up new opportunities for Mexican cartels to become more than just careers

777
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:57,312
Did eventually come to dominate the entire cocaine supply chain

778
00:35:57,568 --> 00:36:01,664
So the big cartels are taken out in Colombia in the first Pablo Escobar

779
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:04,736
And the Cali cartel was taken down

780
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:07,040
And the Mexican cartels

781
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:10,112
Particularly

782
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,136
Personal loans

783
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:17,024
I'm telling you I was only like

784
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,328
12 for 30 years old back then

785
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:23,424
And my classmates and I we were like eight

786
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,728
I don't want to be a superhero like most kids

787
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:28,288
Around the world I want to be a troll traffickers pose

788
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,872
They do have pneumonia and they can do whatever they want

789
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:33,664
This is Miguel Angel Vega

790
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,968
Grew up in culiacan Sinaloa

791
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:37,248
Which by this time

792
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:41,088
I've been the epicenter of Mexico's heroin and marijuana trade for deck

793
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:44,672
What was the rise of cocaine Sinaloa drug-trafficking

794
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:46,464
Because we're getting even more powerful

795
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:48,256
And they go watch that happen

796
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:49,792
She was growing up

797
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:53,120
Some of his classmates became immersed in Narco culture

798
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:55,936
El Chapo was seen as a modern-day Robin Hood

799
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:58,496
Helping sharn the sinaloan economy with drugs

800
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:01,056
Some of those glass

801
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:03,360
Classmate ended up being

802
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:06,944
Drug traffickers and all I can tell you about that

803
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:09,248
Some of them are in prison

804
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:12,064
Or that much of the blood is still here in culiacan

805
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,088
No violent

806
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:18,720
Consider joining the Norcos Vega became an investigative journalist focused on organized crime

807
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:21,536
He's chronicled the violence and Chaos of the drug war

808
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:27,936
What is done so much over the years to destabilize the country corrupt its institutions and turn some of its mode

809
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:29,216
Vulnerable people

810
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:30,752
Into Asylum Seekers

811
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:35,104
By what seems like these body stuck in garbage bags police executed

812
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,640
Journalist assassinated

813
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:39,712
Are directly connected to the Wrath of the Sinaloa cartel

814
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:45,344
And big explains that a lot of this violence and Chaos was seated back in the late 80s

815
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:49,952
I'd only because the cocaine trade was being rerouted through Mexico

816
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:53,024
But also because the cartels were undergoing in in

817
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,048
Internal reorganization

818
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:54,816
Sensation

819
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:58,656
Whole generation of older narcos with leaving the scene

820
00:37:58,912 --> 00:37:59,936
They were getting arrested

821
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:03,264
They were dying and a new generation was coming up

822
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:05,568
And they were dividing up the old territory

823
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:07,104
Forging new alliances

824
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,128
The rivalries

825
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,200
That generation included El Chapo Guzman

826
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:13,248
And enormously creative

827
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,272
Brutal and

828
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:15,296
Ambitious

829
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:16,576
He was like

830
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:18,112
Eager for power

831
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:20,416
Let's just a small the whole world

832
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,184
Was just

833
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:23,488
Conquered entire world

834
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:24,256
And that's

835
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:26,304
Like his ultimate goal

836
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:28,352
El Chapo had some new ideas

837
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:30,144
Like this tunnel in Douglas

838
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:36,800
Which According to some estimates allow the Sinaloa cartel to Triple the amount of cocaine they were moving across

839
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:37,568
Cross the border

840
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:38,848
So do you think

841
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:41,408
What role did this tunnel play in

842
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,944
Chapo

843
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,224
Becoming Chapo

844
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,248
I think was a big role

845
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:46,784
Piers keoki Skinner again

846
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:50,368
The journalist and Juice shop owner from Iowa

847
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:56,512
Nothing really launched him onto his career the climates couldn't believe how fast you got that cocaine to Los Angeles

848
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:59,328
And they kind of jokingly nicknamed him speedy

849
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,400
In addition to helping El Chapo make his name

850
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:04,960
The tunnel created a new kind of notoriety

851
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:06,240
For Douglas Arizona

852
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:09,056
Which had formerly been a sleepy border

853
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,360
Suddenly it was synonymous

854
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:12,128
With the biggest

855
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:14,432
Drug trafficking story of the early 90

856
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:19,552
And there were a lot of questions about how a smuggling operation of that magnitude

857
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:22,880
Could have happened without at least a few local collaborators

858
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:25,696
What's the date in one June 10th

859
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:27,232
The first cup

860
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:29,280
Sure

861
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:34,400
The Specter of a man who called himself Francisco Rafael Camarena

862
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:38,496
Still stalks the homes of the wealthy and influential here

863
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:41,312
Who entertained him and lavish Style

864
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:43,872
In the aftermath of the tunnels discovery

865
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:44,896
Keoki got to work

866
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:47,968
Read a series of articles for his old newspaper

867
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:49,248
The Arizona Republic

868
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,344
Chronicling Raphael, Dan has connections to various prominent

869
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,136
People not just in Mexico

870
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,160
But in Douglas

871
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:58,208
He was always out of the country club

872
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,536
And I'm making the right connections getting another right people here

873
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:03,072
Before you got this

874
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:04,864
Tunnel under way

875
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,144
I mean

876
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:11,008
It seems like there were a lot of implications in these articles about

877
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,312
Local officials

878
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:14,336
Profiting

879
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:16,384
From this whole scheme

880
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,480
But did anybody in local government ever

881
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:23,552
Do any time for this or

882
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:24,576
Anything like that

883
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:25,600
No

884
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:28,672
No nobody on the Douglas side

885
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,768
They're also allegations about how Agents from the customer service

886
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,072
May have colluded in the tunnels game

887
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:37,632
And while no one was ever charged

888
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:41,472
There was a lot of corruption going on within the agency in around this time

889
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:43,264
Here's Terry Kirkpatrick again

890
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:44,544
At that time

891
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:51,712
Corruption was so rampant that the US government started a blue ribbon campaign trying to stamp it out and we

892
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:52,992
We're so busy

893
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:57,600
Trying to work the corruption and trying to weed out all wrong with these inspectors

894
00:40:58,112 --> 00:41:01,952
Because they were passing a thousand pounds in the trunk of a car right to the Port of Entry

895
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:06,560
It was just a lawless kind of area back in 1989

896
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:13,984
Senior agent in the customer service told me that the tunnel was probably in operation for at least 6 months

897
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:15,776
And he said that quote

898
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:16,800
Everyone

899
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:18,848
Dave had to know about the passageway

900
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:20,896
Route to be in regular use for that length

901
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:30,880
After the discovery of the tunnel El Chapo Guzman came up with new ways of getting drugs across the border Tactical

902
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:34,720
Cans of jalapeno peppers or inside coils of insulated wire

903
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:39,072
Both Francisco, Rihanna and Saudi pakoda naved badass led to Max

904
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,144
And it took a long time to get them back to unite

905
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:47,776
Coming in and was eventually extradited in 2001 and a couple years later he

906
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:50,592
He plead guilty for his role in the Douglas smug Lincoln

907
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:52,895
You received a sentence

908
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:54,431
10 years in Federal

909
00:41:55,455 --> 00:42:00,063
Corona beer out with extradited in 2003 and tried in 2006

910
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:03,903
He was released from federal prison in September 2018

911
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:06,975
But that wasn't the end of the tunnel

912
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:09,279
The devil's tunnel was like

913
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:10,047
Prototype

914
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:14,655
Even though it was eventually discovered it was so efficient and effective

915
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:16,703
During the time it was an operation

916
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:19,519
But it paid for itself many times over

917
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:21,311
With a successful experiment

918
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:23,615
They proved the viability of under

919
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:25,663
Michelle

920
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:27,711
The tunnels after this one

921
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:29,503
They almost became a nightmare

922
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:33,087
That was one tunnel after another tunnel after another tunnel

923
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:39,743
Tunnel from San Diego to Tijuana they found it so sophisticated being called a super tunnel

924
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:41,535
Nearly seventy feet underground

925
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:45,119
Part of it through solid Limestone on the phones

926
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:49,983
Phone still work without specific information about where the tunnels are located

927
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:51,263
Or just plain luck

928
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:53,311
They're virtually impossible to find

929
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:54,847
Ron Claiborne

930
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:56,127
ABC News on the US map

931
00:42:57,151 --> 00:43:00,223
Most Channel show up along the Arizona and California borders

932
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:05,087
In places where the ground is soft enough for digging but not so soft it will cave in

933
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:09,183
Some of the tunnels are pretty rudimentary but some like the Douglas tunnel

934
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:13,535
Are highly engineered and sophisticated projects with elevators and real cars

935
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:16,351
I told discovered in Baja Mexico last year

936
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:20,447
Included solar panels to power a ventilation and Lighting systems

937
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:26,335
Most illegal drugs actually come into the country through legal ports of Entry

938
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:27,359
That fact

939
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,383
And tunnels

940
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:29,919
Are two reasons why Trump

941
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:33,759
Probably wouldn't do much to stop drug trafficking

942
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:40,927
But the US government still sees tunnels as enough of a problem that they started tunnel task force groups along the boy

943
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:46,047
The groups exist solely to monitor investigate and prevent tunneling

944
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:48,863
The tunnels are notoriously difficult

945
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:49,887
Detect

946
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:51,423
And they keep showing up

947
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:57,567
I was in Douglas I tried to get in

948
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:58,335
Into the old tunnel

949
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:00,383
Which has been kept open for

950
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:02,431
Regional training sessions by the border

951
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:06,015
Keoki Skinner worked his connections

952
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:08,063
And got us into the warehouse where the entry

953
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:10,623
But the tunnel is dank

954
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:11,903
Anna maintains

955
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:15,231
And I was 7 months pregnant at the time of the visit

956
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:18,047
A city worker took one look at me

957
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:20,095
Probably imagined me trying to

958
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:22,655
To clamber down the rusty ladder in the dark

959
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,703
And then wouldn't let us in

960
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:25,727
After all

961
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:28,287
But if we couldn't see the architecture of

962
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,311
Drug tunnel

963
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:32,383
Then at least we could see the architecture the drug trade has helped

964
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:33,151
Spell

965
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:34,175
Across the border

966
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:37,247
So you see it was pretty nice neighborhood

967
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:41,855
Once again we're driving around in keoki's rattling little VW Bug

968
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:45,695
We're exploring the part of town where I will see you at this business

969
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:51,327
It's the neighborhood where, Donna's ranch home with the hydraulic pool table

970
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:54,911
Although that's now been converted into a community

971
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:58,239
And keoki point that a house on the corner

972
00:44:58,751 --> 00:44:59,519
It's a nice place

973
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:01,055
With a wrought iron fence

974
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:02,847
The house is made of brick

975
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:06,431
This this is clean money this is Cattlemen this guy's been a cattle

976
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:08,735
Guy Rancher 44 years

977
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:11,295
Because keoki has lived here for decades

978
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:14,879
Just picked up a lot of information about how people make their money

979
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:16,927
As we go around the corner

980
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:19,743
Look at this place up on the right look at the

981
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:21,023
Columns on that place

982
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:23,839
Blood Money

983
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:25,631
Who's ever The Limited

984
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:27,935
The house takes up the entire block

985
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:34,335
It has enormous white Greco-Roman columns and a chandelier dangles over its soaring entry

986
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,895
Keoki says a local Narco

987
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:37,663
Let's hear

988
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:39,199
It's one of many

989
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:40,735
Extravagant Narco mansions

990
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:41,503
In the area

991
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:44,063
Puking out with local tours Italy

992
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:49,695
Bringing tourists and snowbirds from Arizona and other parts of the Southwest down to God

993
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:51,743
I said I'm going to show you what

994
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:54,047
Bad habits United States

995
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:56,351
Has built for us down here

996
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,399
All this money from

997
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:01,215
Drug consumption United States this is

998
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:03,007
Is how it's been spent

999
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:04,543
Down here these houses

1000
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:09,919
And not just these houses

1001
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:13,247
When you stop to think about everything that's funded

1002
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:14,783
Directly or indirectly

1003
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,831
Buy American drug consumption

1004
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:18,367
To make your mind

1005
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:22,207
The money find its way to the people who drive track

1006
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:23,487
Or fly the drugs

1007
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:25,791
The Hitman

1008
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:27,839

1011

I took a bribe the cops

1012
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:38,591
Politicians and border patrol agent

1013
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:41,407
So they don't turn their heads and look the other way

1014
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:44,991
At this vast and complex system grinds along

1015
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:49,855
And of course the money also trickles down into the rest of the economy

1016
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:53,439
To the grocery stores in the clothing shops in the gas stations

1017
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:55,487
Even the local Juice Shop

1018
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:57,279
That sells the Norcos

1019
00:46:57,791 --> 00:47:00,351
They're AR-15 smoothies

Might cost you your life

1062

You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

1063
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:37,023
Or lose a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

1064
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:40,351
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like

1065
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:41,375
Adad

1066
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:45,727
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that guy

1069
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:57,503
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called immortal
