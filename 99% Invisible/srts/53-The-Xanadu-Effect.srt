I'm Roman Mars

32
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:00,832
Julia Barnett been thinking about what happens when we build

33
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:01,600
Big

34
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:04,672
Maybe because she grew up in Dallas and the Go-Go eighties

35
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:08,256
Big football Arenas take freeways big houses

36
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:10,048
Texans love big

37
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,704
Dallas build a new city hall in 1978

38
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:22,080
Worldwide Plaza is kind of wedge shaped but upside down so the widest enlarges Flores on the top

39
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:26,432
Sometimes I go up to the top floor City Hall with my friends

40
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,736
That's where the vending machines were

41
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:31,040
They stalked my favorite candy bar

42
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,064
Caramello

43
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,768
Then we'd sit by the windows in chocolate and looking down over the plaza and I think

44
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,816
This is so cool

45
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:47,424
Bellator in high school Julia went to a protest Down Below in the plaza

46
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:50,752
And those same city hall windows were now

47
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,032
Hawking over us

48
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:55,616
We could see our tiny Reflections in the glass

49
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,176
Made me feel like a nobody

50
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,992
And that this whole event was a waste of time and

51
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:04,832
Environment seem to be saying the same thing

52
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,392
I'm important

53
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,416
You're Nobody

54
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:13,280
So Julia developed a mistrust of the big building the big project

55
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:17,376
In places where people seem to love the glory of the grandiose

56
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,680
I'm also fascinated by those kinds of

57
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,472
I can't stay away from them

58
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,752
Case in point

59
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:23,520
Russia

60
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:26,592
Biggest country in the world makes Texans look like amateurs

61
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,360
Totally

62
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:31,968
The Russians are real pros in the department of tall towering and humongous

63
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,272
And not just from the Soviet past

64
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:38,624
Europe's tallest skyscraper 93 story says going up right now in Moscow

65
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:42,208
So they had to stop for a while on the 67th floor after I caught fire

66
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,072
Russia's Southernmost city Sochi is the biggest construction site in Europe

67
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,888
That's because so she's hosting the Winter Olympics

68
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:56,032
2014

69
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,080
I'm headed down there to check it out

70
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:04,224
I went on a two-hour bus ride from Sochi Center on the Black Sea up to the foothills of the caucuses

71
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,760
Weather building ski resorts

72
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:10,880
And maybe on that whole ride there were a couple of five minute stretches where I wasn't

73
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:13,184
Looking at a crane or a new hotel

74
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:17,791
Honey Chris Republic Chinese look for dessert

76
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,327
The Grease T

77
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,887
I also met this man named Alex a trivia

78
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,959
He went all his life in a cinder block house by the Black

79
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:28,287
I see the city wants to tear it down for new rail yard

80
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,591
They've already demolished the rest of his neighborhood

81
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:33,407
But trivia is appealed his eviction in court

82
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,455
He says construction workers

83
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,735
Just come up every day

84
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:37,759
Scrape is walls

85
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,527
Backhoe

86
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,719
We never asked the government for anything

87
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,999
Guess what trivia to say

88
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:50,815
And now the government wants to take everything away from us

89
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,143
He's painted slogans and red paint on his windows

90
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:54,911
Does things like

91
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,959
People live here and SOS

92
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:00,031
Sometimes construction workers throw rocks through the

93
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:03,103
They fall in shards of Cyrillic all over the

94
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,175
Big

95
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:10,527
Crushing small that's the way always seems to play itself out wherever there's a mess

96
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,575
Development but there's a theory

97
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:16,159
That big buildings don't just hurt little people they may in fact

98
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:18,975
Hurt the Builders of those buildings to

99
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:22,559
There is the well-known fact in real estate

100
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:25,375
That the great buildings tend to go up

101
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,399
At the end of

102
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,935
Recycle when everything

103
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,775
That's a Critic and philosopher Edward tenner

104
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:36,383
Well I was in Russia this last time I found an essay online that he wrote in 2001

105
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,455
Affect

106
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,479
Is

107
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,015
What I called

108
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,295
Appearance

109
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,343
The big building

110
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,367
The big structure

111
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:47,647
At

112
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,439
The time when things are starting

113
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:52,255
Counter site this idea known as the

114
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,279
Skyscraper pictures

115
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,095
Tall buildings correlate with bad times

116
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,119
The Princeton

117
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:00,191
The Empire State Building was conceived in the 1920s

118
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,239
But not finished until the Great Depression

119
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,543
When it was known as the empty State Building

120
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:07,871
The Sears Tower and the World Trade Center both opened in 19/7

121
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,663
33 on the verge of another egg

122
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,479
The people who run the NASDAQ

123
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:18,879
Change build the world's largest video display on Times Square in 1999 just a few months before the

124
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,671
Dot-com Bubble Burst and then nap.

125
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,439
Crashed

126
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,719
Xanadu effect

127
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,743
Is a symptom

128
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,327
People over reaching over

129
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,095
Planning

130
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:32,191
Thinking that everything is going to go on forever when

131
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,215
It's about to turn

132
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,823
I found Tanners Theory a little comfort

133
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,127
Plus I think Olivia Newton-John

134
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,943
Xanadu is one of the biggest songs ever written

135
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:46,527
I see what you're trying to do their Julia and it's not going to work

136
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,319
No Olivia Newton-John

137
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,599
Nicole Richie

138
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,135
I will allow

139
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,695
In Xanadu did Kubla Khan

140
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:59,839
A stately pleasure Dome decree was thinking of the movie Citizen Kane and Kane

141
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,863
Palace Xanadu

142
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,143
Okay then

143
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,423
Rosebud

144
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,983
Who's this ledge

145
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:11,103
So just as Citizen Kane build his Palace while his Empire crumbled

146
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:14,431
The big project can be a big bad distraction

147
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:18,783
Tender goes through several examples of the Xanadu affecting his original essay

148
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:23,135
There are plenty of instances of big projects that don't pre-stage any kind of crash

149
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:26,719
Enterocytes example of Cass Gilbert Woolworth Building

150
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:29,023
What up in a bun time of 1913

151
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,815
It certainly didn't hurt the Warwick

152
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:36,191
It's hard to say what these gigantic state-driven projects like the Olympics finit does Hannity

153
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,471
Plus

154
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:43,871
There are plenty of critics who argue that Building height much less bigness in general cannot accurately predict the downturn at all

155
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,431
Greatness is a strategy

156
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,711
That

157
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,015
Just about always spells

158
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,551
Unless it succeeds

159
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,599
Or you can say it's one that

160
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,415
That always succeeds except when it fails

161
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,207
And and there's really no

162
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,231
One way

163
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,535
That you can regard it

164
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,327
You have to see it as a

165
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,607
As a very

166
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,143
Powerful

167
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,703
Easy to

168
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,983
Misuse

169
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,519
But also

170
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,287
Tempting

171
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,311
Way to

172
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,079
Go about 4

173
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:18,943
Does energy affect might not provide that comeuppance

174
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,223
Julia desires

175
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,271
Design in any sort of downturn

176
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,831
A little person is still the one most likely to suffer

177
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:29,695
I guess the success or failure of bigness really does depend on where you stand in relation to it

178
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,487
Are you on top of City Hall

179
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,767
Or down below

180
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:35,071
Big places just amplifier reaction

181
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,143
Protest in Moscow

182
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,727
When we marched on one of the city's wide soviet-era Boulevard

183
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:44,031
Ordinarily I hate these boulevards

184
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,823
Because you can actually cross them

185
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,871
You have to find a pedestrian tunnel

186
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:48,639
Like

187
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,663
Sneak underneath

188
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:53,247
For a few hours Moscow suppressive bigness

189
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:54,527
ARS

190
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,319
The wide Road

191
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:58,111
Stalin-era skyscrapers

192
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,647
Block-long Institute

193
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,695
It all made us feel bigger to

194
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:02,719
That was freezing

195
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,279
Michael Cole

196
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,303
People

197
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,095
Smiling

198
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,375
Everybody is

199
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,423
That's my friend Vasily Sulkin

200
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,471
He grew up in Moscow but

201
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:16,543
He never experienced his grandiosity like this

202
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,847
As a grandiose stage for political

203
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:19,615
Expression

204
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:24,735
The way the crowds transform the National Mall in Washington DC or the Sean's Alizee in Paris

205
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,271
And even Edward tenner says

206
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,063
That's what can be wonderful about BigNik

207
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,879
It can Elevate people give them a sense of

208
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:31,647
Pride and

209
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,415
Purpose

210
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,463
I took a lot of the positive side

211
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,999
Or cities

212
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,815
Are the big buildings when they're done well

213
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,095
New York without

214
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:44,447
The Empire State Building New York without the Chrysler Building

215
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,287
New York without Rockefeller Center would really be a poor place

216
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,359
I keep thinking about Alex a cravat

217
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,383
Centos standoff

218
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,663
Developers in Sochi

219
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,735
Sometimes he goes out in films his confrontation

220
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,503
Construction work

221
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:06,975
I posted one of the film's up on 99percentinvisible. Org everyone speaking Russian but it's not hard to understand what

222
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:07,743
What is going on

223
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:13,119
Preview to put some of his things in a metal storage unit behind his house

224
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,167
The worker showed up with a huge

225
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,447
Crane haul it away

226
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:21,055
Career test do they work for in the supervisor this big Burly guy says

227
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:23,103
We are building the Olympic facilities

228
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,919
Then they hook up the crane while craviotto shelter

229
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:37,439
You can see a big building under construction behind millions of visitors.

230
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,463
During the Olympic Games

231
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:41,279
You can see the bones of what's going to be a soaring roof

232
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,583
A stately pleasure Dome

233
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,887

Daddy long legs utf8 legs to fix out of the darkness by

Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like a dad

Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine even worse the cops think that I had

Something to do with it

268
