In 1998 Dr Gary Kaplan the CEO of Virginia Mason Medical Center in Seattle

27
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:07,744
Received some bad news

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,512
About as hosp

29
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:09,792
It was losing money

30
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:13,120
But voices David Weinberg who's doing our reporting for us today

31
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,400
So back to the story

32
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:19,776
Is that loss is at Virginia Mason Dr Kaplan start studying how other hospitals are managed

33
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,568
We started scouring the country

34
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:24,384
Looking for a hospital with a management system worth it.

35
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,432
And if you're anything like me when you hear the phrase

36
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,456
Management

37
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,224

40
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,624
The hearing a lot of

41
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,928
Either complete nonsense

42
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,464
Or common sense

43
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,816
Tarted up with unnecessary jargon but really all you need to understand here is that

44
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:46,656
Dr Kaplan was looking for a hospital that have processes and procedures

45
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:48,960
Or better than what it was already using

46
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:51,008
But he never found one

47
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,288
So instead

48
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,824
He ended up in Japan

49
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,848
At a Toyota fact

50
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:55,872
Yep

51
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:56,896
The automobile

52
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:57,920
I think about

53
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:02,528
This is a very smart physician who goes around the country

54
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,064
Looking for a great manager

55
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,600

System to healthcare

60
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:18,912
He doesn't Dr Kaplan told his staff they would be changing everything about the where they operate

61
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:21,216
And the changes were based on a car company

62
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:25,568
And that the doctors and nurses should refer to their new teachers as sensei

63
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,104
Response

64
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,128
Was not pretty

65
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:30,432
There was a lot of Anger from

66
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,736
People within his organization

67
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,272
Led by the doctor

68
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:38,880
And this whole multi-year overhaul started with a ball

69
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,416
A blue your

70
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,536
The staff met with a Sensei and he took out the ball blue yarn and a map of the hospital

71
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,816
And he told the staff

72
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:49,632
To trace the path a cancer patient would take

73
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,168
On a typical visit

74
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,704
For chemotherapy

75
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,240
And then the yarn when

76
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,008
Cross tattoo

77
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:57,056
Couple inches and then it maybe went up

78
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,104
5 in

79
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,128
To where they'd have

80
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:02,688
To get their blood drawn and then they would go up

81
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:06,272
To the 14th floor and on the cardboard that was like maybe 4 in

82
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:10,880
Which is above that Joellen is a nurse manager at Virginia Mason

83
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:11,648
To come

84
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:18,047
And see their doctor which was in a different location was so big on our board that we just had to keep wine

85
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:24,447
Finding it around itself that sucker Henry Otero creating kind of this circular maze like

86
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:27,775
You would wind a yo-yo when we looked at it we were amazed

87
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,567
At how far patients

88
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,335
Travel

89
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:33,407
We were asking oncology patients who are

90
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,479
Their oxygen carrying capacity

91
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,015
Password is compromised

92
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,039
Because the chemo

93
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,063
Therapy

94
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:44,159
Destroys a lot of red blood cells so that makes him short of breath

95
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,951
And here were asking patient

96
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,743
Things to do this who are short of breath.

97
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,511
To begin with

98
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:49,535
So is this

99
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,815
It was appalling

100
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,863
To us and I think it was

101
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:58,495
That mapping of the flows of medicine and the patient understanding the patient Journey was

102
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,031
That I

103
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,311
Eye-opening moment

104
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,335
That you realize

105
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,639
You don't really know what

106
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:09,503
What's going on the blue yarn told the story of what Virginia Mason was doing wrong

107
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,831
We just didn't we couldn't conceive of it intellectual until we saw

108
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:19,231
In the story it told was not a good one to dr. Otero thought he was providing exceptional care for

109
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,535
They basically came into my

110
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,303
Exam room

111
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,583
And they laughed

112
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:29,727
And I really said I'm a great doctor look at this great care I give I see them I send them out and

113
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,007
Another day just mess

114
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,031
Feel like temperature

115
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:34,079
Great experience of having care here

116
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,895
Then he saw the twisting path of the blue yarn

117
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,199
Oh how awful it is for them

118
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,735
How awful it must

119
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,759
Speed to really

120
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:44,319
Weight everywhere along the way

121
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,367
And that I was contributing to that

122
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,135
And that

123
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,927
It became an intolerance

124
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:49,951
Spell 82

125
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,999
I couldn't accept it anymore

126
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,815
Six months after that first meeting

127
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:57,631
Doctor Mecklenburg the hospital's chief of Medicine

128
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:00,959
Let a group of staff on a 3 week trip to Japan to meet with a

129
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:06,335
And so they pulled out the schematic essentially an architect's drawing

130
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,383
Various parts of

131
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:09,919
Virginia Mason Medical

132
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,455
And

133
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:14,271
The Sensei kept pointing to these areas

134
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,319
Saying what is that and

135
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,343
Dr Mecklenburg

136
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,879
I would say well that's a waiting

137
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,927
And this happened over and over

138
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:21,695
Again

139
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,999
The waiting area and as this was happening

140
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:24,767
That's a waiting area

141
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,047
The sensation

142
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,095
To him to be getting increasingly angry

143
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,655
And he says to Mecklenburg

144
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:31,935
Why are there

145
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:32,959
So many waiting

146
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:33,727
Areas

147
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,495
Throughout this

148
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,799
Who's waiting

149
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:39,103
What are they doing what are they waiting

150
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,151
Dr. Mecklenburg

151
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,943
Says those are patient

152
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,991
They're waiting for us

153
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,039
And the sensei

154
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,831
Long pause

155
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,879
Looks quite

156
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:52,927
Furious

157
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,231
Looks directly at Doctor Mecklenburg

158
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,535
Front of Mecklenburg steam says to him

159
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,071
Aren't you ashamed

160
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,911
And Doctor Mecklenburg said at that moment he was

161
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,191
He was absolutely

162
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,727
If I told you to

163
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,495
Picture

164
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,519
A waiting room

165
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,335
You probably picturing a doctor's office

166
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:13,663
This is what we are trained to do when we go to the doctor we are trained

167
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,455
To wait for to a sensei

168
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,991
He's been trained in the Toyota production

169
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,295
Waiting is a form of waste

170
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,831
The number 110

171
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,367
TPS

172
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,391
Is to eliminate

173
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,159
Waste

174
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:27,231
The staff completely redesigned the cancer center

175
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:31,583
And they hired an architect who had first-hand knowledge of cancer treatment as a patient

176
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,655
You've designed the journey differently to really

177
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:35,679
Be

178
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,447
OceanFirst

179
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:39,263
The new design put patients on the outer edges of the building

180
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,335
Nice rooms with big windows that let in natural light

181
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,615
And provided views of the Puget

182
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:50,015
It sound but in order to give the patient these rooms they had to take them away from the doctors who had their off

183
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:50,783
Offices there

184
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,063
Do you want something that really

185
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,623
Was difficult for me because

186
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,439
Play I think we're always in the right direction with

187
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,207
The patient

188
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:02,047
I think for others who may be didn't go through that process

189
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:05,375
They saw it as a takeaway

190
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:11,263
You know I had to Great office the great win tonight putting me in this cubicle you know and I'm on the guy does all the work you know

191
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,799
You know what your night

192
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:13,567
It shouldn't have

193
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:16,127
The big office some doctors were so angry that quit

194
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,919
Dr. Otero

195
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,967
Did everyone who stayed realizes

196
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,247
It was the right thing to do for the

197
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:25,855
When I go there and I see them there and I see them looking out and I

198
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:26,623
II

199
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,463
Recognize that's a much better place than be gratified that

200
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,487
Decision was made

201
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:32,511
And

202
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:33,791
It's totally worth the right

203
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,327
Decision it's not even a question

204
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,119
Should have doubted relocating patients

205
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,143
It was just the beginning

206
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,447
Today the new cancer center has been dubbed

207
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,471
The cancerous

208
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,239
Spa

209
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,775
It was designed to

210
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,311
Create an environment of

211
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,335
Healing

212
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,127
So it has

213
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:52,223
Real pretty pale yellow color we use colors of nature

214
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:52,991
Nature cell

215
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,807
Yellow for Sunshine we have brown

216
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,575
To stimulate

217
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:57,599
Ingrained

218
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,367
Stimulating

219
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:01,951
And we have a water wall there's two of them

220
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,487
Actually it just so you don't think

221
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,255
But this new manager

222
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,047
System resulted only in

223
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,327
Natural

224
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,351
Colored walls in

225
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,375
Big windows

226
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:14,495
The whole reason why this blue yarn was unspooled to begin with was to save the hospital money

227
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:15,775
And it did

228
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,055
And it also

229
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,847
Made it a safer place

230
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:21,407
From 2007 to 2009

231
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,455
Virginia Mason was so much safer

232
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,479
But their insurance

233
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,759
Expensive decline

234
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,551
Astonishing 37

235
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,319
2%

236
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:31,135
While simultaneously increasing the number of pages

237
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,159
Retreated

238
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:34,207
All without having to hire any Edition

239
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,511
And yet some people

240
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,559
Still scoff at the idea of Toyota in

241
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,327
Inspired manager

242
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,631
I was on a boat once

243
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:46,239
And someone said to me so you are you guys still building Toyotas in your basement

244
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:49,311
And that was that was a real

245
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,079
I mean I was

246
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:50,847
Send it

247
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:55,455
Because I knew that what we're doing here is a really good and I said to him

248
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:57,759
You know you can say what you want

249
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,039
2

250
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:02,367
Make fun of what we're doing but we're trying to do the best

251
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,695
This complete upheaval of the medical industry

252
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:08,511
Stemmed from a single thread of blue yarn

253
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,303
Became especially poignant

254
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,607
When the staff visited Japan for the first time

255
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,655
Ansan exhibit at the Toyota his

256
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,423
History Museum

257
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,959
It was an automatic Loom

258
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:22,079
That was where the team learned that the Toyota production system was in fact born quite literally

259
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,127
From a single thread of yarn

260
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,431
Might have even been blue

261
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:29,247
Toyota was originally a textile

262
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,295
In 1902

263
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,599
Sakichi toyoda invented a selfie

264
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,623
Correcting Lune

265
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,647
I would stop

266
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,951
The thread was broken or woven incorrect

267
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:43,327
That this the museum is a story of continuous process Improvement

268
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:47,423
You start with backbreaking work on a manual Loom

269
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:50,495
That is producing defective product

270
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,567
And you put in the first components of ergonomics

271
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,615
Putting the person sitting up in

272
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,639
Instead of sitting on the

273
00:10:56,895 --> 00:11:03,039
The floor then you start making automatic lamps and improve the Machinery then you start developing mistake proofing into the prom

274
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,087
Process that if any of the weave or the West

275
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,623
Breaks the machine stops

276
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,159
Improve the machinery

277
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,463
Function is time goes on

278
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,999
Speed and velocity

279
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:16,351
I see that at Virginia Mason we're still just we just gotten off the floor

280
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,375
Sitting on the chair

281
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:24,031
We got a couple of mistake proofing things in the iron and we someday we might be an automatic Loom but that might be 34

282
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,055
40 years from now

283
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:25,823
But

284
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,151
We've got a long way to go to mistake-proof healthcare

285
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,687
Do it in a cost-efficient

286
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,455
Manor

287
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:38,879
99% invisible which produces Wheat by David Weinberg

288
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,415
With help from me Roman Mars

289
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:42,719
Who's made possible with support from the lunar

290
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:43,999
Making a difference

291
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,023
With creativity

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:51,423
It's a project of kalw 91.7 local public radio in San Francisco the American Institute of Art

296
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:19,583
Before we go I want to tell you about the body genius a five-part series from fellow radiotopia show the truth

297
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,375
The body genius is a dark

298
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,399
Comic mystery

299
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:27,263
That whines through a treacherous fictionalized Hollywood we're looking the part

300
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,799
Might cost you your life

301
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:34,175
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

302
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:38,527
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

303
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:42,879
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like a dad

304
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:47,231
I'm having I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

305
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:53,631
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main got to know how to do that kind of thing if you

306
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:59,263
2 days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

307
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:05,663
Was found dead in my private gym crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

308
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:11,295
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it now

309
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,343
I need to clear my name

310
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:19,743
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes to find them

311
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:28,703
