I'm Roman Mars

25
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,384
One of the most exciting things in sports is to see a truly great player shatter all previous attempt

26
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,784
About what is possible to achieve Ligety

27
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,344
Millwall fans applaud

28
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,928
Announcers lose their minds

29
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,256
Opposing team scramble Define strategies.

30
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,144
In basketball they tried to stop Shaquille O'Neal by immediately following him when he got the ball

31
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,192
So that he'd have to shoot from the free throw line

32
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,752
Which he wasn't very good

33
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,824
Best strategy became known as the hack-a-shaq

34
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,152
Cuz he really have a hackashack call

35
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:59,552
I don't believe it 5 seconds in soccer opposing teams continuously file the great Argentina

36
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:05,952
Player Leo Messi to keep him from dribbling to their defense

37
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,512
Absolutely

38
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,048
These tactics

39
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,840
Stop the great players

40
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:12,864
Can be aggressive

41
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:15,680
And they often stretch the limits of the rulebook

42
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,728
That's neupane bringing us up

43
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:18,496
Story today

44
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:22,080
He's from 538 data journalism site owned by ESPN

45
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:24,128
But in baseball they did it differ

46
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,176
In baseball the solution to

47
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:28,480
Stopping the greatest hitter of all time

48
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:31,040
What's the actually redesign the game

49
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:31,808
Itself

50
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:39,488
It all started in the 1940s

51
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,256
With the Great

52
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,024
Ted Williams

53
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:47,168
Famously he would say that when he grew up he wanted to be the greatest hitter who ever lived

54
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,960
Ben bradlee Jr wrote that

55
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:50,496
Definitive biography of

56
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,104
Before a game in the clubhouse she would put up a mirror

57
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,152
And strip down to was

58
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:57,920
Skivvies

59
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,200
And swing a bat

60
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,224
Say

61
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,248
Ted Williams

62
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:04,064
I'm the best hitter who ever lived

63
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:05,856
Pardon my French

64
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,648
Not a humble man

65
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,440
Doug Williams but also not wrong

66
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:14,048
In 1941 the Young Red Sox Superstar finish the year with a batting average

67
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,072
406

68
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:18,400
Meaning of he got a head in over 40% of his at-bats

69
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,936
Which is incredibly good

70
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:23,264
No one has batted above 400 since Ted Williams

71
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,824
Ted Williams

72
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:32,480
The greatest hitter of them all

73
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,368
And Williams kept it up

74
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,184
Even left to fight in World War I

75
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,208
Came back

76
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,488
And was still the best

77
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,256
Best hitter in baseball

78
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,888
But in 1946 just as Ted Williams was on track for another record-breaking year

79
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:53,472
He came face-to-face with someone hell-bent on ending history

80
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:57,312
A guy with the Cleveland baseball team named Lou Boudreau

81
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:59,360
Boudreaux was a shortstop for the Indy

82
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,664
But he was also the manager of the

83
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:05,504
Because back then you could actually be both a player and a manager at the

84
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,272
The same time

85
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,576
He was an incredibly ambitious person

86
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:09,600
And a great player

87
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,904
But despite Boudreaux's success

88
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,952
There was this other player that got

89
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,232
All the attention

90
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,512
Ted Williams

91
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,280
The greatest

92
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,071
Hitter who ever lived

93
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,863
Williams-goss

94
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,143
Most of the headlines

95
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:22,911
Praise

96
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,959
Freshwater being such a great hitter

97
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,751
That's Russell Schneider

98
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:29,311
He covered the Indians for the Cleveland Plain Dealer

99
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,335
And became close with

100
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,895
Knowing Boudreaux's

101
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:33,663
Think I did

102
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:36,223
There's no doubt but this was a Clash

103
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:36,991
Eagles

104
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:37,759
Between William

105
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,527
Boudreaux

106
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,319
But Boudreaux had a plan

107
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:44,415
He knew that Williams almost always hit the ball to the right side of the field

108
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,951
Between first and second base

109
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,743
As the Indians manager

110
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,559
He could actually set up his team strategy

111
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,863
Specifically to beat Williams

112
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,911
Voice whisper.

113
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,191
Cleveland manager

114
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:59,519
Burning the midnight oil perfecting a new type of DP

115
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:03,871
Blue said the Hound is I'm tired of having Williams

116
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:04,639
The Beatles

117
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,175
And it is

118
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,199
This is what I want to do

119
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:12,831
Lou Boudreau decided that he would shift three players from the left side of the field

120
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:13,855
To the right

121
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,391
He put a wall up

122
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:20,767
3 infielders between first and second base with a trio of outfielders backed up behind them

123
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:21,791
Now 6

124
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:25,119
Of the seven Defenders were standing on the right side of the field

125
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:28,959
Only one lonely outfielder remains on the left

126
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:32,031
The Familiar symmetry of the baseball diamond

127
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,055
Adventist Rock

128
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,591
And with it

129
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,639
The Ted Williams shift

130
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:37,663
Was born

131
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,711
I called the Boudreau shift

132
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,527
Some people call it the defensive shift or just

133
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,295
The chef

134
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:48,415
First time boudreaux use the shift on williamswood july 14th 1946

135
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,695
Fenway Park

136
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,999
When William stepped into

137
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:54,303
The place and saw the shift for the first time

138
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:57,119
He said that the Umpire what the hell is going on out there

139
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,399
They can't do that

140
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,679
But they could

141
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,727
Totally legal

142
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,775
And so Williams had a choice

143
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,823
Swing just like he always swan

144
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,359
Any might hit a homerun

145
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:11,967
But he might also hit the ball into the crowded offender shifted to his right

146
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:12,991
Or

147
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,783
He could go outside his comfort zone

148
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,319
Try to hit the ball to the left

149
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:20,415
Boudreaux knew they would be difficult for Ted to alter his swing

150
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,951
The song I'm selfish

151
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:22,719
The Slugger

152
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,743
Home run hitter

153
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,535
And that therefore he would

154
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,351
Continue doing it his way

155
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,399
Who wrote the Ted Williams biography

156
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,727
He was appealing to the williamses pride

157
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,263
And it worked

158
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,311
The first time Williams came up to bat he hit

159
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,103
Straight into the teeth of the shaft

160
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,919
In fact he hit the baseball right to Boudreaux himself

161
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:44,223
Standing directly between first and second base

162
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:52,415
Boudreaux kept using the shift on Williams and pretty soon other teams were using it against him to

163
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:57,023
Wasn't long at all maybe within a week or two that the rest of the American League

164
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,047
Was adopting it

165
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,351
The Williams argued that

166
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:03,423
No he wasn't going to alter his natural swing

167
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,983
But the fans were showing up at

168
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,519
The park to see him hit

169
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:11,871
In interviews William said he thought the ship shaved about 15 points

170
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,407
Off of his lifetime batting a

171
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:14,943
Back

172
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,271
Probably the only tactic that ever actually had an effect on head while you

173
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,575
Eventually Ted Williams retire

174
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,343
And the chef

175
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,647
It more or less disappeared from baseball

176
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,951
A lot of managers were hesitant

177
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:28,255
To use it because it didn't always work

178
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,559
When it goes bad you look

179
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,119
This is John Dewan the author of The

180
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,143
Fielding Bible

181
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,959
And the guy you'd be safe calling The Godfather

182
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:37,727
Shift date

183
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:40,031
And he says for a long time

184
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:45,151
Teams didn't have the kind of data that would back up the idea that risk would pay off overtime

185
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,711
You know they weren't real strong Analytics

186
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,527
Back in the seventies and eighties that could tell you

187
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,295
I just kind of think

188
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:53,599
Would work but then sabermetrics came along

189
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:59,743
Sabermetrics is a movement in baseball that started in the 90s to collect data and study it to find advantages

190
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:06,399
Suddenly GM's in front office is across the major leagues were focused on this idea that to win without spending much

191
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,167
How much money

192
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:09,471
All you had to do was look at the numbers

193
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,287
Enter the Tampa Bay Rays

194
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,079
Formerly known as The Devil Rays

195
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,383
It was regarded as

196
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,431
You know maybe the worst franchise in all the bass

197
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,479
That's Jonah Keri

198
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,271
A journalist who wrote a book about the rain

199
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,575
They just didn't really understand what it took to win

200
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:30,975
This is bad baseball defensive miscues have cost a Devil Rays

201
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,255
Dearly in the 8th

202
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,095
But things started changing for the rights in the mid 2000

203
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:39,167
Stuart Sternberg former partner Goldman Sachs

204
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,959
Decided he was going to buy the tea

205
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,519
And with him he brought a bunch of other Wall Street

206
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,567
You know number guys

207
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,335
Quad

208
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:49,407
Guys who are good at using data to find hidden

209
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,175
Advantages

210
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,455
Is Siri was

211
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:54,783
Let's just succeed and be 2% better than the competition

212
00:08:55,295 --> 00:09:01,439
The Rays numbercruncher study the data and they discovered a really efficient tactic that can help their fielding and defense

213
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:02,719
Atactic

214
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,535
Dredged up from baseball distant past

215
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:06,815
You guessed it

216
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,095
The defensive she

217
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:11,167
The shift really is a perfect example of an extra toe

218
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:15,775
2% Advantage because this doesn't work all the time Infected fails quite a bit

219
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:20,383
But the Rays didn't have much to lose so they decided to take a risk and bring back the chef

220
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,919
And they hire manager

221
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,711
The team who's on board with their plan

222
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:25,503
A guy by the name of Joe Maddon

223
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,527
And right away

224
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,063
Madden starts using the show

225
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,343
Death on all kinds of

226
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,111
Different headers

227
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:36,511
Joe Maddon he's kind of the doctor and the master of the defensive shift

228
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,279
Against Hardy

229
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:42,399
The Joe Maddon has come up with all kinds of interesting shifts this year She'll follow me you don't really ride

230
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,167
See this type of shoe

231
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:43,935
Just all that often

232
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:45,983
And all the sudden

233
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:48,287
Just a disaster of a team

234
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,311
Airtight in the

235
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,847
You can score runs off their pictures

236
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,343
From nowhere they transform themselves from a

237
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,903
Petrol doormat to a championship contender

238
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:07,231
And the shift was right at the center of their resurgence

239
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,023
The shift caught on

240
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,583
All the sudden every team the league started shifting

241
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:15,679
In fact other teams began shifting against the Rays on best hitters

242
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:20,799
Including this guy my name is Carlos Pena net play Major League Baseball 414ce

243
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:25,663
Carlos Pena grew up playing baseball and a kid in the Dominican Republic

244
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:28,223
And being a power hitter I believe

245
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,271
Was his ticket to the US

246
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:36,927
We swing our way you know off the island we have two other stuff that's the way we but we were taught you know we want to make some

247
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:37,951
You better

248
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:38,719
Swinging

249
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,487
Empower

250
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,167
And swing for power heat

251
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:47,935
Dead

252
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:48,959
Carlos Pena height

253
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:49,727
46

254
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,495
Home runs in

255
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,799
In 2007 while playing for the Rays

256
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:55,871
Right around the same time Joe Maddon was reintroducing

257
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,151
In the shift to the Major League

258
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:04,575
And there's a high fly ball back into right field number 46

259
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,343
1007

260
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,367
846

261
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,135
2008

262
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,415
Bad to shift on

263
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:13,279
And the shift is absolutely a killer

264
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:21,727
Ground ball right into the teeth of a shift and Lopez

265
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:28,127
I'm short right field throws out Pedro

266
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,919
Let me know if this is going to be

267
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:35,039
You know for the rest of my career and sure enough and that's exactly what happened

268
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:38,879
Anna Johnson

269
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:42,463
Newhattan plate between first and second in the ship

270
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:46,303
Even the greats like pain yet can't hit home runs all the time

271
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,583
When Penny was shifted on

272
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,863
He had to make a decision

273
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:53,727
Do I swing my natural swing and maybe get a homerun or maybe hit straight into the shaft

274
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,007
Where do I change my

275
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,543
Eventually

276
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,127
Unlike Williams whose ego led him to try to power through this shift

277
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,687
Pena started to adopt another tax

278
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:07,807
He did something Ted Williams it only tried a handful of times during his whole career

279
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:14,463
Shifters on Prytania

280
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,767
Carlos Pena

281
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:17,791
Budget

282
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,327
Be humble but

283
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,375
There's nothing pretty about this move

284
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:25,215
You just kind of bummed about with your bad and it dribbles out onto the field

285
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:30,591
Bunting with something that players traditionally did just to move their teammates from one base to another

286
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:33,663
For Carlos Pena turn the butt into his own

287
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,687
Secret weapon

288
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:38,527
Using the bundt pan you could tap the ball toward third base

289
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,575
Where no one was around to pick it up

290
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,367
And it worked a lot of the time

291
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:45,183
Even if you didn't always feel good about using it

292
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,975
It felt like I was giving in

293
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,535
You know like I was saying okay

294
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,583
You guys got me I'm just going to buy

295
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,119
That's kind of silly but

296
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:57,471
In reality sometimes says prideful athletes we think that

297
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,239
No man

298
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,007
Play the game

299
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,311
Daniel knew he had to swallow his pride

300
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:04,127
But it went against everything he had learned growing up

301
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,919
I grew up watching

302
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,199
Comanche

303
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:09,247
Home run

304
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,527
That's what was celebrated

305
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,063
You know no one said

306
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,111
Grapevine Sun

307
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,999
Painless bumps though they were

308
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:24,863
Really great at one point in his career he was 15 for 25 on bunts against

309
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:25,631
The ship

310
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:28,447
Carlos Pena become the most prolific bunters

311
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:30,751
In the majors against the ship

312
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,287
Fastball inside

313
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:38,687
How about that great white

314
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,735
Front by Pina

315
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:46,879
Pena says his success at combating the chef has actually changed the way the game is played

316
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,671
But he's not happy about

317
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,719
Man that shift is just a

318
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,023
Images of shift is something that

319
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,327
I wish they could get rid of

320
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,399
New baseball commissioner Rob Manfred actually agrees with

321
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:01,983
Siri is talking to ESPN about how he wants to improve

322
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,287
Things like eliminating shifts

323
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,335
I would be open to those

324
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:10,175
Mannford thinks the shift makes the game less

325
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:13,247
Exciting because it makes it harder for teams to score run

326
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,551
He also thinks it's just happening

327
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,575
Too much now

328
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:21,695
Shift is on as the shift is on there it is

329
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,487
Ship design

330
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:26,047
The shift is on for the Rockies defensive

331
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:32,703
In many ways the fight about the chef has become a fight over the nature of the game

332
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,751
Ever since sabermetrics came along

333
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,031
Baseball fans

334
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:36,799
Pundits

335
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:37,567
Players

336
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:41,151
Have bristled at the idea that on-field decisions

337
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,455
Are basically a product of data analysis

338
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,783
That could be maddening that too many players just like weight

339
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,319
This kid

340
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,087
From Harvard

341
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,623
Who has never

342
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,671
You know throwing a baseball

343
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:56,511
It's deciding the future that angers

344
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,047
Like you wouldn't believe

345
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:01,631
But unless there's a rule change the field will keep shift

346
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:02,911
Pause it

347
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:03,679
Works

348
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,215
It's huge

349
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,495
It is really here

350
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:09,567
According to John Dewan the author of The Fielding

351
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:13,151
It can help win about three extra games a year

352
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,431
Which is

353
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,711
3 wins

354
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:18,783
I think every single year has separated

355
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,063
18

356
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,343
I'm getting into the playoffs

357
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:25,695
Tinder not going to give up that competitive advantage

358
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:28,511
So now it's a fight between the number guys

359
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:29,535
In the traditional

360
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,839
Between the Nerds and the jocks

361
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,631
Decide the design

362
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,399
Have the game

363
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:38,239
In the meantime if my boys ever decide to take a baseball

364
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,519
I'm going to make sure and tell him

365
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:40,799
Bright Bugz
