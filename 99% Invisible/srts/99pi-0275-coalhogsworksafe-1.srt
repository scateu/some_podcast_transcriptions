I'm Roman Mars

23
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:14,496
Ronnie Johnson still remembers the first time he went underground

24
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:19,872
He and a handful of other Coal Miner's piled into a little trailer and descended into the mine

25
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:21,920
We're going down to their hitting bumps

26
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,200
Running over Little Rock

27
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:23,968
Stop

28
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:27,552
And I remember laying in that little trailer and

29
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:31,392
The roof was actually so close to me

30
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:34,464
Betabel by my hard hat with almost 50

31
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:35,744
Route

32
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:41,888
When they got down to the bottom Ronnie's boss handed him a wrench and told him to open a nearby waterline

33
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,936
But someone had forgotten to

34
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:44,704
The water off

35
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,752
Blackwater just started

36
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:47,776
Brian May

37
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:50,080
Sprite all in my face

38
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:52,128
Can all of them out something wet

39
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,664
I just like

40
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,200
Spell up against the real

41
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:57,248
You know the wall or cold

42
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:00,576
And I thought to myself what have I done

43
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:10,304
As a new minor in a dangerous industry Ronnie had to go through an intensive orientation process before

44
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,840
This first trip Underground

45
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,632
Best producer Irina zhorov

46
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:16,192
Ronnie's actually my partner's father

47
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:18,240
He lives in Northern Alabama and

48
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,800
On a recent visit as a family cook dinner

49
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,848
Ronnie and I went out to his Workshop

50
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:23,872
He likes to sit

51
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:24,640
Smoke

52
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,688
With only the dogs and cicadas

53
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,456
S4 company

54
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,736
Somewhere else you want to do

55
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,016
I don't care

56
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,416
He told me about how he saw through 40 hours of training and safety classes

57
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,976
Before going down into the mines

58
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,280
At the end he was issued a hard hat

59
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,328
That identified him as a rookie

60
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,864
The hard hat was yellow

61
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:48,192
It was like you stood out from here to the Rogue

62
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:49,984
Terrible

63
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,008
It was terrible

64
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,056
Was a terrible cuz you'd get

65
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,848
You get like crap from the other men

66
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:58,176
Oh yeah yeah everybody knew you would have a rookie you know and

67
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:00,224
Just you know practical jokes

68
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,016
Nothing serious

69
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:05,856
In addition to this terrible yellow hard hat

70
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,392
The safety man that is mine

71
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,672
Also gave him

72
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,440
Sticker

73
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,720
Yeah it was there

74
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,512
Take a right here

75
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:16,096
It's a red rhombus about 2 by 2 inch

76
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:18,144
With a reflective White Center

77
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,680
ABC

78
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,728
Amy Says always be careful

79
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:25,568
But ABC was a company named Alabama

80
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,616
By Products Corporation

81
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:30,176
Ronnie got a few of these stickers back then

82
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:34,272
He put one in a box and one on his brand new yellow hat

83
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:37,088
This was just the beginning of Ronnie sticker collect

84
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,880
After 34 years is a minor

85
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,928
He now has several photo albums

86
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,720
Filled with thousands of stickers

87
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,512
Some are inside jokes

88
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,072
Some commemorate big events at work

89
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,632
Lots of other coal miners across the

90
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:52,192
The country have collections just like Ronnie's

91
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:54,240
Miners use the stickers for

92
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:57,824
Safety and for communication and as a kind of currency

93
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,848
Down in the mines

94
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,944
It would just walk homeowners did you know kids collect baseball cards

95
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,736
In a coal mine

96
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,528
You know that's all you had really would

97
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,296
To collect

98
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,064
You can always

99
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:08,832
Call Monica

100
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,160
One of the darker

101
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,696
List of all working

102
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,232
Underground mine

103
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:19,583
Since the beginning of underground mining

104
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,631
One of the biggest dangers in the

105
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,167
Has been the darkness

106
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,239
Wood shutters

107
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,479
Open flame

108
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:45,695
The darkness makes accents more likely and even though technology has improved to make Minds brighter and safer

109
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:48,767
Still an issue the culture of mining to a certain degree

110
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,071
Has been shaped by the level of risk involved

111
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,607
What cultures

112
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:54,143
Have very strong cultures

113
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,167
Especially

114
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:57,471
I want that face Danger

115
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:01,567
Like mining of firefighting police work

116
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,847
The military

117
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,895
Deep sea fishing Etc

118
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,431
This is a lame Cullen

119
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,223
She's an occupational if not

120
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,039
And she spent a lot of time with minors

121
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:13,343
Like actually down in the mines with them

122
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,391
Money has a very strong cultural

123
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,183
I think the reason is

124
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:23,327
Because people who work underground are well aware of the fact that every day you go in you don't know if you're coming out

125
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,143
The first time Colin went down into a mine

126
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,959
She was told that she had to have something reflective on her

127
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:29,727
Hard hat

128
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,775
There's a lot of heavy machinery move

129
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,543
Nothing around

130
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,567
Trump buses

131
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:36,127
To the shears roof bolters and other tools

132
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,151
Yeast extract

133
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:42,015
Cole people get hit do they get run over they get crushed by mobile equipment

134
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:46,623
And so reflective material increases the visibility of the people underground

135
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,671
We put a strips of

136
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,975
Reflective tape on the back of a hard hats

137
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:56,095
But then it became pretty obvious that other people had other things on their hard hats

138
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,887
And these were stickers

139
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:03,775
The stickers had originally been little advertisements that the manufacturers

140
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,567
Of mining equipment handout

141
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:10,175
Even before the late 1960s when mining safety laws started

142
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,735
Requiring reflective materials Underground

143
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,527
Miners use those stickers

144
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,551
Stay visible.

145
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,319
To each other

146
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:19,135
What is time past the stickers evolved

147
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,415
They became more personal

148
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,207
It's hard to tell minor stories

149
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:25,791
In a mine companies themselves started printing stickers for their workers

150
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:29,375
They went from simple ads to signaling and identity

151
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,167
Knees are sort of

152
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,703
Their symbols

153
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,751
Symbols of the mining industry and that you're part of it

154
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,031
Picture of minor

155
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:42,431
After a year in the Alabama Mine Ronnie swapped out his yellow hard had for a black one

156
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,735
Which meant he was no longer a rookie

157
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:45,759
With that

158
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,039
Kenmore stickers

159
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,343
Stickers always came in twos

160
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,927
One went on his hard hat which he actually brought out to show me

161
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,487
So where's your 6 inches of reflective tape

162
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:58,303
I probably coming out my nipple stickers

163
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,351
Alabama stickers

164
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,679
The other sticker he saved for his growing collection

165
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:07,519
A minor showed Ronnie how to keep the stickers organized so

166
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,287
Each week

167
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:11,103
Sit down and put the new stickers in an album

168
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,383
What's this one

169
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,687
The Grim Reaper looks like Donna

170
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:18,015
It says umwa I say

171
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,319
Union sticker I'm sure you've got some

172
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,599
Going to do with black long

173
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:26,463
Managers and the safety man and his mine gave him stickers with the my name

174
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,791
And is Union game stickers with Union messages on them

175
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:34,655
One of his favorite stickers has the state of Alabama outlined in red and inside it says

176
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,191
Alabama coal miner

177
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,471
That kind of a

178
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:40,799
Pride thing though you know Alabama coal miner

179
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:45,151
As he gained more experience he got stickers commemorating his accomplishments

180
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:51,039
She worked at a company early on that counted the amount of coal mined by the number of cars feel during a shift

181
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,087
Something like a hundred cars with

182
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:53,855
Was okay

183
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:57,695
But Ronnie has a sticker that says his team mind 150

184
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,487
E-cars in one shift

185
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:01,791
And then they sticker says 150

186
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:04,095
Car club with a little Play Bunny

187
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,631
Playboy Bunny on there

188
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:09,471
He also has one commemorating 225 cars in a shift

189
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,495
Which is a big deal

190
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,799
You have a big run in the next night you're

191
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:18,175
Outside and all the guys that didn't have such a good run or whatever and your boss is going around

192
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,735
Giving you these stickers and every other star

193
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,271
How many Senate

194
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:28,671
In the 1960s and 70s a number of major mine safety laws were passed in the US

195
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:35,071
Anna Lane Cullen started working at a new agency that was responsible for studying and enforcing safety in the mine

196
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,143
For years she researched mining culture

197
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:42,751
In the 2000s the National Institute for occupational safety and health a federal agency

198
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:46,335
Heard her to develop a safety training program for coal miners

199
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,615
By that time

200
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,407
She knew who she was dealing with

201
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:54,271
So she knew she might be facing some skepticism from the minors she was trying to reach

202
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,551
I don't look like a minor

203
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,855
I'm a woman and

204
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,647
Most of them are not

205
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,415
So

206
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:06,815
Getting them to work with me especially when I was a representative of the federal government and you know they

207
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,351
Our little Leary to

208
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,887
Going to work with government

209
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,727
Maryland had seen that the miners were really into the stickers

210
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,775
And she figured she could use them

211
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:16,799
To gain their trust

212
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:19,615
And to convey messages about safety

213
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:23,199
But you knew just putting work safe on a sticker wouldn't cut it

214
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:25,759
She needed something to grab the miners attention

215
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:28,319
We were working out and

216
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,343
Eastern Kentucky

217
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,647
It was a money in community with the

218
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,927
Cultural ties to coal

219
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,463
And she started to notice

220
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,767
She be walking along with the safety guy

221
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,535
And

222
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:40,095
As we would approach another minor

223
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,631
He would squeal like a pig

224
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,935
I finally asked him I said Jessie

225
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:48,799
What's going on here why are they doing that and he said oh they're just saying they know I'm a Cole Haan

226
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,359
What is a Quahog annies

227
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,639
Quahog is hungry

228
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,175
Call Greedy for call

229
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,199
Can't ever get enough

230
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,735
Meaning

231
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,015
But you're ugly minor

232
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:02,367
Took the idea and design a sticker with a big muscular pig with a

233
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:04,159
Hard hat on and it says

234
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,951
Coal Hogs work safe

235
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,231
So what we were doing

236
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,279
Putting those two ideas together

237
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:11,327
That's you can be a Quahog

238
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,863
But you can also work safe

239
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,911
The miners loved it

240
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:17,727
Oh gosh I think we printed 3002

241
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,263
To begin with and I have

242
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,079
One little packet left that I'm kind of keeping as a

243
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:22,847
You know

244
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,615
Keepsake

245
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:26,175
Semicolons other designs were dead

246
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,479
13 made one with a dead Canary

247
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:31,807
Canaries were once used to check for bad air in a mine

248
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,855
But that was a long time ago

249
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,135
And the younger miners

250
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,159
Didn't get it

251
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:39,487
Other stickers catering to the raunchy humor in the mines

252
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:42,815
Didn't pass muster with her bosses in the federal government

253
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:46,143
For example they designed one sticker to remind minors to check

254
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,423
Check for gas in the mines

255
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:50,239
So what the this one was a

256
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,031
The back end of a donkey

257
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,335
And have the donkey kind of looking back

258
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,615
Back at you

259
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,639
And it said

260
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,687
Don't be an ass

261
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,711
Check for gas

262
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,807
I kind of have this little Cloud coming out

263
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,623
Gas can be really dangerous Underground

264
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,695
And donkeys were once used to carry coal out of the mines

265
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,975
NOAA weather

266
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:11,999
Thea

267
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:16,863
Folks in Washington didn't like that one but the miners loved it

268
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:23,007
Unless Elaine visit your mind it be hard to get one of these stickers

269
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:27,871
A lot of the stickers were Specialized or localized depending on what organization or company design them

270
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:30,175
That's part of what made collecting them fun

271
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,455
I have

272
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:34,015
Over 26000

273
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,063
Different stickers in my collection

274
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:40,159
And I've I've kind of come to believe that you either are collector or you're not

275
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:45,535
And if you're not a collector you just don't get it and if you are a collector you just really can't help yourself

276
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,583
This is Lenny Hanner

277
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,863
And I'm

278
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,423
Coleman from Southern Illinois

279
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:54,239
When is worked in coal mines for 40 years

280
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,287
He's a major sticker collector

281
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,103
At the height of his collecting in the 1980s

282
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:01,407
Heat exchange stickers with other collectors

283
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,687
Across the country

284
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:05,759
And go to sticker swaps almost every weekend

285
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,807
Those are meetups where miners Exchange

286
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,575
Pieces

287
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:11,647
Lenny says unique stickers were like currency in the mines

288
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:14,463
Way to buy or sell favors and help

289
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:17,791
Princess say you're a trucker and you rolled up the money for the big

290
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,815
Load of supplies

291
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,351
You asked him to minors

292
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,375
Help you unload

293
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,679
The first thing they wanted to know is

294
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,215
Do you have any stickers

295
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:29,055
Without stickers the miners wouldn't exactly rush to help

296
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,079
So

297
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:35,455
They all learned that they they had stickers in that truck when they arrive and that's the

298
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:38,271
Tend to get unloaded the whole lot faster that way

299
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:42,623
Lenny still works from mining company but above ground these days

300
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:46,975
He lives in an old mining town and a house that was once owned by Mining Company

301
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:51,071
Annie's got a full room devoted to mining memorabilia

302
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:54,399
I'm I'm married to the you know the most

303
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,959
Understanding woman in the world

304
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:01,055
He keeps his stickers in 27 albums organized by type of sticker

305
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:07,199
What's pretty by mining companies that one's equipment manufacturers gave out the ones focused on safety and Union issues

306
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,759
Some of them are especially sentimental

307
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:14,879
I have a sticker that I got from a friend of mine and he recently passed away

308
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:19,487
And I have just a couple stickers in my collection that really make me think of him when I see them

309
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:22,559
The sticker albums function just like photo albums

310
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:25,631
Reminding minors of their milestones and stories

311
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,679
They are just little

312
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:31,519
Pieces of our history of our past little mementos

313
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:36,127
I guess maybe like a postcard if you travel that you might pick up a postcard that

314
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,943
It remind you of something from the past

315
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:43,295
We can just see our past mining history there on the pages of the album

316
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:46,623
Of course just like with photos

317
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:49,439
Some of the darker memories don't end up in the album

318
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:52,767
In 2011 after more than 30 years in the mine

319
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:55,071
Signs my partner's dad Ronnie had an accident

320
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,447
We're living a thousand miles away in pace around in my living room as news trickled in

321
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,775
Eventually learn that his hand got pulled into a machine

322
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,055
And it took a finger

323
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:08,127
Down in Alabama he was rushed to a hospital

324
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,663
Useful to call his wife

325
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,431
Deborah

326
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,223
At first he didn't want to call

327
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,783
What happened in the mind stayed in the mind

328
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,063
But the nurse insisted

329
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,111
And Deborah happened to be nearby

330
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,415
I remember dad but looking at me

331
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,695
What you came in the rain

332
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:25,279
If at Ron Johnson how'd you get so dirty

333
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,095
You know like I mean I've been getting that wife for years

334
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:30,143
And I guess you never saw me

335
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,191
Diana my rubber boots

336
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,751
My wife was all black and

337
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:38,335
My hand was all wrapped up in a manual

338
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:41,407
He never really shared much about his life in the mine with her

339
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,175
Ace family

340
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:46,015
I guess I had never saw me like that I didn't I didn't I didn't tell him what I went through

341
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:50,367
The Seeker album stacked up in his cosy house

342
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,439
Only tell their stories to those who know how to read them

343
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:56,255
Ronnie says before he lost his finger

344
00:14:56,511 --> 00:15:00,095
Keep Calm 31 years without spending a night in the hospital

345
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,887
He never ridden in an ambulance

346
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,191
I never had an accident in the mine

347
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,983
That made him lose work hours

348
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:09,823
I caught up Rob Lowe 31 years in one night.

349
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,407
Ronnie never got a sticker

350
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,175
For that

351
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,951
So what are you do with a mind that no longer productive

352
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,743
Lots of things that turns out

353
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:31,583
Kurt Kolstad tells us about his favorite examples of adaptive reuse

354
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,351
Happiness

355
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,215
Between the beats

356
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,519
Bongs and Charter of our devices

357
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,287
We're immersed

358
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,847
The cluttered World a man-made sound

359
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,127
If

360
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:48,479
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexa

361
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:54,367
Is talking to me and my wife is in another room and a kid is another remedy for all hearing that voice

362
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,391
Technology

363
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,159
You talk to us

364
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,463
It is a creation of Sonic trash

365
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:01,535
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

366
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:05,119
Studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

367
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,911
To make them more human

368
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:11,007
Turn the living room lights on

369
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,799
Okay

370
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,335
Dim the living room lights

371
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,359
50%

372
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,151
Okay

373
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:23,551
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

374
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:26,367
Makes for a much more natural experience

375
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,415
Turn the living room lights on

376
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,999
Dim the living room lights to 50

377
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:32,767
80%

378
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:41,215
We're presenting two special episodes from 99percentinvisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation about how are sound

379
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,007
Landscape is impacting our health

380
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,567
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

381
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:48,383
Look for them Friday is May 17th and May 24th

382
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,151
Right here

383
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,687
NPI fate

384
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:55,039
We need to talk about something

385
00:16:55,295 --> 00:17:01,439
Constipation abdominal pain and bloating yourself it's not that bad you take laxatives modify your diet

386
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:04,255
But thinking about it all the time is frustrating

387
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:10,655
It doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again and you don't know why

388
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,959
Then it may be time to seek help

389
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:19,359
Go to oh my God. Info podcast we can learn more about your symptoms that's oh my God

390
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:21,151
. info / podcast

391
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,175
Oh my God

392
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:22,943
Dot and Bo

393
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,967
Flash podcast

394
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:28,831
We were attracted to the coal miner stickers because it was a cool way that design and the

395
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,879
Cultural mining intersected

396
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,671
And it brought to mind another

397
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:36,767
Interesting juxtaposition of design and abandoned mines

398
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,071
Kolstad Road about on the website

399
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:41,119
So I asked him to come to the studio and talk

400
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,679
I think a lot of people tend to have this

401
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,959
Idea that mines

402
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:45,727
Are these

403
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,263
Rickety

404
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,055
Dangerous places to go

405
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:53,407
I was rotting Timber frames holding up sections of a tunnel that could

406
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,687
Collapse on you at any moment

407
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,223
The reality is a lot of mines

408
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:59,295
Are much bigger than that and much more stable than that

409
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,575
And really I have

410
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,855
Promising futures

411
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:04,671
Doing much different things and they were designed for

412
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,695
What's a good example

413
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:09,279
So one example would be there's a really cool mine in Romania

414
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:12,351
That was actually first mine for salt

415
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:16,447
Nearly a thousand years ago and it's been used on an office's fault line ever since

416
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:18,239
So to really deep and it's really complex

417
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,519
And recently

418
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,567
I decided we're going to turn this into a fraction

419
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:23,359
So they made it a museum they made

420
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,127
Theme park

421
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,151
You go down there

422
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:25,919
And like

423
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:29,759
Boat around on this water and the pictures are just sort of Mesmer

424
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:34,367
They really let this place up so you can go down and really get a sense of the geology but also

425
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,415
Experience Underground

426
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:38,207
Cool are there any in the US

427
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,743
Yeah in Kansas there's a

428
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:40,511
Data Center

429
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:44,607
A little less exciting but it a little more functional

430
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:45,887
Does that I sent you the

431
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:46,655
Uses

432
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,679
The natural

433
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:51,007
You don't even temperatures in the protection of this mindspace

434
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,543
Old Limestone mines

435
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,335
Thousand servers

436
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,383
And you can imagine in a

437
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,663
If you're just trying to keep

438
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,687
E-service running

439
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,455
You know

440
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,735
Doing any kind of weather

441
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,271
The perfect place is just

442
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:06,623
And there's also

443
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,159
A research facility

444
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:11,743
That is doing experiments on dark matter

445
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:15,839
Far underground in South Dakota in an old gold mine it's about a mile deep

446
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,119
And

447
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,143
It turns out

448
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,679
That there's a lot of particles that

449
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:24,031
So just float through space and Bombardier atmosphere on a pretty regular basis

450
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:28,383
And getting below the surface they can get away from a lot of that noise and a lot more

451
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,663
Chemiclean experiment

452
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,967
Yeah totally

453
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,503
Unethical

454
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:36,319
And you know if they decide to destroy the universe

455
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,855
At least they're a mile Underground

456
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:42,207
Yeah I mean yeah right hope the hope the hope is that they'd only just destroy their lab in the mountains

457
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,791
So what's your favorite

458
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:48,863
My favorite is probably the Louisville Mega Cavern

459
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:49,887
Which is this

460
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,167
Huge

461
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,703
Huge underground space

462
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:53,983
In Louisville Kentucky

463
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,007
If you

464
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:57,567
Buy the argument that it's now a building

465
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:01,407
It's the largest building in Kentucky at about 4 million square feet

466
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:02,687
And

467
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:07,807
Basically this mine opened in the 1930s The Dugout Limestone for decades

468
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:09,343
Ali Karver this thing out

469
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,135
In the 1960s

470
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,695
Actually talked about using it as a fallout shelter

471
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:18,047
In case it the Cuban Missile Crisis went the wrong way they were paying it back

472
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:18,815
10 mm

473
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:19,839
The people in there

474
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:22,143
And then eventually it sort of fell into disuse

475
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,167
And

476
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,471
Tamiya investors can long to hey

477
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,495
We could do something

478
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:27,775
And they did

479
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:29,567
Basically they bought this thing

480
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:33,151
And they started you know putting businesses in there they started using it for

481
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:35,711
For storage because it started yet temperature Stables good place

482
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,479
Extra storage

483
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:37,759
And then

484
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:41,855
Ladies in the kind of weird and they started adding all of these kind of theme park element

485
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:42,623
Stuit

486
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:47,999
She can go take tram tours of the underground you can go take zipline tours there's a Ropes Course

487
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,535
At the heart of it all

488
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,583
One of the biggest functions is this

489
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:55,167
Huge huge 300000 + square foot

490
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,191
Bike Park

491
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,471
It's is like a BMX

492
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:00,799
Parkwood jumped and all that stuff

493
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,591
And they build those out of

494
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,359
All the sudden

495
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:09,759
Bill that was already carved out instead of laying around for the miners rights all they have to do is just going to pick up the dirty or shoveling over there

496
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:12,063
And they can make entirely new course

497
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:18,464
And we have some pictures of bees on our website a picture isn't a video of this on the website

498
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,768
Awesome thanks so much that's so cool

Before we go I want to tell you about the body Genie

516
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:27,072
Series from Bello radiotopia show the truth

517
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:29,888
The body genius is a Dark comic mystery

518
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:31,168
That whines through a

519
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:33,216
Treacherous personalized Hollywood

520
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:34,752
We're looking the part

521
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:36,288
Might cost you your life

522
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:41,664
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

523
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:46,016
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

524
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:50,368
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like a dad

525
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:54,720
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

526
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:59,072
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main got to know how to do that kind of

527
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,096
I think

528
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:06,496
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

529
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:09,824
Was found dead in my private gym

530
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,152
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

531
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:17,504
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

532
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,832
Now I need to clear my name

533
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:26,208
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes

534
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:27,232
To find them

535
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:35,424
