00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:38,816
You know the same

39
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,352
You can't judge a book

40
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,120
By its cover

41
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:44,704
Woodmagazine it's pretty much the opposite

42
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,472
He works here

43
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:49,056
You can and you should judge a magazine by its cover

44
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,592
Everyone is

45
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,152
They want you to

46
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,968
The cover of the magazine

47
00:01:56,224 --> 00:02:02,368
Is the unified identity for a whole host of ideas and authors and designers who created The Eclectic array of

48
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:05,184
Stories and articles and materials within each issue

49
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,280
And some would argue this identity extends to the reader as well

50
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,328
Magazine covers

51
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,352
Third person

52
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,704

53
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,984

54
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,264
Oh by your peers

55
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,056
And you are a bo3.

56
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:26,176
And this is different than being a Twilight reader or a DaVinci Code Reader

57
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,200
Moment In Time

58
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,224
Where's the magazine

59
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,784
Is a constant source of ever-changing

60
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:37,184
Content and that's why the design challenging

61
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:43,840
Magazine covers are a composition of text and visuals that are designed to express a specific identity

62
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,936
Hugo the phone girl

63
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:48,960
You got color

64
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:52,544
Secrets of magazine design

65
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:56,640
Reveals All This is Andy

66
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:03,040
Which is a block in Creative at Marie Claire

67
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:06,112
And a whole bunch of other magazines both in the United States and England

68
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:09,184
So we are two about covers starting from the top

69
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,208
Literally

70
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,768
Because that's where the name of the magazine always is

71
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:16,352
When you see a magazine

72
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,632
Best Central

73
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,168
If that doesn't happen everything else

74
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:25,568
And then you got to show them that this is the new issue the one they don't have yet

75
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,616
300 the last one

76
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:29,152
Is green

77
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,176
This one is blue

78
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,992
The photograph

79
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:35,040
Is the thing that creates really pound

80
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,064
Emotional

81
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:36,832
Connection

82
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:37,600
Weather radar

83
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:40,416
You see somebody you see the eye contact

84
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,976
Celebrity

85
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,256
On my level

86
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,096
But the photograph wasn't always part of the equation

87
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:50,912
The early magazine covers were recently illustrator

88
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,448
And so you looking at

89
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:54,496
Rockwell unisaw

90
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,520
Amazing Oliver

91
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,544
On the cover of Vogue

92
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,896
Andy had a few examples on hand

93
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,688
Like this one

94
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,456
Action

95
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,736
Which has

96
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:05,760
Redhatter

97
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,552
Women in short dresses

98
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,344
POTUS

99
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,672

100
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,232
Illustrator

101
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,512

00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:22,399
Paintings of the 60s

104
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:25,215
Men of the 60s were very imaginative

105
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:31,359
MB on the men's magazines a lot of major Publications actually had cartoon mascots on the cover

106
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,151
Some of them persist today

107
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:36,735
Like the Playboy Bunny Mad Magazine Alfred E Neuman

108
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:40,063
And the mascot of the New Yorker the monocle Eustace Tilley

109
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,623
Even UK Vogue an illustrated mask

110
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:47,487
Miss Exeter An Elegant 50-something woman who had an advice column about being a

A mustachioed skirt Chaser in a fedora

115
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,935
A lot of Esquire covers featured in

116
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,983
Until George Louis

117
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,823
George Lewis was the Pioneer in the industry

118
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,127
Who's the guy who made magazine covers sexy

119
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:06,687
He revolutionized the cover of Esquire

120
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,711
Using big

121
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,759
Pulled eye catching photographs

122
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,551

Spratly store module

124
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:17,951

In a man putting on lips

127
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,583
For the 60s

128
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,607
These were

129
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,631
Shocking

130
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:31,007
No more cartoon covers the crazy thing was that Louis didn't even work for us

131
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:36,127
My name is George Lois and I never had a role at Esquire he wasn't adman

132
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:42,527
He was behind a lot of the most famous ads of all time iconic 60s posters for American Airlines Xerox

133
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,111
And even political campaigns for candidates like Robert Kennedy and Ed Koch

134
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,671
Many people who dream about the covers

135
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:52,255
Call me do you want to make the best way I would never

136
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,791
I just did that covers

137
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,327
1962

138
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,887
Harold Hayes head editor of Esquire magazine

139
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,679
Ask Lois to do a cover for it

140
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:03,519
And a Louis tell the story hey is needed to cover from him in 3 days

141
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:09,919
Description of the 20 things in the Magazine spread

142
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,199
Have a photograph

143
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:16,063
Floyd Patterson the photograph of the Sonny Liston Floyd Patterson vs Sonny Liston

144
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,855
This is the upcoming heavyweight fight

145
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,903
The issue was going to come out

146
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:20,927
For the fight

147
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,975
And everyone was predicting that Patterson

148
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:23,743
Woodwind

149
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:24,767
And Lewis

150
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:31,167
Did a really got a thing

151
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,703
Laying flat

152
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,007
Dead in the ring

153
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,591
Knock down

154
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,919
So there's a good chance that a square would be wrong

155
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:44,991
And this could make the magazine look really bad

156
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,271
So bad

157
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:51,647
Can you imagine a major publication that predicted the wrong outcome of a huge heavyweight fight

158
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:54,207
Oh my God so embarrassing

159
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:56,255
But Harold hey is the editor of Esquire

160
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,279
Went along with it

161
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,303
And Louis

162
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,583
Actually

163
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,351
Call Dad

164
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:11,615
And everybody in America went crazy over their shoulder

165
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,639
Newsstand

166
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:15,199
I think 800000 how to get it wrong

167
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:20,831
Create a catalog of 92 Esquire covers

168
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:23,647
Most of them just as eye-catching and controversial

169
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,671
Dispersed

170
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,951
Because

171
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,047
He was able to

172
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,351
Potential

173
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:35,423

Apple presentation

176
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:41,567
No idea would just happen to be in the magazine

177
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:44,383
One big start image with little or no tax

178
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,175
They look almost like wall poster

179
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:51,039
And now many of them are in the permanent collection in the Museum of Modern Art in New York

180
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:54,623
Is radical an amazing world

181

The real estate vary depending on the kind of magazine

262
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,503
Celebrity weeklies always have their big cover lens

263
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,783
Splashed across the middle

264
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,319
And it's yellow

265
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,599
It's always just

266
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,647
It's yellow

267
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:14,047

It's not just White

273
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,055

277
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,711
And for the more lifestyle oriented

278
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:35,807
The location of the most captivating cover lines is the so-called hotspot

279
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:40,671
Immediately underneath the logout on the left hand side

280
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,975
Depends on which country you're in

281
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,791
How much of this has to do with the way in which magazines Iraq

282
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:49,119
Action stands jeans are very much designed around their rack

283
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,191
Hello magazine

284
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,727
I need the last OG review

285
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:57,823
Some England you get most of your headlines on the left side or the leading left Edge

286
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,103
British Invasion

Then there you have a wonderful presentation where you and you see the talk

Philly cigar best cover lines is high and close to the logo as we can on either side as Publications have

290
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,695
Many more cover lines from those in the UK

291
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:22,911
So magazines that don't rely on Newsstand sales look very different from magazines that do

292
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:27,263
And take Bloomberg time the New Yorker these mostly function on subscriber

293
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,567
User inside of magazines that use the hotspot

294
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:32,383
The same extent because they're not dependent on these stand soil

295
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,687
They are a little more Louis asked

296
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:37,503
Big photographs and pictures with not as much tax

297
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:41,599
New Yorker covers harken back to a pre-1960s illustration

298
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:44,415
Except when you encounter the New Yorker on the Newsstand

299
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,207
In which case was a little flat

300
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,487

301
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,279

Take pictures by themselves just don't sell like they used

304
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,935
It's about volume of content

305
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:56,703
Magazines

306
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,471

307

Been reassuring readers that is plenty to read inside

My name is David currito and on the design director for Esquire magazine the guy behind today

321
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,455
Which look nothing like Lois

322
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:45,343
I'm responsible for the look of the magazine from cover to cover my job is to pick

323
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,111
Photographers

324
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,391
Take all the images

325
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,671
Typography

326
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,463
Pick the size of the Type R

327
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:51,743
The color of the tie

328
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:52,511
Typography

329
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,791
The key word here is

330
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,559
Typography

331
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,351
My choice in typography

332
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,375
Definitely

333
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,399
Sets the tone

334
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,679
4

335
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:05,055
Corrido style is loaded with words

336
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,615
Overloaded

337
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,663
Loads the donut

338
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:12,735
Chris Kyle Texas all over the cover

339
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:15,039
In front of the celebrity behind the celebrity

340
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:15,807
Handwritten

341
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:16,831
Scroll down the side

342
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:17,855
Much of it

343
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:23,487
Completely illegible a lot of texture in the sense that there's an overwhelming

344
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,511
Illustrate

345
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:27,071
We have a ton of material inside the magazine

346
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:29,887
So much material that we can't possibly

347
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,423
Show it all to you

348
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,215
Undercover even though we'll try

349
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:36,799
The text in the image weave in and out of each other in such a way

350
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,079
That the words almost

351
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,103
Become the image

352
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:41,919
What we've been doing is kind of overwhelming your senses

353
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:42,943
With both

354
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,735
The photography and

355
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,527
The typography

356
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,807
Combined together

357
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,087
It's been a radical kind of

358
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:49,855
Thing on the news

359
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,671
And this is Esquires way of standing out

360
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,719
From all the other magazines on the rack

361
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:58,815
But they don't stand out in the same way Louis is covers dead in the 60

362
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:01,631
We're a little more formulaic but

363
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:06,239
Yeah we don't have the ability to

364
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,287
Do exactly what he did back in

365
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,055
In the day if that's me

366
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,919
It's hard to replicate design from the 60s because the audience is not from the sea

367
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:18,271
I think people are less shot today it's been in the past

368
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,039
I think it's

369
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:22,367
I think we've become so desensitized

370
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,159
22 imagery

371
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,463
But you can still be done

372
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:28,511
I don't know what's shocking now

373
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,559
Kim Kardashian and Kanye West

374
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,863
So Kim Kardashian and Kanye West it is

375
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,399
Celebrities sell

376
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:38,495
Lionel celebrity 9 out of 10 times and we've been with that model for a really long time

377
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:41,311
Louis is not so certain that this is the way to get attention

00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,543
Your words on the upper left-hand side

399
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,335
And the upper right-hand side

400
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:48,127
