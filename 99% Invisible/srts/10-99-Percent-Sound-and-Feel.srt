I'm Roman Mars

Beethoven continue to write music in resumes best music

28
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,424
After he lost his hearing

29
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,472
So you couldn't hear his music at all

30
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,520
You can only hear the construction in his mind

31
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,312
As architects

32
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,360
We have all sorts of.

33
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,384
Different ways of

34
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,152
Experiencing art

35
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:53,920
Architecture

36
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,712
Both and it's built forum

37
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,736
And it's creation

38
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:57,760
Through

39
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,296
Scale drawings and models

40
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,600
Besides our own mental Construction

41
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:04,160
So Christian he asks me what's more preposterous

42
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,952
Composing music you can't hear

43
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,232
What is an architect

44
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,512
You can't see

45
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:10,048
My name is Chris Downey

46
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,864
In case you haven't guessed it yet he's a blind

47
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:17,728
Chris Downey lost his side about 3 years ago after being an architect for nearly two decades

48
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:24,384
Clearly there wasn't any book out there on how to be a blind architect so really the best thing to do it is just to get out there and

49
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,432
Try and once I did that

50
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:32,832
Quickly realize that there are ways to perceive and understand drawings and design both in two dimensional

51
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:35,392
Form and in three-dimensional form and their

52
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,696
Any number of ways to react

53
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,232
Advance Auto

54
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,000
Create it

55
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,024
Just like anybody else

56
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:47,680
He couldn't do ultimately with translate the physical models that he can make by hand in today.

57
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:49,984
That he can input into a computer design program

58
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,752
But hey

59
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:54,592
That's not all bad excuse not to

60
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:58,944
Reproduction guy and get past that and focus on

61
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,784
Where I could really deliver value it started falling together pretty well on

62
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:06,112
The key is finding the right tools

63
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:06,880
In this case

64
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,416
Computers at talking to me fast

65
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,488
So that's the following

66
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,632
I can't understand anything

67
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:20,448
I can slow it down

68
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:23,520
Am I being more

69
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:27,360
Easier to hear it

70
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:30,432
If you had to listen to that all day long that's how fast the

71
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,224
ATM machines are windows

72
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,296
Go and listen to those two have your non-visual access to it

73
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,320
And it takes

74
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,088
So long

75
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,624
To get to what you need to do

76
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:39,904
You got to be faster

77
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,696
Lightspeed Lansing

78
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,632
Another key tool is an embossing printer that makes a raised

79
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:53,728
Braille. Version of the architectural plans that he's working on

80
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:58,080
I'm like a sided architect that can get a bird's-eye view of an architectural plan

81
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:02,688
When Downey runs his fingers over the embossed printed page

82
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,480
He experiences the plan

83
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,248
More like

84
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,320
An actual person traveling through the building one

85
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,368
As a sequence of vignettes

86
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,648
When you do that

87
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,696
Then you have a better chance

88
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:16,000
The really putting yourself in that space

89
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:19,071
And think about everything that's happening when you move through there

90
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,375
The typical sensory

91
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:23,423
Experience of the environment around us

92
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,959
80% of it is visual

93
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:31,359
Brain is overloaded with the visual information the other 20% becomes a lot more important in this allows for a

94
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,639
New appreciation for

95
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,663
For certain buildings

96
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,455
Like for example a much

97
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:37,247
Heated old San Francisco

98
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,807
Bus terminal the transbay terminal is coming down

99
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:40,831
And that'll

100
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:41,599
Hbase

101
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,623
Once there

102
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,671
It was not a perfectly delightful place

103
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,719
Visually it was a horrific place

104
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:49,279
Olfactory experience with pretty miserable to

105
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,815
Appended to smell like urine

106
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:53,887
But I was lucky enough to have lost my sight and my smell

107
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,167
So

108
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,959
Didn't look bad and it didn't smell bad

109
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:00,287
And there are there alot of these that long

110
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,055
Ramps and

111
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,079
Inclined plane

112
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,359
If you're blind

113
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,687
Great because all the sudden you get directionality out of gravity

114
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,551
Regardless of whichever way you're going up or down here going uphill you can get a strong scent

115
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:14,111
Of going straight uphill as opposed to

116
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,135
Drake going off

117
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:15,903
On an angle

118
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,183
You coming down here

119
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,975
Make like a drop of water into

120
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:19,743
Just follow gravity

121
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,791
So those are actually kind of fun

122
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:25,631
Spaces so if you ever wondered what it would take to love the old transbay terminal

123
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:28,959
Being blind and having no sense of smell seems to do the trick

124
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,263
Something often talked about

125
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,823
The touch of the building where you actually

126
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,591
Reach Out

127
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,359
Grab

128
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,383
Building weather today

129
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,431
Door handle or a railing replace

130
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,199
Lean against

131
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,479
A place to sit down

132
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,503
If those places

133
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,271
Offer

134
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,039
The worms

135
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,319
But comfortable

136
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,623
Touched something that acknowledges

137
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,903
The presence of the body

138
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,951
Besides the agenda of the eyes

139
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,231
How can you think about the

140
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,767
The material or the Forum

141
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:53,535
In a way that

142
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:54,815
Give you that pension

143
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:55,583
Just like you

144
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,607
Give somebody a hand

145
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,399
Excommunicated

146
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,423
Through a handshake

147
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,191
It's a what

148
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,215
Sandshaker the building

149
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,239
What are you saying that

150
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,103
But no more about Christianity at 99% invisible. Org

151
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:07,871
Yeah

152
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:16,063
99% invisible is produced by me Roman Mars with support from lunar it's a project of

153
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,367
Kalw the American Institute of

154
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,183
San Francisco in the center for architecture and Design

155
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,607
Before we go I want to tell you about the body genius

156
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:32,447
A five-part series from fellow radiotopia show the truth

157
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,983
The body genius is a dark

158
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,007
Comic mystery

159
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:38,335
That whines through a treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

160
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,871
We're looking the part

161
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,407
Might cost you your life

162
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:46,783
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

163
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,135
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

164
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:55,487
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like a dad

165
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,839
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

166
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:02,143
Actually if I'm being honest

167
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:04,191
I'm one of the main guys who know how to do that

168
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:10,591
I think a few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an act

169
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,871
Watch a movie called Immortal cop

170
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:15,199
Was found dead in my private gym

171
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:18,527
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

172
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:22,879
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

173
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:23,903
Now

174
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,951
I need to clear my name

175
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:32,351
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes to find them

176
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:40,543
The final episode of the body genius drops on May 30th Bend all 5 Parts on the truth podcast
