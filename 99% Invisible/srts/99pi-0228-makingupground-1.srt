I'm Roman Mars

32
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,416
On May 3rd 1978

33
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:37,792
Construction workers in San Francisco we're digging a foundation for a new building on Sansome Street

34
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,352
Right next to the tallest skyscraper in the city

35
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,632
The Transamerica Pyramid

36
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:43,424
In the heart of the financial district

37
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,752
They were about 20 feet below street level

38
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:47,776
When their shovels

39
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,312
Hit something totally

40
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,080
But expect

41
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:53,664
Who is the hull of an old ship

42
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,712
That's reporter Edmund Fitzgerald

43
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:58,272
Archaeologists immediately came in

44
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,832
And start scraping away all the dirt and mud

45
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:01,856
And

46
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:02,880
After a few days

47
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,160
They don't cover the

48
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,184
Full skeleton

49
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,280
120 foot Gold Rush era vessel called in in

50
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,816
Preserve perfect

51
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:13,120
New York Streets of San Francisco

52
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,192
As the archaeologist did their work

53
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:19,264
Hundreds of people gathered to watch the bizarre scene

54
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,544
A massive

55
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,128
Massive ship being pulled out from beneath the pavement

56
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:25,408
As Speaker

57
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:28,224
Construction hoarding was put up people were carving holes in it

58
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,040
To look in and see Niantic emerge from the mud

59
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,576
That's James Delgado

60
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,856
I'm an archaeologist

61
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,160
Then the historian and I'm the author of

62
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,184
Gold Rush Pawn

63
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,744
The maritime archaeology of San Francisco

64
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,792
Delgado was 20 years old then

65
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:45,376
An archaeologist in training and he was part of the excavation

66
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,936
Inside the ship he found

67
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,984
All kinds of artifacts from the gold rush

68
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,032
Brush that have been preserved Underground

69
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,568
Ric's nails

70
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,872
Tin plates for sheathing

71
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:56,896
Boots

72
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:57,664
Jackie

73
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:58,688
Saddle

74
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,712
Shovels

75
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,248
A lot of booze

76
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,040
49ers like to drink

77
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:08,416
Delgado even pop the cork on a bottle of 150 year old champagne

78
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,440
Tasted

79
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:14,560
But the excavation of the Niantic launched his career in Marine archaeology

80
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:16,608
Inspired him to study the ships

81
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,888
Spinning San Francisco

82
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:18,912
Because

83
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,984
Isn't the only one down there

84
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:31,200
I see that they're probably as many as seventy ships that were buried that in some way shape or form remain even

85
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,224
If it's fragments

86
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:38,624
In 1994 city workers were digging a tunnel for the muni train when they hit the side of another gold

87
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,160
The ROM

88
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:43,744
The decision was made to drill through it

89
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,280
They tunneled right through the hall

90
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:51,680
In today thousands of San Francisco's travel through the ship every morning as they ride the train between Folsom Street

91
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,960
In the Embarcadero

92
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:59,360
Severally marked in the tunnel but for those of us who know when you take that turn you're passing through the gold rush

93
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,384
Ship rum

94
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:08,576
To understand how all of these ships ended up buried underground beneath the city we need to go back to the

95
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,344
The 1830

96
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,648
When San Francisco was just a

97
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,928
Tiny little pork

98
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,208
Call yerba buena

99
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:18,047
It was an outpost of a few buildings with Tiny Town Square that's it

100
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:21,375
By 1847 the population had grown to a few hundred

101
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:23,423
They renamed the port San Francisco

102
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,471
But it was still just a small town

103
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,263
But in 1848

104
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,543
All of that changed with

105
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,567
The discovery of gold in

106
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,615
January the gold rush

107
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,151
Titlewave of prospect

108
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,175
California

109
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,223
And by the end of 1850

110
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,759
The San Francisco waterfront

111
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,783
Clogged with more than

112
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,807
Thousand ships

113
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,855
And the town had grown into a city of

114
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,623
Thousand

115
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:45,439
So you're looking at a city that was in a decade

116
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,743
Has gone from being a village to being the

117
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,279
The 12th largest city in North

118
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:53,887
But the land around San Francisco was mostly sandyhills

119
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,679
But not well suited to this

120
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,703
Scale development

121
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:02,591
So to meet the surging demand for Real Estate the cities sold off plots of water in the shallow Title Zone

122
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,895
A person could buy a piece of water

123
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:08,223
But it was their job to turn it into usable ground

124
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,271
Some people dump sand

125
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,807
The garbage into their plots

126
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,087
To try and make plans

127
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,623
Other Strokes

128
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,903
Steaks in the mud

129
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,695
And build platforms on top of the

130
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:22,815
And a lot of people repurposed the ships that had brought them to California

131
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:23,839
The ship's help

132
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:27,423
Because they came many of them were sitting idle the cruiser gone off

133
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:29,215
Did the diggings or hit run away

134
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:33,823
So the owners rented them out or sold them outright to become floating

135
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,127
Houses warehouses

136
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,919
The town jail offices

137
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:38,943
You name it

138
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,271
Over 200 of them became floating building

139
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:45,087
Commercial life

140
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:45,855
References

141
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:50,463
What you had the Apollo Saloon which was basically a restaurant they sold

142
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,743
Donut in a cup of coffee

143
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,023
Two bits they said

144
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,887
You had the euphemia which was turned into the town jail and later became an insane asylum

145
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,727
You also had ships that served as water cistern

146
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,543
You had other ships that worked as government offices

147
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,567
And another ship

148
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,847
The Good Ship Panama

149
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,383
Was used as a seaman

150
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,151
Church

151
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:12,735
The city looked like a forest of masts

152
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,015
And playing

153
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,039
Schenectady ship

154
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:21,439
Creating a grid boardwalks perched above the water one visitor said that San Francisco was Venice built

155
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,207
Pine

156
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,327
But they were obvious downside

157
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,375
Next to a floating city and little by little

158
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:32,191
People began to fill in areas between the shifts

159
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:34,495
Using whatever they could get their hands on

160
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:37,823
From garbage to unwanted cargo to

161
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,847
Dead bodies

162
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:39,615
You name it

163
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,407
Everything was thrown into that

164
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:44,223
And with this gradually began the process of

165
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,503
Feeling in the mud

166
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:49,087
In this way the shoreline itself begin to advance

167
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,391
At this point the harbor was a patchwork of

168
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,671
A freshly filled Lots

169
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,975
Ships and buildings on stilts

170
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:58,047
But then in May of 1851

171
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:01,119
A massive fire broke out in downtown San Francisco

172
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:02,911
The wind

173
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:03,935
Fans the flames

174
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:04,959
And by the

175
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:07,007
The time the next day had dawned

176
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,799
More than 2000 buildings

177
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:09,567
Gone

178
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,359
The Flames were so high

179
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,663
That they could see the glow in Monterey

180
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,479
Some of the ships caught fire

181
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:20,063
Leaving their half chard holes in the muddy water

182
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:23,135
By the time they managed to put the fire out

183
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,695
The Waterfront was just a mushy mess

184
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,231
ESO smoldering Timber

185
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:30,815
And that mushy mess was too unstable to rebuild on

186
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,351
So you some of the Worlds

187
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,887
First steam powered excavator

188
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,983
Describe sand off of nearby Hills and dunes and dumping

189
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:38,751
On top

190
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:39,775
By September

191
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,567
Of 1851

192
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,359
The old Waterfront had been

193
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,639
Buried

194
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,431
And with it the Niantic

195
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:49,247
The Rome and all of the other Gold Rush ships

196
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,271
InTune

197
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,063
Dennis manufactured ground

198
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,159
After the fire at San Francisco continue to expand

199
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:59,231
Feeling in more and more of the title Zone in deeper

200
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,255
Burgundy for water

201
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,559
And eventually the states Dept

202
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,351
They built a sea wall

203
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:09,727
The cap the production of new land they drew a line instead San Francisco you can go no further

204
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,263
And today we know that line

205
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,287
It's the Embarcadero

206
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:15,615
The walkway along the Eastern edge of the San Francisco Wharf

207
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:18,431
But by that time a city at build up

208
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,479
On top of all this sand and dirt

209
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,247
Garbage

210
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:22,783
And over the years

211
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,831
San Francisco continue to develop

212
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,111
Today what

213
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,903
Had been the title Zone

214
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:30,463
Is the heart of the city's Financial.

215
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:40,191
Throughout history the absence of ground has proven to be a

216
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,983
Surprisingly small Lobster

217
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,263
For people who want

218
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,031
How to build stuff

219
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:47,871
San Francisco isn't the only city that is built its own land

220
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:51,711
Large portions of Boston Seattle Hong Kong and Merced

221
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,759
We're built on top of fill

222
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,575
It's not uncommon to see it another City's New York

223
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,367
Manhattan built out

224
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,135
And filled

225
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:01,439
Theory the World Trade Center sits on

226
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,463
What's landfill

227
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:06,303
Ashley found a ship when they were building the original World Trade Center towers

228
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:10,143
What is now Mumbai India used to be a 7 Island archipelago

229
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,495
Before the British colonial government turned it all into one continuous strip of land

230
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:17,567
Tokyo has built 60000 acre

231
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,127
Over the last several centuries

232
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:23,199
The process of building new land along the water

233
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,735
Is often referred to as

234
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,527
Land reclamation

235
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,551
Which

236
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,087
Is kind of ridiculous

237
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,647
Land reclamation is another one of those

238
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,415
Words that

239
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,231
Made up band

240
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:38,303
Masquerades what's really happening you're creating

241
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,607
Land where it didn't exist before

242
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,167
Or even creating a whole country

243
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,959
Like the Netherlands

244
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,239
Does a very

245
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,263
Extraterrestrial

246
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,567
ICP the Dutch making their own country

247
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,103
That Stephen Graham

248
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:56,223
Professor of cities in society at Newcastle University and author of the book vertigo

249
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:59,039
The city from satellites to bunkers

250
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,575
Most of Holland

251
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:04,159
Most of the Netherlands currently constructed

252
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:08,511
Isn't engineering construction is a huge project of

253
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:12,607
Land reclamation land manufacture touchdevelop

254
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,887
Writable techniques

255
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:17,727
To build land in places that were actually below sea level

256
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:22,079
Let me see fingernails is Medieval Times by launch Dykstra constructed

257
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,639
Large pumping systems were constructed

258
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:28,735
To create a dry country underneath the sea

259
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,015
A proud of this history

260
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,807
Does a popular saying there

261
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:35,903
God created the world but the Dutch created the nether

262
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:44,863
Humans have been making their own ground for a long time the process has reached New Heights in recent years

263
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,655
The historic

264
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:47,935
K-Love

265
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:51,775
Land reclamation along money factor in the building up to

266
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,311
Longanisa

267
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,615
Absolutely miniscule

268
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,895
Skyler White

269
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,175
What's going on today

270
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,991
More and more cities are building waterfront property

271
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,015
For airports

272
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,039
Skyscraper

273
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,063
And housing

274
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,599
Urban economics

275
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,391
If you create you

276
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:12,255
Supply in an area weather is amazing levels of the Mountain at 4

277
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:16,095
It's very possible and new dredging technology

278
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,911
Have enabled developers to build land faster

279
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,447
And on a grander scale

280
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,239
Often at the expense

281
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,007
Of the environment

282
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,543
I mean they use

283
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:28,383
Cute ships for example which ethical rainbow

284
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,663
Dredging cyst

285
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,967
These ships suck up massive amounts

286
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,759
To sand and gravel from sea floor

287
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:39,647
Shoot it through the air in a giant parking rainbow Muk on the area where they're trying to build new land

288
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,951
This technology has been particularly useful

289
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:44,255
For creating artificial Islands

290
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:47,839
China is using these rainbow dredging ships

291
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:53,727
To turn uninhabited Coral apples in the middle of the South China Sea into larger Island

292
00:11:53,983 --> 00:12:00,127
I could support human settlement there actually manufacturing land in the hopes of staking territorial claim to highly

293
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,407
Contested Waters

294
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:07,807
And then there's to buy device of poster child for this process where the wealthy desert Emirate has been

295
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:11,135
Built a series of artificial islands for wealthy Elite

296
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:17,023
Three of the new landforms are shaped like massive Palm fronds another project called

297
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,631
The world is a cluster of islands designed to look like a map of the world

298
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:29,055
But Dubai's Reclamation project has stirred up so much sediment that they buried coral reefs oyster beds and Seed

299
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:33,919
Grass fields in the Persian Gulf and some of the islands that make up the world

300
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:36,735
Are already starting to a road back into the sea

301
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,831
Dubai is also running out of sand

302
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:41,855
At least

303
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,647
The kind of sand do you need to build

304
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,207
Desert sand is too fine for

305
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:46,975
Construction

306
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:50,047
And Dubai has used up so much of the sand around it

307
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:50,815
East Coast

308
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:53,375
But they now have to import it from Australia

309
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:57,215
Globally humans use over 40 billion tons of sand a year

310
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,263
The two largest uses of that sand

311
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,543
Are concrete production

312
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,335
Inland manufacturing process

313
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,639
And it's created a global

314
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,663
Sand shortage

315
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:09,503
Is forcing countries to go to extreme lengths

316
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,551
In their efforts to build new ground

317
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:14,367
Most famous example here is Singapore

318
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:19,743
The wealthy island nation is one of the densest countries in the world

319
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,815
At constantly looking to expand its territory

320
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,607
Those plans to make

321
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:28,703
Singapore 20th 30% bigger than x full 258

322
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:34,335
True Manufacturing Uline without enough sand of its own Singapore has had to look

323
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:37,407
Elsewhere does being a lot of evidence that

324
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:43,039
Best extended blind manufacturing around Singapore the basis for its growth

325
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,063
Tiny Island City

326
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:48,415
Is is based on basic stealing Sandy Islands from the

327
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:54,047
Poor countries like Cambodia and Indonesia and Burma

328
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:57,119
Removing a material physically

329
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,399
Land itself

330
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,959
Is Flowing from poor countries

331
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,983
The wealthier one

332
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,263
Those countries

333
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,287
Made

334
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,055
Sam

335
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,335
Illegal

336
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,871
Because of this

337
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:10,175
Signs that they are losing their own

338
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:10,943
Parrot tree

339
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,063
Blade manufacturing isn't Justice

340
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,343
Expanding territory

341
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,903
In some cases it's expanding upward

342
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,951
On the coast of Nigeria

343
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:24,511
Developers are building a new luxury City

344
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,047
Called Eko Atlantic

345
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,351
On top of manufactured ground

346
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:32,703
Install thing about Eko Atlantic is it's about 3 or 4 meters higher

347
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,263
And the rest of Lego Sand is being designed

348
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,567
To be more resilient to expect

349
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,591
Sea level rises

350
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:39,615
On the rest

351
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,383
Pacetti

352
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,735
Lagos has a very poor lowline City that's extremely vulnerable

353
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:45,759
The sea level rise

354
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:48,575
This is very disturbing

355
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:51,903
Apartheid CC amazing hair

356
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,999
Where Elites are able to build their own Escape Routes from

357
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,279
Increasingly powerless

358
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,047
Auditions

359
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,583
True going higher

360
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,119
Into manufactured loan

361
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:05,983
In theory building new land could be a part of the solution to sea level rise

362
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:12,127
But Stephen Graham says these new land projects are often built exclusively for the rich

363
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:17,759
Tell me about private projects for those who can get in and can afford it

364
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,039
They're not being built

365
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,831
Public projects very often

366
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,111
To protect

367
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,647
Cities as a whole

368
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,327
Massive Reclamation projects like

369
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,375
Eko Atlantic are the most obvious

370
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:34,911
Of manufacture

371
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,239
But even if you live far away from the coast

372
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,287
The ground beneath your feet

373
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:43,103
May have been partially created by human

374
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:46,687
People are continuously impacting the surface of the Earth

375
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:49,503
We dig up Rock from one place grind it into cement

376
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,295
And build a sidewalk somewhere else

377
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,831
The book skyscraper

378
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,367
Dump the rubble somewhere

379
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,391
And build a hosp

380
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,719
And all of this human activity

381
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:01,279
Is actually created a new layer

382
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,071
On the surface of the Earth's crust

383
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,119
It made up of Old Brick

384
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,399
Ground up cement

385
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,167
Rusting metal

386
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,727
Archaeologist and geologist

387
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:11,519
I've started calling this later

388
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,055
The Arceus fear

389
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,127
The ark is fear isn't

390
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,407
Totally unnatural

391
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:19,967
It's filled with soil roots in earthworms

392
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:20,991
Symptoms grass

393
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:21,759
Cross on top of it

394
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,807
And that makes it hard for us to notice

395
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:26,367
Stephen Graham says that this idea

396
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:31,999
That human activity has actually created a geologic layer on the surface of the Earth

397
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:35,327
Is bringing archaeologists and geologists

398
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,095
Together

399
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:39,935
Traditionally archaeologists study human artifacts within the ground

400
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:42,239
Well geologist study the ground itself

401
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,287
But what if the ground itself

402
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,567
Was made by human

403
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,919
Archaeologist of increasingly working with geologist in Lacey

404
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:55,551
The ground is as a gradual accumulation of the leftover stuffing sheets of rubbish

405
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:59,135
It's the bodies of the dad it's the leftover materials

406
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:02,719
And it is increasingly Bob the Builder by my thing that's really important

407
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:07,327
Important for 1 because we need to understand what the ground is made of

408
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,375
If you want to build safely on top of

409
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,447
Manufactured round can be unstable

410
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,471
More susceptible

411
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,239
Earthquake

412
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,007
Sanlitun

413
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:17,567
Big sample in China in Shenzhen

414
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,871
When the construction material it was

415
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:22,943
Keep top on a on a hillside spot of the

416
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,711
Grace

417
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,991
Expansions not CT

418
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,015
Basically

419
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:28,831
Slumped down this a great big slide in the

420
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,111
Does by 80 people

421
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,903
Killed in that as well so

422
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:37,279
We need to become much more water in creating around geology where will SEC racing around hazard

423
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,607
But the Arceus fear is also a resource to be

424
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,375
Explored

425
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:43,935
Despain estimates that this is much copper

426
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:44,959
And not

427
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:46,751
Artificial ground

428
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:50,335
Azaleas in all of the copper mines in the world

429
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,383
So in Scandinavia

430
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,175
Starting to mine

431
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:56,991
The disused industrial ground off their own industry

432
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,367
When you walk through a city

433
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,927
Cota's and pavement and covered in buildings

434
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:07,999
It's easy to assume that the ground beneath you

435
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,535
Is ancient and natural

436
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:15,935
Does a does a tendency always just to say the ground is something that's always been there and always will being there

437
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:16,959
Bethesda

438
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:20,031
She's about evidence that cities built around grounds

439
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:20,799
Cities of Rage

440
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,847
Thanks for making their own geology

441
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:27,711
If you look at a brand new land reclamation project like Eko Atlantic

442
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,735
It's obvious

443
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,271
The ground is manufactured

444
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:32,063
Right now it looks like a

445
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,111
Giant Sandy construction site

446
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,135
But

447
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,927
If all goes according to plan

448
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,975
Pretty soon there will be parking lots

449
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,999
Skyscrapers

450
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:40,767
An apartment built

451
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:48,447
And right now it's hard to imagine that such a blatant example of artificial ground will one day become seen as

452
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:51,263
Just an ordinary part of the Nigeria lids

453
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:54,079
But you probably could have said the same thing about

454
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,103
About San Francisco

455
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,383
Then 1850

456
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:14,047

Oakland California

467
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:48,095
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices were immersed

468
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:50,655
In a cluttered World a man-made sound

469
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:51,935
If

470
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:56,287
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexa

471
00:19:56,543 --> 00:20:02,175
Is talking to me and my wife is in another room and a kid is another

472
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,967
Technology talk to us

473
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:06,271
It is a creation of Sonic trash

474
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:09,343
That's Joel Beckerman he's a sound designer and composer

475
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:14,719
Studies how we can improve our interactions with technology to make them more human

476
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,815
Turn the living room lights on

477
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,351
Okay

478
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,143
Dim the living room lights

479
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,167
50%

480
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:24,959
Okay

481
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:31,359
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

482
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:34,175
Makes for a much more natural experience

483
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,223
Turn the living room lights on

484
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,807
Dim the living room lights to 50

485
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:40,575

486
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:49,023
We're presenting two special episodes from 99percentinvisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation about how are sound

487
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,815
Landscape is impacting our health

488
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:53,375
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

489
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:56,191
Look for them Fridays May 17th and May 24th

490

We need to talk about something

493
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:09,247
Constipation abdominal pain and bloating yourself it's not that bad you take laxatives you modify your diet

494
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:12,063
But thinking about it all the time is frustrating

495
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:18,464
It doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again and you don't know why

496
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,768
Then it may be time to seek help

We've a lively community on Facebook I'm on Twitter at Roman Mars

516
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:21,184
Way way way too much

517
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:24,256
But you want hundreds and hundreds of stories to make yourself

518
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,536
Really interesting

519
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,304
Parties

520
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:28,096

Before we go I want to tell you about the body Genie

524
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,368
A five-part series from Bello radiotopia show the truth

525
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,464
The body genius is a Dark comic mystery that whines through a

526
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,512
Treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

527
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:58,048
We're looking the part

528
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,584
Might cost you your life

529
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,960
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

530
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:09,056
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

531
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:13,664
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like a dad

532
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,016
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

533
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:22,368
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main got to know how to do that kind of

534
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:29,792
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

535
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:33,120
Was found dead in my private gym

536
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:36,448
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

537
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:40,800
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

538
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:44,128
Now I need to clear my name

539
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:49,504
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes
