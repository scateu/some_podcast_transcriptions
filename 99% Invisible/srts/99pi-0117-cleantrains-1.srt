I'm Roman Mars

34
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,768
I grew up mainly in Ohio

35
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,048
And in the 80s

36
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,120
I only knew about New York City from the movies

37
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:45,984
And all the movies every single one of them had this one establishing shot at said

38
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,264
Audience

39
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:49,312
We are in New York City

40
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:52,640
It was a graffiti-covered Subway

41
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,944
All beautiful

42
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:59,040
For me it Suburban kid from Ohio that graffiti was exciting

43
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,576
But it didn't seem

44
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:03,392
Artistic or complicated it was just

45
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:05,184
Scary hooliganism

46
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,720
Too bad you can't think

47
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:10,816
The graffiti was a total mystery to me too

48
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:15,936
Preacher and hepperman grew up in Nebraska also far far from New York City

49
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:18,496
It was like Technicolor hieroglyphics

50
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,544
You doing the Bowie MD

51
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,336
Oh he's doing it

52
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,872
Back and front

53
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:30,272
All of these intersecting lines and colors I mean I knew that they were letters I just never knew what they said

54
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,832
New York was another planet

55
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,880
And graffiti was its language

56
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:37,184
Is only 26 letters of the alphabet

57
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,720
But somehow

58
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,512
Graffiti Writers manipulated

59
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,304
And it make it theirs

60
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:45,632
Strange looks so cool on the outside

61
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:50,496
But the inside was a whole other story you would not have gotten on that sub

62
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,032
The place where

63
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:52,800
Sophie

64
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,336
The train smell

65
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:58,176
They were dirty the floor is stuck to the floor

66
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,200
And

67
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,992
You got stuck in the tunnel

68
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:03,552
In the car is filled up with smoke

69
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,088
And I mean it was

70
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,368
Scary place

71
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,136
The beat

72
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:10,720
In the 1970s and 80s says this guy David gun

73
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,024
The New York City subway was like

74
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,048
Some kind of

75
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,840
Don t and hellscape

76
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:19,168
Fire in Bloodshed and gangs

77
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:25,568
There is definitely a sense that you know this is Subway's work

78
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,408
Totally controlled by wild gangs of teenagers

79
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:35,296
No you Boppers out there know that amongst the Gang

80
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,320
Who are the Rogues

81
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,600
The Gramercy riffs

82
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,904
Everyone's favorite the baseball Furies

83
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:40,928
Of course

84
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:43,744
The Warriors

85
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,792
I want everybody to know the warriors were

86
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,472
Artist Caleb neelon Wheels Amin spray-can himself

87
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,752
But even he admits

88
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,032
Graffiti was

89
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,824
Simply just a symbol that

90
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,848
The city of Lost

91
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,128
Control and

92
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,176
It was a symbol that

93
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,712
Who knew what the future lay

94
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,736
What cities

95
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,016
It could be terrible

96
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:09,600
And nothing pisses people off more than writing I can't read

97
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:14,976
So starting in the early 70s the mayors of New York City to eradicate graffiti

98
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:15,744
First

99
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,280
Mayor John Lindsay

100
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:23,679
He took office it really like one of the worst times for any New York mayor Lindsay forms of first anti-graffiti test

101
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,447
Task force

102
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:27,007
And he turned graffiti from a nuisance

103
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,543
Took it out of the category of

104
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:32,383
Lettering or something like that into a crime interview

105
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,663
You know what a misdemeanor

106
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,711
But subway graffiti persistence

107
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,783
It was the problem that wouldn't go away

108
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:43,647
For two decades the Metropolitan Transportation Authority also known as the MTA

109
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:46,975
Failed miserably trying to fix its graffiti problem

110
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,767
Sometimes laughably

111
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:52,351
I could time they decided to repaint 7000 subway cars

112
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,375
All white

113
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,399
They called it

114
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,935
The Great White Fleet

115
00:04:56,447 --> 00:05:00,543
Oddly what the graffiti movement needed at that time was new real estate

116
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,847
Before you knew it

117
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:03,871
Tire

118
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:04,639
Subway car

119
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,663
Car covered in spray paint

120
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,759
There was Ed Koch's Berlin Wall method

121
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,063
Conscionable. Defenses in the yard

122
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:16,927
Plus

123
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,207
Attack dogs

124
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,487
Here's maricon

125
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,767
But I said

126
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,815
Go to fences and have

127
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:28,959
The dog run between the two fences and that will keep people out and protect the dog from stepping on the third rail

128
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:33,311
And the responsible as well maybe some of the climb over the fence

129
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:38,687
And the dog will bite them I said what I thought that's what the dog was for

130
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:43,807
In the razor wire top defenses and the German Shepherds worked

131
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:48,159
Realize that they could distract the dogs with food and cut through the fences

132
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,719
Desperate people take Desperate Measures

133
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,279
And the transit officials were desperate

134
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,071
No one knew what to do

135
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:58,655
Hello David Gunn

136
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,935
David Gunn

137
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,239
And I was

138
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:08,639
President of the New York City Transit Authority for 6 years

139
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:12,223
David Gunn

140
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:18,623
Would you write up in front of subways in Boston Philly DC

141
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,903
In Toronto

142
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,207
He headed up Amtrak for awhile to

143
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:28,607
He seemed Invincible New York City in 1984

144
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,143
Reaction was no

145
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,167
Because it was

146
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,703
Just looked to be a hoax

147
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:38,079
Situacion actual words were suicide mission

148
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,127
But then his mother stepped in

149
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,711
At that point she was in her eighties

150
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:44,991
She said

151
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:52,415
You better take that or you'll see everybody will think you're a coward

152
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,463
You got love Mom

153
00:06:54,975 --> 00:07:01,119
Hit the ground running with something he called the queen train program

154
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,655
I cleaned up the cars

155
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:05,727
Yeah we did we got the car is clean but we also

156
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,055
The clean train became sort of

157
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,847
Symbolic of the fact

158
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:11,871
The thing work

159
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:15,967
And here's the difference between you and me and David gun

160
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,015
When we see graffiti

161
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,807
We think about it in terms of Aesthetics

162
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:24,159
Like it or hate it but we're reacting to it visually

163
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,695
David Dunn

164
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:32,095
Looks right past all of those wildstyle letters and sees a transit system not doing its job

165
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,399
Easy graffiti you got bad name

166
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,447
Because

167
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,751
Having equipment clean

168
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,799
Is part of maintenance

169
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:46,431
For decades people in charge treated subway graffiti like it was a sanitation problem

170
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,735
Gun says that all wrong

171
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:51,039
It wasn't just a sanitation problem

172
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,831
It was something else entirely

173
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:58,207
Gun says the root of the problem was MTA deferred maintenance program

174
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:01,023
New York City was broke

175
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,303
And the City

176
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:05,887
A big chunk of the transit authority operating budget

177
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:11,007
To reduce its budget

178
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:13,567
The worst decision

179
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:16,639
They cut back on the things that kept the Subways running

180
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,919
Routine inspections

181
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:20,479
Replacing Parts even Subway mechanics

182
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:23,807
And what you expect to happen happened

183
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,111
The subway deteriorated

184
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,903
Breakdowns tripled

185
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:30,975
Nearly every two weeks

186
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,255
And get this

187
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,303
In 1981

188
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:39,423
There were 1800 subway car fires

189
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:46,847
When there's 1800

190
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:47,871
Suicide mission

191
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,663
Billy took it on

192
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:55,039
First he hired 1500 non-union managers and increase repair staff

193
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,063
He rebuilt

194
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,599
Thousands of cars

195
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:03,743
Can you control cases rebuilt trucks New Motors air compressors motor alternators

196
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,279
The whole nine yards

197
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,815
Here's the thing about maintenance

198
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:10,399
It's not sexy it takes years to see improvements

199
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:13,471
People needed something now

200
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,519
Or in this case not see something

201
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,799
My Approach

202
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,591
Was to drive the bastards out

203
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:21,151
And to clean up the mess it made

204
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,175
And fix the

205
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:22,943
Equipment

206
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:25,247
And we gradually drove the little bastard

207
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,527
Estrogen to a corner

208
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:29,087
My little bastards if it's not obvious

209
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,111
Gun net

210
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,903
Everyone vandalizing the trains

211
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:36,255
He figured out a way to do it systemically line by line

212
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,047
Again that's artist Caleb neelon

213
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:42,911
Like the a line or the one line or the two line

214
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:48,543
Off the map for the for Graffiti Writers while they're fixing it they didn't allow any graffiti on it

215
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,311
0

216
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,591
And a graffiti artist

217
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,871
Bob the Train car

218
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:55,967
Bombed in this case means covering the outside of the train with graffiti

219
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:57,503
If an artist manage that

220
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,527
Bmth

221
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,063
Hold it from the system

222
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,343
Even during rush hour

223
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,623
It was tough going

224
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,207
One day I ended up pulling

225
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,999
500 cars how to service

226
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,023
And it worked

227
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,303
If people knew it

228
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,583
Because they could see it

229
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,631
Ghana Chief The Impossible

230
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:16,703
He got rid of graffiti on New York City subways

231
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:18,751
There is even an official date

232
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:19,775
May 12th

233
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,311
1989

234
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,079
People

235
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,359
Remember

236
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,151
Ve and VJ Day

237
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:30,527
Generation moment for the people who ran the subway system

238
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,599
What time when they were declaring victory

239
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,671
The transit authority held at ceremony that day

240
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:37,951
It was up at

241
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,743
77th Street shop

242
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:44,863
All of the MTA employees were there

243
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,655
Premier Ed Koch was there too

244
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,447
Privately I get it in love

245
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,519
The fact that I bet it never thought it's you that day

246
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,615
He said I was right

247
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,919
Commemorative t-shirts

248
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,455
They were red

249
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,223
And I hit the

250
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:04,063
Stay at the old New York City Transit Authority logo on them

251
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,367
Down below at hip

252
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,391
Graffiti free in

253
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,159
Date

254
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:15,327
It's fun to ride the subway and imagined that there ever was so much graffiti

255
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:21,727
I mean I've lived in New York for almost 10 years now and no graffiti-covered Subway has ever pulled

256
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,263
I was wondering

257
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,055
Where did the Cassini go

258
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,103
I thought the answer might be more complex

259
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:30,175
But this time for once the answer is simple

260
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,711
You can point to a man

261
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,991
David Gunn

262
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,271
David Gunn Twitter

263
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,319
A lot of New Yorkers was this

264
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:42,719
Need a white knight coming into to fix the subway system and you know to be writers who is this

265
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,511
Darth Vader character

266
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,863
Ultimately was better at taking away their fun

267
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,655
Then they were at sustaining it

268
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:53,471
May 12th 1989

269
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,519
Bidet subway graffiti died

270
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,271
The story's not over

271
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,831
Graffiti didn't actually in that day

272
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:14,975
There's still subway graffiti but because of David guns clean training program

273
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,255
It's almost become a

274
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,047
Possible for us on the outside too

275
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:20,607
To see it almost never leaves the train yards

276
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:25,983
MTA Cruiser on patrol their constantly looking for graffiti and hosing it off with these

277
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:28,031
Crazy solvent that they see any

278
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,311
And they see it

279
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,871
An international gallery of it in fact

280
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,943
So the kid from Munich would go paint Subways in

281
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:35,967
Paris kitten

282
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:41,343
You know Paris would go pay Subways in Amsterdam today or kind of like stamp collectors

283
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:46,207
Heading to balance tube on the Paris Metro and the London Tube to put into their album

284
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:48,255
Collections are judged by two things

285
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,023
Size

286
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:49,791
And value

287
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:54,143
The subway graffiti completist would have to hit 190 systems

288
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,679
54 countries

289
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,471
And as for value

290
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,775
There's only one that matters

291
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,823
There's a real way of thinking

292
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,895
Kane graffiti which I don't think it's entirely wrong with that

293
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:07,711
You're not a real writer until you got here or

294
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,247
Peace on the New York subway

295
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:12,063
Kind of like the Holy Grail of all trains yunnan

296
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:17,439
Right now spray painting a New York subway car is a felony

297
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:22,559
If teachers get caught it could mean jail time and thousands of dollars in fines

298
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:25,119
Graffiti artist have to ask themselves

299
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,655
Is this worth it

300
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:31,519
I'm pretty nervous talking on the phone right now even about it because

301
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,543
Nina

302
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,335
It's not really something that

303
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,127
People are crazy

304
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:37,663
Very nice

305
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,687
Thank you for doing that

306
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,991
This is Joe

307
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:43,295
Or at least that's what he wanted me to call him

308
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,599
Joe is a graffiti artist

309
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,879
From South Africa

310
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,695
It's trains and countries around the world

311
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:52,511
Didn't want to say if he was going to hit New York

312
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,559
EEG headset

313
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:59,679
We disorder Jose boys to protect his identity

314
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,727
That's the only way that you would agree to talk to us

315
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,263
Just never been caught

316
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,543
But it's been closed

317
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:05,823
I've loved

318
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,871
Seeing a flashlight

319
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:11,455
Turned around to tell the guy that someone

320
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,479
Is coming for us

321
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:15,039
And when I turned around he's already like

322
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,319
Running

323
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,599
We we actually

324
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:20,159
Caught a couple of guys from Australia just last week

325
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:23,231
School trying to breach of security and go into a yard

326
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,535
And now Vincent demarino

327
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:30,143
He's the vice president of security for the MTA and New York City Transit

328
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:34,239
He sees guys from all over the world in New York train yards

329
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:38,335
Demarino didn't have hard numbers of who gets caught from where in the yard

330
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,895
But when a train gets hit in New York

331
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,711
The graffiti artist is more likely to be from say

332
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,247
Spain or France

333
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,039
Not from New York

334
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,855
Someone put the ratio at something like a D20

335
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,391
The international folks

336
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,927
It cost a lot of money to do

337
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:56,255
If I was to get on a plane I'd go somewhere and sit on the beach

338
00:14:56,511 --> 00:15:00,351
I wouldn't buy an airplane ticket to go commit a crime in a train yard

339
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:03,167
Graffiti artists that's part of the draw

340
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,959
It's a rush to break the law

341
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:06,239
Now I want to get over this

342
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:10,847
Fence Potter that that's exciting at first when you go inside to

343
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,967
The yard in East on the floor not on the platform and you see how big is

344
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:19,039
This train ready is I me when you're on the platform and train the train when you're on the

345
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,319
Floor next to it outside

346
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:24,927
At 11

347
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:31,327
Smile and the sound is so much more intense because you already likes

348
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,095
Novice

349
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,887
Look what's coming at you what is it

350
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,679
There's not much that could beat that

351
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,447
Feeling

352
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,751
Better than sex

353
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:42,335
That's like better than money better than

354
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:45,151
Set back that's why people do it that's why someone address

355
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,319
What colors on a train

356
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,623
I seen as Europeans going it

357
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,159
Somebody why New York

358
00:15:56,671 --> 00:16:00,255
Do you think doing it like this way it's from this way was built that like

359
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,303
I see no but let me bring the trains back

360
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,607
This is beauty

361
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,167
I spell it c e t e

362
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:09,215
And then I have a 2 letter c t

363
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:11,007
The same thing between trains

364
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,543
If you don't get it

365
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:15,359
CT tells me he always feels like an old soul

366
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:17,151
I call in a romantic

367
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:19,199
I seen it on the trains and

368
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,991
Icing Subway online

369
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,015
Damn I missed

370
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:22,783
Time

371
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:26,367
City bombed not one but two trains the

372
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,927
The first was the R Train

373
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,975
It was a Spy vs Spy theme

374
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:34,559
I think about 11 cans in an hour to paint

375
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,607
But days and days

376
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:39,167
The preparation of these Minds

377
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:43,007
I studied the workers because

378
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,847
If you could find a lazy worker one day and you could do a lot of stuff in this

379
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,127
MTA

380
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,663
You have a lot of

381
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:54,271
The second thing they had was a B train

382
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,575
This time with a Pink Panther theme

383
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:59,391
We had the whole day planned next week on Mission

384
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:02,463
Here's what size CT and David gun together

385
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,487
Both men

386
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,023
It's been a lot of time

387
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:08,351
Scrutinizing the weak points in the MTA system

388
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:13,215
Dreams of bringing back New York subway graffiti

389
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:15,775
But the number of hits a rapidly declining

390
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:18,847
In 2007 there were 75 yard hits

391
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:21,407
So far this year only nine

392
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:26,783
Bmth please Forest can take some credit for those numbers but there is another Factor

393
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,575
I find it hard to think of

394
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,879
Graffiti Writers who were much under 25

395
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:34,207
People that I know

396
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:35,999
AR

397
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,023
In their 40s

398
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,047
Honestly

399
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:41,375
Graffiti is an art form a two-stage out at some point

400
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:44,191
And if subway graffiti did die out

401
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,727
How do we even know

402
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:52,127
The artist know that their work will never be seen by the public at Large

403
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:54,431
Immediately after the subway cars

404
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,479
Scrub to clean by MTA workers

405
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:58,527
The art form is totally ephemeral

406
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,367
It reminds me of those Tibetan sand mandalas made to disappear

407
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:05,183
If you thinking your stuff is going to live forever is not

408
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:07,743
Everything you do with tenants in one day

409
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:12,351
Pretty much all that keeps that from happening right now is social media

410
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:14,911
Naira invitation-only Instagram account

411
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:18,239
Subway bombers post their work before it disappear

412
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:24,895
Those painted trains that cross are movie screens on countless establishing shots of dirty New York City in the night

413
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:25,663
1970s

414
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:28,991
They're just a little square on your smartphone now

415
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,783
And by the time you see them

416
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,319
They're already gone

417
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:36,671
My love is the train is always going to be trains to the casket drop

418
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,951
Dogs going to be trained

419
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,487
And yeah

420
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,559
What's wrong

421
00:18:56,639 --> 00:19:02,527
Until the casket drops or until the NYPD anti-graffiti unit

422
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:04,575
Which is what happened to CT

423
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:10,975
He was arrested and charged with more than 180 misdemeanor counts for things like possession of a graffiti

424
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:13,791
Instrument and intention to damage property

425
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,327
Along with some felony charges

426
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:20,959
He took a plea deal agreed to pay nearly $19,000 in restitution charges

427
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,751
And is now on probation

428

Bongs and chatter of our devices were immersed

434
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:08,063
The cluttered World a man-made sound

435
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,343

Voice technology talk to us

439

But taking away the fake

451
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:48,767
Human and adding and some thoughtful sound

Constipation abdominal pain and bloating
