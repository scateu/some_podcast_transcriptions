This is 99% invisible I'm Roman Mars

26
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:06,976
If you were standing in the crowd for any of the presidential inauguration from Andrew Jackson

27
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,768
Dwight D Eisenhower

28
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,400
You have seen the solemn oath of office taken between 24 tall smooth columns

29
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:17,472
The East Portico of the United States Capitol building

30
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:25,664
When the columns were installed in 1824 the Sandstone slabs themselves that made up the column

31
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,456
Even before they were erected

32
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:29,248
What considered so important

33
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:32,576
But they were transported from the Potomac River to Capitol Hill

34
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,880
My human power alone

35
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:38,720
No lowly mules were deemed fit to moveset synchronoss

36
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:44,352
But they didn't have quite the same standing in 1958

37
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46,144
They had been taken off the east

38
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,680
Restaurant when the front was

39
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,448
Extended

40
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:51,264
They were stored on along the Potomac

41
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,032
Crated

42
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,568
Slowly disintegrating

43
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:56,640
After the renovation of the Capitol The Columns all got the boot

44
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:59,200
The notion was horrifying to Ethel Garrett

45
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:04,320
And she conscripted her friend Betty Ray Elizabeth Sea Ray known as Betty Ray

46
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:08,672
And sometime in the 1970s they made it their mission to get the columns back on their feet

47
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,976
I thought this would be very simple

48
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,768
I mean who would say no

49
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,632
Do that people said the way they still belong to

50
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:20,192

Have another meeting fundraising had to appear before the national

54

Capital Planning Commission Architects and surveyors

55
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,272
But we offer

56
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:36,320
The Columns were moved from Storage

57
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,624
From the area along the Potomac

58
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,672
They were put on trailers

59
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,440
And

60
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,208
Draft

61
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,000
I was in a band

62
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,024
Steal things

63
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,328
On mattresses old mattresses

64
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:50,144
And they've been brought to the National Arboretum

65
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,544
The Arboretum is a swath of greenery nestled in among the warehouses in gas stations at the edge of Washington DC

66
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:00,384
It's where the old Columns of the US Capitol still are today

67
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:05,248
When you're walking up to the columns located on a high area

68
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:07,040
In the meadow are there

69
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,064
Arboretum

70
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,880
Their Majestic they're huge columns

71
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:13,952
Courser free-standing they are really Majestic

72
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,488
And there's only one way to

73
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,256
Describing it

74
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,280
Majestic

75
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:21,375
I could I could see them approaching from the field and actually pretty majesti

76
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:24,191
The consensus seems to be that they look pretty Majestic

77
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:27,775
It's pretty spectacular that's radio producer Jess schreibstein

78
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:30,847
Taking of columns at the National Arboretum

79
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:33,151
On the crest of this very small hill

80
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,175
AR

81
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,735
I want to guesstimate a couple doesn't call him

82
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,271
22

83
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,551
Weather is Chrissy Moore

84
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,831
She works at the armory

85
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:43,135
So they have Corinthian

86
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,159
Tops

87
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,695
On these columns and

88
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,231
They're lined up

89
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,767
And a few rows

90
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,559
Very tall

91
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:54,143
I understand why people think that they're from Grease

92
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,703
Or from Rome because it actually looks like

93
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,543
Some old Greek ruins sitting on top of the hill definite

94
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,335
Distinct Granger about it

95
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:05,919
That you won't see much outside of Washington DC

96
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:10,527
Independent of their grand presentation The Columns hold a certain power

97
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,063
Even if they don't

98
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,111
Hold the roof

99
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:17,951
But not all of the old East Portico had a champion like Betty Ray

100
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:20,255
My directions say

101
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,047
Go downhill Into the Woods

102
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:26,655
Go down towards the bottom of the hill there will be no Trail don't worry keep walking

103
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,215
Several miles away from The National Arboretum

104
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:32,031
Where there's no visitors center there no commemorative black

105
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:35,615
Philadelphia trail that goes up into a ravine

106
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:38,431
And you go on that trail and then it'll large

107
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,455
Concrete bridge

108
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:42,015
Take the lower Forks to pass under the bridge

109
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,551
And then there's a clearing on the web

110
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,951
And here in the middle of the woods lies the rest

111
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:54,303
The capitol's East Portico the parts that didn't make it to the Arboretum

112
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,839
To the right of us

113
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,631
Are basically

114
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,167
Stacks and stacks

115
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,191
Comes

116
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:05,055
We almost could have walked right by I feel like

117
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,079
Who's our next

118
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,615
To some buildings Ellis

119
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:09,919
You know

120
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:12,735
Part of some building materials but if you look at it

121
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,015
More closely you see at the RX

122
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,295
Discover it in

123
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:21,183
This place is 100 square yards

124
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,231
Busted up architecture Maryland

125
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:26,047
Stone and granite and decapitated heads

126
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,607
Corinthian columns weathering in the snow

127
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,887
But it's arrangement

128
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:32,191
Oddly intentional the debts of

129
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:35,519
Building carefully stacked 12 15 feet high

130
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:38,335
With Wells and kasim spanning between

131
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,127
Is it just going to leave them here

132
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:46,015
Super sad the physical manifestation of the parts of history that didn't make

133
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,295
The car

134
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,087
Texas

135
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,935
Leaving here without the Rolling Meadow and historic backdrop

136
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,471
The ruins still managed

137
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,495
To be Majestic

138
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:13,151
I think if I discovered this when are the kids out of felt like I discovered the Lost World

139
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:15,455
Atlantis

140
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:31,839

Before we go I want to tell you about the body genius a five-part series from fellow radiotopia show the truth

148
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:32,511
The body genius is a Dark comic mystery

149
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:35,839
That whines through a treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

150
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,375
We're looking the part

151
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,911
Might cost you your life

152
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:44,287
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

153
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:48,639
Or lose a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

154
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:52,991
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like a dad

155
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:57,343
I'm having I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

156
00:08:57,599 --> 00:09:03,743
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that kind of thing if you

157
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:09,375
Days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

158
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:15,775
Was found dead in my private gym crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

159
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:22,175
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it now I need to

160
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,455
To clear my name

161
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:29,855
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes to find them

162
