Digging into unanswered questions about their history

12
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:45,824

18
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:04,768
Every house is haunted

19
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,840
This is 99% invisible

20
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:10,400
I'm Roman Mars

21
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:17,312
When you're a comic book fan there's always a surge of excitement when they announced a film adaptation of the

22
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:20,896
Character you love the chance to see your hero punch

23
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:24,480
In Twisted movie through the air to make spaghetti

24
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:30,880
But there's always that fear that Hollywood is going to screw it up that the screenwriter won't get the care

25
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:37,280
The way you get the character because you know how it's supposed to be you know Mary Jane came after

26
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:40,352
Gwen Stacy it doesn't make sense the other way

27
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:47,008
But the first indication whether you're going to be buzzing with eager anticipation while you're in line on opening day

28
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:53,408
Card reading each step while you're in line on opening day because let's face it you're going to go no matter what

29
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:59,808
First indication of how good or how bad it's going to be happens months before when they reveal the design

30
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,088
Of the suit

31
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,232
Superhero suits made real with a real Fabric and real people are very hard to design

32
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:09,536
But we will judge them not know why

33
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,816
That is our job

34
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,704
You reckon much more mellow over the years or the suits have gotten much much better

35
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,264
Eric molinsky has noticed this too

36
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:25,664
Eric has done a couple of great episodes for us at 9 p.m. over the years but now he has his own podcast called imaginary world

37
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,224
About sci-fi and other fantasy genres

38
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,064
How we create these worlds and why we suspend our disbelief

39
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:38,464
This is an episode that he produced in 2015 about designing comic book costumes for movie screens and I really like it and I

40
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,048
I know that you're going to like it too it's called fixing the hobo suit

41
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:50,240
Let's not stand on ceremony here

42
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:55,104
If you haven't seen The Dark Knight Rises

43
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,408
Tom Hardy plays the villain

44
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,176
Bait

45
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,968
And for some reason

46
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,784
The voice is a cross between Sean Connery

47
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,064
And Darth Vader

48
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:08,160
Given that the character is supposed to come from a fictional Latin American country

49
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,952
It was a very weird choice

50
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:16,608
Darkness is your ally you merely adopted the dark

51
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,400
But it was so weird

52
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,704
It was kind of amazing

53
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,520
And led to all these really great parities

54
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:31,456
I believe I would like two packs of AAA sauce thank you

55
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,368
But for all the buzz Around The Voice

56
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,416
I was surprised more people didn't talk about the

57
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,184
Costume

58
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,976
Which I thought was ingenious

59
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,816
So in the comics Bane looks kind of like a Mexican wrestler

60
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,608
He's got a black hood over his

61
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,912
With a white design the middle that

62
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:53,472
Kind of looks like a skull with red eyes

63
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:54,752
His strength

64
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:57,056
Comes from tubes going to his back that

65
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,336
Pum pum full of liquid

66
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,104
Steroids

67
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:03,456
And back to shoulders are so huge and bulked out

68
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:07,040
Artist like to draw his head below his neck

69
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,112
It's no way you could do a literal version of that

70
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:13,696
But that didn't stop Joel Schumacher from trying

71
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:15,488
In his 1997

72
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,256
Catastrophe

73
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,536
Batman and Robin

74
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:18,815
Freehold

75
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,375
We Are Evil killing machine

76
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,423
I call this little number

77
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:33,663
Of course Christopher Nolan's Batman to play some kind of a semi-realistic universe

78
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,735
So he and Lindy Hemmings costume design

79
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:41,087
Turn beans liquid steroids into a gas that he inhales

80
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:44,927
But it doesn't make him super strong and actually dulls physical pain

81
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:51,583
His breathing apparatus is the same shape as the design on the hood in the comics but

82
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:57,983
The breathing apparatus is black in the design in the hood with white course not wearing a hood in the movie

83
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:02,335
Instead we see the actress bald head so if you squint

84
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:07,711
Beans head in that movie looks like the exact same design as the comics

85
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:12,831
But the negative image of it of course they couldn't give Bane like cartoonishly huge

86
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:13,599
Shoulders

87
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,391
So instead he wore a coat

88
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:18,975
They had a very high round wool collar

89
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:22,303
They gave him the same silhouette at the comic books

90
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:25,375
Like I said it was a brilliant design solution

91
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,167
Impossible

92
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,727
Superhero costumes used to be

93
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:30,495
Cringe-worthy

94
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:34,591
Even the cool ones like you know Batman from the Tim Burton films

95
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,383
The costume was so bulky

96
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:38,687
Michael Keaton couldn't turn his head

97
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:42,015
Or fight unless they bad guys basically ran into his fists

98
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:45,855
So what happened how did the costumes get so much better

99
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:48,671
I Michael Wilkinson and I'm a costume designer for film

100
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:49,951
Michael worked on Manor

101
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:52,255
Steal any upcoming sequel Batman verse

102
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,023
Superman

103
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,071
He got a lot of heat from a new bat

104
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,607
Because the first images

105
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,399
It look like Ben Affleck

106
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,679
Was wearing a thick rubber

107
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,983
How it wouldn't be able to turn his head with

108
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,263
Feel like a step backward

109
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,823
But newly released images

110
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,359
Show The Dark Knight turning his head

111
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:14,271
I feel like I play When the world has a really good look at the the Cowell then we're as

112
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:17,343
I have people like it's a lot of work went into

113
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:20,671
The construction of that is all sorts of amazing

114
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:23,231
Things going on inside that cow

115
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,767
Let's make it

116
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:28,095
Easy to move in and I have a full range of expressions

117
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:33,215
Superhero costumes stand-alone works of fashion which over

118
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,751
Time became dated

119
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:35,775
Cringe-worthy

120
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:38,079
Even if they were designed by a genius

121
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,127
Like Edna Mode in The Incredibles

122
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:47,295
What do you mean

123
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,087
Distracts from the now

124
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,391
If ground beef

125
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:58,047
Something classic

126
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:01,887
She had a crazy look in the boots

127
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:05,215
One of the big changes is that costume designers

128
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:07,775
Are now looking more closely The Source material

129
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:12,383
When Michael Wilkinson and his collaborator James Atchison worked on Man of Steel

130
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:15,455
They research the history behind Superman's costume

131
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,759
The Genesis of that idea was

132
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:21,343
That you know II perform as the weight lifters and

133
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,367
Strongman

134
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:24,159
Had this look around you know

135
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:27,743
Ellabel Jazzy tights when they're so short

136
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,511
Over the top

137
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:32,607
Superman suit was kind of like a combination of the weightlifter

138
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:34,911
In the ringmaster who wore boots in a cave

139
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:41,823
Also swashbuckling Heroes like Zorro wear capes so James and Michael thought

140
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:45,407
Best to communicate strength power Adventure

141
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:48,991
But I will be going to resolve those silly Redondo

142
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,783
So we went through

143
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,575
Dozens and dozens of drawing

144
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:57,695
And I remember that pretty much just got smaller and smaller and smaller until one day they took

145
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:00,511
Kind of once they're on the illustration.

146
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:03,071
That was the look we decided to go with

147
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,119
What's the S stand for

148
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,703
On my world it means hope

149
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,799
Sammy Sheldon differ

150
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:15,871
Had a similar experience working on X-Men first Class

151
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,175
The previous X-Men movie

152
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,223
The mutants were wearing assertive

153
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,503
Black leather outfits

154
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,807
Just a few distinguishing characteristic

155
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,111
But the director first class

156
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,135
Coupon

157
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:30,207
Told Sammy that he wanted to go back to the original comic

158
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,279
The X-Men or yellow and blue jumps

159
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,839
I'm sorry

160
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,887
Given the LBC

161
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,935
Pheasant is a very simplistic

162
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,959
Join that was on the

163
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,799
I just started researching into

164
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,335
The. Of the time

165
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,895
Why they were drawn The Way They Were

166
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,943
What the colors were represented

167
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:53,247
And what immediately came out with

168
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,295
In 1963

169
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,343
Discovered

170
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,367
Tesla

171
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,463
It felt to me like maybe that's what they were trying to represent in the comic

172
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,999
So we kind of went down this route

173
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:07,071
Seeing if that would work for us and also what natural

174
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,375
The Advent of the nuclear age

175
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,679
May have accelerated mutation process

176
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:15,519
Individuals with extraordinary abilities may already be

177
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,287
Among Us

178
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:19,359
She pulled it off the costumes with cool very six

179
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,431
But honoring the source material is

180
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,199
It's Tricky

181
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:23,967
Comic book

182
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,247
Illustrators

183
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:28,319
Not that they don't understand but they don't need to

184
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:31,647
Make a logic of the lines of that drawing

185
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:38,303
The where it goes from the front to the back of the body round over-the-shoulder it just won't look school on the page and sells the

186
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,607
That the dynamic of the character

187
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,399
When you put that into reality

188
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:44,703
You got to follow those lines around the body three

189
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,983
3 + 360

190
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:49,823
And those characters are wearing skin-tight clothes to show off their

191
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,615
Ridiculously well-defined muscle

192
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,151
For some reason

193
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:55,199
Is completely believable in the comics

194
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:57,503
One thing we discovered is that no matter

195
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,551
What incredible shape and actor is in

196
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:03,135
Once you put a leotard on them then everything is kind of

197
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,671
Smooth out and all that fence

198
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,719
Traffic definition in that I've been working so high

199
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,023
Is kind of negated

200
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:12,095
The next big leap away from cringe-worthy costumes

201
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:12,863
Was Tex

202
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,911
Now the old days,

203
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,215
What's going to be printed in a few limited colors

204
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:20,543
That's why the costumes were usually just one or two maybe three colors

205
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:23,103
What's good I mean I kind of left off the page

206
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,407
But for movie like man of

207
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,175
Steel

208
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,223
Want to get rid of Superman's red Underpants

209
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,503
And the yellow belt

210
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,295
The suit is very blue

211
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,599
And that's boring to look at in HD

212
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:38,463
So they created a silver layer that one under the blue give it a metallic quality

213
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:39,999
And a 3D printer

214
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:40,767
Detector

215
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,047
To get muscle definition

216
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:46,911
Ana pattern of ridges which creates visual interest for lighting in cinematography

217
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,727
And they create a backstory to explain that text

218
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,263
It was chainmail

219
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,591
They went under the armor people wore in the Planet Krypton

220
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:56,639
Another track

221
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,919
Which Sammy's all the different light

222
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:02,015
Is mixing and matching materials on the same costume

223
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,295
Movie X-Men

224
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:04,575
Costumes they wear

225
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,647
Layers and layers of fabric soulwax into your

226
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,671
Piece together and then

227
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,463
You know connecting things

228
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,999
1

229
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:17,119
If you stand away from they just look white blue with yellow baseball at you when you go in close

230
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,423
Kind of intricately

231
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,727
Stitch to make it textured and

232
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,775
Tunnels in the leather pieces and then

233
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,055
Kevlar in the middle

234
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,335
Auto design

235
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:29,407
If it's going to be interesting is that you have to take risks

236
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:33,247
And the thing about superheroes has a fabulous Arena

237
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,015
Take risks

238
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:38,111
The problem is it's a huge amount of money

239
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,415
So you better make you can take the rest

240
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,695
You better make sure that you

241
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,719
You come up with a good

242
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,255
Because it's an

243
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:50,655
Open expensive process to get around very angry fans I'll let you know if they don't like it

244
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,447
Define

245
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,471
The producers

246
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,775
Still waiting on this

247
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,823
Somerset saying where where is it

248
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,639
Finally it needs to move

249
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:05,247
James Atchison had a devil of a time working on the first Spider-Man film

250
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:07,551
The one with Tobey Maguire in 2002

251
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:11,391
It's been three months making nearly 70 versions of that suit

252
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,183
How to get the colors right

253
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:15,487
Making sure the textured webbing seitan

254
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,279
When was finally ready

255
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,559
They took it for a test

256
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:21,375
We had a stunt man on a Wire

257
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:24,191
I'm a fluid straight into a tree

258
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,263
And the whole

259
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,031
Suits

260
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,311
Half the webbing

261
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:32,895
Unglued from the suit I mean it was like it was sort of like a

262
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,175
Terrible waffle

263
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,711
Hanging in the tree

264
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,759
It was such a

265
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,527
Step

266
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,599
Itsfunneh superheroes are supposed to seem indestructible

267
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,671
And maybe there's a scene at the very end where like after the soup

268
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,695
Superheroes been roughed up

269
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,463
Is costumes

270
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,487
Like a little bit tour

271
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:50,047
But in real life these costumes are

272
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,583
Extremely fragile

273
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,631
Soda solution

274
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,167
It's create 20 or

275
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,447
30 versions of the

276
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,471
The same costume

277
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,007
But each one

278
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,287
Is tailor-made

279
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,823
For the specific needs

280
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,847
Each scene

281
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:06,687
When Sammy Sheldon differ work on Marvel's Ant-Man

282
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:07,967
Even that was a

283
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,015
Duke has power

284
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,295
The man harnesses

285
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,599
You should be able to shrink

286
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,647
And grow on a dime

287
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,927
What's your size

288
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,719
Always suits your needs

289
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,767
They want someone to

290
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:23,327
You know 10 over and over and over

291
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,863
Tumblr

292
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,143
Inet

293
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,983
4 in a rubber floor and then they kind of got well he can't do it and these boots and you have to

294
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,007
You have to go

295
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,543
Okay we have to wait for

296
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,335
Boots that look identical to

297
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,359
The Harry Potter books

298
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,151
And almost like that for

299
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,943
It's a grueling job

300
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,735
Michael Wilkinson says

301
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,039
You really need to sort of step back and realize that

302
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,343
This is really a conversation

303
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,135
Tapping across time

304
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,415
Among designer

305
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:51,999
You know an Asian. We're over the centuries you take

306
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,559
The figure of Buddha or something like that on

307
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:59,679
And over the centuries they are refining they putting their own soda stamp on

308
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,727
On these these cultural figures

309
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:02,751
I don't like that

310
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:03,775
I feel with

311
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,311
Without making it to Grand

312
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,615
Without superheroes because you know h

313
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:11,711
Iteration of a superhero reflects a lot about

314
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,247
The society

315
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,807
In which states did they duration was born

316
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,599
He's been giving this a lot of thought

317
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,879
Because he designed the first

318
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,415
Movie version of Wonder Woman

319
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,207
Who will appear in Batman verse

320
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:22,975
Superman

321
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,767
Carmichael this was a

322
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,791
The dream assignment

323
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,071
The Wonder Woman

324
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:29,631
You're not close to my heart growing up

325
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,423
She was

326
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,447
The one that really

327
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:35,775
Captured my imagination and in the strongest way

328
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,311
Really why

329
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:40,127
There's something about Lynda Carter's performance

330
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:44,223
They really crossed into this kind of magical world I was fascinated by the

331
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,759
Her backstory

332
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,807
I was lucky enough to actually work with Linda

333
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,575
Picada

334
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,879
On a film called Sky High when she played

335
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,903
The principal

336
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,183
Hefei high school

337
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:53,951
Pacific Heroes

338
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:59,327
I had a kind of Seminole experience shopping with her on Rodeo Drive that I Pro

339
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,095
Probably never really

340
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:00,863
Get over

341
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:01,887
It was very exciting

342
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:05,983
I think the reason why costumes have gotten so cool

343
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:09,311
It's because the designers are now constantly asking themselves

344
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:10,847
Why

345
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:15,711
I don't think you can just get away with doing if you need Tommy the funny helmet I think you have to make

346
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:16,991
Send

347
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:24,415
Why is that person wearing that suit what does he do with it does he have a power or is it something that the suit gives him

348
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,951
And then a list questions

349
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,231
Lead you onto

350
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,511
How does that work

351
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,351
That's one of the reasons why I love the new Daredevil series on Netflix

352
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:39,263
In the first season they're actually separate episodes to answer all those questions

353
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,311
Why does he need a padded suit

354
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,359
Why does the suit have to be red

355
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,151
Why does it have horns

356
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:50,527
She used to say be careful of the Murdock boys

357
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,623
The evolution of Daredevil costume

358
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:57,951
Becomes the story of the character realizing who he truly is

359
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:01,535
The costume is like an expression of his real self

360
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:04,351
The one that he has to dig down and find

361
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:07,167
Below the surface of his alter ego Matt Murdock

362
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,751
The best costume designers are storytellers

363
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,311
The fans will nitpick but

364
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,639
I don't really feel like there any wrong choices

365
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:19,199
