Funny new ways to create new buildings with new technology has been the bread-and-butter of the Leading Edge architects

00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,784
Time on the Leading Edge was brief

34
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,808
But dramatic

35
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:05,952
Made it the creator of the Memory Palace the History Podcast that is all about being brief and dramatic

36

00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:27,456
As an older man Central Station

41
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,320
Central location

42
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:35,648
The places you waited to get places where things actually happened

43
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:39,232
But buy ticket for Manhattan or St Louis Arch

44
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:42,560
Can you can find other Architects building more impressed

45
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,328
Thanks

46
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:45,376
6 + 8 + 10 story structure

47
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:48,960
Mammoth blocks of stone and brick and wrought iron

48
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:51,776
Made for the kings of the modern American Insurance in

49
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,080
The emperor is of import

50
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:54,848
What's an export

51
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,432
John Noble Stearns made a lot of money importing

52
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:01,248
Silk anyways looking to make a lot more in real estate

53
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,552
He bought some land in a prime location

54
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,576
850 Broadway

55
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,112
But there was a problem

56
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:09,440
Dwight was only 21 and 1/2 feet wide

57
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,256
There are rules that dictate what you can build and how

58
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:17,120
Rules of physics and rules of men who sit on various bureaucratic boards and body

59
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:23,520
And those rules dictated that if Stearns wanted to build one of those 10-story towers that were all the rage in 1888

60
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:26,080
You need to build walls of stone and brick

61
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,616
That were five feet thick

62
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:31,456
That was no for an interior that was only 11 ft wide

63
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:35,296
Play stuff you need for a hallway a few for a bathroom

00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,144
During diastole the best dark

68
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:50,912
Extra solution

69
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,704
They all told him it couldn't be done

70
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,032
Everyone except Bradford Gilbert

71
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:00,384
The in-house architects of the New York Lake Erie and Western railroad had a theory

72
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:05,248
Hundreds of tons of cars in cargo we're hurtling over

73
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,016
Everyday

74
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,344
What if you turn one of those bridges on its head

75
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,136
What if he built a bridge up

76
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,416
Instead of out

77
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,720
Hold strength if he did this

78
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,768
The walls wouldn't have to be fine people

79
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,071
They could be just dine in

80
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,863
20 foot wide office

81
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,143
Places that would create

82
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,959
Quintessential modern American Titan

83
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,751

Came in from all over the country

87
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,687
To watch the tower building rise

88
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,735
Deport over Gilbert's blueprints

89
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,575
Gilbert and Stern

90
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,647
Beg Gilbert to change the plan

91
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,183
But he refused

92
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,999
He said he was so confident in his design

93
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,535
Good movies off

94
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,071
2 floors of the building

95
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,399
You would have the farthest

96
00:04:55,935 --> 00:05:00,031
The first stiff Winds of a hurricane blew into Manhattan on a Sunday morning 1889

97
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,591
The tower building stood

98
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,615
Nearly complete

99
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,919
People lined the streets to watch it

100
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,735
Men pursue the crowd

101
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,015
And began to climb

102
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,087
When Bradford Gilbert reach the top of his Tower

103
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,927
The wind was whipping through its skeleton frame it more than 80 miles an hour

104
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,719
He called out to the center of the building

105
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,511
Pulled from a bag

106
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,279
A rope

107
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,583
With the lead weight attached to one end

108
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,887
You tied the other two a girder

109
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:28,703
You toss the way down through the open floors below

110
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,263
When you called his way back down

111
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,543
He found the lead weight

112
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,311
Hang in there

113
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,591
Stocksdale

114
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:37,407
Held up by a building that wasn't going anywhere

115
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,455
4 years after

116
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:43,295

Or lose a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

135
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:48,063
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like a dad

136
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:54,719
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff actually if I'm being honest

137
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:58,047
I'm one of the main guy to know how to do that kind of thing

138
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:04,447
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop
