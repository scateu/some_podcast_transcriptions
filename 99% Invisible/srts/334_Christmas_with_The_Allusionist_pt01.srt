94
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,423
I must say to suggest

95
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:29,727

But which Story 6

186
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:39,327
The tree one that winter was a marketing and admin umbrella

187
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,351
What's a lie

188
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,655
The twin trouble had come to kill Christmas

189
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:47,775
Nobody asked you could see the

190
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:58,271
Is significantly more about the war on Christmas

191
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,575
The actual evidence

192
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,855
That war

193
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:02,879
Is being waged

194
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:06,463
Some people seem very eager for that to be a war on

195
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,743
So they can leave

196
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:08,767
Two Christmases defense

197
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,863
The Christmas has achieved cultural dominance Way Beyond the religious line

198
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,911
D'cost it as an underdog

199
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,191
Provides a cover for

200
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,471
Taking a puppet of occult

201
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,543
To create to maintain divisions in society

202
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:23,871
But Christmas is a pagan Roman Christian

203
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,431
Celebrated by people from oil filter

204
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,967
Tiffany

205
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:28,991
Including me

206
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,271
Ethnically Jewish

207
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,831
Christmas is not threatened by multi

208
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:33,599
Culturalism

209
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,879
It is multicultural

210
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,927
People don't want change

211
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,487
The schedule change

212
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,791
Ultrasonic sensor

213
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,583
Winslow was used

214
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:47,679
An example of a change gone too far

215
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,727
Because I misread

216
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:50,751
Waltz

217
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,031
The organizer

218
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,055
Trying to do

219
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,615
And they continued to mystery

220
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:59,967
Austin 1998 Birmingham didn't run Winterville again

221
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:05,343
But in the following years the Winterville meth was repeated dozens of times in Britain's national news

222
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:10,719
Invite in 2011 after running another set-piece The Daily Mail have to print a retraction

223
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,767
Saying that we did not rename

224
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:13,791
Will replace Chris

225
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,095
That's too little too late

226
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:19,167
Windmill had already become the byword for play

227
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,447
Political correctness gone mad

228
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:22,239
It still continues

229
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,543
Just a few weeks ago in the British Parliament

230
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,567
Shailesh Vara

231
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,615
The conservative MP for North West Cambridge

232
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:28,639
Tell prime minister

233
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:31,199
Theresa may minority communities

234
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,479
Should respect

235
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,271
Reviews on tradition

236
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:40,415
Mainstream Brittany and that means and that means Christmas is not Winterville

237
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,695
On Christmas trees

238
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:48,095
I'm not pissed at trees we can

239
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:53,983
Agree with him that Christmas is not winter

240
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,799
It's just certain people just

241
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:00,127
Knights who say what they want to say

242
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:08,575
As a marketing story it is very successful because the brand

243
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,599
Really clever

244
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:12,671
If you just called it and I Birmingham winter holidays

245
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,999
Noah

246
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,303
Absolutely

247
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,351
The bronze Bean soy misinterpret

248
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,447
If you had your time again

249
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,239
Would you do it differently

250
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,055
Good for you

251
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:33,151
Experiment

252
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:35,967
The public needs to be introduced to Mew

253
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,759
Cycling initiatives

254
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:41,855
Otherwise we're just going to let you know.

255
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,351
Is it going to do

256
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:56,959
Going to go buy that fried turkey in the window and settle in for another story from The Illusionist

257
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:00,031
Featuring a couple of familiar 99 Guy voices

258
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,055
After this

259
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,383
Between the beats

260
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,687
Bongs and chatter of our devices

261
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:10,271
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man made sound

262
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,295
If

263
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:17,695
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife is

264
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:21,791
Another word for all hearing that voice

265
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:22,559
Technology

266
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,583
He talked to us

267
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,631
It is a creation of Sonic trap

268
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:28,703
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

269
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,287
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

270
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,335
To make them more human

271
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,175
Turn the living room lights on

272
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:39,967
Okay

273
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:42,527
Dim the living room lights to 50%

274
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:44,575
Okay

275
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:50,719
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

276
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,487
Mix

277
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:53,023
For a much more natural

278
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:53,791
Experience

279
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,583
Turn the living room lights on

280
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,911
Dim the living room lights

281
00:13:59,167 --> 00:13:59,935
50%

282
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,263
We're presenting to

00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,359
Special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

About how are soundscape is impacting our health

285
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:12,735
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

286
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:15,551
Look for them Friday is May 17th and May 24th

287
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,319
Right here

288
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,439
Here again is The Illusionist

289
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,975
Anthony 9% invisible

290
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,071
So we're in the parking lot of Cow Palace

291
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,887
Does a gun show happening at the same time

292
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,935
Does welcome Patriots

293
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,263

00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,807
In the Cow Palace arena in Daly City

298
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,599
Just south of San Francisco

299
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,367
California

300
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,415
I mean

301
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,487
60s degrees

302
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:00,095
Not Christmas tree at all

303
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:03,935
The great Dickens Christmas Fair entrance

304
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:08,031
Giant portrait of Santa Claus

305
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:13,919
As you walk in the Dickens Christmas Fair has been an annual event in the Bay Area since 1970

306
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:19,551
Founded by husband-and-wife team run and Phyllis Patterson who previously had started the Renaissance

307
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,855
As in the backyard of that home in Los Angeles

308
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:26,463
The kids run the Dickens bad now it's held on five weekends prior to Christmas

309
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:28,767
And is 120000 square feet

310
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,559
Victorian London Festival

311
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,351
Wow

312
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,703
Midas

313
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,567
They did a good job

314
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,359
Okay so

315
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,663
It smells

316
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:46,943
Lake

317
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,759
Apple cider or something

318
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,295
Spice wifey

319
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:54,623
It started set up to look like an Old English like

320
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,183
Market

321
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:04,095
Yeah they're like storefronts

322
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:09,983
And right here there's a big old timey sign that says champagne and they're like barmaids

323
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,519
Serving champagne

324
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:17,407
The bridge of my God, and they're British flag

325
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,687
Everywhere

326
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:21,759
All along

327
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:22,783
The feeling

328
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,599
It looks like a film set

329
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,135
Straight

330
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:29,695
The streets are named things like Nickleby Road

331
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,719
Crocheting

332
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,999
Pickwick place

333
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,535
Fezziwig's don't party

334
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,815
Do you have a map

335
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,375
FODMAP

336
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,167
Eyewear on Nickleby Road

337
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:39,935
Right now

338
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,263
Charles Dickens house

339
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:48,127
Streets of throwing with people in different interpretations of dickensian costume

340
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:53,247
Compulsory for attendees but encouraged

341
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,039
Pepitas

342
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,575
Batman actually

343
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,599
What is baby

344
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,391
Put their donuts face

345
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:03,743
Rapping in a potato sack and brought them to the victims

346
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:09,631
The Dickens bad London is also inhabited by schools of volunteers and well reset. Costumes

347
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:16,031
Before the event they've been taught relevant history given vocabulary guidelines and chosen names from a selection of approved

348
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,055
Dickensian names

349
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:19,871
Oh yeah

350
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,639
410

351
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,407
Never lacking

352
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:25,247
Patrico family's neverlucky

353
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:28,063
Oh and their English accents

354
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,599
Which I thought were right

355
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,415
Until you hit the docks

356
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,719
If you go any further you're going to hit the gym

357
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:36,511
You don't want to hear

358
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:42,399
What courses at Emsworth

359
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:51,103
I don't know if you could having a little too much laudanum Avenue missing

360
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:54,687
Laudanum was not a controlled substance in nineteenth-century Britain

361
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:57,759
But it is now so the Dickens Fair doesn't sell it

362
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:00,319
But there are lots of places to buy T&L

363
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,855
Aero performance stages

364
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,135

I

369
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,119
Been wanting

Biblical quotations and lines from carols

00:19:56,543 --> 00:20:02,687
Happy Christmas or Merry Christmas in Victoria

403
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,223
August 8th completely inappropriate

When do babies not falling

00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,471
Greg

412
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,263
The word bollocks

413
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,311
That's a good old English

414
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,591
Swear word

415
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:34,943
That's enough. Of my head if if they can't ever use the in his novel Pepsi did

416
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:41,343
I mean it's it's got a long history goes all the way back to Anglo-Saxon English

417
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:42,367
So

418
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:49,535
Festivals of quaint britishness than Publix is our standard go to

419
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,559
English insults

Is this one Ally where everyone is dressed up as like a beggar or a prostitute or I guess a

423
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:01,823

I got a lot of people are fake

429
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,039
Mud on their faces

430
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,063
Here

431
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:14,623
Which is kind of a weird thing look like

432
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:20,000
It wouldn't be my chosen form of escapism on the weekend sure but

433
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:20,768
Being rich

434
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:21,792
Expensive

435
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:22,560
Kevin Hart

436
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,096
Boring things

437
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,400
To gamble and drink

438
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:28,704
Really funny

439
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:31,520
Completely underestimated

440
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,544
Terrifying

441
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,080
Daily

442
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,384
Stresses and strains of

443
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,688
That's not having a food of having

444
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,808
Sexual violence if you're a woman who is a sex worker

445
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:46,624
The diseases you know the infant mortality rates

446
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:49,952
The fact that children working in factories and

447
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:50,720
FML

448
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,000
Kickboxing on the streets

449
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:54,304
Cadillac of educational reform

450
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,352
There is an enormous

451
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,144
Canvas of

452
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:00,704
A sadness of human sadness

453
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,240
Which Dickens picks up on

454
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,288
But there's a strange romance to it

455
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,312
Which we

456
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,848
Seem to Revel in

457
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:13,248
What was the life expectancy

458
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:17,344
1820 whisper something like 40 years old

459
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,136
An hour closer to 80

460
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:24,256
The facts of course this is massive infant mortality rates

461
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:29,120
Alicia Brady High chance of having at least two children died on you

462
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:31,168
If you have a family of six or seven kids

463
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,192
Women

464
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:34,752
Frequently have very serious

465
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:36,288
Illnesses in childbirth

466
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:38,336
More often than not the thing that would kill

467
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:41,152
A woman would be complications from childbirth

468
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:43,200
Cement of course

469
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:47,040
Treatment for service being

470
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,832
Elite dangerous

471
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,368
Temperature

472
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,392
Traveling the world

473
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,952
I'm conquering things in a ruthless fashion

474
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,232
Little circles you have

475
00:22:55,744 --> 00:23:00,864
Terrible diseases and no understanding of germ Theory until the 1850s and 60s

476
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,728
So they're horrible cholera outbreaks the people that understand what spreads Colorado there is

477
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:09,056
Ask Evie that race this entry that race

478
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,592
A typhoid

479
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:16,224
Just terrible deprivation there. People unable to feed themselves unable to have healthy diets

480
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:20,320
There is choke in the bread in the period of History where

481
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,856
You can tell I have an ear infection

482
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,672
A scratch on your wrist

483
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,208
Anything can get infected

484
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,000
So

485
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:31,584
It's really not a very nice time to be living if you don't have

486
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:34,400
Car lot of money and if you do have money you might

487
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:36,192
Still die young as

488
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,240
Happened to several of Dickens

489
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,264
Closest relatives

490
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:45,152
Okay let's go see if we can Pekin

491
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,688
We're getting close to

492
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,504
The house of Charles Dickens wear

493
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:53,344
He's writing you can see in the window hello my goodness

494
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,648
What is

495
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:56,928
Ray-Ban

496
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,048
Could be one of his 20 novels and novellas thousands of short stories all schools in place

497
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:07,424
But given the environment that is quite a high possibility that he's writing something about Christmas

498
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,240
A Christmas Carol wasn't his first Christmas Story

499
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,776
But it was such a hit

500
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:14,336
It's like Mariah Carey really sing all I want

501
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,360
For Christmas Is You

502
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:17,664
Each year off with that was precious A Dickens

503
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,456
Keep supplying festive material

504
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:21,504
His other Christmas stories

505
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,064
The Chimes the cricket on the hearth

506
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,344
The Battle of life

507
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,392
The haunted man and the ghosts

508
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,160
Spigen

509
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,696
Human rights

510
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:36,608
And household World switches his self magazine stories for the Christmas edition of the magazine

511
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:37,888
From July of each year

512
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,424
Mr. Christmas tree

513
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,704
Christmas dinner

514
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:42,240
There's a very

515
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:43,776
Side SA

516
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,568
Britain in 1851

517
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,640
The year in which four of his family members died

518
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:50,176
Code what Christmas is

519
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,456
As we grow older

520
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:52,992
Which is a kind of

521
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:55,552
Tribute to them through several cooling out

522
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:58,880
In defense of Christmas in saying Christmas is about

523
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:02,464
Looking forward and hope and hoping for better future

524
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:04,768
While the same time remembering those who

525
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:05,792
To come before

526
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:06,816
So he

527
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:09,632
Return to Christmas many times in his career

528
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:12,704
Great Expectations starts with a Christmas scene

529
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,240
But none of those

530
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:16,544
Match the success of A Christmas Carol

531
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,360
A Christmas Carol is by far and away his best

532
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:21,152
Is most defiantly

533
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,176
Popular

534
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:22,944

00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,112
How many other books being adopted hundreds of times for film and TV

537
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:32,928
The popularity of A Christmas Carol has never waned

538
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,744
It was an absolute Smash Hits straight away

539
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,816
It was published on the 19th of December 1843

540
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:41,376
I'm by Christmas Eve it was already sold out

541
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:47,776
The next day the book was adopted several times with stage and reprinted and reprinted it has never been out

00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:48,544
Sprint

Back in Britain in the US until his death in 1870

545
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:54,688
And

546
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:55,712
Beyond

547
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,504
Yeah where at where at

548
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,272
Charles Dickens

549
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,832
And where he will be doing a reading

550
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,672
Completely set up like a full interior

551
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:08,256
And there's like a swooning couch and a fireplace and a bookshelf

552
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,048
Tattoos all over the place

553
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,072

00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,712
Reading dramatically

563
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:30,528
A Christmas Carol to a

Sitting in his house

572
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,568
A Merry Christmas

573
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:59,200
What do you know about Charles Dickens

574
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,224
Katie mango

575
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,784
Sew it all

576
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,648
I was in a production of Oliver one

But stick and is one of those off as he's what keep kind of night without even having Reddit

578
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:18,144
Some of his work sticks so much and cultural Consciousness the name becomes an adjectives

00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,168

What Kenzie and is a very very Broad

583
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:26,592
Idea other than incredibly

584
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,712
Avast canvas of what we think of his dickensian and even that we use it as it was

585
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:33,504
That what itself has

00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,528

God bless us everyone

594
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:57,312
Dickensian is quite a tricky word Ashley and I think we

595
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:59,616
Done with nasseri know what we mean when we say it

596
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:01,920
As a what kind of comes up

597
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,456
Public cpaps

598
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:06,272
A sense of squala a sense of people trapped

Young women couldn't

00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:19,328
Suddenly becomes into a life of poverty or crime or violence

602
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,888
But the Kenzie knows I really should sum up

603
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:26,752
Some of the beautiful things some of the wonderful things he harnesses you know when we look at a Christmas carol

604
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:30,080
The way he depicts the street scenes in children

605
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:30,848
People

606
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:34,176
Singing and saying hello to each other the sense of community the

607
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,968
The shop windows

608
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:42,624
I filled to the brim with delicious goods and treats to eat on Christmas Day and toys in the window

609
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,696
Also a Bountiful

610
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,256
Visual iconography

611
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,792
Dickens country.

612
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:50,560
Both

613
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:52,352
Oh so quiet

614
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:55,680
Enrapturing entrancing

615
00:28:55,936 --> 00:29:01,056
Visions of what the city and the community could be so dickensian tends to be

616
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:03,104
Quite negative but I can really

617
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,176
Should I supposed apply to all of the different

618
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:11,808
Atwells the Dickens created and some of those were all the Pleasanton lovely and some of those were

619
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:13,344
Robert Rule and dog

620
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,392

Steeler Christmas

Chicken

623
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:19,744
Yeah

624
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,840
Written about Christmas but don't have festive Festival

625
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:28,192
What is Dickens get to be the adjectives why is he given credit for Christmas

626
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,984
I want to pick people up and say is

627
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,544
Dickens invented Christmas which is absolute nonsense

628
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,312
Of course he didn't

629
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:36,384
Chelsea Kansas Christmases

630
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:40,736
Perpetuated some traditions he

631
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:48,928
Child that he

632
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:51,232
Perpetuated and shed in his books

633
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:53,792
Singing feasting charitable donations

634
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:54,816
YouTube

635
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:58,912
Medieval chewed up Stewart Georgian whatever you want to call that so

636
00:29:59,168 --> 00:29:59,680
Dickens

637
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:01,216
Is not the architect

638
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:02,496
He's a cheerleader

639
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:04,032
Three different professions

640
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:08,640
Maybe maybe Saturday mean they both build large structures

641
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:12,480
The Christmas carol landed at a time when there was a trend for nostalgia

642
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:15,552
The nineteenth-century zientara why you have many folks arrest

643
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,856
And antiquarians

644
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:24,000
Taking an interest in the old ways there is definitely in the 19 century this idea of

645
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,792
I miss College eyes post

646
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:28,096
The Chew today ribbing

647
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:29,632
It's at Halcyon dive

648
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:33,984
Just as we have the dickensian festival is in San Francisco and we look best victorians

649
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:39,872
The victorians looked back to the Saxons and the Normans and The Chew

650
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:43,200
As a kind of Glory Days of simplicity

651
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:47,040
The good old days of Christmas

652
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:49,088
What much more pleasant

653
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:54,464
Because in some ways Victorian Christmas is a reaction to industrialization

654
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,000
The trauma of

655
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,536
Enormous economic

656
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:58,560
Frost

657
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:03,168
People moving from the countryside into the cities of communities being broken up

658
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:05,472
Dark satanic Mills

659
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:08,544
A factories of trains in industry

660
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,384
Of the British Empire expanding and people being separated by

661
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,432
Huge geographical distances

662
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:18,528
A Christmas Carol was riding a wave of renewed interest in Christmas

663
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:20,832
Along with the Revival of older faster

664
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,880
Costumes that win new ones imagine that

665
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:23,648
The K2

666
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:28,512
Christmas cards with suddenly logistically Bible with the invention of the penny Post in 1840

667
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:29,792
Christmas trees

668
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:30,816
Became popular around

669
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:33,632
King George the third German wife

670
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:36,448
Starting in the late 1700 so they went completely new

671
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:42,336
But they wouldn't really fashionable when in 1848 Queen Victoria Prince Albert and their children posed in front of

672
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:44,128
Illustrated London news

673
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,200
And like when whatever Kate Middleton was sells out

674
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:49,760
Christmas trees became All the Rage so

675
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:51,552
Quad loss of traditions

676
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,648
Movie think of his Traditions now that we assume that the Keynesian

677
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:59,488
Dickensian exactly the same time

678
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:01,024
2q coincidence

679
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,328
And it's so much together

680
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:08,192
Andis Victorian Festival suddenly feels like it's this brand-new thing

681
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:12,800
But it's not it's a continuity with some extra additional elements

682
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:18,176
The capitalism rapsody flop Christmas is a commercial economy

683
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:21,504
Without parallel

684
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,040
Had been for a while

685
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:33,024
Toys for children which is a new market is just opening up

686
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,352
Dickens's main intention wasn't to cash in on Christmas

687
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,400
Emanated need the money

688
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:41,472
Though he had had considerable literary success the previous decade

689
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:47,104
Lately the serialization of his noble Martin chuzzlewit haven't been too popular and his income was looking dice

690
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,712
Kelsey had a growing family to support him was often bailing out his parents and siblings to

691
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:54,272
I'm Dickens did sincerely love Christmas

692
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:56,064
His children write about the reddish

693
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,112
Which the father praise the festivities

694
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:01,184
But that wasn't the primary motivation either

695
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:06,560
Instead his heart filming Christmas Fable was the cover story for a political mission

696
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:09,888
He's a man who had a tremendous

697
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:12,448
Political appetites on who was

698
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,984
Of the middle classes

699
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,032
And after class

700
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:18,080
It was always on the side of

701
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:19,104
The wagon Clawson

702
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:23,968
And this of course was largely because he'd experienced poverty as a child

703
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,808
Dickens was the second of eight children in a pretty close family

704
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:30,624
I'm hot but he considered to be an adult child

705
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:37,024
Until he was aged 11 whereupon his father regularly had financial problems was sent to prison for debt

706
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:41,376
Anna's was customer at the time taken his mother and younger siblings moved in there with him

707
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:43,936
Puryear Charles Dickens left alone

708
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:48,800
He had to quit school and work 10-hour days 6 days a week under boot-blacking fact

709
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:51,104
Does a family dead reunite

710
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,384
Experience

711
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,176
Dickens informing much beeswax

712
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:54,944
Complete collapse

713
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:58,016
He's a man who's always championing

714
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:00,576
Those who've had a less fortunate life

715
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:04,672
He campaigned against public executions he thought they were vile and Grimm

716
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:09,536
You know he campaign for the women he campaign for Beto schooling for children

717
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,584
He's a man who

718
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,120
Who uses his voice

719
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:15,168
The campaigning tool

720
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:20,288
In the Victorian era

721
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,592
Many people Duster

722
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:27,200
Industrial Revolution adopted in such huge societal and economic changes.

723
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:30,528
Welfare and Health Services has not been instituted yet

724
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,832
I'm Dickens was horrified

725
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:36,160
The poverty so many people was stricken by in 1843

726
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:38,720
Particularly The Temptations children when living in

727
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:41,280
On the streets in schools for the impoverished

728
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:44,352
Looking down mines or in factories is he

729
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:47,168
And he was desperate to make a palpable difference

730
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:50,496
As a journalist he planned to write a political pamphlet

731
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:51,776
Entitled

732
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:55,104
An appeal to the people of England for the benefit of the poor man's child

733
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:58,432
But you realize that not many people would read a political compass

734
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,504
They would however read his fiction

735
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:04,832
And as a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down

736
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:07,648
Dickens code to display for social justice with

737
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:09,184
They feel good Christmas ghost

738
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:10,720
That's a Dickens

739
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:13,280
And I'd like to run with right many many

740
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:16,096
Journalistic pieces and editorials and he would

741
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:17,632
He would use his power

742
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:19,680
As a journalist in an essay yes

743
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:24,544
But with A Christmas Carol he's using his power as a Sentimental novelist

744
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:27,104
To move people to action

745
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:31,712
To inspire them to be better Christians to be better British people to be better

746
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:32,736
Neighbors

747
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:35,296
Family members lovers friends

748
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:37,600
Play whack his colleagues set

749
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:39,648
It's a book about charity

750
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,696
It's a book about community and about

751
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:42,720
What happens

752
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:43,744
When

753
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,536
The ravages of capitalism

754
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:48,864
Erode the human spirit

755
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,936
The corrupt the heart of Scrooge

756
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:55,776
You know he was a man who once felt he wants cat who once loved

757
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:59,104
An ultimately over the years he's being sensitive

758
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:02,432
Gradually worn down by this

759
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:04,480
Victorian Age 2

760
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:05,504
Make profit

761
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,600
The economy industrial progress moving forward

762
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:12,160
He's lost his Humanity

763
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:14,720
To the point that his own family

764
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:19,072
I mean I wasn't really want to hang out with and they already know he's lost all reason to say

765
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:20,608
For his fellow man

766
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,912
A Christmas Carol is

767
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,192
An allegory

768
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:27,264
Every Christian allegory a deeply spiritual book

769
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,032
About

770
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,848
A man who has become lost

771
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,640
Finding his way back

772
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:34,176
To his Humanity

773
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:36,736
I'm taking this Mission did succeed

774
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:37,760
Somewhat

775
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:43,904
The book was credited with causing a rise in charitable giving and going to General State your fellow humans and employees

776
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:44,672
Lisa Christmas

777
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:45,952
But it couldn't

778
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:47,744
Totally transformed Society

779
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,792
Literature can remove us

780
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:52,352
But ultimately structural systems

781
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:53,888
All very hard to shift

782
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:54,656
And

783
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:56,448
Victoria.

784
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:58,240
Had many many

785
00:36:58,752 --> 00:36:59,520
Yes

786
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:02,336
Of moving forward in the very small

787
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:05,408
Steps being taken with their children's rights

788
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:08,480
Education reform since all the rights of women in particular

789
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:11,040
The Christmas aspect may have overwhelmed

790
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:11,808
The place call message

791
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:18,720
Patience

792
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:25,120
Like Scrooged we're running a little further away with inspiration like bad Sunday but I tell you what

793
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,912
B&B original still works

794
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:28,448
Treat because

795
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:32,800
It's really read a book the characters leap off the page

796
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:35,360
It's really moving

797
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:38,688
Inspiring and you desperately hope that

798
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:39,456
Scrooge

799
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:41,248
Stays reformed

800
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,784
It's really funny as well

801
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,880
I think one of the disadvantages to the web dickensian is it it makes his wife sound like

802
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:49,952
You going to be studying the Christmas pudding boiled for 8 hours

803
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:52,256
But it's not a cozy. Piece

804
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:54,048
His book is a reaction

805
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:55,072
Three economic

806
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:57,376
Situation in the 1840s

807
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:59,424
Facebook is deeply Morton

808
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:00,704
And yet

809
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,472
His

810
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:03,776
Outlook his ass to choose his

811
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,824
Sense of nostalgia for Whimsy

812
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,848
Is a course

813
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:08,640
In many ways DP traditional

814
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,456
Is

815
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:12,992
Bringing it kind of

816
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,016
Fusion

817
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:16,320
Between Haifa maternity

818
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:18,112
Old fashioned

819
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:19,136
Old timey

820
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:22,720
Lovely Nostalgia Fuel and when we look back

821
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:25,024
Dickens we

822

Before we go I want to tell you about the body genius

839
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,264
5 part series from Bello radiotopia show the truth

840
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,800
The body genius is a dark

841
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:41,824
Comic mystery

842
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,152
That whines through a treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

843
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:46,688
We're looking the part

844
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:48,224
Might cost you your life

845
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:53,600
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

846
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:57,952
Or lose a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

847
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:02,304
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like a dad

848
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,840
I'm having

849
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:06,656
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

850
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:08,960
Actually if I'm being honest

851
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:11,008
I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that

852
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:17,408
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an act

853
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,688
Watch a movie called Immortal cop

854
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:22,016
Was found dead in my private gym

855
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:25,344
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

856
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:29,696
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

857
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:30,720
Now

858
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:32,768
I need to clear my name

859
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:39,168
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes to find them
