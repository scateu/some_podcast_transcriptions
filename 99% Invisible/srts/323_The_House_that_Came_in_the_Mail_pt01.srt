Itemized

60
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:08,672
But starting with this very issue in 1908

61
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,976
The company that offered America everything

62
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:16,864
Began offering what just might be the most audacious and in some ways most necessary

63
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,888
Item level

64
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:23,520
Wait these are houses

65
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:28,896
On page 596 subscribers would come across a drawing of a house

66
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:29,920

Exactly provided catalog

78
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,032
Between dozens of different designs

79
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:59,360
All you had to do was select your preferred model from the catalog

80
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,896
Fill out the provided form

81
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:01,920
Sending the check

82
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:05,504
A few weeks later everything you need would arrive in a train car

83
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,296
It's door was secured

84
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:09,088
The small red wax seal

85
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:12,160
Just like the Sea on the back of a letter to the king or something

86
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,720
It was to be broken

87
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,512
Throw for the door to this box

88
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,791
Car and you're looking at

89
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:18,815

Cedar Shakes

93
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,191
That's Rosemary Thorne

94
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:27,775
An architectural historian and author of the houses that Sears

95
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:31,359
She says that that train car also came with every single door

96
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,639
Every single door knob

97
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,919
Old way ironing

98
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:34,687
Beer Kitchen

99
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,223
In the mantle for the fire

100
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,527
And then you would begin the process

101
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,063
List of dutifully loading it

102
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,087
Either onto

103
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:43,135

00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:43,903
Model T

105
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,695
Plumber came precut

106
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,487
Giant Ikea

107
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:48,767
Along with

108
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:50,815
Instructions

109
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,607
If you provided the foundation

110
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,631
Sears promise

111
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,911
That working without a carpet

112
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,447
Only rudimentary skills

00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,751
You can finish your Sears mail-order home

In less than 90 days

115
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:03,103
Claire Rosemary says does instructions also came

116
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:03,871
Weather warning

117
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:07,199
Do not accept anyone's advice on how this house should

118
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,223
Rebuilt follow this

119
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,271
Instruction manual and do not.

120
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,063
DV8 Sochi old wise

121
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,087
Carpenter

122
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,111
Buy and sell

123
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,927
I want to do that way and

124
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,231
Sears is warning you up front do not live

125
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:19,999
Listen to that man

126
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:24,607
Sears were going to ship out some 75000 homes across the country

127
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:29,727
In doing so they helped replace the idea that each new house needed to be built from scratch

128
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:33,823
The promise that new homes could be standardized affordable

129
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,871
Within Reach of every family

130
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:39,455
Long before the Advent of housing developments in the modern suburb

131
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:45,087
It was the Sears kit home that gave Americans their first taste of 20th century domestic life

132
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:49,951
But it's also a chapter of housing history that was almost lost

133
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,351
Sears not the first company to offer Keno

134
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,399
First mail order catalog

135
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,191
I can't dominate mail order

136
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,727
Is it founder Richards

137
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:06,079
What's that thing that so many people would claim to be over the course of the 20th century

138
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,127
Very few actually War

139
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,455
Did you just did

140
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:14,271
So many things and one is it one of my favorites

141
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,039
Is this

142
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:18,623
Sears knew that most Farm households would have both them

143
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,903
Montgomery Ward app

144
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,183
Sears Roebuck catalog

145
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:21,951
The household

146
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:24,255
So we purposely made his

147
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,279
Catalog

148
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:30,143
Just a little bit less wide and a little bit less tall in the Montgomery Ward catalog

149
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:36,543
Knowing that when The Farmhouse wife was tidying things up she would naturally put the Sears Roebuck catalog on

150
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:39,871
Top of the Montgomery Ward catalog I love that

151
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:46,783
A 1907 Sears and Roebuck was selling this been equivalent of 1.3 billion dollars

152
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,551
Merchandise

153
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,599
American family every year

154
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:54,207
It's around this time Richard Sears saw a weight cell even more

155
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:58,303
Most American families were still living in multi-generational housing

156
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,351
The reigning Paradigm of the middle class

157
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:03,679
Was the Victorian home with its many little rooms

158
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:06,495
Giving up children uncles and grandparents

159
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:11,359
Sears looked at this idyllic scene of families living in Harmony and saw

160
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,407
A wasted opportunity

161
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:18,015
Why should newlyweds move in the old homes with old things when they can move into new homes

162
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,295
Building with new things

163
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:20,575
From Sears

164
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:21,855
And that's

165
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,647
Sears modern home program

166
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,183
It was a hit

167
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,231
Basically after the end of World War 1

168
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,255
The influx

169
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,559
Veterans triggered a need for more housing

170
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:33,631
And there's literature that said if you really love this

171
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,703
If you really want to do right by America

172
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:37,727
Bye

173
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,007
Build a house

174
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,799
That's when kit homes

175
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,079
Really took off

176
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:44,383
Sears cut lumber for almost all of these

177
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,407
Right order

178
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,455
Giant Mills situated across the

179
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:48,735
The large

180
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:52,319
In Cairo Illinois at the Confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio rivers

181
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,855
Covered nearly Forty Acre

182
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,927
MSU variety of homes it shipped out with Stager

183
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:00,511
That first motorhome catalog at over 40 models to choose

184
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,559
Sears Will Go On.

185
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,095
447

186
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,119
Different designs

187
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,423
Every house in the catalog had a name

188
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,727
Fitting its architectural aspirations

189
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:15,359

Sears even offered a 6 classroom School House

Complete with an auditorium and Library

212
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,967
Mostly it was hot

213
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:52,991
Big

214
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,015
Beautiful

215
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,295
Empty homes

216
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:58,623
Just waiting to be filled with things

217
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:05,279
In fact if you look at some of the old floor plan it'll feature the living room the dining room the bedrooms but then it will say

218
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,071

00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,215
Kind of showing people

222
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:17,311
How to stuff their houses with stuff from the Sears Roebuck catalog

In part because the company used is considerable marketing Savvy to make it clear

231
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,559
The building your house was going to be easy

232
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,607
The pre-designed home

233
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,143
You didn't need an architect

234
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:45,983
And with the pre-cut Lumber frame you didn't need a carpenter either

235
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:48,799
You can treat it like any other consumer item

236
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,359
Sears even have his add in front of the catalog

237

241
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,575
Using ordinary building materials

242
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,855
Uncut stick Lumber

Retrica camera

245
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:07,231
In the ad the house with the stick Lumber sits unfinished

246
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:11,839
People are collapsed in the front yard exhausted

247
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,631
Precut Lumber

248
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:16,447
They're sitting on the porch with a mint julep you know having

249
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,239
The time of their life

250
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,311
Forget hire contractors Builder Sears home

251
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,335
Many did not

252
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,615
And I have heard

253
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,407
Many stories about

254
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:26,687
Family

255
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,967
Receiving their kit home

256
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:31,039
And calling on neighbors to help them come out

257
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,063
Start the process

258
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,343
Building the house

259
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:36,927
For many families these for their first homes with things like Central Heating

260
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:37,695
Inflation

261
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:38,975
In some neighborhoods

262
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:42,047
Sears kit home by the only house on the block with electricity

263
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:46,655
Annie 1911 Sears began offering competitive mortgages to their customers

264
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:51,263
Which also helped people in neighborhoods of color again around the practice of redlining

265
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,287
And redlining

266
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,335
Just meant that the bankers in the mortgage

267
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:58,943
Lenders would draw a line around neighborhoods where they would not loan money

268
00:10:59,199 --> 00:10:59,967
So Sears

269
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,247
Didn't do any of that

270
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,783
And that enabled immigrants

271
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,063
Men and women of

272
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,599
Color and single women

273
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,623
Who would otherwise

274
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,183
Never have a chance of becoming a homeowner

275
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:11,743
Have indoor plumbing for the first time

276
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,535
Then the company discovered

277
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,071
Edited made a mistake

278
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,863
Probably sound

279
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:17,631
All 2

280
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,399
Familiar

281
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:24,799
From the beginning Sears had made sure their mortgage policy was like everything else in their catalog

282
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:25,567
Obtainable

283
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:31,199
Application form was only half a page long and almost everyone who applied for a mortgage qualified

284
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:37,855
Meaning of the average Sears homeowner was also in debt to Sears in the Roaring Twenties when interest rates were low

285
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,135
Sew-in liquidity High

286
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,671
It wasn't a problem

287
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,463
But when the Great Depression hit

288
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,999
Things got ugly fast

289
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:48,351
The end-up foreclosing on tens of thousands of very own customers

290
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,375
It was a

291
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:52,447
Emotional Devastation we all know the Great Depression

292
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,751
Was horrible for so many reasons

293
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:57,055
Losing a home that you had built

294
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:00,383
With your own two hands just seems like such a

295
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,407
Twist of the knife

296
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:04,223
For Sears it was a PR disaster

297
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,551
Best Mary remembers talking to someone in 2003

298
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:11,135
Describe has Sears have foreclosed on their grandparents home in 1931

299
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,671
Very same home

300
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,719
Sold them a decade earlier

301
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,767
And he said for two generations

302
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:19,583
Our family never patronize Sears ever again

303
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:22,399
Those are strong feelings go from 19

304
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,167
31

305
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,447
2003

306
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,495
After years of declining sales

307
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:30,079
Sears would finally closed its modern homes Department in 1940

308
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:34,431
A few other kit home manufacturers ones that hadn't sold mortgages

309
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,455
They survived

310
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:38,271
But the Sears kit home boom was over

311
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,319
Then came World War

312
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,087
And with it

313
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:41,855
The next

314
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,391
Modern housing boom

315
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,183
Between the rise of the suburbs

316
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,719
And a prefab home

317
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:47,743
The homes

318
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:48,767
So many of us

319
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,047
Live in today

320
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:54,399
Most of the Sears homes the Alhambra the argyle the Magnolias

321
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:57,727
Ends up being sold to new owners who didn't know what they bought

322
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,007
I didn't care to know

323
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,311
Despite the high quality of materials

324
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,335
With Decades of

325
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:05,919
Comedian associated with companions over and above quality

326
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:08,479
Don't want to admit they live in a home

327
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,503
Elephants ears

328
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:14,623
A lot of them end up being renovated beyond recognition

329
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,415
Many were torn down

330
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,207
Others were simply abandon

331
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:24,095
And ask her where to find the ones that remain unfortunately after World War II

332
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,887
During a corporate house cleaning

333
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:26,655
Sales record

334
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,679
Search were destroyed

335
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:31,263
Phillies records are the records are missing

336
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,615
Turn somebody's burnpile all that stuff was

337
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,383
Disposed off

338
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,943
So the only way to find these house

339
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:39,967
Today is

340
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:41,503
Literally one by one

341
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:45,343
Weeks after I interviewed Rosemary

342
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:49,183
I want to see some of the last remaining Sears homes outside of Cairo Illinois

343
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,743
Town of Sears largest male in 1 stud

344
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:57,119
I got there only sign that there's never been anything there with the name of an overgrown back road

345
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,143
Sears

346
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,983
These are the two tiny houses to Sears rodessa models

347
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,519
Next to each other

348
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:06,335
They were the cleaner odesza models from that original advertise

349
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,639
2 homes being built

350
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,175
One fast one slow

351
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,199
Side by side

352
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,759
Now they weren't so so shape

353
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:16,575
But somehow they'd outlive the mail that built them

354
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,367
Sears Roebuck Road

355
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,159
Stop take a look

356
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,695
30 seconds later

357
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,231
A man wake me inside

358
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:31,679
Go to your room

359
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,311
They're just noise they don't mean no

360
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,103
They try to scare you off I think

361
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:42,431
Guy Parks greeted me wearing an old mechanic's jumpsuit

362
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,991
He settled into an easy chair in the living room

363
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:48,063
He told me that he lived on and off in Cairo since the 1950

364
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,111
Eddie first laid eyes on this route

365
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,903
Every 35 years ago

366
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,439
In the house was derelict

367
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,463
I mean it was

368
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,767
The roof was leaking

369
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,559
The windows were broke out

370
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,095
It was still safe

371
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,631
They withhold

372
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,935
Guy ran into the owner little while later

373
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,495
How about I tell you the place

374
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:07,519
Can you fix it up

375
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,311
After the hell I can't buy nothing

376
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,127
I saved $2 on my last check

377
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,431
He said I'll make it where you can buy

378
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,991
He said 1500 SLT for 15

379
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:21,087
I thought you meant that was an awesome and I would give that farted. In shape

380
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,879
He's on talk about a hundred

381
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,695
Okay you wait right here

382
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:32,095
So guy went out came back an hour later with the cash and bought through Adesa for $1,500 on the spot

383
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,655
Eventually by the rodessa next to it to

384
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,423
Between

385
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,215
His son lives there now

386
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,519
Nightsiders but I'm dumb enough

387
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:44,127
The last man everything I made for the next 5-6 years on this place

388
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,431
Try to make it right

389
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,479
You know that it was a

390
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,575
Sears home

391
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:54,367
Does a man live down on the corner

392
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,647
He work for Sears

393
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:56,927
You telling me story

394
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,719
Call

395
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,815
But he always told me the bad stuff

396
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:06,655
Guys neighbor told him that job at the Mill I've been

397
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,679
Hard dangerous

398
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,727
As a lot of males in the air

399
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:12,543
It wasn't uncommon see employees missing finger

400
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,359
Sears Mountain Home Department closed

401
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:19,455
Where can I purchase the plant in Switched making crates for bombers during World War II

402
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:23,039
After that they tried making their own kit homes under a new name

403
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,343
Ultimately they couldn't hold on

404
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,903
Canal closed in 1955

405
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:30,463
They didn't make very many homes after that I think this

406
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:32,767
One down and the little yellow house was

407
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,303
Probably the last one they built

408
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,095
It was just a little

409
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,655
A little shotgun house

410
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:41,215
My wife's sister lived there until she died

411
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:47,359
Even guys house isn't very serious anymore he's replaced a lot of the original parts over the years

412
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,639
Front door

413
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,943
The only thing in this house is

414
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:53,503
In this room right here this original was at front door

415
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,295
Sears door

416
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:59,391
4 series of race riots got to downtown Cairo 19th 6

417
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:02,463
I had nearly a hundred other Sears homes

418
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,767
Namibia last third of them are left

419
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,559
Skywatch this arrest

420
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,327
Abandon

421
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,607
Reduced to Rubble

422
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:09,887
Anna

423
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,935
The downtown just get going down

424
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,471
Going down going down

425
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:17,567
You can say every month or so they'll be another business gone

426
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:19,871
Tennessee

427
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,407
Find there was nothing down there but

428
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,431
Derelict buildings

429
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,455
Falling down

430
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:24,735
Anna

431
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,271
Sentinel event

432
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,551
All that done

433
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:30,367
Doggone definition

434
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:35,743
For a long time by parx's little rodessa and its twin

435
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:40,607
We're just two of a small handful of Sears homes that have been located and identified

436
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:45,215
When guy bought his house of the 75,000 kit homes that Sears built and shipped

437
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:48,031
Maybe 5% have been properly documented

438
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,823
Moose at undiscovered

439
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,383
If you lived in a Sears house chances are

440
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,663
You didn't even know it

441
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,455
A little over 20 years

442
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:58,015
One woman took a big step towards change

443
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,295
Although

444
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,831
As she herself would be there

445
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:01,599
Crestwood met

446
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,903
She didn't really mean to

447
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:06,463
It's pure Serendipity then I ended up

448
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,743
In this field

449
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,023
This is Rebecca

450
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:11,071
And no she doesn't live with you

451
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,143
But she does live in a town on the other end

452
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,935
A little Western Chicago

453
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:16,959
On the Fox River

454
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,495
It's called Elgin

455
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:22,079
And unlike Caro Elgin was not known for Sears homes

456
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,639
Rebecca first got there in the mid-90s

457
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,943
Almost no one there herself included

458
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,991
New with a Sears house was

459
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:33,087
Then my partner died in 1995 and I was

460
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,111
Doing everything

461
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,391
Because

462
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,159
It help

463
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,487
And that's how Rebecca ended up at the local library

464
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:42,815
Or she having fun a book about see ourselves which contained old

465
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,863
Catalog images of the various models

466
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,399
What you mean nothing

467
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,959
Capital One bitterly cold day in February

468
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:53,823
1997 happened to be lying on the dining room table

469
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:59,711
And it picked it up and I said oh haha I wonder if I can walk around my neighborhood

470
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:05,343
That would be really funny and so I picked up the book and I've said about walking in my neighbor

471
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:06,879
How many were you real

472
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,439
I wasn't expecting to find it

473
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:13,791
It was really kind of fun you know I had to go I had a mission

474
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,071
I forgot about the

475
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:18,399
Alarm clock

476
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:20,191
Time 15 minutes

477
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:22,495
I was walking down the street

478
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:23,519
And

479
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:26,591
I saw this house and I instantly knew it was

480
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,359
Sears

481
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,663
Right there after almost zero effort

482
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,455
Sears house

483
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:33,247
Makeup looks paused

484
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,015
What's the book

485
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:34,783
The house

486
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:35,807
The book

487
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,367
Craftsman style

488
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,391
Tapered porch column

489
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,927
The Avalon model

490
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:45,535
Then I said I wonder if I could walk around my neighborhood and find another one

491
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:57,311
And so I did on walk after walk

492
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,335
Rebecca Katz

493
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:04,735
Finding Sears models the Mitchell the Crescent the Vilonia and it was the Betsy Ross the Osborne

494
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:11,135
Text ICE one street that has the sunlight model and one side of the street and opposites the star lights

495
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:14,463
Starlight right across the street from each other

496
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:21,631
Rebecca wanted to confirm that these were serious homes so she sent a mailer app asking each resident to go and inspect

497
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:28,031
When did most discovered beams bearing a special stamp with a part number from Sears

498
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:31,871
Others found shipping labels from Sears on the back of attic baseboards

499
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:35,199
Two others managed to find their homes original series blueprints

500
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,991
Rebecca is not even done

501
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:40,319
There still more houses waiting to be investigated

502
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:42,879
What is the total number of houses in Eldon MO

503
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:46,463
At the moment

504
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:51,583
I think we are at 237 Sears houses in about a hundred from other companies

505
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,119
What's more

506
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,655
Most of the homes Rebecca found

507
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:55,423
Look like they were

508
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,703
Straight out of the catalog

509
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:59,263
They barely been altered since the 19th

510
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,567
That's why she was able to find something

511
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,103
Because the homes

512
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:03,871
Still be recognized

513
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,687
And there was a specific reason why

514
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,503
When the Elgin Watch Factory which had employed

515
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:12,319
A quarter of the Town closed in 1960

516
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,087
Before

517
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:15,391
Elgin entered a localized recession

518
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,416
Experian

519
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:19,232
From the renovation craze of the 60s and 70s

520
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:22,304
Instead Elgin Sears Home simply sat

521
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:23,584
Through the decades

522
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,352
Untouched

523
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:28,448
Has anyone ever went out the back at the closing of the watch Factory froze the houses

524
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,472
19 time

525
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:31,520
Oh yeah we we talked about that

526
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,824
Stuff we love it

527
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,848
We love it

528
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,896
The study of the Elgin homes

529
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:38,432
Along with your two other research

530
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,456
Makro store

531
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,736
Architectural history

532
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:44,320
What helped launch what is become a Sears house hunting movie

533
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:47,392
Turkish Chief passion in life is to scour the way

534
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,952
Try to find as many kittens as pause

535
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,488
Equity Rose

536
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:52,768
Some people do crossword

537
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:53,536
Word puzzles

538
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,840
Some people do jigsaw puzzles

539
00:21:56,096 --> 00:22:00,704
I guess I look for Sears home but I actually listened Dale and Wendy

540
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:01,984
Andrew

541
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,544
And Nigel and Cindy

542
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,080
Look for soup

543
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:10,176
Those names form part of an elite corps of the Sears House Hunters

544
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,712
In a team if you will

545
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,760
And like any proper 18

546
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:15,808
Each member has their specialty

547
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:22,208
Rosemary Hunter the rare Sears Magnolia the three-story Colonial Mansion so far she says

548
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:23,488
They found 10

549
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,120
Their walkie specializes in kit homes built by Sears biggest competitor Aladdin company

550
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:31,680
Reminder much is the numbers down

551
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:35,264
He's currently working with about half a dozen people on a database that would list

552
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,544
Every single tear

553
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:43,200
Meanwhile Nigel Tate at 19 is the youngest member of their team he's found over 1000 kit homes

554
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,736
Without even leaving his desk

555
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:46,784
Uses Google Street View

556
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:53,184
Mostly they hunt for houses the old-fashioned way chasing down Clues patrolling the Mean Streets of America

557
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:00,864

Sears homes on the only Sears architecture. In the landscape

583
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:27,136

00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:27,904
After this

585
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,584
Between the beats

586
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,888
Bongs and chatter of our devices

587
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:41,472
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man made sound

588
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:42,496
If

589
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:48,896

00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:53,760
Technology

592
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:54,528
He talked to us

593
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,832
It is a creation of Sonic trap

Okay

601
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:21,920
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

602
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:22,688
Mix

603
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:24,224
For a much more natural

604
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:24,992

Constipation abdominal pain and bloating you tell yourself it's not that bad you take laxatives modify your diet

Flash podcast

622
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:28,736
Use the fork record that join the team at 99percentinvisible he and I started corresponding by email

623
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:31,808
Among other things he sometimes sent over story ideas

624
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,416
And one of those was about an old Sears building he moved into in Minneapolis

625
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,952
It's not a serious home it's

626
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:38,976
Tessier's plant

627
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:39,744
Huge

628
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,536
City Block size Warehouse

629
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:43,584
Distribution center and Retail Store

630
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,632
Yeah when I was really young

631
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:47,168
I used to actually go shopping list

632
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:49,472
12 story Art Deco Sears

633
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:50,752
I go there with my parents

634
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:54,592
But for most of my years in Minnesota it was just an abandoned building

635
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:55,872
I used to bike

636
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:58,432
4 miles along this overgrown railroad track

637
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,712
Ran past the building

638
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:00,992
A trench and

639
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:03,296
At the time that B complex

640
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,160
Ominous presence that you just kind of slipped passed on your bike

641
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,952
Can I get to close to you

642
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:11,232
So you basically don't

643
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,000
Engaged

644
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,536
It's not really something nice

645
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:14,304
If you go up to you just

646
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:20,960
Psychopathic Eckley city blocks so it was really kind of between the parking lot in the

647
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:22,496
Building was just this big empty

648
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:24,032
Depressing city

649
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:27,104
And then suddenly you know I move back to the Midwest years later

650
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,128
And this place is

651
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,152
Totally transform

652
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,712
It been renamed the Midtown Exchange

653
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:36,576
And it was full of all these little shops and eateries on the main floor plus offices

654
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:38,368
Apartments and condos above

655
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,464
And those old realtrack that I'd like the long have been cleared and paved

656
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,256
Turn into this Five Mile Greenway

657
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:47,328
Which was really needed service ready-made Rails to Trails

658
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:53,984
And I got really interested in this. Just as a building but also as an urban phenomenon right like how they turn the

659
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,264
It's nothing into something

660
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:57,824
So I naturally being architecture

661
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:00,896
Started digging into the history of stairs

662
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:02,432
And what did you find in your

663
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,200
And your research

664
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:04,480
Well for starters

665
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:06,272
Richard Warren Sears himself

666
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:09,344
Was born in Minnesota where he actually started selling watches

667
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,368
Channel 1800

668
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:12,928
10 overtime he moved operations

669
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:15,744
To Chicago and start growing out this larger mail order

670
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:20,352
And basically became the Amazon of the early 20th century

671
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:22,400
And in the 1920s

672
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:26,752
We started branching out even more adding retail outlets to their distribution centers

673
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:28,032
All the way from

674
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:28,800
Boston to

675
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:31,616
Can you show me pictures of bees they all looks

676
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:33,152
Surprisingly similar even though they're like

677
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,944
What's scattered across the entire us

678
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:39,040
There's some different brake Styles but they're all kind of boxy that big windows

679
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:41,088
And other details income including

680
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,368
These really great

681
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,160
Distinctive Art Deco style

682
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,440
Powers Yeah

683
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:49,536
Yeah they look a little bit like Castle Towers or something there a big giveaway

684
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:50,304
If you're ghetto

685
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,840
Hunting these concert series build

686
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:56,448
The function to they basically concealed these huge Waters

687
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,752
Is that didn't serve the floors below

688
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:02,592
And yeah what's you know you have the tower is in the other details

689
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:04,640
You can really easily start to spot

690
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,408
Other Towers

691
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,176
Another city

692
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:08,480
A lot of that commonality traces

693
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:09,504
Back to this one

694
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:10,528
In particular

695
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:11,808
George Coleman

696
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,856
He did a lot of work for

697
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:14,624
Serious

698
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:20,768
A mansion for the company president but he's mostly known for big

699
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:21,792
Stihl commercial

700
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:25,376
Among other things he worked on this really big early plan

701
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:26,656
Administrative hub

702
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:27,680
Four Seasons

703
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,728
But this is not the Sears Tower

704
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:33,568
Chicago Willis Tower it's something else

705
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:38,944
About actually can many decades later but amazingly it was only like half again as big as this

706
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,504
Really old complex

707
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,272
Knows about

708
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:45,856
The old complex was built a bit West of downtown and it was about

709
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:47,392
3 million square feet

710
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:52,000
The company boasted that it was the largest commercial complex in the world at

711
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,560
And it's been multiple blocks

712
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:56,608
Covered existing Street

713
00:29:56,864 --> 00:30:01,984
Could actually blocked off city streets and I had to get special permission of course from the city to do that

714
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,312
In the place basically function like a city within the city

715
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,592
Had some power plant

716
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:07,360
It had its own

717
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:10,944
Corporate employee based Fire Department

718
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,736
And it even has its own radio show

719
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,016
WLS

720
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:14,784
Short for

721
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,552
Worlds large

722
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:20,416
Store commercial radio station that sell great

723
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,696
Yeah I mean

724
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:27,328
Sick of basically buying airtime

725
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:33,472
Giant it's America's biggest retailer

726
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:37,824
And they just kept expanding to they kept following kind of where the country

727
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,360
If you took down at first the

728
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:42,176
Did mail order where they serve rural populations

729
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:44,480
Then they added these mixed-use plants

730
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:46,272
With retail outlets

731
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,296
Surf City

732
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:49,856
And then if people moved out to the suburbs

733
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:50,880
Going to the shopping

734
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,976
Today obviously serious is not doing quite as well

735
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:56,768
And a lot of that complex in

736
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:58,816
Chicago for example has been torn down

737
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:02,400
But some parts are still around and some of you

738
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,936
Including that Central iconic

739
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,984
Because it's really hard

740
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,008
To reuse

741
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,288
A million +

742
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,312
Where feet inside of

743
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:15,712
Yeah it's incredibly difficult almost impossible to find a single corporate client take that on

744
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:21,600
I am so like the one in Minneapolis for instance it had to bring in all these different stakeholders he's our local hospital

745
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:25,952
You get to see onboard another developers so that you know there was a plan to make it next

746
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:26,976
Start

747
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:30,304
These buildings also has some advantages to 4 adapter

748
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:33,888
Yeah they're built of 30 Concrete & Masonry

749
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,680
And they get a lot of light

750
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:38,496
On all sides because they have these huge windows

751
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:44,128
And so when you wrote me years and years ago it was in part a story about how cities are we using these

752
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:44,896
Sears

753
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:45,920
Buildings

754
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:48,224
Yeah and that's what really fascinates me

755
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:55,136
It's it's not just you know that they're being reused but it's the story that they tell about the different cities they're being used in

756
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:57,696
So in some ways it's like this big Urban experiment

757
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:58,720
Put

758
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:00,000
These different box

759
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:03,584
But all the time of the same sort of similar in size

760
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:07,168
You spread them out across the country and you abandon them

761
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:13,568
What happened and it turns out that you get these very City specific stories of

762
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:15,104
Abandonment and reuse

763
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,640
Tell you something about these

764
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:19,456
Okay so what are some of your favor

765
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,760
Discover in Seattle

766
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:23,296
Famous for its coffee

767
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:25,344
There's an old plant south of downtown

768
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,952
Has been transformed into the headquarters of Starbucks

769
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:34,560
And the Los Angeles plant is being renovated right now for a long time

770
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:36,608
It was basically down to just the retail

771
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,680
Store on the ground floor and the rest of the building

772
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:40,448
Was empty

773
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:44,800
Of course even an empty building when you're talking about Hollywood

774
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:46,080
Has a function

775
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:49,920
You can rent it out for filming

776
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:53,760
And then a lot of cities are to follow the Minneapolis example

777
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:59,392
In Boston was the first one to do it where they just said you know we have to bring in a bunch of different programs to make this work for us

778
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:02,208
Theaters in sports complexes

779
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:03,232
Daycare centers

780
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:05,536
And Memphis and Minneapolis North

781
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:08,096
And so there's a little

782
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:09,120
Sears building

783
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:10,400
The Uptown

784
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:16,800
Oakland Uptown is you drive up Telegraph far away from beautiful Downtown Oakland California chords

785
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:21,408
A little one and what it would they use at 1

786
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,456
So that place is really small

787
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:25,248
And call the telegraph Lofts

788
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,784
Basically they're looptworks

789
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,624
Southern residential units

790
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,440
Which is probably the thing we need the most in the Bay Area

791
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:34,720
Oh yeah yeah if there's

792
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:37,024
Is there empty buildings to be used here

793
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:37,792
I would hope

794
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,840
Could just turn them all into Morehouse

00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:42,912

A five-part series from Bello radiotopia show the truth

822
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:36,576
The body genius is a Dark comic mystery that whines through a

823
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:38,368
Treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

824
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,904
We're looking the part

825
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:41,696
Might cost you your life

826
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:46,816
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

827
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:49,120
What is a ton of weight

828
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:51,168
Play a prisoner or a psychopath

829
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:55,520
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like a dad

830
00:35:57,312 --> 00:36:00,128
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

831
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:02,176
Actually if I'm being honest

832
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:05,504
I'm one of the main guy to know how to do that kind of thing

833
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:11,904
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

834
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,232
Was found dead in my private gym

835
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:18,560
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

836
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:22,912
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

837
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:23,936
Now

838
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:26,240
I need to clear my name

839
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:31,616
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes

840
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:32,384
