We are a culture

34
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,672
Fascinated with style

35
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:40,352
It always seems to be some award ceremony or gala where people are talking about but everyone is wearing

36
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:44,704
But it seems like it's always Fashion Week somewhere am I right

37
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,984
Living every week

38
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,008
Like it's fashion

39
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,824
And there are street style blogs and

40
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,360
Festival fashion Roundup

41
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:54,432
And then out of the sidewalks and the catwalk

42
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,968
Dial emerges

43
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:58,784
Then it comes time for the mass Market

44
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,064
To get the look

45
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,344
Which might mean

46
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,368
Graphic t-shirt

47
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,648
Are hot right now

48
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:06,208
Are cobalt blue or minimalism

49
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,232
Are platform sneakers

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,280
And you might be saying to yourself

51
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:12,096
Trends Arbor trendy people I follow nerd stuff

52
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:14,144
Catholic podcast I don't follow trends

53
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,936
They might say that but they do

54
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,288
Professor Sarah Pettit

55
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,568
Calling everyone's Bluff

56
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:24,896
Kind of outright lying

57
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:27,200
They just don't realize what they're doing

58
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,480
Professor Pettit is

59
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,248
Coordinator of

60
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,528
Fabric styling Pro

61
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,600
At the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York

62
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,880
You might not realize it

63
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,904
But subconsciously

64
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,464
You can kind of tell when styles are shift

65
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,000
You may not think

66
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:42,048
That what you have on is Jaden

67
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,608
But this other thing suddenly male

68
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,144
Look new to you

69
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,192
And it's all over all the windows

70
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,984
It's all over all the racks

71
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,544
And you probably would get influence

72
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,312
By that

73
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,104
Don't you think so

74
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,920
Whether or not you consciously notice it

75
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,968
The trend cycle is circling

76
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:00,992
All around you

77
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,272
That's moving fast

78
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,344
It's not like we just have a spring fashion season and

79
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,624
Fall fashion season

80
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,672
There's now a steady turnover

81
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:09,696
Style

82
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:12,256
If you go to certain stores like

83
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,024
H&M

84
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,560
Change the wine Maybe

85
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,584
Every two weeks

86
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:16,864
Because

87
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,144
Avery how many

88
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,704
Close to any of us really need

89
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,800
They have to get US Destroyer close out so that we buy new things

90
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,336
This creates

91
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:28,384
Manufacturing this

92
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,664
Create sales

93
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,968
And it makes the monetary

94
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:33,760
Retail world go round

95
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:36,320
And it's not just clothes it's our home where

96
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,088
Are linens

97
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,112
Sarkar whatever

98
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,672
Our tastes are constantly made to change

99
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:41,696
Coloring

100
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,232
Is that kind of

101
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,000
Shane

102
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,792
Like Charlotte Russe

103
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:48,864
May come in every 5 years or so

104
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,912
Purple can be big

105
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,448
One year and that it takes

106
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,216
Facts about

107
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,240
5 years to

108
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,520
Come around again

109
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,288
Moose

110
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,312
Friends are

111
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,104
Question

112
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,128
Is about timing

113
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:00,896
That wedding

114
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,944
And pretend to come back around again

115
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,736
I got their timing right

116
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:08,064
A lot of designers and retailers and fashion students

117
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,344
Turn to one

118
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,112
Major

119
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,184
People use wgsn

120
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,744
Yes as a school we have access to

121
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,768
To wgsn

122
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,303
Wgs

123
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,071
End

124
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,863
Which sounds more like the name of radio

125
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,911
From wgsn

126
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,191
90.7

127
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,215
Your 24-hour

Christian companion

129
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:31,103
It is indeed a radio station in Tennessee but that is not the wgsn we're talking about

130
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,639
Wgsn

131
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:36,479
Is the company that might have determined what you are wearing right now

132
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,271
And I never heard

133
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:42,879
A lot of people haven't actually it's a little bit of an industry Secret in Iowa

134
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,159
This is Sarah Owen

135
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,207
A forecaster at wgsn

136
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:48,255
Which is a global trend for

137
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,023
Casting agency

138
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:54,911
Their other Trend forecasters and Trend forecasting companies but wgsn is the most

139
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,679
Influential

140
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,983
We have been around for 18 years

141
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:01,311
We're in over 94 countries in terms of clients

142
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:04,639
In around 6000 companies subscribe to us

143
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,175
And dumb

144
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,455
What does wjsn

145
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:11,551
This is why I'm not sure where that cuz it used to be

146
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,319
Worth

147
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,111
Global Style Network

148
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,647
Worth as in Market

149
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,951
Who founded the company in 1997

150
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:21,535
But after he sold wgsn it was called world

151
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,095
But mostly it's

152
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,119
Call wgs

153
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,143
So I think it's

154
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,447
Become an acronym that doesn't really have

155
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,215
A meaning

156
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:35,871
Wjsn is part publishing platform parts fashionhaus Part research company

157
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:39,711
And what they provide is a comprehensive website behind Annex

158
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,735
Tremont

159
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,759
Epayroll

160
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:46,111
Like tens of thousands of dollars depending on the size of the company in the subscription level

161
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:50,719
But pretty much every major manufacturer design studio and marketing company

162
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,487
Subscribe to it

163
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,535
And we have clients across ol

164
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,095
Industries not just retail in the fashion space

165
00:05:56,607 --> 00:06:00,191
Do a few about clients range from fashion companies such as

166
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:06,591
Nike and Cochin HM2 food and beverage companies like Starbucks to TV network

167
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,895
Looks like MPC Nickelodeon toes quite varied

168
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:11,455
Wgsn reports on all kind of Trance

169
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,991
Including Behavior patterns

170
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,295
Consumption patterns and advertising prediction

171
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:18,879
The majority of their users are coming at it from the design.

172
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:25,535
So if you are a designer colorist or merchandiser for a major company or brand

173
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,607
You consult wgsn to figure out what colors will the

174
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,655
In what styles are ahead

175
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:36,543
And other designers heed this advice or not it's considered essential to at least know what wgsn is saying

176
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:39,871
Because they're commenting on Trends they notice in a really in-depth

177
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:40,639
Way

178
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,431
To that level analysis that you just

179
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,991
Can't find people actually just don't have the time

180
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,015
To do themselves

181
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,063
And to keep ahead of the trends

182
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,855
Wgsn predicts

183
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,135
Two years in advance

184
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:55,487
That's as long as we can really look look ahead without College a different quantity

185
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:58,559
Seed of analysis further out than that and it's really quiet

186
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:05,215
It's speculating guesstimation is you want to say but honestly I had a really hard time wrapping my head

187
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:07,263
Around wgsn and what they offer

188
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:13,919
Until Sarah let me take a peek at the site it is a website behind a paywall a really beautiful

189
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:20,063
Sleek website it almost looks like an upscale online store but then when you click a category

190
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,855
It looks more like a Pinterest page

191
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,415
Loaded with pictures

192
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,975
Catwalks images high resolution

193
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:33,631
Original image 84th Street style for trade shows fit denim in addition to all the photography of models

194
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:39,519
Festival-goers and beautiful stylish people there are articles and reports organized by category

195
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,847
Google fashion categories from accessories to be

196
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:45,407
Footwear kids way on women do I use

197
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,711
Denim get its own category

198
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,759
It's a huge Market

199
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:54,623
Did the den insinuated addendum director to I think denim associate editors

200
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,463
The editors are working on articles but not only find the trend

201
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,743
But explain them

202
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:02,303
Because we do work so far in advance

203
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,071
I did

204
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,095
Do a report

205
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:10,495
Close to two years ago I was cold and young contemporary contemporary

206
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,263
Next Generation

207
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,031
Consumers

208
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:15,615
Genze ujenzi is your teenager

209
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:18,431
She's about to go back to school she's back to school shopping

210
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,223
She still going to festivals

211
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,759
How she lives at home

212
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,551
She's always weighed digital-native

213
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,343
Multiscreen

214
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,439
Personality and Sarah's report found that genzie's Idols are

215
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,207
Fashion model

216
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,487
Not movie at

217
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:37,119
So these models are on Instagram and magazines wearing Couture on the runways

218
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:40,447
And this makes the members of gen Z want access

219
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,215
High fashion

220
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:45,311
Is consumer base is really being Prime to be the next luxury consumer

221
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,359
Enter that we we come to them

222
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:50,687
Fruition now it seems super Alabama two years ago was kind of

223
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,991
Stila testing idea with some retailers

224
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:57,343
And other researchers at wgsn are already preparing for the next wave of cancer

225
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,367
After

226
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,927
Gen Z generation Alpha

227
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,999
The newest that the ones under gen Z

228
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:06,047
Welcome to relevancy millennials

229
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:13,215
In addition to the reports in the images wjsn has this really fascinating component that makes it very

230
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,751
Very different

231
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:17,311
Journalism side or a fashion blog

232
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,359
They have a database

233
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,407
Full of colors

234
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:25,503
Patterns and 71000 original design template

235
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:28,063
For design teams to use

236
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,087
However they want

237
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:32,159
So there really is a lot that you can take as a designer

238
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:35,487
Open in illustrator Photoshop and rework it however works

239
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:40,095
XPO customer will get embellishments entrance and you have prints and Graphics as well

240
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,375
Do you want to make

241
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,143
Shirt

242
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,447
You could choose a template may be out of

243
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,727
Pocket or something

244
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:51,871
It's like a color swatch a pattern that wgsn says will be popular two years into the future and why

245
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,407
There's your design

246
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,967
Oh my God it's so these are these are jeans

247
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:58,783
For 2018 oh my God

248
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,111
What do genes of 2018 look like

249
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:07,231
I kind of can't tell you because wgsn is very protective of this information

250
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:13,887
And rightly so people pay a lot of money for it this precious until makes it fast and easy for design teams

251
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,935
To come up with new styles

252
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,727
Somewhere are you

253
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,519
Too easy

254
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:25,151
Mark worth himself the founder of wgsn sold the company in 2005

255
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,687
According to the independent

256
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,991
Wurth called his creation a monster

257
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:34,879
Same quote Shoppers complain that everything on the High Street looks the same but is it any Wonder

258
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:38,975
Instead of looking for inspiration brands or line on templates

259
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:41,023
Because everyone uses the same template

260
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,583
There's no competitive patch

261
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:49,215
Whether it was an adherence to an ideology of creativity and competition or just

262
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:52,799
An opportunity to build another business and sell it off again for tons of money

263
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,079
Mark worth

264
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:57,407
Started a rival forecasting company called stylist

265
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,199
The much smaller company

266
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,991
With two offices about

267
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:01,759
400 Club

268
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:05,087
And it doesn't have all the templates and ready-made designs

269
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:07,135
We don't tend to have like downloadable

270
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:09,439
Prints and patterns and things like that because

271
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:13,791
Fashion is just kind of one element of what we do that's Shannon

272
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,839
Forecaster at stylist

273
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:16,863
And their New York office

274
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:20,447
Stylus is also a website behind a paywall

275
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,751
And they do a lot of custom Trend report

276
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:25,055
Tailored to specific clients need

277
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,359
So basically are

278
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,151
Clients get a

279
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:29,919
Login

280
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,199
And they can

281
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:35,039
View all of the content they have a client services person

282
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,319
Send help them so if

283
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,599
America says

284
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,415
I'm doing a piece of research on

285
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,695
The future of bracks

286
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,255
Our client service person goes in

287
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,815
And says here's a really interesting piece

288
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:51,679
Piece of work that we did about fluid lifestyles in about people multitasking and this could affect the

289
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,703
Picture of breakfast

290
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,495
Future

291
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:55,519
Breakfast

292
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:00,127
No but really there are trends for breakfast

293
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:06,783
And stylist will say to the client here is what we saw something interesting from our packaging teen about you on the go Packaging

294
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:10,367
Which seems silly but that is really the kind of stuff that often like

295
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,135
Dino client

296
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,927
Have to think about wrap their heads around

297
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:15,487
Trend forecasting is not just about taste

298
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,255
Store aesthetic

299
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,559
Trends also take changes in life

300
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,143
So wgsn and stylus also work

301
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,423
What stats and projector

302
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,447
Like this one

303
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:30,847
40% of Americans work from home by 2024 some questions around my head am I okay so if ever

304
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:34,175
Everyone's working from home a sweatpants back in stock

305
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,735
That's Sarah Owen again from wgsn

306
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:37,759
Translate yes

307
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,807
Sweatpants are back in the trend cycle

308
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,111
But like cool looking sweatpants

309
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:44,415
But you could also wear to a bar

310
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:51,071
Both wjsn and stylist say that arrived in what they call the athleisure style of clothing

311
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,863
Which looks good at home on the couch

312
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,655
In the office or out at night

313
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,447
To me it's connecting the dogs

314
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,727
Pattern recognition

315
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:03,615
It's taking those cues that and pairing that would that Jada and that will kind of inform the future

316
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,663
Oh created that sound

317
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,455
Tagline

318
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,223
Create

319
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:08,991
Tomorrow

320
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,807
Is actually written in huge neon letters

321
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,599
Wgsn New York office

322
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,623
Which is

323
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,671
I don't know it's kind of strange to see

324
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:20,511
It made me wonder if wgsn was catering to my

325
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:21,791
Or actually

326
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:22,815
Creating them

327
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:25,631
For me they have such a strong influence in the industry

328
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,935
I can't tell if they're reporting trend

329
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,471
Dictating them

330
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:32,799
Yeah that's always a hungry like I said we do have some of the most

331
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:38,687
Time influential and recognizable brands in the world using us so it's like did we create it or was it actually

332
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,223
About to come to fruition

333
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:46,623
Shannon at stylist told me that even paint companies and textile manufacturers were using their Trend forecasting sir

334
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:49,183
Services to decide what fabrics and colors to make

335
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:52,255
Which then inform the transit stylist puts out

336
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:55,327
At some point you just lose track of who is influencing whom

337
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,887
But ultimately the buck stops with us

338
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:58,911
The consumer

339
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,191
What's the

340
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:03,519
The thing you can lead a horse to water or something

341
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:07,871
Drink Professor Sarah Pettit again you can show them

342
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,919
Things that are very

343
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,199
Far out things

344
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,503
You think they should buy

345
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,063
But if it's something that's not going to work

346
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:17,855
They're not going to do

347
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:22,719
For example Professor Pettit says there was a movement recently to bring back the mini skirt

348
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:24,255
They sorta okay that's been

349
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,279
Around while

350
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,607
And four units the new generation of

351
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:29,887
Kids with tray

352
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:30,655
Reintroduce

353
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,703
A flop

354
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:33,727
Totally

355
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,287
So if people

356
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,823
Really don't

357
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,591
1

358
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:39,615
It's going to

359
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,383
Slot

360
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,431
The consumer has a voice in this

361
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,223
And it's a very

362
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,247
Active

363
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,807
And lately it seems there's been

364
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,599
Great refusal of swords

365
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,391
A massive backlash

366
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,671
Against fast fashion

367
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,207
And transformed cells

368
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,767
It's interesting we've come off this kind of

369
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:59,327
Phase in fashion of trends

370
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,863
Changing really fast

371
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,399
A lot of design today is

372
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:03,679
Simplicity

373
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,727
Minimalism and quality

374
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,519
Even with with fashion

375
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:10,335
Which for a long time was super super Trend driven

376
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:11,871
That people are starting

377
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:12,895
Anything more about bass

378
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,687
Some more of having you know that

379
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,991
Great pair of jeans that they can wear

380
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:17,759
With everything

381
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:21,599
But Shannon seemed remarkably, she told me about this change in the tithe

382
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:24,159
She does not think the trend industry is doomed

383
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:27,487
So you know it's not like Simplicity means that people are just

384
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,255
Sweet Leaf

385
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,047
Not shopping and

386
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,071
Do you know everybody

387
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,095
Becoming

388
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,375
No anti

389
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,655
Consumerism

390
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,423
God forbid

391
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:38,751
Just that the things that made people buy before or

392
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:45,407
I'm going to say the trend of their future Trend but maybe that is also a trend

393
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,175
Sing shift

394
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:48,223
But it's not to say that it's not going to ship

395
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,527
It's hard to say

396
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,575
But what's the check back here

397
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,343

Bongs and chatter of our devices

413
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:35,583
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man made sound

414
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:36,607
If

415
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:43,007
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife isn't

416
