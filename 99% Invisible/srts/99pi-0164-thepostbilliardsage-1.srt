I'm Roman Mars

24
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:15,776
We live any post Billiards world

25
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:22,176
It was an age of Billiards and it has been over for so long most of us have no idea how huge bill

26
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:23,200
Billiards once was

27
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:25,760
100 years ago

28
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:29,088
Your 830 pool hall in my city of Chicago

29
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:31,648
Now if you add up all the gas station

30
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:36,000
All McDonald's and all the Starbucks in Chicago right now

31
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:38,048
Nowhere close to that

32
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:40,352
Maybe a little under 600

33
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:43,680
If you want to be exact and I know you do you beautiful nerds

34
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,448
Today

35
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:47,008
Chicago has fewer than 10 pool hall

36
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,800
That is Dan Weisman

37
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:49,824
Reporter

38
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,592
Chicago in

39
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:54,432
Dan originally reported the story for Marketplace so billion

40
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,712
Not what you say

41
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:59,552
But this is a post Billiards World any much more profound sense

42
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:03,648
Because the growth of Billiards led to the development of a material that

43
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,184
For Better or Worse

44
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,232
Came to define the modern world

45
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,768
I just want to say one word to you

46
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,120
Plastics

47
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,728
This story starts with a guy named Michael Phelan

48
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,776
Who's regarded by everybody else

49
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:23,104
But really the father of American Billiards

50
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:26,688
He's the author of The Illustrated Encyclopedia of building

51
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:31,296
Phelan was a brilliant player we also raised awareness of the sport

52
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,064
Promoted it

53
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:34,880
Arranging the biggest big money matches

54
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,672
Film was totally remarkable

55
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,208
Because he was everything

56
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:40,000
She was an all-around everything guy

57
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:42,304
He started huge Billiards on San Francisco

58
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,632
Deposited a new kind of billiard cushion and then

59
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:49,472
He took the money he'd won playing Billiards and writing books on Billiards

60
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,520
And use it to become the first

61
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:54,592
Big manufacturer of billiard tables and equipment

62
00:02:55,104 --> 00:03:01,248
Feeling created the age of billiards in the US and he felt that you further popularized the game of Billiards

63
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:03,552
Sell more tickets

64
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,088
Send some more equipment

65
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,880
He would need a standardized

66
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:09,184
Cuz if tables and balls

67
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,208
Rent-A-Center

68
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,744
From one location to another

69
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:18,400
You were basically playing a different game every time you went somewhere new but standardizing the billiard ball was no easy task

70
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,216
It's a very very high standard to me

71
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:27,104
The billiard ball has to have certain physical properties it has to rebound properly it has to be the uniform density

72
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,128
And the time

73
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:30,944
It was really only one material that we do

74
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:31,968
Ivory

75
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:33,248
Which was not

76
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:36,320
Going to Africa shooting elephants that is

77
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,856
Dangerous and expensive

78
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:41,696
Not to mention horrible people for

79
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,464
Decades

80
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,768
Had been trying to find substitutes

81
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,304
For ivory

82
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,400
They tried a variety of materials including even metal balls iron balls

83
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,424
Which really don't

84
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,800
Perform well iron billiard balls just weren't the same Ivory balls had just the right way

85
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,336
The most evnroll

86
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:00,384
The best rebound off the cue stick

87
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,432
Each other off the side of the table

88
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,968
Laughing with this guy

89
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,296
Only the best

90
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:09,344
Great ivorywood do in fact

91
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,136
When you look at records in the ivory trade

92
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:13,696
The top grade of ivories actually called

93
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:15,232
Billiard ball ivory

94
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,536
And Billiard balls required a lot

95
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,839
Set of billiard ball grade ivory

96
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:23,679
Unlike the ivory on piano keys for a veneer over wood

97
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:27,775
Do your balls had to be made of 100% solid ivory

98
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,055
And therefore

99
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:33,407
The average number of billiard balls that could be obtained from a single tusk

100
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:34,687
What's 3

101
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:36,991
If you're the best

102
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,783
Lucky's billiard ball Turner

103
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:41,599
Maybe you could get five balls from One Touch

104
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,623
Even so

105
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,975
That mean one set of billiard balls is going to require chewing at least 2 L

106
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:49,791
Two billiard balls were very expensive

107
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:52,863
And when you're trying to build an industry that a problem

108
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:55,679
Her film company it was the problem

109
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,471
Sinclair trade

110
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:04,127
Depended on the forces of this one exotic material that's Robert fradella professor at the universe

111
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:04,895
First Tee of Maryland

112
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:08,223
He studied the history of technology and he wrote the book

113
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,247
I'm what happens next

114
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:15,903
Phelan and his colleagues were acutely aware that their dependency on Ivory was not ideal there really

115
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:18,463
That's what I don't think it proved wrong or what

116
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:21,791
Define chum kind of substitute material

117
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,583
Simply wasn't

118
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:29,471
Parent takes out an ad in the paper and here's a dramatization of what happened

119
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:32,543
When a guy named John Wesley Hyatt found at at

120
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,103
Look at this

121
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:36,895
Cries of

122
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:37,663
10000

123
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,431
Dollars

124
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:41,247
For the discovery of a satisfactory substitute

125
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,551
Ivory and making billiard balls

126
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:48,159
That's my 1937 episode of a radio show called Cavalcade of America

127
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,463
Hey that's a lot of money

128
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,487
Certainly is

129
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:56,607
In terms of wages people earned at the time it was like 3 million dollars

130
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,679
Height was mcamis but he was a tinkerer

131
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:02,239
Any work for years to win fail and fries

132
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:07,871
By trade Hyatt was a printer and printers use nitrated cellulose to protect their hands

133
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,431
It still sold as liquid bandage

134
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:14,527
And that material turned out to have very interesting properties

135
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,063
And in particular

136
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,087
Dissolve

137
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:19,647
And it creates a very sure every liquid

138
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:25,279
In the radio dramatization I it gets his key inspiration when a bottle of the stuff overturns

139
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:28,607
Any watches that dry into a film that he finds

140
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,887
Interesting

141
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:30,655
Why is this

142
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,447
Giving me an idea

143
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:36,031
And the idea it might be worth $10,000

144
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:39,871
Giant idea might have been worth $10,000

145
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,663
But it was also dangerous

146
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,967
Nitrogen cellulose is highly

147
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:49,087
Highly flammable

148
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:55,999
But John Hiatt in his lab assistant Jim kept going

149
00:06:56,255 --> 00:07:01,119
Baby heat up and I traded cotton put it in the press and

150
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:07,519
What's the weather

151
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:08,799
The Press

152
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:09,823
Look at it

153
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:13,407
All this time

154
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,967
A material that will take the place of ivory

155
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:19,551
A material that would take the place of ivory

156
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:20,831
Was plastic

157
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,135
Hyatt call Disney material

158
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:23,903
Celluloid

159
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:27,999
Celluloid did not win feelings $10,000 prize

160
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,559
Celluloid is a wonderful material

161
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,583
Thrift Shop

162
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,655
Beautiful plastic it can be colored an ostrich weight

163
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,935
Give me shape to deflate

164
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:39,263
It has a wonderful range of uses

165
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,847
Tell your boss is not one of them

166
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:49,503
Balls made of Celluloid just didn't bounce right but Hyatt tried to make a go of it anyway

167
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,527
Well Company

168
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:53,087
His balls are not made of cellulite

169
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,111
They have a

170
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:58,207
Thin veneer of cellulite on the outside

171
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,743
But I mainly plaster

172
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,023
On the inside

173
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,047
And there

174
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,839
Very inferior by your body

175
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,887
I didn't give up on cellular

176
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:09,215
You wanted a business with his brother Isaiah

177
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,263
Shut up

178
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:15,359
To try to exploit what they are convinced they're very

179
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,895
Nifty material

180
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:19,455
But they can't figure out what on Earth

181
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:21,247
The market trying to be

182
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:26,367
They tried dental plates you can color Celluloid to look just like real gums but

183
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,647
There's a problem

184
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,183
Turns out that

185
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,463
So you like it

186
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,511
Soft if you're drinking hot tea

187
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:35,839
Eventually they find the best use for celluloid

188
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,119
Is imitation ivory

189
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,143
Albeit

190
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,423
Not for billiard balls

191
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,239
But versions of popular Ivory luxury goods

192
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,263
Nike sandals

193
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,031
Combs

194
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,055
Hand mirrors

195
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:45,823
Even

196
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,615
Toys in boxes

197
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,663
A gigantic arranged

198
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:53,759
Many of which would never actually have been made it I write also

199
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:54,783
Piano keys

200
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,087
A Sears catalog from the 1890s

201
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:59,135
Offers pianos with a choice of key covering

202
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,159
Ivory

203
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:00,927
Cellulite

204
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:06,047
And of course the most famous use of Celluloid would eventually be to make film stock for movies

205
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:08,863
Meanwhile billiard balls kept getting made out of ivory

206
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:14,495
Ivory that came mostly from Africa which of course the Europeans have been busy colonizing and exploiting

207
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:18,079
In the ivory trade was pretty awful for the people of Africa

208
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:20,383
Joseph Conrad Heart of Darkness

209
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:23,711
Based largely on his own experience in the Belgian Congo

210
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:25,503
Where Ivory was a big Prada

211
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,807
Conrad called the whole Enterprise

212
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:33,183
Quote the vilest Scramble for loot that ever disfigured the history of human conscience

213
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:33,951
End

214
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,767
Current necessarily care about this part but

215
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:39,071
Obviously the ivory trade was also

216
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,351
Terrible for elephants

217
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:44,959
Why jumpstart a pretty common animal

218
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,519
In central Africa

219
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,079
In the middle of the 19th century

220
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,919
Becoming increasingly scarce

221
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:54,943
By the 20th

222
00:09:55,455 --> 00:10:01,599
By the time of World War II the ivory Supply crunch the one that Michael Phelan had started worrying about

223
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,879
50 years before

224
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:03,647
Had arrived

225
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,719
And around this time the real significance of Hyatt

226
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,511
So you would have begun to show itself

227
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:13,631
However begin to inspire people

228
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,399
Think about

229
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,727
What artificial material might be

230
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,007
Available what what

231
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:21,567
People could make what people could invent

232
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:27,711
And I do a seven a chemist named Leo baekeland comes up with a new kind of plastic made from petroleum

233
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,503
He names it Bakelite

234
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:30,527
After himself

235
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:32,831
And one cool thing about Bakelite

236
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:33,855
You can melt

237
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,135
Mixing fillers

238
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:40,255
And it turns out that with that capability you can vary the density

239
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,047
You can bury the electricity

240
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,071
And you can make

241
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,607
A perfect day of fall

242
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:48,447
So they finally replaced Ivory balls with this new plastic

243
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,727
Bakelite

244
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,007
By the 1940s

245
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:54,591
Even top pool tournament being played with plastic balls

246
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,871
But by then

247
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:56,895
Kuhl pants

248
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:57,663
Peak

249
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,711
It crashed as the depression begin

250
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,759
Never gained its former prominence

251
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,295
The age of Billiards

252
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:04,575
Whatever

253
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:08,159
And this post Billiards age the age of plastic

254
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,951
And really got into gear

255
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:12,255
For example the handle of your toothbrush

256
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,535
What is probably at 5

257
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:16,095
So undoubtedly on the barrel of your fountain

258
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:18,399
Family instrument panel in your car

259
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,423
And yet these are just

260
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,471
A few of more than 25000

261
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:22,751
Modern uses

262
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,519
For Plastics

263
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,055
Static plastic

264
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:25,823
Plural

265
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,871
By that time you got a bunch on the market

266
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:30,687
PVC vinyl polyethylene of plexiglass

267
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,711
Nylon

268
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,991
Aunt in labs

269
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:35,807
You're discovering the stuff would end up becoming Teflon

270
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:42,463
And good old Celluloid the plastic that started it all had been retired even from the movies

271
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:45,279
It was indispensable to the beginning of motion picture

272
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,071
But it was highly dangerous

273
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:51,679
Flammable Celluloid film called several disastrous and fatal fires in movies

274
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:54,239
Vanagon 34 a new form

275
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,519
Cellulose acetate

276
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,055
I taken the place of Hyatt

277
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,079
Cellulose nitrate

278
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,127
Celluloid

279
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,663
Born out of Billiards

280
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,943
Was the first plastic

281
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:09,087
Ushered in a new age of modern products and but it never succeeded in revolutionising the game of Billiards

282
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,879
It did however

283
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:13,439
Revolutionize another tables board

284
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,463
Ping pong

285
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:21,375
Before Celluloid was invented ping pong was played with something more closely resembling a golf ball

286
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:24,703
Which as you can imagine doesn't didn't have that perfect balance

287
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:30,847
Celluloid ping pong balls that were used for years but finally got some from tournament play in 2013

288
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,127
The reason

289
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,431
A little too bouncy

290
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,711
Poor soil

291
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,247
It just can't win

292
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:43,391
Someday we'll find the perfect home for you my bouncy friend

301

Bongs and chatter of our devices

302
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:34,335
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man-made sound

303
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:39,967
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexis

304
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:45,855
Is talking to me and my wife is in another room and another hearing.

305
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,647
Technology talk to us

306
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,695
It is a creation of Sonic trap

309
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,399
To make them more human

310
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,239
Turn the living room lights on

311
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,031
Okay

312
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,079
Dim the living room lights to 50

313
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:06,847
80%

314
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:08,639
Okay

315
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:15,039
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

316
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,855
Makes for a much more natural experience

317
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,903
Turn the living room lights on

318
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,999
Dim the living room lights to 50%

319

Constipation abdominal pain and bloating

327
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:53,439
It's not that bad you take laxatives you modify your diet and exercise routine

328
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:59,839
But thinking about it all the time is frustrating but doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again

360
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:55,551
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine
