This is 99% invisible

21
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:09,120
I'm Roman Mars

22
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:13,984
I'm down at the bottom of the hill away from the highway and I'm about to

23
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:20,640
Cross really old railroad bridge not an active railroad anymore that's jacquot Alico wandering around the

24
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:22,944
New Hampshire Woods Security View

25
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:27,552
He's about 10 miles north of the state capitol off Interstate 93

26
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:33,952
Pretty out-of-the-way place there no signs or markers on the road indicating something special is there

27
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,232
But he's found something

28
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,584
So you get out of this little Island

29
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:47,008
And the railroad tracks go straight across but what you really notice is this Epic

30
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,544
Looking

31
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,336
Granite Monument

32
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,128
In the middle of the island

33
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:59,040
It looks a lot like a monument you'd see in a city park except it's on a forested island in the middle of a river

34
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:01,856
It is enormous

35
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,160
It's 30 ft tall

36
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,184
Wow

37
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:12,864
It's all granite and on top of a tall pedestal there's a woman she's wearing this down that's fall

38
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,400
Falling off her shoulders

39
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,448
In her right hand she has a tomahawk

40
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:23,104
And in her left hand she has a fistful of Scouts and on the back of this thing going to run around to the back

41
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,920
Back here is the inscription

42
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,968
Now let's pause for just a second here

43
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:31,040
If you are a regular listener to the show

44
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,088
You know how I feel about plaque

45
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,880
And always reading them

46
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:40,256
The reason being that blacks tell stories sometimes they tell really amazing stories

47
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:42,304
If you can decipher them

48
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:45,120
March 15th 2 30th 1697

49
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,144
The Wharf

50
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,472
Tomahawk f***** and infanticides were a Haverhill

51
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:52,544
The ashes of wigwam campfires at night

52
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,080
I have 10 of the tribe

53
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:54,848
Are here

54
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,384
I got another man

55
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,688
Yeah not a lot of detail there

56
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:01,248
Honestly the whole island was strange to me

57
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,296
Kind of creepy actually

58
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:08,416
Not very well kept up this enormous imposing statue with the Erie plaque

59
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,952
The scouts

60
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:16,608
What's crazy is this statue was erected in 1874 making it the oldest Monument dedicated

61
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,376
12 woman

62
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,656
In the US

63
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:22,752
So you think someone would come out here and at least over the grass

64
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:28,384
Well what I learned is that plaque does tell a story though not an obvious one

65
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:31,968
And I learned there's a good reason why the grounds are neglected

66
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,040
In fact what to do with this Historic Site

67
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:37,088
Has become a bit of a problem

68
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,648
And it all has to do with the woman in the monument

69
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,928
And what she did

70
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:50,912
The story starts about 50 miles south of the monument in a town called Haverhill Massachusetts

71
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:54,752
I went down there and met up with a local historian named Tom spitaleri

72
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:56,800
In the parking lot of a Dunkin Donuts

73
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,592
How you doing

74
00:03:59,360 --> 00:03:59,872
Jack

75
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,408
Tom nice to meet you too

76
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,480
Tom is a die-hard New Englander

77
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:10,112
I'll tell you he's wearing a Boston Red Sox jacket on top of a Boston Celtics Jersey

78
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:12,416
On top of a New England Patriots

79
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:15,488
T-shirt

80
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,512
Sure

81
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:20,863
Everywhere we drive in Haverhill Tom see signs of New England past

82
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:25,471
Particularly from Colonial times and to the time of Hannah.

83
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:30,847
What time will Royal in what some historians

84
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:34,175
Most people would know it as the French Indian War

85
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:37,247
What King Philip's King George's in the Seven Years War

86
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,783
In the 1600s

87
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:45,183
New England was a war zone between the French the British and the Native Americans by the end of that Century disease

88
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:48,767
These and War would wipe out most Native Americans in the Northeast

89
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,559
In Haverhill was

90
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,839
The Wild West

91
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:52,863
I mean

92
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,143
It sounds funny

93
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:57,983
Putting in today's contents that's what it was we were the album

94
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,519
There was nothing north of us

95
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:04,895
There was nothing but Wilderness around making it an easy target for attacks by Native Americans

96
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,015
Bands of Native Americans had shifting alliances with the British and the French

97
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:14,623
The French paid Abenaki used to abduct Brits and bring them 2K back

98
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,439
Then the French would sell these captives back to the British

99
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,975
It was a slave trade

100
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,023
Xiaomi this area was

101
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:21,791
Constantly

102
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:23,839
Constantly

103
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:30,239
In 1697 a woman named Hannah Dustin was recovering from delivering her 8th

104
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,007
Child

105
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,799
What happened to Aki's rated Haverhill

106
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:39,199
They killed and captured dozens of colonists and burned buildings that's what the word faggets on the monument refers to

107
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:42,527
A faggot was a bundle of sticks used to fuel the fire

108
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:46,879
During the raid Hannah duston husband was outside with seven of their kids

109
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:49,183
Defending the homestead and his children

110
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:55,327
But Abenaki is entered the house and abducted Hannah her newborn baby girl that her nurse Mary Neff

111
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:01,983
The captives were marched North to the Wilderness and shortly after leaving April when Hannah's baby wouldn't stop crying

112
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:05,055
One of the Abenaki smashed it against a tree

113
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07,615
That's where you get the word infanticide

114
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,151
From The Monuments plaque

115
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,943
They kept walking North

116
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,991
Most likely they were heading to the Outpost

117
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,295
That's up in Quebec

118
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:20,671
At some point the war party handed Hannah Dustin and Mary Neff to another group of Abenaki

119
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,719
A group made up of a couple families

120
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,999
She was sold

121
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,535
To those Native Americans

122
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:31,423
So the group of Abenaki that ended up with Hannah was made up of two fathers to mothers

123
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,447
A grandmother

124
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,471
A bunch of children

125
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:37,823
And I already had a white boy with them a kid named Samuel leonardson

126
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,639
Putin abducted from Worcester the previous year

127
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,431
Is it that makes three white captives

128
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,455
12 Abenaki

129
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:48,575
The whole crew across the Merrimack River to the island the one that now is the money man on it

130
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,367
And they set up camp for the night

131
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,671
In the middle of the night

132
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,463
Hannah Dustin made a decision

133
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:58,815
She rallied Marion Samuel and led them around the sleeping Evan Aki's

134
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,351
One at a time

135
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:03,167
They brought a hatchet down on the abenakis head

136
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,471
They killed 10 in total

137
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,239
Two men

138
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,519
Two women

139
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,055
6 children

140
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,615
And then before making their getaway

141
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,383
A scout

142
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,407
Each victim

143
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:16,223
2 Abenaki is made it out alive

144
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,759
The old woman who was injured

145
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:18,783
And a little boy

146
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:23,135
Hannah Marie and Samuel left the island in a canoe

147
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:27,743
It was a dangerous time of year to be on the river it would have been choked with icing

148
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,767
Full of Rapids

149
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,327
They traveled at night to avoid being seen

150
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:36,447
15 days after Vanishing Hannah Dustin and her companions landed in Haverhill

151
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:39,775
To the total shock of her husband or seven children

152
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:42,335
And everyone who ever lost a family member

153
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,103
To arraign

154
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:47,967
Hannah Dustin is the woman memorialized in the monument

155
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:53,087
The Scout she is holding in the Statue belong to the 10 people including six children

156
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:55,903
That she and her companions killed on the island

157
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:03,327
That statue isn't the only Hannah Dustin landmark in New England not by a long shot

158
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,655
There are others particularly in Haverhill where she live

159
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,959
Tom spitaleri took me on a tour

160
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:12,543
They just pull off here real quick this the Hannah duston rest are

161
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:19,455
This is speedy I always yeah this is it here he is Hannah Dustin Street

162
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:21,503
Obviously meme

163
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:28,159
Now we're at the Hannah duston Rock Monument Street got its name from The Monument that's there for Hannah Dustin

164
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:30,207
Boskone Avenue

165
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,279
Boscawen is the town in New Hampshire where the island is

166
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,095
Tell me even took me to an old Garrison house

167
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,375
Essentially

168
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,655
Where Hannah Dustin live

169
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,191
After her captivity

170
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,263
We do private tours in here

171
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:50,943
In a glass case is a piece of Hannah Dustin memorabilia I've seen on eBay

172
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:55,551
In the 1970s the state of New Hampshire commissioned Jim Beam

173
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:58,111
To make a Hannah duston whiskey decanter

174
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:01,439
It's an exact replica of the statue in New Hampshire

175
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:04,255
Down to the little bloody scabs in her hand

176
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,815
It's made of porcelain

177
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,375
Yeah that hits the floor goodbye goodnight

178
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:10,655
It's kind of

179
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,959
Sexy and provocative

180
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:16,287
Which popping that would never have happened back in 1697

181
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:20,383
Where you at remember this was in 1976 they did

182
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,175
1976

183
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,199
It was about selling

184
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:26,783
Your selling booze with a sexy woman with scalps and an axe

185
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:30,367
Right and we don't even know what you really look like cuz there is no photographs

186
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:37,279
That whiskey decanter is from 1976 but the New Hampshire Historical Society still sells ajena.

187
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,559
Dustin bobblehead

188
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,095
And it's Museum shop

189
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,399
On the basis of bobblehead it says

190
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,167
Quote

191
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,191
The mothers

192
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:44,959
Revenge

193
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:49,055
You can probably see how these kitschy collectors items might

194
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,591
Feel offensive

195
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:57,247
In fact all the Hannah duston stuff and Hannah Dustin the landmarks are a problem for some people who know the whole story

196
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,551
But the whole story

197
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,599
That's a tricky thing to pin down

198
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,647
You gotta understand something with two handed

199
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,695
Is a lot of inter

200
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,999
And it's a lot of New England

201
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,143
Canada Sims kidnapping and Escape happen more than 300 years ago

202
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,215
And the story has been told and retold a lot

203
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:20,031
And actually the reason we know anything about it today

204
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,311
Has to do with the fact

205
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,103
That she scalped her victim

206
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:26,431
After Hannah came home her husband took her

207
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,991
Sea scallops down to Boston

208
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,015
To sell them

209
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:36,159
Now if you like me when you heard she had Scouts her victims you may have thought she had some kind of bloodlust

210
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:39,231
I thought scalping with something tribes did to wipe

211
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:41,279
People not the other way around

212
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,327
Turns out I was very

213
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,607
Very wrong

214
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:49,983
Colonial governments paid cash for Native American scalps heads and even hands

215
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:53,055
They would pay most for a man less for women

216
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,335
At least for a child

217
00:10:54,847 --> 00:11:00,991
They would even pay Native Americans for the body parts of other Native Americans depending on who was Warren with whom at the

218
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:05,087
So Dustin had Financial incentive for scalping her victims

219
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,647
But if you're the reason we still know the story

220
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:11,743
When Hannah was in Boston selling her Scout she sat down with Cotton Mather

221
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,791
And he wrote her story down

222
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,839
His name might ring a bell

223
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,631
Cotton Mather was head of

224
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,167
The Protestant Church in New England

225
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,727
He had ties to the Salem witch trials

226
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:22,495
He was a

227
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:25,823
Fire and brimstone Minister traveled around giving sermons

228
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:32,223
These little Frontier Towns at Cotton Mather visit that they were filled with these shell-shocked colonist who had missing family

229
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,015
Members from Native American raids

230
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:39,647
Mother told Dustin story again and again to wrap churchgoers building Dustin status

231
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,671
As a heroine

232
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:44,767
Well I think the Hannah duston story has endured for so long

233
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:48,095
Because it's not just a story about

234
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,399
A woman who

235
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,423
Kill people

236
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,959
It actually

237
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:57,823
Has become a story about The American Nation at different points of time

238
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,175
This is Barbara Carter historian and professor at the University of Northern Iowa

239
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,223
It was a story about

240
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,039
The colonial battle against

241
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:10,111
Native Americans in the 17th century

242
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,647
It was a story

243
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,927
Justifying

244
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:16,511
The westward expansion of the United States in the 19th century

245
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,279
Traits

246
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,047
And

247
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,095
In more recent years

248
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,887
It has been used as

249
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,167
A story

250
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:29,567
Domestically about culture wars really Qatar has researched how and why the Hannah Dustin monuments were built

251
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:34,687
And she said it really hit home just how far the story had traveled when I

252
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:37,247
Happened across a Salt Lake City

253
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,807
Mormon woman's newspaper

254
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:43,647
In the 1890s that started off by saying

255
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,439
Who has not heard of Hannah.

256
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:48,767
I mean Hannah Dustin was from Massachusetts

257
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:52,607
After her captivity Hannah Dustin lived in colonial obscurity

258
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,655
Jackson had seven more kids

259
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,447
And died at age 84

260
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:59,007
No one talked about her through the 1700s

261
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,031
She was forgotten

262
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,311
Until

263
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,079
In

264
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:04,383
The 18 teens in the 1820s

265
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,431
United States was a new nation

266
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,223
And a lot of

267
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,503
Intellectuals

268
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:12,063
At that point in time we're trying to create

269
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,343
A distinctly American

270
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,111
Can culture

271
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:17,183
And so they started telling American story

272
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:20,767
And trying to uncover American heroes and heroines

273
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:25,631
So the country's literary Elite Doug around for some good ole American stories

274
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,679
Hannah duston

275
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:31,775
Carter says if you were an American in safe 1865

276
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:34,847
Well the first place you might likely come across her

277
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:39,711
Would be when you opened your American history textbook in the school

278
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,735
You

279
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,039
Would also come across

280
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:47,391
Her story if you read famous American Writers like Hawthorne

281
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:49,183
For John Greenleaf Whittier

282
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,231
Poor Henry David Thoreau

283
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,511
Popular magazine

284
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:55,839
Newspapers essay collections children's books

285
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:56,607
Paintings

286
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:00,447
1800 Hannah Dustin was a household name

287
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,007
Johnny Appleseed Davy Crockett

288
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,031
Hannah Dustin

289
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,823
Bodhi Tree telling of the story

290
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,103
Something happened

291
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:10,687
People change the narrative to suit their purposes

292
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,783
It becomes a moral problem for Americans that Hannah duston killed children

293
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:18,367
Especially since I mean they weren't just children they were sleeping chilled

294
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:23,487
Writers omitted details embellished others and sometimes just made things up

295
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:26,559
Be completely left out the children she killed

296
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:29,119
Replacing them with Warriors

297
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,423
That Abenaki child that escaped

298
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:36,543
The writer said Dustin spared him intentionally which there's no evidence of

299
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:40,639
Most writers depicted Hannah duston as a sympathetic heroine

300
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:44,479
Is outraged mother seeking a justifiable Revenge

301
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,783
This was the era of manifest destiny

302
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:52,671
And then it is America's Destiny to inherit the land to seize it from people dump heathens

303
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,695
And Savages

304
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:57,535
That's when I think new englanders

305
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:00,607
Really started focusing on

306
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:04,959
Hannah Dustin more and more as the kind of heroin they should commemorate

307
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:10,079
In the mid eighteen hundreds as headlines screamed about the wars in the West

308
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:12,383
Monuments sprung up in the Northeast

309
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,711
When the monument on the Island was built in 1874

310
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:18,015
There were a thousand people present

311
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:22,111
Again it was the first Monument ever built to a woman in the US

312
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:25,183
But when the Indian Wars die down around 1900

313
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:28,255
Hannah duston dropped out of the national Spotlight again

314
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:32,095
But a subset of new englanders held onto her story

315
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:35,423
1905 Hannah Dustin descendants

316
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:38,239
Created the Dustin Family Association

317
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:41,567
They should have littered the landscape of Haverhill with

318
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:44,639
Memorial Boulders and millstones in her honor

319
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:47,199
At sites where she landed her canoe

320
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,503
Across from where she was buried

321
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,623
Apparently they put one up at one place where she turned around and looked back thinking that Indians might be

322
00:15:54,879 --> 00:16:01,023
Following her on her way home then all the way into the mid-1900s there was a whole other layer of things named after

323
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,559
After those rocks and statues

324
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:03,839
A nursing home

325
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:04,607
A school

326
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,375
Streets

327
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,935
Overtime the namings petered out

328
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,471
Put the names themselves.

329
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,519
So did the Dustin family

330
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:15,103
Well my name is Cedric H Dustin jr.

331
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,151
I'm a test generation from Hannah

332
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:23,807
So would that make her my eighth grade grandmother I'm not sure I just haven't counted

333
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:30,207
Something like that yes Cedric is the vice-president and formerly the president of the Dustin family associate

334
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:30,975
Station

335
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:34,303
He's 88 and he's known about hannah dustan since he was a boy

336
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,607
To Cedric Hannah was a heroine

337
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,911
She was concerned about her own life

338
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,703
And those of us companions

339
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,751
And as such

340
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,031
Iceland

341
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:47,615
She was quite a lady to have two planets you did

342
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,407
And do the things she did

343
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:52,223
But basically I think this was self-preservation

344
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:57,599
Just make something clear the Dustin Family Association isn't lobbying for statues anymore

345
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:02,207
They mostly spend time tracing their lineage and they get together for a barbecue every summer

346
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:08,607
And Cedric Gaston says he understands why some aren't such a big fan of his grandmother a Generations or

347
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:13,727
But he is disappointed the statue in the island are in disrepair

348
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:17,311
Hannah's nose was shot off of the rifle there's graffiti

349
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,615
And the grass hasn't been mowed in years

350
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:23,711
When I was a young man I could have gone up there and cut the whole thing but right now

351
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:25,503
Sage won't let me do that

352
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,087
The state of New Hampshire

353
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,135
Should make

354
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,415
Could you

355
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:35,999
Are the fact that they have in their confines

356
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:37,535
The first

357
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,095
Statue ever erected to women in this country

358
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:43,935
Perhaps a new sign should be put at that location

359
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,215
Indicating that

360
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:49,823
As opposed to the scientists are now indicating the deed that happened on that island

361
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,687
So this is The Islander

362
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,479
This is the island

363
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:01,087
I went back to the island with a 30 ft tall Hannah duston

364
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:03,647
With someone who says he's avoided going out there

365
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:04,671
4 years

366
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,207
She doesn't look very

367
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:09,279
Brolic gym looks more like an opportunist

368
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,887
Angry oportunista went back and then bragged about it and then

369
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:14,911
History

370
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:15,679
Become history

371
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:19,775
This is Paul I'm Paul pouliot I'm the Sagamore

372
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,823
Roughly translated

373
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,103
The principal speaker

374
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:23,871
Of

375
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,407
The grand Council

376
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:26,687
Of the

377
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,223
Kasich band

378
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,759
The pannekoeken Abenaki people

379
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:33,343
Paul doesn't by cotton Mather's version of the story

380
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:37,439
The one where the Abenaki smashed Dustin's newborn baby against a tree

381
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:41,279
He said it doesn't match with other captivity stories of the era

382
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,047
We have

383
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,327
Many many accounts

384
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,095
The captive

385
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,375
Saying that

386
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,655
Being taken

387
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,703
I'll buy the Abenaki was not

388
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,727
A death sentence

389
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,543
Many went to Canada someone for traded back

390
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:59,199
Paul thinks Hannah's captors were probably treating her well will presumably as well as one can be

391
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:05,599
Retreat at the in captivity revered children so the idea of a warrior bashing a baby again

392
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:08,159
Against the tree as Cotton Mather story portrays

393
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,695
Sounds unlikely to him

394
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:15,583
It's impossible to know how the baby was killed or how Hannah Dustin was treated by her captors

395
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:19,423
And I hesitate to judge for my 21st century vantage point

396
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,519
What she should or shouldn't have done in order to make her Escape

397
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:26,591
But it's clear that the Hannah duston story

398
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,871
Is complicated

399
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:31,455
Paul thinks the monument to her should just be forgotten

400
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:33,247
I mean I really don't think this

401
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,015
This Monument

402
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:34,783
Should be preserved

403
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,319
Just let it

404
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,903
It's it's going to last you for Millennia so

405
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:42,207
It's unfortunate Eeyore's not going away

406
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:44,255
And that's the problem now

407
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,047
Hannah duston Monument

408
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:48,095
It's the one on the island and all the others

409
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,399
Are mostly fading relics in

410
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,679
Out-of-the-way places

411
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,751
But every few years some politician or

412
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,823
History buff for Native American points to one and says

413
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,383
Clean this thing up

414
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,663
Every time

415
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,431
People argue

416
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,223
Is she a heroine

417
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,503
Where she a villain

418
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:08,831
The same thing over and over and over

419
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:12,415
Just in the last couple months there's been renewed talk about the monument

420
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:17,023
People are suggesting putting up additional plaques that show the Abenaki history

421
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:21,375
Or changing the name from the Hannah duston Memorial state Historic Site

422
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,447
To the Kentucky guilin state Historic Site

423
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:28,543
But even something as small as cleaning up graffiti on the monument

424
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:34,943
For mowing the ground could be seen as taking a stance about whether Hannah Dustin deserved a monument in the first place

425
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:38,015
About whether she was actually a hero or villain

426
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:44,415
Before we left the island Paul pouliot said there was something he wanted to do

427
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,183
Off the Record

428
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,463
Sure no recording

429
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:47,487
Okay

430
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,327
He pulled out a dram and some tobacco

431
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,375
He paced around the monument twice

432
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:57,215
One time he scattered a little Tobacco on four sides of the statue

433
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,775
The other time he beat the drum and sang

434
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:03,359
He didn't want me to record the ceremony but he talked about it afterwards

435
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:05,407
We don't want to forget

436
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,455
Aransas to the Past

437
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,527
So we weaved alluring song

438
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:12,831
And we made an offering of tobacco

439
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:13,855
2

440
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:15,647
Kind of purify the ground

441
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,928
Where we were

442
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,208
Walking around the

443
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,488
And does it

444
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,768
Provide you with

445
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:23,584
Any relief for satisfaction to do that

446
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:24,864
What's what is

447
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,400
Appropriate

448
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,704
You know just asking Earth Mother

449
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:31,520
An awning or if Mother take him back

450
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,288
And

451
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:34,336
Understanding with some kind of closure

452
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:39,200
Spiritual closure if nothing else

453
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:44,064
Public decision on how to include Paul's ancestors in this history

454
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,624
Is private ceremony will have to be enough

455
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:51,488
For now the statue with her shot off nose and big hunting plaque

456
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,792
Remains neglected and crumbling

457
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:54,816
Which

458
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:59,424
Actually is probably the most accurate symbol of how we feel about Hannah duston today

459
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,728
Ambivalent about who she was

460
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,776
But not quite ready to let her go

Okay

486
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:45,408
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

487
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:48,224
Makes for a much more natural experience

488
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,272
Turn the living room lights on

Series from Bellow radio TV show the truth

524
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,984

You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

530
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:34,112
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

531
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:38,464
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like a dad

I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

533
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:47,168

534
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:48,192
I think

A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop
