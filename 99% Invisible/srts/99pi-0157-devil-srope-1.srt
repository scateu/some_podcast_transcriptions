24
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:08,864
I'm Roman Mars

25
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:15,264
There's a pretty famous novel about the old American West

26
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,544
Called lonesome.

27
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:22,176
Published in 1985 and won a Pulitzer Prize and was later made into a TV mini-series

28
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:25,248
It's one of the best books ever written I think

29
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:31,648
That's our own Katie mingle in the book A group of cowboys from Texas Cattleman as they were once

Montana

32
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:43,168
It's an epic adventure story the writing is just gorgeous

33
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:43,936
Here's a path

34
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,800
As they rode North they saw more Buffalo

35
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:51,360
Mostly small Bunches of 20 or 30

36
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:55,456
The third day north of Yellowstone they killed a crippled Buffalo Calf

37
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,992
And dying on its liver

38
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:00,320
In the morning when they left there were a number of buzzards

39
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:03,136
And two or three Prairie wolves hanging around

40
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,928
Waiting for them to leave the carcass

41
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,976
It was a beautiful morning

42
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,768
Chris for an hour or two

43
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:10,560
And then sunny and warm

44
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:13,120
The country rolled onto the North

45
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,144
Has it had four

46
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,424
4000 to miles

47
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,960
Brown in the distance

48
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:20,032
The prairie grasses waving in the breeze

49
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:24,128
The book which is fiction takes place in the 1870s

50
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,920
And the reason we're talking about

51
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:31,552
Is that basically everything about that scene was about to become impossible

52
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:34,880
The whole premise of the book really

53
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,416
Was about to become impossible

54
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,952
In just a few years

55
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,000
Cattle drives would come to an end

56
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:44,352
The West will become populated with people in towns and Railway

57
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,400
And almost all of the Buffalo

58
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,424
Would be gone

59
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:50,496
This change would come about incredibly

60
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,288
And a lot of it

61
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:58,688
Would be brought about by one very simple invention that would come to be known as the devil's real

62
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,088
But let's back up just a tad

63
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,464
In the mid-1800s not many non-native Americans had ever been west of the Mississippi

64
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:14,048
When Frederick Law Olmsted visited the West in the 1850s

65
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:17,120
He remarks that it was like a sea of grasses

66
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:20,192
Batman and swells after a great storm

67
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,264
And they were so tall that

68
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,544
In order to

69
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,384
See where you are going to get your bearings you have to stand on a horse's back

70
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,456
That's Joanne Liu

71
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:36,576
Hi my name is Joanne Liu I am a texas-based writer and editor

72
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:42,976
You had to go far west you had to go to the West Coast of Washington Oregon California to Seymour

73
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:43,744
Said it was out there

74
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,144
The middle of the country was divided into territories in apart from Texas

75
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:50,912
Summit

76
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:56,544
On the maps up until I would say about 1850s 1840s

77
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,592
They just label that whole region

78
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,640
As a great American desert

79
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:04,480
They later change the maps to say the Great American Plains

80
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,248
But still

81
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:08,064
The middle of the country was a vast unknown

82
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:10,112
It was sparsely populated

83
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:15,488
Mostly by Native Americans and by Cattlemen who are supplying beef to the people on the East Coast

84
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,791
And then in the mid-1800s

85
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:20,863
People in the East start thinking about manifest destiny

86
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,655
And about settling the West

87
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,959
The American government

88
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:27,263
Wanted to settle the American West

89
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,311
And they didn't view Cattlemen

90
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:32,127
And Native Americans are suitable Settlers of the West

91
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,943
What they wanted out there were people who would actually

92
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,223
Farm tallinn

93
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:40,319
Put down the roots improve the land with buildings and communities

94
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,879
And they look to the Yeoman farmer to do that

95
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,183
Ye Olde Yeoman farmer

96
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:50,559
So in 1862 President Lincoln signs the Homestead Act

97
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,375
Which basically says if you move west

98
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,423
Settle on a piece of land that

99
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,727
Other people and farm it

100
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,519
And you do that for 5 years

101
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:00,799
The land is yours

102
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,335
160 Acres

103
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,615
Free for the taking

104
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,943
Of course the young man you know us common Folk

105
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,223
Started heading west

106
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,527
Free land that can't be hard right

107
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,295
Right

108
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:12,831
Guys

109
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,367
It seemed like a great idea

110
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,135
Stayed

111
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:18,463
Really didn't think about how difficult that would be for

112
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,743
People going out there

113
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:23,583
No toy stores no schools

114
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,679
And of course no

115
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,215
No fencing material

116
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:32,543
And it turns out fences were crucial to Farmers

117
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,591
But that sea of grasses

118
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:37,663
Was not a sea of fencing material

119
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:38,687
In other words

120
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,247
There weren't many trees to use for lumber

121
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:46,879
Yeah this other start going out there and what they found was that the land was fertile it was great for farming

122
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,415
But

123
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:52,255
There was cattle everywhere and so when they start to plant their crops

124
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:57,375
The cattle just simply wander onto the field trampled and Destroy every all their efforts

125
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:04,031
To keep cattle out of their cross the farmers tried using these really thick and thorny Osage orange edges

126
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:04,799
Is for fencing

127
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:10,687
They work pretty well but they took five years to grow and if you had to move the boundaries of your property

128
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:11,711
Tough luck

129
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:16,831
Butler's also tried smooth wire fencing but the cattle could just bust right through it

130
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:23,487
Everyone was getting really frustrated lot of settlers they move west and found that they had this

131
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:26,303
This problem on their hands and there was nothing they could do about

132
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,327
And then they left

133
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:33,727
Fencing became an issue of much discussion there was talk about everywhere you went among farmers of

134
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:40,127
Course but also in newspapers agricultural Publications and in the US government

135
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:45,247
Department of Agriculture that I think was the land office did a study in 1870

136
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,063
And they basically determined that

137
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,343
It was

138
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,623
Not feasible

139
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,671
To settle the West

140
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,463
Because there was no fencing

141
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,487
What's impossible

142
00:06:55,999 --> 00:07:00,351
Our destiny could not be manifested without solving the fencing problem

143
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,911
And the solution

144
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,703
Barbed wire

145
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:14,175
There were a lot of different patents filed for barbed wire like fences around this time

146
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:19,039
Twitter attempted to replicate the deterrent properties of the thorn bush

147
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:23,903
Ultimately the barbed wire design that prevailed was from a guy named Joseph Glidden

148
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:28,767
In 1873 Glidden was at a County Fair in his hometown of DeKalb Illinois

149
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:32,351
When he saw a fence that inspired him

150
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,375
Strip of wood

151
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:35,167
Withnail like spikes on it

152
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:39,007
The strip of wood was meant to be attached to a smooth wire fence

153
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:41,311
And he realize he could he can improve on that

154
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:46,175
Glenwood home and created what we now know as Barb Wire

155
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:49,759
Sharp metal barbs twisted around a strand

156
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,783
Smooth wire

157
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,879
And from then he intertwine a second smooth piece of wire

158
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:55,903
So that

159
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,439
The Twisted bar could not

160
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,207
Slide around

161
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:04,863
Gwen went into business with a guy named Isaac Ellwood and they said about trying to get barbed wire into the hands of Western

162
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:11,263
Settlers but people were skeptical that barbed wire would work against the kind of cattle they were raising in the west at the time

163
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,567
The Texas Longhorn

164
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:18,431
Texas Longhorns for the most unruly

165
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,711
Belligerent cattle

166
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:24,063
And so the idea that this little piece of barbed wire could

167
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,087
Keep them out of

168
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:25,855
Anywhere

169
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:26,879
Laugh

170
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,671
So The Story Goes

171
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:35,071
That Gooden in Elwood sent a fast-talking salesman and compulsive Gambler known as John bed

172
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,095
Add a million Gates

173
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,631
Down to San Antonio

174
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:43,007
To sell barbed wire and bet a million Gates basically tells all the farmers and cowboys

175
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:48,383
Together up there most unruly cattle and stick them inside this barbed wire enclosure

176
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,175
But she built in the Town Square

177
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,711
By the other day

178
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,991
There's a huge crowd

179
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:56,575
They put the cattle in the enclosure and they got them all riled up

180
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,623
And the cattle just went crazy

181
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:01,183
They rushed up against the defense

182
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,719
And immediately we are back

183
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:05,023
Cuz they met up with a barbed wire

184
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:11,167
Eventually the cattle all just kind of meekly settled down better Mill and gate start taking orders

185
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:11,935
Right then and there

186
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:16,287
Word spread and so did the barbed wire all over the West

187
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:20,639
1874 when Glendon Elwood first started they produce

188
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,943
10000 lb of barbed wire

189
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:27,807
1876 was the same year that Betty Milton Gates went on San Antonio

190
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,087
They

191
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:31,391
We're producing nearly 3 million pounds

192
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,999
Before barbed wire hit the West

193
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:40,351
The Cattleman had just been kind of watching and laughing as that Yeoman farmers

194
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,887
Struggle with their

195
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,167
Fence shrubs

196
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,703
Remember the West

197
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,727
For the Homestead Act

198
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,519
Was in large part

199
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:51,359
Populated by Cattlemen and the various Native American tribes

200
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:56,479
Has been made of the animosity between Cowboys and Indians

201
00:09:56,991 --> 00:10:00,319
They have this one kind of striking thing in common

202
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:04,927
Neither really believed in fencing off the land and hanging no trespassing signs

203
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:08,511
The west of the American Cowboy before the Homestead Act

204
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:15,167
Was governed by something called The Law of the Open Range now I'd always thought that the Open Range

205
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,959
It was a figure of speech

206
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:19,775
Like it just meant big open pastures

207
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,615
It was like the way things were done

208
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:26,175
It was a big deal in the West

209
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:26,943
So

210
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,711
It just

211
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,479
Became practice

212
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:31,039
Common practice that became Unwritten code of law

213
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:33,855
I don't need to rearrange Farm why to fatten up

214
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,951
And for cattle to get the grazing lands they needed the land had to

215
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:38,719
To be open

216
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:42,559
So you can probably guess who was about to ruin

217
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,327
Everything

218
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:47,167
ELD Yeoman farmer and their barbed wire fences

219
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:54,847
It was in direct contradiction of the law of the Open Range apart from that people also thought that barbed wire

220
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,383
Water was cruel

221
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:02,783
A lot of the cattle you know they would be injured by the barbed wire and they would their wounds would become infested with screw bar MN

222
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,807
Double die

223
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:07,903
A whole side business of elixirs for wounded cattle sprung up

224
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:11,743
Briefly people try designing more Humane barbed wire fences

225
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:15,071
They were made to be easier for the cattle to see and avoid

226
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,351
But they didn't catch on

227
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,119
In any case

228
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,167
The Cattleman weren't happy

229
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,983
If you ever seen the musical Oklahoma and

230
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,007
Oh I have

231
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:29,151
You might remember this little ditty called the farmer and the Cowman should be friends

232
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:36,063
I'd like to say a word.

233
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:40,415
D, Weston field a lot of fences

234
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:47,583
I'm right across. Cattle range

235
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:53,215
The chorus of the song and floors all territory folks to stick together

236
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:09,599
But in reality Cowboys and Farmers wouldn't become friends for a while

237
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:13,951
Cattlemen resented the farmers as they put up more and more fences

238
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,231
And that's what's up

239
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,023
Yeah defense carnivores

240
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,327
The fence cutting Wars

241
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,631
They started around 1881

242
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:28,287
It began with Cowboys cutting down illegal fences the people were putting up around land that they didn't

243
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:30,335
I'm even have a rightful claim on

244
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:33,919
What happened was as this sort of momentum built

245
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:37,503
I'm a lot of people start joining in a lot of Outlaws and

246
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,295
Rustlers and they started

247
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,063
Cutting

248
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,855
Illegal and legal fund

249
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:44,159
Anytime and followed suit

250
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,951
And it just it just

251
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,231
Erupting chaos

252
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,023
Starting in Texas

253
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,583
And it spread northward all the way up to Montana

254
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,655
The Cowboys cut fences at night

255
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,679
With masks on

256
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:59,263
But even had fans cutting gangs with names like the owls

257
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,287
Blue Devils

258
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,567
And the land League

259
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,127
This all went on for about 4 years

260
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,199
Most of the damage was in property value

261
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:09,759
But there are a few dots on record

262
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:16,159
Eventually the Texas state government and the FEDS got involved and the fence cutting finally died down

263
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,695
Around 1885

264
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,887
During the 1800s the Buffalo that roamed the American West died off in huge numbers

265
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:28,703
Partly because settlers were killing them for their hides

266
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,263
But also because of fences

267
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,335
Buffalo needed large areas for their migration

268
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:40,735
And just like it did for the cattle barbed wire and peaden's Buffalo's access to grazing lands and water

269
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:45,855
Poor white people live in the west it's estimated that 65 million buffalo live there

270
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,903
But by the end of the 1800s

271
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,439
There were less than 1000

272
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:54,303
By the time Barb Wire hit the West

273
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:58,911
A lot of Native American tribes had already been forced onto reservations

274
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:05,567
But somewhere still relatively free living a nomadic lifestyle that follow the migration of the Buffalo

275
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:11,455
And of course the native cultures also lived by the law of the Open Range

276
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,247
Even if they didn't call it that

277
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,551
And once a bar went up

278
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,623
I'm for the Native Americans the way of life

279
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,647
Was just obliterated

280
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:25,023
Native Americans ultimately came to refer to the fencing as the devil's Road

281
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:30,143
By the end of the century the West was basically covered in the devil's rope

282
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:33,727
The fence cutting wars were over the farmers had one

283
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:37,823
Even the Cowboys have come to accept and use barbed wire

284
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,103
And then

285
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,919
Appliance

286
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,527
Summon agricultura

287
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,063
Economy as a

288
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,599
2

289
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,367
A very

290
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,415
Specific political military

291
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:57,791
That's Alan Krell and I'm the author of

292
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,327
The devil's rope

293
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,143
A cultural history of barbed wire

294
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:08,799
Ounces at World War 1 is the first time barbwire really becomes widely associated with being

295
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,335
Tool of War

296
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,871
So if you could imagine

297
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,151
Trench warfare

298
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,455
Had a remarkable intimacy

299
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,223
To it

300
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,271
You have a lot of credentials

301
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:19,807
And then

302
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:23,647
A hundred yards away the enemy had their own line trenches

303
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,927
And

304
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:27,999
The area in between is so cool no man's land

305
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:29,535
And

306
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,351
The side of the Snowman

307
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,935
Bob wire at 4.

308
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,703
Vacations

309
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:40,031
The barbed wire kept the enemy out of your Trench

310
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:43,359
But soldiers got caught and sometimes died in it

311
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:46,943
There's a British army song from that time that captures this

312
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,479
Called the old bark

313
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:01,023
Navigate home

314
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,519
Barbed wire shows up again in World War II

315
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:14,079
With an extra Sinister innovation

316
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,383
Electrified barbed wire

317
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,175
Is a double heart

318
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,991
Electrified barbed wire was

319
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,551
Part of the architecture of the Holocaust

320
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:27,391
It was such a ubiquitous part of the scenery that in fact

321
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:34,047
There was a term coined in the death camps of World War II for committing suicide by throwing oneself on the

322
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,071
Electric fence

323
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,351
Embracing

324
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,375
The Wire

325
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,167
Bamako

326
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,983
Embracing The Wire

327
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:47,103
In the 1960s you get Barbed wires evil spawn razor wire

328
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,151
Also called ribbon wire

329
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:53,503
And of course now you see that stuff at prisons all over the world

330
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,551
Bob wire

331
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,343
Ease nausea

332
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,647
It's menacing

333
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,695
It's

334
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,231
Transparently

335
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:04,767
Terrible

336
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,095
As useful as the fencing may have been to Farmers

337
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,375
The settling the West

338
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:15,775
Alan says that has always been about control and possession and separation

339
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,567
They keep sitting it keeps off

340
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,103
Except

341
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,127
For once

342
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:26,015
There's one instance where the stuff was actually used not to separate us

343
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,295
How to connect

344
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:31,135
Right around the same time that barbed wire was invented

345
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:33,695
Alexander Graham Bell received a patent for

346
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:37,791
An apparatus for transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically

347
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,583
The telephone basically

348
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:44,191
And his telephone company is when about stringing telephone wires in cities

349
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:47,519
They weren't really interested in the world market

350
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,567
The farmers wanted phones

351
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:51,359
Needed them really

352
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:55,967
Which meant they needed a network of wires that connected all the Farms

353
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:58,271
I think you see where this is heading

354
00:17:59,039 --> 00:17:59,807
Simsbury

355
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,599
Clever people said well

356
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,367
We have wire

357
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,391
Already we have

358
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:04,927
Barbed wire fences

359
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:11,327
David Cecilia he's a professor of business and economic history at the University of Maryland

360
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,095
It wouldn't

361
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,375
Transmit a signal

362
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:15,679
Quite as clearly as say it nice

363
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,447
Pixelated

364

By the 1930s the national Bell Telephone system had penetrated into the remote rural regions of the West and Midway

395
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:29,663
Farmers no longer had to create their own telephone collectives
