This is 99% invisible

24

I'm Roman Mars

25
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:11,424
You're walking in San Francisco

26
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:15,264
You might not know when you're Crossing from the Western addition neighborhood

27
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,544
In the Hayes Valley

28
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:18,336
Or if you're in Portola

29
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,360
4 Excelsior

30
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:25,760
But you could be aimlessly wandering around any Western city of significant size including San Francisco or

31
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:26,528
Oakland

32
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:29,856
And you'll know exactly when you're in Chinatown

33
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:34,208
Those visual cues may be simple to pick up on but it turns out

34
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:38,816
The origin stories of Chinatown and the architecture and food that come from it

35
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:42,144
Are far more complex and interesting than you can imagine

36
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:47,264
We did a couple stories on this a few years ago and we compiled them together into this episode

37
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:48,544
I hope you like it

38
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:56,480
Stepped off a plane from Hong Kong and into the San Francisco International Airport

39
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:59,296
It was his first time on American soil

40
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:06,464
At 22 years old he had left his homeland of China and traveled across the ocean to build a new life for himself

41
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,744
Self and his young wife

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,536
In this land of opportunity

43
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:13,376
When immigrants first come to the US Census

44
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:16,704
And this is such an all troponin old stories that you expect

45
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:18,752
Yeah the streets are paved with gold

46
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,288
This is Bonnie toy

47
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,056
Jorge's daughter

48
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:24,128
She's also the author of a book about American chinatown's

49
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,920
Even today I changed

50
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:29,504
San Francisco gold Mountain

51
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,552
This is why you find your fortune in Sims

52
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:37,184
George toys very first stop in San Francisco he's very first stop in America

53
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,768
Like generation upon generation of Chinese immigrants beforehand

54
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,072
What's San Francisco's Chinatown

55
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,912
And he was not impressed

56
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:49,216
Two Georges San Francisco Chinatown

57
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,752
Fell out of date

58
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:56,640
All the things he saw in Chinatown these Pagoda roofs these Dragon Gates these flourishes that

59
00:02:57,152 --> 00:03:03,296
United a signal China and Chinese notice there were things that he actually end scene in

60
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,832
Back in China Fair

61
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:07,904
Years and years and years and they were not used in that

62
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,976
Architectural vernacular back there and sell

63
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,280
He wondered how Chinatown in this

64
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:16,096
In a release supposedly modern America was

65
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,632
Why did it

66
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,936
Feel older than oldest parts of Hong Kong work

67
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:20,704
Looking grown up

68
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:22,752
Because it was designed that way

69
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,544
That's producer Chelsea Davis

70
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,360
For George soy and many other Chinese immigrants

71
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:29,408
San Francisco's Chinatown

72
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,968
And the chinatowns in alot of American cities

73
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,528
They don't look much like the China they know

74
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:36,576
Looks like a bit of a movie citic

75
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,904
It's a lot of contacts to anything else

76
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,696
Next to it on either side

77
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,000
That's filmmaker Felicia Lowe

78
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,304
She made a documentary about San Fran

79
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,888
Walking around Chinatown together

80
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,216
Past Bank of America ATMs guarded by gold dragon

81
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,520
Shops with neon lit names

82
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,800
Like Hart of Shanghai

83
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,104
Selling paper fans and plastic Buddha

84
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,664
And towering four-story bazaars

85
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,432
Crowned

86
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,200
With little to gota

87
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:05,504
But Chinatown hasn't always look

88
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:11,392
In fact before the massive earthquake that leveled San Francisco in 1906

89
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:14,976
Chinatown look like most of the other neighborhoods in San Francisco

90
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,512
Rosa brick homes

91
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:19,071
Done up with Victorian italianate facade

92
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,887
The only thing you recognizes Chinatown

93
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,167
Are the people in it

94
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:24,959
And

95
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,751
Chinese signs

96
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:28,799
American

97
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,079
Signs

98
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:33,663
Phil Choi a retired architect and historian of chinese-american

99
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,431
Culture

100
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,479
He grew up in San Francisco

101
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,015
And still live there

102
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:43,391
He says it's not like Chinese immigrants in SF had strong opinions either way

103
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,415
About their neighborhood

104
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,439
Victorian flourishes

105
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,231
Columns for porches

106
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,255
They just

107
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:51,071
Didn't have much Choice when it came to where they live

108
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:55,679
After arriving in America they moved into the old homes that white people had abandoned

109
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,263
And after that basically the Chinese

110
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,031
Didn't have

111
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,055
Time

112
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,335
Greeley

113
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,359
Pay attention to

114
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,151
The architecture

115
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,687
All creating

116
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,455
Chinese

117
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,223
Architect

118
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:12,063
The basic desire was to make a living

119
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,343
And making a living

120
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,135
Was easier said than done

121
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,671
If you were Chinese in early

122
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,439
Early 20th century

123
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,743
Since the 18th 6

124
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,279
Chinese immigrants

125
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,303
I've been a convenient

126
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,351
For Nationwide jobs

127
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:28,703
The result was Federal legislation like the 1882

128
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,983
Chinese Exclusion Act

129
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,031
Which bar the vast majority of

130
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,823
Chinese people from entering the states

131
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,871
And made it impossible for

132
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,663
The Chinese already in the US

133
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:38,943
Become new America

134
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,711
Can citizens

135
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,319
In San Francisco racist housing policies made it almost impossible

136
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:47,391
More people of Chinese Heritage to live outside of China

137
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,439
And when they did set foot out

138
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,231
Outside the 15 square blocks

139
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,511
So the Chinese Enclave

140
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,815
It was at the risk of physical violence

141
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:57,375
So the self-contained world of Chinatown

142
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,423
Served as a desperately needed Refuge

143
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,447
Or Chinese

144
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,495
But a 1906

145
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,799
That Refuge would be eviscerate

146
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,591
Buy a double whammy

147
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,359
What is that

148
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:13,759
Early in the morning of April 18th of that year San franciscans woke up to a seven point

149
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:14,783
892 North

150
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:21,183
Like it was the biggest quake in the cities recorded history still is but those violent Tremors were

151
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:26,047
We're just the beginning because the earthquake shattered the cities gas means

152
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:31,167
And the gas that we doubt somewhere it connected with a spark

153
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:36,799
The massive fires that resulted lasted for three days and destroyed about 500 city blocks

154
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:43,199
Chinatown was one of the first neighborhoods to go up in smoke

155
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,479
Neighborhood and without it

156
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,527
Give me something very dangerous

157
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,807
Situation

158
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:52,159
Andrea Davies is a historian at the Stanford Humanities Center

159
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:54,463
But before her career in Academia

160
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:56,511
She was in a slightly different line of work

161
00:06:56,767 --> 00:07:00,863
I was a San Francisco firefighter for about 5 years

162
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,143
And so my first

163
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:08,543
Assignment was Chinatown fighting fires in that neighborhood later LED Davies to write a Social history of the ninth

164
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:16,223
She says that in the wake of the disaster newspapers pedal this feel goodies story but the SF

165
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,039
Earthquake and fire were social equalizers

166
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:24,927
That the shared experience of suffering United San franciscans of all colors and creeds

167
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:31,583
Man helping man and so on but while white man may have helped white man no one was out

168
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,607
On the Chinese

169
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:35,935
The racism against them only intensified

170
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,727
I call it hiding post-disaster

171
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:41,311
You could see this height and racism happening on at least

172
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,335
Two levels

173
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,359
First

174
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,407
With individual white Saint Francis

175
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:46,943
The built environment

176
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,223
Everyone in their place

177
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,271
And that's what gets erased

178
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,295
On April 18th

179
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:53,599
So

180
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,391
If you're an elite white Saint Francis

181
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,159
You don't have

182
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:57,695
The resident

183
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,975
Chinatown unless you go there

184
00:07:59,487 --> 00:07:59,999
As

185
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:03,071
The Chinese are leaving their homes in desperation

186
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:05,119
They're being yelled at to get

187
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,167
And don't turn back

188
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,727
And according to Davies it wasn't just

189
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:13,055
Private citizens who are guilty of that heightened racism

190
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:17,663
Because the second place that the fire spur to flare up and racism

191
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:20,735
Wasn't how the recovery efforts were managed

192
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,503
The Firebird

193
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,271
Department

194
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,039
Did very little

195
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,575
In Chinatown

196
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,343
In effect

197
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,391
Underwater Manta

198
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,415
Until there

199
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,439
It's not wide enough

200
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,743
Is if you look

201
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:32,511
Cat Chinatown

202
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,047
Just Nestle right again

203
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:34,815
That's not pill

204
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,095
We're all the elite mansion

205
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,655
All the water goes

206
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,679
Advance America

207
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,703
To save Nob Hill

208
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,263
And all the dynamite

209
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:44,799
Goes into tray

210
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,615
At the time Fire Department

211
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,407
Would Dynamite buildings to keep

212
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,687
Spreading

213
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:53,759
But the fire department use the wrong kind of dynamite

214
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,063
In Chinatown burned all the faster

215
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:59,903
In the following days as the Embers of Chinatown cool

216
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,695
The Chinese found themselves

217
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,463
Homeless

218
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,511
A new Leaf vulnerable and hostile

219
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,559
The things

220
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,839
We're about to get worse

221
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,631
So many of the sea

222
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,655
Cities political and business

223
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,423
Slater's

224
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,215
Or actually excited about

225
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,007
Social equalizing disaster

226
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,311
Because of the Limited in Chinatown

227
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:18,591
Will never rebuild it

228
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,639
Before the quake

229
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,407
Many whites

230
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,687
Tina Chinese neighborhood

231
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:25,503
At the Camorra of opium dens process

232
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,783
Pollution and disease

233
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,575
In 1885

234
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:31,135
City Hall had prepared a municipal report

235
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:31,903
On Chinatown

236
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,183
And in that report

237
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,719
Page yourself

238
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,767
Of documentation

239
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,815
Listing all the houses of

240
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,351
Prostitution

241
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,655
And the number of gambling houses

242
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,447
And opium dens

243
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,727
Throughout China Town

244
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,775
This reputation for Vice

245
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:51,103
Had actually created a minor industry of Slum tourism

246
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:51,871
In China

247
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,431
Thrill-seeking white people

248
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:58,271
Could hire a guide to lead them through scenes of alleged depravity

249
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:01,087
It would be taken through dimly-lit building

250
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:03,135
Then shown opium smokers

251
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:03,903
Send prostitute

252
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:04,927
Gambling

253
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:09,791
Evidence suggests that some of these scenes may have actually been staged by the guys

254
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,559
That's themselves

255
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,583
And one thing that was

256
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,351
Definitely

257
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,143
Was a widespread rumor

258
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,191
At San Francisco's Chinese resume

259
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,239
Lived in underground tunnels

260
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,287
This is what they really peeling

261
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,335
That the Chinese live

262
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,359
Underground

263
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,383
And

264
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,663
Even today

265
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:26,943
People wants

266
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,711
Seeds

267
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,735
Chinatown

268
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:29,503
Underground

269
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,295
On top of all this

270
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,855
Chinatown was right in the middle of choice

271
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,623
Downtown

272
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,671
Real estate

273
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,951
The San Franciscan Elites

274
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,999
Had long wanted for white biz

275
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:41,791
In fact

276
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,327
2 years before the fire

277
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,119
Then-mayor James Phelan

278
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:45,887
A tired in Ark

279
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,167
Dr sketches

280
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,191
It's brand new.

281
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,007
The architect they hired

282
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:51,775
You may have heard of

283
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,567
Daniel Burnham

284
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,871
And in his plan there is

285
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:59,199
Burnham was a proponent of the city beautiful moon

286
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:03,551
In urban planning philosophy popular in the late 19th and early 20th century

287
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,599
And this idea of City beautiful

288
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:06,879
Racialized

289
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:07,647
This View

290
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,927
And the idea is

291
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,487
A more beautiful Urban environment

292
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,255
Crates

293
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,047
Citizen

294
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:16,863
We want a beautiful city of well-educated

295
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:17,631
Citizens

296
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,399
Everyone is

297
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,679
White and productive

298
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:22,239
And with China Town burned to the ground

299
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,543
City leaders seize the chance

300
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,591
Make that white dream or real

301
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:29,151
Within a week of the fire

302
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:33,503
City Hall created a committee dedicated solely to relocating China

303
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,087
The group included former mayor James Phelan

304
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,623
The one you would hired Burnham

305
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,671
To drive those revised draft

306
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,695
San Francisco

307
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:42,975
And so the minute

308
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,255
The city Goes Up in Flames

309
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,047
I'm not kidding I don't know

310
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,071
Is finished burning

311
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,607
And James feeling is

312
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:49,887
Telegrafi

313
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:50,655
Canterbury

314
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,447
Send more reports

315
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:55,263
Immediately get them at the hands of the city leaders and

316
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,287
Business Leaders

317
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,335
Here's our plan we can rebuild

318
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,103
Here's the proof

319
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,895
The plan for that

320
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:01,919
Perfect City

321
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,735
Who did the Chinese all the way to Hunters Point

322
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,783
A region on the edge of town

323
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:09,087
It's where the city slaughterhouses were

324
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:13,183
But it wasn't long before the Chinese residents found out about the

325
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,023
And I think they fought back very

326
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,047
Intelligently

327
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:21,887
They got china's Empress Dowager so she involve

328
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,239
She sent her consul-general from Washington to meet with San Francisco official

329
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,031
But the coup de gras

330
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,311
Was Financial

331
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,591
Four-decade

332
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:34,431
San Francisco had been a key hub for trade with China

333
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:41,087
So a group of the city's top Chinese business owners wrote to the current mayor in a line

334
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:44,159
Which San Francisco officials could easily understand

335
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:47,231
And so the on the business level of the negotiation was

336
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,255
Okay you don't want to

337
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,791
Come back we're not going down

338
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,839
WinCo Tacoma

339
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,119
We go to Portland

340
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,399
What is a panic of a loss

341
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:59,007
And that was a loss that city leaders couldn't take

342
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,311
Less than a month after the quake

343
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,847
The mayor dissolved

344
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,127
Committee to relocate

345
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:07,199
For Chinese Americans at this time

346
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,991
This was an unprecedented

347
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:09,759
Political victory

348
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,551
But they didn't stop there

349
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:14,623
The fire had left Chinatown a blank

350
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,927
And for the first time

351
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:17,951
The Chinese

352
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:18,719
For holding the

353
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,607
They were sick of Chinatown getting this bad rap for Vice

354
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:31,007
Sick of City Hall harassing them sick of visitor asking them if they lived in tunnels

355
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,311
Makeover for their neighborhood

356
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:39,199
And an American Born Chinese businessman named looked in Eli just how to go about it

357
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,759
The word was build me a pagoda

358
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,295
That's Felicia low again

359
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:46,111
She says that look Tennille I figured

360
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:52,511
Hey if porous are always going to come to China Town seeking a taste of some imaginary East

361
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:55,839
Let's give them what they want and so he was able to

362
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,887
Higher White architects

363
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:01,983
To create a Chinatown that looked the way

364
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,543
White people imagine Chinatown to look

365
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,335
Even though he knew

366
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,127
In his own mind that

367
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,687
The buildings in China didn't all look like this

368
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,783
Now looks plan might seem a bit counterintuitive

369
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,319
For decades

370
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,623
The Chinese of San Francisco had been harassed

371
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,391
That's precisely

372
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:23,231
Cuz they look and dress differently from mainstream White America

373
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,767
And he was the guy saying

374
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,607
Let's rebuild our neighborhood in a way that emphasizes our foreign debt

375
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:33,471
The cars are different from the rest of the city into the very face of our buildings

376
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,751
The Bonnie song

377
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:39,103
Whose father had been flummoxed by the look of Chinatown when he arrived in Sanford

378
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:39,871
Francisco

379
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:43,455
She says that the Chinese community of 1907

380
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,991
Saw a positive side

381
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,015
To that foreign this

382
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:50,367
And they also were pretty Savvy with the fact that people were interested

383
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,927
And they were interested in this exotic

384
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:53,951
Element

385
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:54,975
And if I could

386
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,023
Bill that in a way that was

387
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:57,791
Attractive

388
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,583
Instead of repellent

389
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,863
But that would be

390
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,399
Protective

391
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,423
For them

392
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,495
Look hired an architect named T Patterson Ross

393
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,799
And an engineer named aw Burger

394
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,591
These two men

395
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,871
Had never been to China

396
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,431
At the time The Architects

397
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,199
Where.

398
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,223
Trinidad

399
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,015
Traditional anything about

400
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,295
Oriental art

401
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,087
Because

402
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,623
Also at the time

403
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,671
The Orion was considered

404
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,463
Way behind the West

405
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:27,743
So

406
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,047
Culturally everything

407
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,583
Was looked down upon

408
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,863
Pain that's it

409
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,655
It's nothing to study about

410
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:41,311
Rothenburg runs knowledge of China was limited to a few images they've seen of ancient palaces

411
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,591
From the Song Dynasty

412
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:48,223
An architectural style that was already hundreds of years old by the early 20th century

413
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:52,063
But that didn't stop Ross and bergren from using their imagination

414
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,879
And how they use their imagination

415
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,159
They created

416
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:58,975
The sort of a Disneyland effect

417
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:05,631
Brinson's the sing cheong building was topped with a small structure that sort of look like a pagoda

418
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:11,263
Batchoy says that in China you typically wouldn't see a pagoda on top of another building

419
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:14,335
Pagodas there are free-standing structures

420
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,127
Not a decorative flourish

421
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,407
And secondly

422
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:19,199
In China dishware

423
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:24,063
Monuments for religious purposes of the religion of Buddhism

424
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:30,719
Here and it's San Franciscan for him the Pagoda instead houses in Monument to consumerism

425
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:35,327
Sing cheong became a bustling department store Hocking Asian art

426
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,607
Which it still is

427
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,631
To this day

428
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:44,287
But nonetheless the designers that looked in Eli hired created a striking building and other merchants

429
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:47,615
Rebuilding in Chinatown couldn't help but notice

430
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:51,199
Soon sing Chong's bombastic

431
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:56,575
Chinoiserie look happy Conde style for most new structures going up in Chinatown

432
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:59,903
The Architects were trying to reproduce Beijing in San Francisco

433
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:02,975
Tell me about a lot of the details wrong Taurus

434
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:05,535
They were wrong in all the right ways

435
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:08,351
Taurus love the new Chinatown

436
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:12,959
This was exactly the Westerner friendly version of China they wanted

437
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,751
Vaguely exotic

438
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:17,311
But safe enough for middle class white

439
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:20,383
Visitors began to flow into China.

440
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,431
And so did their cash

441
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,527
Antenna towns Pleasant new appearance was beginning to change

442
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,551
Popular sentiment

443
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,831
What's the Chinese people

444
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,623
American newspapers made it

445
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:34,719
Explicit that the neighborhood makeover was causing them to rethink their contempt

446
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,743
For the Chinese

447
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:38,815
And one newspaper the bulletin put it in 1909

448
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:39,583
Quote

449
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:43,423
Chinatown is one of the most noted places on the American colonies

450
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,727
We have held up to the public gaze

451
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,495
For too long

452
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,519
The racial grief

453
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,567
What separates the yellow and white people

454
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,847
The Earth and quote

455
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,383
Looked in Eli's

456
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:58,783
Plan had worked in Chinese communities elsewhere in the US were taking note all of the

457
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,343
Successive China towns that have Cam

458
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,879
In America

459
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:09,279
Take a cue from the take a page from this Playbook New York San Francisco LA Honolulu

460
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:15,679
They all sort of San Francisco again

461
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:22,079
She says visual style and tourist-friendly attitude that San Francisco's Chinatown had perfected

462
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:27,455
Soon began to spread was so successful

463
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:33,855
Still influencing chinatown's being built in our own time for instance take the Chinatown in Las Vegas which was

464
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,391
Created in the 90s

465
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:37,695
It also had the same

466
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:41,279
Pagoda roof lines and Dragon Gate like the same

467
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,815
Language sexual language

468
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:45,375
Same architectural vernacular was being used

469
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,399
To create

470
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:52,799
The newest Chinatown that was used to create the oldest Chinatown you know you outsmarted the devil

471
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:55,871
Basically there is a phrase you know that they called white people

472
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:58,687
Walkway which is the white

473
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,455
Devil

474
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:01,247
I think that it wasn't fixed

475
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:05,087
3 absolutely of course this architectural Revenge

476
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:09,183
Didn't instantly fix everything for the Chinese in San Francisco

477
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:13,535
They still faced plenty of legal and popular discrimination

478
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:17,119
For example they were still required by real estate laws

479
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,399
What's to live in China

480
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:21,983
And on a federal level the Chinese Exclusion Act

481
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:25,311
South wouldn't even be repealed until 1940

482
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:27,871
3 more than 30 years later

483
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,663
And even if they're rebranding

484
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,687
Chinatown help

485
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:32,479
To ease negative sentiment towards the

486
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,247
The Chinese

487
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,807
Philips Hue believes it may also have helped

488
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,343
Promote certain stereotypes

489
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,879
It continues

490
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:39,903
Super Bowl

491
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:40,927
Al forniss

492
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:44,255
And my I remember my daughter coming home

493
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,559
One day very annoyed

494
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,583
And

495
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,863
Upset is it

496
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:55,519
People look look look it's like they never seen a Chinese person before

497
00:19:55,775 --> 00:20:01,919
By contrast look at the other traditionally ethnic neighborhoods in San Francisco Japantown or theater

498
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,455
Italian neighborhood of North Beach

499
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:09,855
Choices those neighborhoods

500
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:12,671
Start the Chinatown dead

501
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:17,023
Not embellish and embrace the ethnicity

502
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:21,887
Other immigrant groups at that time didn't face the same antagonism that the Chinese did

503
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:25,983
So only the Chinese were forced to cater to white people's fantasies

504
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,263
As a survival knife

505
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:30,591
That's the irony at that time

506
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:36,991
We have to promote our furnace to be accepted but even if chinatown's architecture

507
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:40,319
Is a somewhat inauthentic representation of the real thing

508
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:42,111
B'Elanna Torres don't realize

509
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:48,511
The fact that real people live there and that it is a place actually that is for poor

510
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,559
People you know I mean it is at its

511
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:56,959
Essence a place where people come to live when they first get here because they can't

512
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:03,359
Because they need the services that are provided there

513
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:08,991
Funny soy says this is true of all the Chinatown she studied they're all portals of entry for

514
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:11,039
New immigrants of

515
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:14,367
Particular class in a working-class immigrants

516
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,135
2

517
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,672
Don't speak English

518
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:23,072
In fact thanks to factors like rent control zoning restrictions and really active tenants rights group

519
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:23,840
Community

520
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:30,496
San Francisco's Chinatown has managed to remain a relatively affordable neighborhood for low-income immigrants

521
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:36,896
Ebony says yes Chinatown has been disneyfied and rebranded to cater to American tastes

522
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:38,432
Are there still an authentic

523
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,712
An important history

524
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:46,368
There's something about it that if you can serve read the skyline you can read the story

525
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,648
Story of

526
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:50,720
How this place came to be and also in that is Chinese

527
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,280
In that there's like there's is power in that

528
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,200
99percentinvisible West produces week by Chelsea Davis and Katie Mingle

529
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:15,808
Version of the story was originally broadcast in the public radio history program backstory

530
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:25,536
One of my favorite episodes and episode titles of all time

531
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,328
A sweet surprise awaits

532
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:29,376
After this

533
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:31,936
Between the beats

534
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:34,240
Bongs and chatter of our devices

535
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:37,824
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man made sound

536
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:38,848
If

537
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:45,248
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife is

538
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:49,344
Call hearing. Voice

539
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,112
Technology

540
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:50,880
She talked to us

541
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:53,184
It is a creation of Sonic trap

542
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:56,256
Mets Joel Beckerman he's a sound designer and composer

543
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:59,840
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

544
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,632
To make them more human

545
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,728
Turn the living room lights on

546
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:07,520
Okay

547
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,568
Dim the living room lights to 50

548
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:10,336
2%

549
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,128
Okay

550
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:18,272
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding in some thoughtful sound

551
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,576
Makes for a much more natural

552
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:21,344
Experience

553
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,136
Turn the living room lights on

554
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,464
Dim the living room lights

555
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,488
50%

556
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,816
We're presenting to

Special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

558

About how are soundscape is impacting our health

559
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,288
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

560

We need to talk about something

564
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:52,064
Constipation abdominal pain and bloating

565
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,928
You tell yourself it's not that bad you take laxatives you modify your diet and exercise routine

566
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,976
Thinking about it all the time is frustrating

567
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:04,352
It doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again

568
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:07,680
You don't know why and it may be time to seek help

00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:11,008

Flask podcast

573
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:21,504
This is still 99percentinvisible

574
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:23,040
And I'm still roaming Mars

575
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:30,208
It was the night of March 30th 2005 and the Powerball Jack

576
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:33,536
Crock-Pot with 25 million dollars

577
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:40,192
On TV the white ping pong balls rolled out one by one as the host announced the winning number

578
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,728
22

579
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:42,496

580
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:43,520
32

581
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,544
33

582
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,360
39 Powerball is

583
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,896
42

584
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:50,688
That's pretty sir Avery truffle

585
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,992
There's a winner in Tennessee

586
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:57,344
But the way the Powerball drawings work there usually some second-place winners

587
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,880
Guess all of the numbers

588
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:00,416
Except for the very last one

589
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:04,000
On average there are three or four of these players

590
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:09,888
But on March 30th 2005 there were 110 second-place winners

591
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,936
Was there a computer glitch

592
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,472
Number

593
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:14,752
Has someone compromised

594
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,288
This is journalist

595
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,568
Jennifer 8 Lee

596
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,616
Lottery officials are planning

597
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:20,896
Like something

598
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,760
So the next day as the winners around the United States came to collect

599
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,552
The Powerball officials

600
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:29,856
So where'd you get your number from

601
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:32,928
And each of them have the same answer

602
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:35,488
They'd gotten their numbers

603
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,256
From

604
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,280
Fortune cookie

605
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:40,096
They were different cookies in different states

606
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:42,144
But they all had the same fortune

607
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,680
And the same lucky numbers

608
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:44,704
Very

609
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,728
Lucky numbers

610
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,008
And so just remember

611
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,568
Made you realize like how

612
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:50,336
March 14th

613
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,360
Use in Chinese

614
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,128
Fast food

615
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,664
Become an American

616
00:25:54,688 --> 00:26:00,832
Chinese food along with pizza and the Frankfurter has been adopted and modified to become

617
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,112
American Cuisine

618
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:06,208
Rooted in some good old-fashioned American xenophobia

619
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:10,048
The early waves of Chinese immigration in the 1850s

620
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:14,400
The new Chinese population work mostly As Miners and farmers and laborers

621
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,704
Can Americans as ever

622
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,264
We're concerned about these new immigrants

623
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,800
Taking away jobs

624
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:23,616
And it was actually only after huge

625
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:26,432
That the Chinese actually moved in

626
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:27,456
Can you feel

627
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,736
When was laundry again

628
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,808
Restaurants with Easter cleaning

629
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:33,600
Unless they were

630
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,136
No longer

631
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:38,720
And as their livelihoods depended on it

632
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:42,816
Chinese restaurant owners made up dishes to cater to American tastes

633
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:44,864
American face Eagle Lake

634
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,656
Things that are sweet and they're fried in

635
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:50,752
And that's how dishes like Chop Suey were invented

636
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:54,080
Chop Suey the name actually means assorted

637
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:54,848
Pieces

638
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:56,128
Like odds and ends

639
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:58,432
Chop Suey the biggest culinary joke that one

640
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:02,016
Chop Suey is not real Chinese

641
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:03,296
At all

642
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:05,344
It's as American as apple pie

643
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,136
And speaking of apple pie

644
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,928
Americans want to start because

645
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:09,952
We are America and we like

646
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:11,488
Antibody

647
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:17,888
Do you need a dessert and is Chinese desserts go there aren't that many options that the American pallet wood go for

648
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,424
The Chinese desserts like

649
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,704
There is a Mooncake

650
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,496
Which like taste and looks like a hawk

651
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:23,264
Tupac

652
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,312
There's there's not there's not a lot of stuff

653
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:30,944
And so around the 1920s the fortune cookie somehow enters the American Chinese restaurant culture

654
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:34,272
Where they came from originally is a bit of a mystery

655
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:35,552
But we'll get there

656
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:37,088
First let's make this

657
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,112
Perfectly clear

658
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,392
The cookies

659
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,160
These are not

660
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:43,232
From China I don't know why the Chinese

661
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:44,768
They don't need a fishing pole

662
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,608
Steven Yang is founder of Yang's fortunes Incorporated

663
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:49,632
In San Francisco

664
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:51,936
Chinese people in China don't eat

665
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,752
But Americans consume billions of

666
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:57,312
Which means great business for Steven

667
00:27:57,824 --> 00:28:02,176
Because he prints a lot of the paper fortunes that go inside fortune cookie

668
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:05,760
If you go to any way I would have new york-boston shoes

669
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,040
Is there any way you can

670
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:07,808
I see my voice

671
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,880
Including all the fortunes for Panda Express

672
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:13,184
That's definitely Stevens biggest client

673
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:15,232
Stevens tiny Warehouse

674
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:17,024
In San Francisco's Dogpatch

675
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,072
Is filled with boxes

676
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,608
All stuff

677
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,656
Full of tiny strips

678
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,424
Fortune

679
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:24,960
Each box

680
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:27,008
Contains 300000

681
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:27,776
Paper fortune

682
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,312

684
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,104
See

685
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,712
And Stephen Prince all these boxes and boxes with only five other employees

686
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:36,736
And Lisa

687
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:37,760
Stevens daughter

688
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,040
Writes all the fortune

689
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:41,856
When I visited she was away on maternity leave

690
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:46,208
But she is written most of the companies 5000 unique Fortune

691
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:51,584
This is amazing because we think about it fortunes are deceptively difficult to write

692
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:57,216
The messages have to be really really generic because they could be for anyone

693
00:28:57,472 --> 00:29:03,616
You can't write messages like you will meet a tall dark stranger because an eight-year-old could read that and be like

694
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:04,640
That

695
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,664
Why would we

696
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:08,736
And fortunes also have to be careful not to offend

697
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:13,344
Famously there was once a fortune that said lighten up and a lot of customers were like

698
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,928
Is this cookie calling me fat reduction

699
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,976
Americans like their Fortune

700
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:20,000

701
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:26,400
So Fortune send of evade or just generally uplifting like tomorrow will be better or the fortunes

00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:28,192
Arnab from quotation books

703
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,984
Just whatever Lisa can find

704
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,032
Stephen doesn't really care he doesn't breathe

705
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:34,592
I don't know why the American people didn't like it

706
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,408
They say they would do when they got a 14

707
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,480
After eating dinner with keeping the water

708
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:41,504
The keeper

709
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:42,784
Yeah that's true

710
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,088
Some people do keep the fortunes in their wallets

711
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:51,744
When I asked around it turns out a few of my friends do this or can recite their favorite fortunes from memory and it's crazy be

712
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,048
Because a lot of these fortunes are Stevens

713
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,584
Written by his daughter

714
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,352
Lisa

715
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:59,424
But there are a few ways to tell where your fortunes come from

716
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:05,824
If you get one with blue corners on it that was printed by a giant company in New York called wonton food

717
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:12,992
They make over 4 million cookies a day and we're responsible for the cookie that made all those Powerball

718
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,528
Winners in 2005

719
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:16,832
If your fortune has smiley faces on it

720
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:19,648
It was probably printed by a Chinese company

721
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:20,928
For the American Market

722
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:21,696
Of course

723
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:28,352
And if the fortune doesn't have blue corners or smiley faces chances are it was one of the many thousands that Steven

724
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:30,656
In all different colors and fonts

725
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,216
And sends the factories all over the country

726
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:36,032
Including the Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Company

727
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:39,104
Tiny Alleyway in San Francisco's Chinatown

728
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,176

The charges visitors 50 Cent a photo and doesn't actually have a very big cookie

732
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:51,648
Actually calling this place a factory is kind of an overstatement

733
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,440
It's just one narrow room

734
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:57,024
With most of the space taken up by three whole King fortune cookie

By Edward Lewis

737
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:04,192
My father used to call his machine like

00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:07,264

745
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:23,136
In a worker sits next to this belt and fold the hot cookies around the paper fortune

746
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,160
One by one

747
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,184
My hand

748
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,208
And

749
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:28,768
We pick them up as you see them doing here

750
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:34,400
Fold it and put them on a conveyor named learned how to fold the cookies when he was around eight years old

751
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:37,472
Aloha family used to have a fortune cookie company of Their Own

752
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:38,752
It was a whole life

753
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,544
Even during dinner

754
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,312
Wechat

755
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:42,592
Somebody eats

756
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:43,360
The other one work

757
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:44,640
That's how we did it

758
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:46,944
We used to call ourselves the prisoner

759
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,224
That was a famous saying

760
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,272
Help I'm a prisoner in this

761
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,552
Fortune cookie

762
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,440
Ming's father later developed the next generation of Fortune Cookie Machine

763
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,232
Fully automated version

764
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:00,768
Which also.

765
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:03,328
And because of this technology

766
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,632
Fortune cookies are widely available

767
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:08,448
A cheap enough that restaurants can give them out for

768
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:09,216
Free

769
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:12,544
No one in the Lewis family really question where the cookies originated

770
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,872
But it was a mystery that other people trying to solve

771
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:17,664
People like Sally Osaka

772
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:19,456
She knew they were not

773
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,736
Invented in China

774
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,784
What do you mean the Chinese fortune

775
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,320
Japanese

776
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:26,112
Sally osaki is

777
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,648
California born and raised

778
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:33,280
But her parents came from Japan in the early 1900s but I was a child

779
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:35,072
Fortunes

780
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,608
Used to be in Japanese

781
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:38,400
Rather than the Chinese character

782
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:42,496
And the cookies weren't something you get at the end of a meal at a restaurant

783
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,800
They coming back you know it and

784
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:48,128
Mostly I know who we got them when I was a child

785
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:50,432
Was we would go see Japanese movies

786
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:55,296
Sew-in Sally's California childhood but cookies were a casual snack

787
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:59,392
But if you chase them all the way back to their origins in Japan

788
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:01,952
You actually find them at a shrine

789
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:07,072
There you will be able to find

790
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:10,912
Is Japanese Bakers on grilling fortune cookie

791
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:16,288
Jennifer flute taisha Shrine in Kyoto specifically to try them

792
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:19,616
They're not like the fortune cookies we see in the United States

793
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:21,664
Bigger and Browner

794
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,736
And they're actually kind of like nutty Savory flavor

795
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:30,624
Cracker like but still there that same iconic fortune cookie shape we all know

796
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:37,024
There's actually an old Japanese image of a baker Folding It crackers and it dates back to 1878

797
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:37,792
Decade

798
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:42,656
It's before the first reports of American fortune cookies that I spoke to

799
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:43,424
Thought that

800
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,704
Fortune cookies

801
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:45,728
Designed to

802
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:46,752
Like a bell

803
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:47,776
In part because of

804
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:48,544
Bealls

805
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,312
All along

806
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:53,408
But then why don't we eat it after

807
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:55,200
Cuz I people are not eating soup

808
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:55,968
Xi'an

809
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:56,736
619

810
00:33:57,504 --> 00:34:03,136
When Japanese immigrants were opening businesses in the 1920s there was no market for Japanese food

811
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:04,672
Again like a Chinese m

812
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:05,696
Before then

813
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:07,488
They Pander to American taste

814
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:09,024
Japanese

815
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,048
Families

816
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:11,840
Ran a lot of Chinese restaurant

817
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:15,424
And these Japanese families ran American Chinese restaurant

818
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:18,752
Full of Chop Suey and other Pho Chinese cuisine

819
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:21,056
Annie's Japanese owners with

820
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:22,336
Bro in a fortune cookie

821
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:23,360
For dessert

822
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:27,712
When Sally was a kid fortune cookies were still made in Japanese Bakery

823
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:29,760
Grace in both LA and San Francisco

824
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:32,320
And the fortunes were still in Japanese

825
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:35,648
And then something happened that completely disrupted

826
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:38,464
Everything about Japanese American Life in this country

827
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:42,304
And I don't know if you know that

828
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,096
The Japanese-Americans hundred

829
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,120
20000 /

830
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:47,680
During World War II

831
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:48,448
Sent away

832
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:52,544
I was nine years old when we got sent to

833
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,568
To the concentration camp

834
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:56,640
Sally and her family were farmers

835
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:57,664
In Fresno

836
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:59,712
They were summoned to a train station

837
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:01,248
And sent off to a camp

838
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,016
In Arizona

839
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:04,320
You had to carry whatever your day

840
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,112
That was a child

841
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:07,392
Enjoy that much

842
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:08,928
Pictures of small suitcase

843
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,720
And I remember my mother

844
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:11,744
Give me

845
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:13,280

846
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:14,816
Account

847
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,376
Cuz she heard that

848
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:19,168
But we are going in error

849
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:21,728
Desert in Arizona

850
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:23,776
Are rattlesnakes and scorpions

851
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:30,176
Whatever yeah oh yeah gila monsters and scorpions and

852
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:31,968
Rattlesnakes Young

853
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:35,552
In the camp her parents were given jobs at her and hardly any money

854
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:36,832
Salary was

855
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:39,904
$16 or $18

856
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:43,232
For 4 years

857
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:45,280
From 1942

858
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:46,816
1946

859
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:51,168
California's Japanese and Japanese-American community

860
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,704
He was marooned in the desert

861
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:54,240
Out of sight

862
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:55,520
Add communication

863
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:56,288
Out of

864
00:35:57,312 --> 00:36:00,640
Including a lot of Japanese Bakers & Japanese restaurant

865
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:03,200
My recollection was that

866
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:05,248
After we came out of the camps

867
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,808
It was a Chinese fortune cookie

868
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:10,368
The Chinese actually

869
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,904
Commercialized it

870
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:12,928
And

871
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:15,744
Did all the Chinese restaurants that are deserve it

872
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,536
Thanks to Chinese business owners

873
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:18,304
And later

874
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,096
Edward Louie Fortune Cookie Machine

875
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:22,144
The Chinese American fortune cookie

876
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:23,680
As we now know it

877
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:24,960
Flourished

878
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:32,128
It's nearly impossible to pan the Americanization of the cookie to one specific Japanese-American Bay

879
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:34,432
Baker or Chinese American Restaurant

880
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:41,088
The transfer from Japanese cracker to American Chinese cookie was a larger phenomenon that occurred

881
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:41,856
Or less

882
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:43,136
Across California

883
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:45,952
And then swept the rest of the United States

884
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,488
And then the world

885
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:49,792
Except for China

886
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:51,840
They still don't eat for two

887
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:05,664
Part 2 of 99% invisible was produced by Avery trufelman this story was largely inspired by Jennifer Haley's book

888
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:12,064
Fortune cookie Chronicles which goes in the even more depth about the origin of American Chinese cuisine

889
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,624
Believe me throw away deeper depths to explore

890
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,904
Really fun read

00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:24,160
Actually if I'm being honest

932
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:26,208
I'm one of the main guy to know how to do that

00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:30,560
A few days ago Wesley Stern

934
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:36,960
After that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop was found dead in my private gym

935
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:40,544
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

936
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,896
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

937
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:45,920
Now

938
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:48,224
I need to clear my name

939
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:53,600
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes

940
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:54,368
To find them

941
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:02,560
