Every game from rock-paper-scissors

31
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:41,888
I like to think of game design as a design discipline that is sort of shoulder-to-shoulder with other design

32
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,680
Find Fields like graphic design

33
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,960
Where architecture

34
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:46,496

I'm actually a professor

38
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,664
Game design

39
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:54,688
If you can believe that

40
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:57,760
The raw materials that game designers work with

41
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,832
What game designers do

42
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:03,136
In essence is

43
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,928
Create the rules of the game

44
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:08,000
But when players enter into the system of the game

45
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,536
And decide to

46
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:12,352
Follow the rules what results is play

47
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:14,144
And play as the opposite of rules

48
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,960
Rules are fixed and rigid

49
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:17,984
And logical

50
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,288
Play is improvisational

51
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:22,080
And creative and spontaneous

52
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:24,128
And that's such an amazing

53
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,200
Weird little Paradox of games

54
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:30,784
The goal of good game design is what Eric calls

55
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,880
Meaningful play and it's sort of a shorthand for

56
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:37,184
Making sure that

57
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,720
You're taking care of your players

58
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:43,072
Ensuring that players stay engaged and their actions have consequences

59
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,632
Oh that makes sense

60
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,912
That's Blake asking

63
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:56,128
But there's one game it's a really popular one and when I play it I don't feel taken care of as a player

64
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,920
I feel bored I feel trapped

65
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,712
I feel like it's never going to end

I've got the money you got the money I got the money you got some money

68
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,768
You are race car for a hat

69
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,816
Iron on Scottie dog

70
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:20,960
You're circling around and around the board

71
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,240
Passing go

72
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,264

Having to pay when you land on someone else's property

75
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:28,640
Building houses

76
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,176
How's it go again

77
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:30,944
Circling

78
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,712
Again

79
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,992
No

80
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,832
That's usually the critique of an APA

81
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:39,392
That it's very very slow

82
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,672
And long

83
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,440
And

84
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:48,096
It ends up being this very gradual slog where one-player gradually survive

85
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:51,680
As the others as you know everyone is Bleed It Out for money from each other

86
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,448

92
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:08,832
I got to look at her little

93
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:11,904
Okay

94
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,952

99
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:21,631
That's mine

100
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,447
Monopoly can be slow

101
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,471
The losses

Best Louis CK

103
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,543
Can be dark

104
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:29,823
And yet

105
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:32,127
The game is incredibly popular

106
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:34,431
It breaks all of these

107
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,455
Classic

108
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,223
Rules

109
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,759
A good design

110
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,551
But in very interesting ways

111
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,343
When Monopoly was created

112
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:44,671
It wasn't supposed to teach children to be ruthless capitalist

113
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:45,951
In fact

114
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,975
It was just the

115
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,767
It became

116
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,071
The embodiment of everything

117
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,631
That it originally set out to critique

118
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:54,911
And I think that's

119
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:58,751
Maybe part of the fascination of Monopoly may be buried

120
00:04:59,007 --> 00:04:59,775
Inside

121
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:03,103
This capitalist fantasy are somehow this seeds

122
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:03,871
Of its

123
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:04,639
Opposite

124
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,175
Hidden there somewhere

125
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,455
Within the design

126
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:10,271
The game we call Monopoly goes back to the Gilded Age

127
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,575
The time of great prosperity in America

128
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:14,367
At least for the carnegies in the rock

129
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,135
Rockefellers

130
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,415
The rest of the country

131
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,695
Was not doing so well

132
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,743
Income inequality was growing

133
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,047
An economist named Henry George

134
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,327
Thought he had a solution

135
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:29,727
Henry George proposed a single tax Theory which would completely up and the American capitalist system

136
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:33,055
Dumb as we know it land ownership would be abolished

137
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:39,455
Instead all land would be public property individual

138
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:44,319
Tax in this industry would create an economy where wealth is distributed more fairly

139
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:48,159
The theory is much more complicated than that but that's all you going to get from me

140
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:49,951
Planet Money yourself

141
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,023
The single tax Theory gain a lot of

142
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:53,791
Followers

143
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,071
Including one woman

144
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,351
Name Lizzie McGee

145
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,631
Lizzie McGuire

146
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,911
A woman

147
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,679
Who

148
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,471
I consider you very before

149
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,519
That's Mary Palin

150
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,055
Author of The monopolist

151
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,591
Obsession Fury

152
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:09,151
And the Scandal behind the world's favorite board game

153
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,455
The story that starts with Lizzie McGuire

154
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:15,039
Willie McGee decided to spread the word about single tax Theory

155
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:18,367
In 1904 she patented a board game that she called

156
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,647
The landlord's game

157
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:22,207
Landlords at the time are considered to be bad people

158
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:27,583
He took a white square board labeled one corner go to jail another one she labeled public park

159
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:31,167
The rest of it was rammed with rectangular spaces that players can rent

160
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,191
4 by

161
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,983
No colors no graphics

162
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,799
Just black rectangles and writing on a whiteboard

163
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:42,943
Players roll dice and circled the board buying up properties and railroads collecting money and paying rent

164
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:45,247
Players who ran out of money were sent

165
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,015
The Pour House

166
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,319
Players who trespass on land

167
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,599
Were sent to jail

168
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,879
And she created to rule

169
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:51,903
Monopolist

170
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:52,671
Real fat

171
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,439
And then

172
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:59,327
Botox ruleset if you played with a single tax rules when one player develops property everyone benefit

173
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:04,191
But in the monopolist rules the goal was to create monopolies and crushing

174
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:06,495
The Hope was you play with both sets of rules

175
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,031
See the differences

176
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,847
And come away totally sold on the single tax Theory

177
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,639
The morphe eye slay

178
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,919
Clearly has taken off IRA

179
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,759
Of course everyone preferred the monopolist ruleset

180
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:20,319
Because in a board game

181
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,087
Evil

182
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,111
Is fun

183
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:27,999
And the landlord's game at a greater capacity for evil than most board games at the time

184
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:33,119
If you look at games that are like late very end of 19th century early 20th century games

185
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,167
There's not a lot of depth

186
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:41,311
They're mostly games where you're just kind of moving characters along a track rolling a die

187
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,335
And

188
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:44,383
I think in that context

189
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,919
The landlord's game

190
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:50,527
Probably stuck out if something really interesting we're different and innovative

191
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,831
The landlord's game made its way around the Northeast

192
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:55,391
College campuses and activist circles

193
00:07:55,647 --> 00:08:01,791
Folk variations organically popped up in different cities and properties on the board would be named after real streets in

194
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:08,191
Locations and around the time of the depression a man named Charles Darrow stumbled upon a version of the landlord's game it was

195
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:11,263
Made in a Quaker community in Atlantic City New Jersey

196
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:15,615
Future locations like Marvin Gardens and Vermont Avenue and the boardwalk

197
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:22,271
Daryl basically now the Quaker version not the landlord's game and started to tweak it into a board game that he would sell

198
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,039
Tell himself

199
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,319
He called it

200
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,343
Monopoly

201
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:26,879
Gyro

202
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:30,463
My reporting has yielded that he was in fact unemployed at the time

203
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,255
He was in fact living in

204
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:37,119
And this game made him enormously successful

205
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:42,239
Daryl made one game a day by hand he sold them out of his home for $4 a piece

206
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,031
Do use bright cheap paint

207
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:46,847
Any misspelled a few of the locations in Atlantic City

208
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:47,871
And yes

209
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,151
He totally stole

210
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:49,919
The concept

211
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:56,063
The look of Gerald's Game was pretty much the landlord's game but Darrow improve the graphics and added some color

212
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,343
Does it kind of graphic

213
00:08:57,599 --> 00:09:00,159
Clarity to Monopoly that's really satisfying

214
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,207
And the game started selling like hot

215
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:06,303
Maybe because it was really fun to handle all of that fake money

216
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,583
Especially during the Depression

217
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:12,191
And then Monopoly attracts the attention of a family-owned company called

218
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:12,959
Parker brother

219
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,751
They buy the Darrow game

220
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,287
Amanda buys leftover stock

221
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,311
It seems affirm

222
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,335
On the brink of Destruction

223
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:23,199
But Parker Brothers wasn't pleased when they learned adero had not actually invented Monopoly

224
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:27,807
So they start to stamp out all the different versions of Lizzie maggie's game

225
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:32,159
And finally they buy her patently McGee as best as we know about $500

226
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,439
Recruiting

227
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,975
You know the landlord's game which is

228
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:35,743
I consider

229
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,023
Foundation of Monopoly

230
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:43,423
Monopoly then becomes the sole property of Parker Brothers and four years Parker Brothers perpetuates the myth that.

231
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,983
Cheryl just invented the game out of whole cloth

232
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:49,055
Monopoly made a lot of money for Parker Brothers

233
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:55,455
Eventually got acquired by Hasbro and of course today Monopoly is everywhere there are hundreds of variations on the

234
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,503
International competitions

235
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,783
That McDonald's promotion

236
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:03,391
And all kinds of shirts and mugs and neckties printed with Monopoly graphics

237
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,695
But just because people buy it

238
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,719
Doesn't mean

239
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,487
They play at

240
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:11,071
I think the people by Monopoly not necessarily to play to the Gris game of because

241
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:12,607
It's Monopoly

242
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,143
Something you have in your closet

243
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,703
Something you should have to me monopoli feels like

244
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,727
A cheesy

245
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:21,311
Christmas album like you know Bing Crosby or something where

246
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:27,711
It's not something that you would normally listen to but it's kind of something that you might drag out in an ironic way

247
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:31,551
Way or in a nostalgic way

248
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,575
Feeds itself

249
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,599
Then you have

250
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,135
Parents with kids

251
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:39,231
That are getting nostalgic about the games that they played

252
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:42,815
And they want to introduce those games to their children and play them again

253
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:46,143
In other words monopolies and popular because it's a great game

254
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:49,471
It's only popular now because it was popular then

255
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,287
And we don't even play by the real rules

256
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,567
Will nobody plays right

257
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,335
To begin with

258
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,359
How many people died

259
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,639
Really rad the ruleset that

260
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:04,319
For example the way most people play if you land on an available property that you don't want to buy or can't afford

261
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,599
Nothing to happen

262
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,647
Spend that is technically wrong

263
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:12,511
According the directions if you land on an available property that you don't want or can't afford

264
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,791
It gets auctioned off

265
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,607
This could make the game way more exciting

266
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,655
Though not necessarily fast

267
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:22,751
You can imagine every turn it's not like a quick decision do I buy this or not it's like

268
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,031
Let's start an option

269
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:24,799
What do you think

270
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:27,103
But let's auction this and who's going to be at higher in

271
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:29,151
So it drives out the game

272
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:33,247
But Eric is reluctant to accuse anyone of playing Monopoly wrong

273
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,551
The way we play Monopoly

274
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:40,159
Even all the cheating that happens Monopoly is notoriously people cheating and hiding money and

275
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,695
Taking money from the bank and

276
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:46,303
And things like that that I mean that is Monopoly right Monopoly is not just a set of

277
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,839
Monopoly is

278
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,631
All of the cultural meaning

279
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,423
And all the ways that we play it

280
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:54,495
And all of the ways that we that we use and misuse the game

281
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:58,079
And this is why some game designers defend Monopoly

282
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,639
The game designer Richard Garfield

283
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:03,455
He's a brilliant game designer he invented

284
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:06,015
Collectible card games with magic the Gathering

285
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,063
I've heard him defend Monopoly

286
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,343
And say

287
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,135
There's some things about monopolies

288
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:16,255
They're actually kind of interesting convention and

289
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,279
Came back

290
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:23,679
And my son told me that he has played Monopoly for the first time

291
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,471
That's the legend himself

292
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,239
Richard Garfield

293
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,519
That's great

294
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,287
How many times

295
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,567
You playing

296
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,639
You look amazing

297
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:35,199
You don't win monopoly you just playing

298
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:38,271
They're not as much about the rank of the end

299
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,295
If you're having fun

300
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,087
During the process of play

301
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,623
A lot of kids at the game

302
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:43,903
So for kids

303
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:50,303
Meaningful play in Monopoly comes when the game is treated less like playing chess and more like play

304
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,071
Clean house

305
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:56,703
Collecting properties a good thing getting money is a good thing being the Scottie dogs a good thing

306
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,263
And not going to jail is a good thing

307
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,311
But there's not necessarily

308
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,847
To it always trust

309
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:06,431
You're following rules making decisions and accumulating

310
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,735
Prometheus was a

311
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,015
Total revelation

312
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:13,343
I think there may be something to that but I have to say

313
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:16,671
I played Monopoly for the first time with my boys recently and they were

314
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,463
Totally in It to Win It

315
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,767
Carver Crush.

316
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,303
And when we went bankrupt

317
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:25,119
He would continue to give us a little bit some money

318
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:29,215
Just so we would stay in the game and he could crush us all over again

319
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:33,823
He was exactly the kind of capitalists that lives in Magee was trying to warn us about

320
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,615
And he loved it

321
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,687
My favorite part of Monopoly is

322
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,247
Taking money from my brother my name is

323
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,295
Staybridge Hotel

324
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,623
I really like annoying my brother

325
00:13:54,303 --> 00:14:00,447

When was Morgan Dewey as my favorite the race car

328
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:15,295
Eric Zimmerman co-wrote a handbook on game design called rules of play

329
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:21,951
In it he and Katie sale until you pretty much everything you need to design a good game and you can easily

330
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:24,511
You take those tools to design a good anything

340

341

It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake

350
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:32,351
Human and adding and some thoughtful sound

351
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:35,167
Makes for a much more natural experience

352
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,215
