Goethe said that architecture is Frozen music

30
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,928
That's lovely

31
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:09,280
Of course that was before audio recording so now for the most part

32
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,304
Music

33
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,584
Is frozen Muse

34
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:19,008
It's only very recently in the history of music that we've been able to freeze music into an object

35
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:22,848
In my life the form of the subject matter to lie

36
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:26,432
One spot vinyl albums and cassette tapes

37
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:30,016
And there were two first songs per album side a

38
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:32,576
Inside B

39
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,624
The energy of a first song

40
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,928
Made it stand apart from the other songs

41
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,208
At least my head

42
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:43,328
Then the CD came along and eliminated side B and there was only one first song

43
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,656
And the actual number of the track that you can see

44
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:49,216
Prominently displayed on the CD player URI

45
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,776
That became my index for sorting songs

46
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:56,640
An MP3 is jumbled my sense of track order in albums begin to feel more like

47
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:00,224
A loose grouping of individual pieces rather than a conceptual Hall

48
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,088
I can do this all day and you're welcome to try man let's just let's totally has the Sound website

49
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,624
But my point is this

50
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:09,696
When it comes to music the form of the thing

51
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,464
Matters

52
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:11,744
But no effect

53
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,280
Has-been is world-changing

54
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,816
As the original innovation

55
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:17,888
Freezing music in time onto a recording

56
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:21,728
Or a single version of a song a single performance of a song

57
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:22,752
Became

58
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,032
The song

59
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:28,384
This inherently mutable method of communication

60
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,176
Was fundamentally changed

61
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,224
Songs

62
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,064
Astonishing things and I also don't think most people really

63
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:39,136
Even know what they are

64
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:42,720
That's the songwriter composer and producer Jon Brion

65
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,256
No I didn't talk to John Bryan

66
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,792
But I know people who did

67
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:50,912
Jim derogatis and Greg caught are the hotel radio program I'm a huge fan of called sound opinions

68
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,960
It's a rock and roll talk show

69
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:53,984
And if certain

70
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,800
Nietzsche snarky corners of the internet

71
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,872
Have darkened or concept of Music journalism

72
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,664
Sound opinions

73
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,224
Is your beacon of light my friend

74
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,760
Anyway

75
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:10,368
John Brian came to WBEZ in Chicago to talk to sound opinions in 2006

76
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,648
And at the time

77
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,184
Brian Tedesco produced

78
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,744
Kanye West album late registration

79
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,839
He was also already well known as a film composer of a lot of really great movies

80
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,631
Mini by Paul Thomas Anderson

81
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:27,775
I heard the show broadcast on WBEZ while I was sitting in my car in a parking lot of a Taqueria in Logan Square

82
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:31,103
And I thought about this section of their interview about

83
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:33,407
Songs versus performances

84
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:34,687
At least

85
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,223
Once a month

86
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:36,991
Since then

87
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,783
For 6 years

88
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:43,391
But only recently did it on me that this is a perfect 99percentinvisible story

89
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,927
So here it is

90
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:47,743
John Brian sound opinions in 2006

91
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,559
I distinguish between

92
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:55,167
Look for lack of better terms I call songs and performance piece

93
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:56,959
And

94
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:02,079
What most people like are specific performance as we've grown up in an era of

95
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:02,847
Recording

96
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,895
Had you know the very thing

97
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,431
One of the very things I love

98
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,711
Recording has

99
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:12,575
Killed people's ability to hear songs purely as

100
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,343
Core change

101
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:14,879
Melody and

102
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,671
It's a very

103
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:20,511
Strange and beautiful art form cuz when it's right do you know it

104
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,535
But

105
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,583
What we have sort of Lost

106
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:24,607
Is

107
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:27,167
I don't know the best example I can give would be

108
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:27,935
Led Zeppelin

109
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:32,799
Those things are the ultimate performance pieces and I'm a big

110
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:36,127
I think they're just absolutely astonishing

111
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,199
And the sort of Dynamics they had

112
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,735
Sorely lacking in

113
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,503
Music today

114
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,551
Record making is

115
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,319
Great

116
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:48,159
The true band in the sense that you really could

117
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,951
Tell who the individuals

118
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,023
Remarkable thing

119
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,399
Consider most of those things

120
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,191
Songs

121
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:03,263
And the way I can sort of prove my point is

122
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:10,175
Have you ever listen to anybody else play Led Zeppelin song and got all that was a great satisfying experience

123
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:13,503
What people like is that

124
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,551
Specific guitar sound

125
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,831
Specific performance

126
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,111
In concert with that

127
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,903
Specific drum sound with that

128
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,439
Pacific drummer playing that song

129
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,463
Pacific Park

130
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:28,351
And it's beautiful it's a beautiful thing they're all different types of art and creative expression

131
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,143
However

132
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,447
If I were to sit and go here

133
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:43,199
And I can play

134
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:45,247
Ghetto 30 others that

135
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,271
That's the thing

136
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:50,623
You know I know it could sound like a snobbishness it's not

137
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,671
I love these records

138
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,463
They're great

139
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,999
However it is

140
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,815
There's a difference between

141
00:06:59,071 --> 00:06:59,583
Is that

142
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,119
Anna song

143
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,911
Say a Gershwin song

144
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:06,751
You could actually play in the style of Led Zeppelin and have it completely

145
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,823
Satisfying experience all the time

146
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:16,223
But when you start playing Zeppelin songs in the style of

147
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,551
1920s music it suddenly it's laid bare that it's like

148
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:24,159
Oh no it was about those people in those people were in a room that it was

149
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,207
I was great and I love it

150
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,743
But I considered a performance

151
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,023
When I consider

152
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:31,583
A lot of rock the people listen to be

153
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:32,607
Performance

154
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:38,751
Necessarily song so you know I heard you had the time you work here recently and there's a songwriter

155
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,799
Comes into the band and goes

156
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:43,615
Here's the thing I've got and then they you know

157
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:48,479
Brock with holy hardness and and all the greatness they've got with them getting a room

158
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:52,575
I mean that's part of what makes a band like Radiohead

159
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,367
Stand out at second

160
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,415
Record came out we all collectively went

161
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:57,951
Oh my God

162
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:04,351
Actual songs in this guy's an amazing singer

163
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,375
Exactly what I mean

164
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,399
Okay here

165
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,447
Google Music

166
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,567
Just go

167
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,591
Cool was

168
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,127
Punk rock

169
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:18,687
Popular he had it factor for days

170
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:19,967
But

171
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:21,759
If

172
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:27,391
You take the average Punk rocks on it is that Same Led Zeppelin Melody

173
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,351
Thousand

174
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:42,751
Punk songs there's a big difference between that

175
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:49,151
I mean

176
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:53,503
Sit here on grand piano playing unaffected version and we can all go oh my God

177
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:57,599
Anytime

178
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,903
Play that Melody over those core change

179
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,207
Lithium is no

180
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:09,375
Different it's in the same realm is being able to go in

181
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:13,983
Where

182
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:14,751
You know

183
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:18,335
Most people I remember exactly where I was

184
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,615
