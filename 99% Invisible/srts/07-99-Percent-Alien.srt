At least that's what Mary Roach.

30
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,056

Conformarse the Curious sign

33
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:55,456
In the beginning the designers of the space habitation module

34
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:57,248
The box where the crew live

35
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,528
Yep that's the one

36
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:04,928
They stuck with what they knew that spending time up there or in zero gravity people just intuitively designed it

37
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,720
Like a room on Earth there would be

38
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:13,120
Control panel and then there were little chairs ever seats that you would sit and it was makes no sense and you can't sit you would have to

39
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,144
Strap yourself

40
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,448
Do the seat the reason is simple

41
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:21,056
We are humans when we have a room we have a floor-to-ceiling we have chairs and tables and that's

42
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:24,640
What we do and that's how it was designed but getting stuff into space is expense

43
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,432
There's always a grand effort

44
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,712
To minimize weight

45
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:28,736
How to create the most

46
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,016
Efficient space pause

47
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,552
And all those human

48
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,088
Came under scrutiny

49
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,184
So then they went to the Other Extreme get rid of it all because in space

50
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,560
The walls becoming your table if you have a table and you put something down on the table the table

51
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:45,632
Doesn't act like a table it doesn't hold it they just floats off

52
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:48,704
A drawer isn't very good you open the door everything flies out

53
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,520
So what you have is pieces of elastic

54
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:55,360
On the wall like you know you pulled the elastic back and you stick your clipboard in there

55
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:57,920
And everything has been savell curse of the wall

56
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:58,944
Become

57
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,712
The table

58
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:01,504
You have a very very

59
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,272
Box

60
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,296
That you're living in

61
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,320
So that became the game

62
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:05,856
No furniture in a ceiling

63
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:06,624
4

64
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,392
Perfect

65
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,672
Utilitarian box

66
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:09,952
For the astronaut

67
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,488
Floats freely and uses

68
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,256
Is every surf

69
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,560
The great thing about zero gravity

70
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:16,096
We can use the ceiling week

71
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:19,168
You can put the bathroom on the wall but this is where the human

72
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:22,496
The capsule became over design

73
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,264
For the 02

74
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,288
Condition

75
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,056
And it became

76
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,080
Two alien

77
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,360
The humanity

78
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,128
Was lost

79
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,920
The one thing

80
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:33,760
That the crews decided that they were not okay with we're getting rid of it

81
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,296
Kitchen table like a dining table

82
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,064
My place

83
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,368
To gather around at the end of the day you don't have

84
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,184
Sit down or pretend to sit down

85
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,256
And talk about what you did over the day eat

86
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,536
Show me where humans

87
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,584
Human beings want to sit around the table

88
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,400
I'm gossip and talk about stuff and eat and drink

89
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,448
And the table came back

90
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:56,544
Small table and there's little pieces of elastic and velcro and they all

91
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,312
Hover

92
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,336
Around the table

93
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,616
So despite that

94
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:02,176
Horrifying scene in Alien

95
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,760
Table and a spacecraft make

96
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,296
Extra happy astronaut

97
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:11,648
Turn the living quarters there's now an effort to use Earth orientation

98
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,440
The bottom part is

99
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:18,559
The floor and ceiling above walls or walls the way that the Q the man is like that the lighting will be up above

100
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:23,935
It was always so that you know what the accepted orientation is

101
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,727
Can helps in the constant War

102
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:26,495
Emotions

103
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,055
And having everyone in the same orientation

104
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,335
It also helps the crew talk

105
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:34,431
I interviewed this astronaut Lee Morin about how

106
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:36,735
Troubling it is to try to have a conversation

107
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,551
With somebody who is upside down when you were right side up

108
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,599
Sort of lip reading all the time without

109
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,879
Realizing it and he said

110
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:45,439
When you go beyond a 45 degree angle

111
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:47,743
The other person starts to have trouble reading your lips

112
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,303
Is considered impolite to carry on a conversation

113
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,351
With someone when you are upside down

114
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,655
When you are differently oriented

115
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:59,263
I love these examples in the fundamentals of Otherworldly

116
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,543
Space design because

117
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:05,151
If you were to recreate that exercise right here and then gravity-based habitat in start

118
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:05,919
Scratch

119
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,967
What would you redesign

120
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:08,991
Wheatley

121
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:10,783
Wood everything

122
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,319
Simply evolve back

123
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,599
To the way it is now

124
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,135
Would US currency

125
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,159
Still beating

126
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,439
Lockable uniform

127
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,719
In color inside

128
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:19,999
Could we get rid of

129
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:20,767
Cars

130
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,303
Could we

131
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,327
Finally make the

132
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,119
Steampunk hers happy

133
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,167
I Have A Sky Full of Derek

134
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:31,775
My guess is that even the poorly designed and inefficient

135
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,055
Text would make a comeback

136
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,847
Because it might just be

137
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,383
Your dining room table

138
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,199
Crappy wobbly

139
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:40,991
Square honey I will

140
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,015
Fix it soon

141
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:44,575
Promise it might be that dining room table

142
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,111
It makes you

143
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,391

151
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:10,687
Series from Bellow radio TV show the truth

152
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:14,783
The body genius is a Dark comic mystery that whines through a

153
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,831
Treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

154
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,367
We're looking the part

155
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,903
Might cost you your life

156
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:26,303
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

157
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:29,375
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

158
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:33,727
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like a dad

159
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,335
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

160
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:42,687
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that kind of

161
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:50,111
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

162
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:53,439
Was found dead in my private gym

163
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:56,767
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

164
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:01,119
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

165
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:04,447
Now I need to clear my name

166
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:09,823
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes

167
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,847
