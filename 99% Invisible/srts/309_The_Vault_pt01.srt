This is 99% invisible I'm Roman Mars in the Arctic

26
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:37,792
Ocean there's a cluster of islands called svalbard the island are technically part of Norway but they're much far

27
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:44,192
Farther north than the mainland like way way up towards the North Pole the landscape is icy and mount

28
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:50,592
Turn on one of the icy mountains of svalbard is a very curious thing of all

29
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:56,992
The entrance to the Vault itself is striking a man-made obelisks sticking out of a glue

30
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,784
Glacier on top of a mountain

31
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,184
Yes the Vault itself is inside a mountain that's been brought Johnson from

32
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:11,584
Podcast endless thread showing which Ben and his co-host Amory sivertson tell stories that they find on Reddit

33
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,888
This week we're featuring one of those stories

34
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:16,192
So I'm going to have this one off to Ben and Emery

35
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:20,288
The story is actually been posted a few times by different redditors

36
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,104
But it's about people who aren't necessarily Reddit

37
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:25,408
Olga Marie Hager

38
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,712
Do you think Marie haga is already there been

39
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,040
I don't know but she definitely knows how to talk

40
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:31,808
Two interviewers

41
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,648
Do you want very short answers medium answers

42
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:38,720
Marie haga is a former Norwegian diplomat

43
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:43,072
He was a member of parliament in that country former minister of energy

44
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:46,912
Her current job is to manage one of the world's most important vault

45
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:49,216
Maybe the most important vault

46
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:49,984
In the world

47
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:56,384
Let me take you on a little tour

48
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,200
You open these metal doors

49
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:02,016
It's like something out of a science fiction novel

50
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:08,416
And you walk 130 meters into the mountains tunnel

51
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:10,720
The walls are covered in snow and ice

52
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:13,024
They look like they're made out of snow and ice

53
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,072
There's this big chamber

54
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:18,656
That I normally called the cathedral

55
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,960
It's painted white

56
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:23,776
It's not the ice crystals are

57
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,848
In this big room UC City doors

58
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,640
These doors

59
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:32,224
Lead into 3 volts

60
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,272
Vaults within the vault

61
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,808
What's inside

62
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,600
Precious treasure that is

63
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:43,488
Stored on permafrost a reindeer covered islands in the Arctic Ocean by bunch of Norwegians

64
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,584
Behind the iciest vault door at 0Â° Fahrenheit

65
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:51,424
Boxes boxes boxes and boxes of seeds

66
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,032
Seeds

67
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:58,336
Inside of these metal envelopes

68
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,872
500 seeds

69
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:00,896
Per envelope

70
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,200
The seeds are from all over the world

71
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:05,504
And I mean all over the world

72
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:06,784
Every country

73
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,576
It's part of something called the crop

74
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,344
Trust

75
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:13,440
The crop trust is like this massive backup for the planets food crop

76
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:16,512
There's only one back up in this is it

77
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:19,327
And it's all thanks to a Russian guy with a crazy story

78
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,863
Don't worry that's coming

79
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,191
Right now how about a list of seeds in the backup

80
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,215
From Marie Hagen

81
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,519
Whose official title is director

82
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,543
Of the crop Trust

83
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,335
So we are concerned

84
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:33,919
To safeguard the 3000 varieties of coconut

85
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:37,503
So are the four and a half thousand varieties of potatoes

86
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:41,087
The 35000 varieties of corn

87
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:44,415
925 Silver right is a wheat

88
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:47,231
Or the 300,000 varieties of rice

89
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,535
Best to mention some examples

90
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:52,095
There seems to be kind of a Noah's Ark

91
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,119
Aspect

92
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:53,887
2 best

93
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:59,519
That is actually a good description it is kind of a Noah's Ark of seeds

94
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:03,103
And it is mint

95
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,639
At to be

96
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:11,551
Backup if things go wrong around the world and unfortunately things do go wrong around the world

97
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,319
Occasionally

98
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:15,135
Once a decade small bird staff

99
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:17,439
It's supposed to take new seeds into the vault

100
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:21,023
This is going to happen just a few weeks after this episode comes out

101
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,559
On February 26th

102
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,327
2018

103
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:30,239
Marie Hager and her team will disarm the bolts alarm systems turn on the lights to the tunnel in

104
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,007
Into the mountain

105
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:34,335
Unlocking Krieg open the vaults big doors

106
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,615
And put more seeds

107
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,383
Inside

108
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:40,223
Any country that wants to store seeds in the vault can do it

109
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:40,991
For free

110
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,783
Emery says in the vault

111
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,319
There is World Peace

112
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:47,391
South Korea's seeds sit next to North Korea

113
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:50,463
There are seeds from Iraq sitting in the frigid sign

114
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:51,743
Afghanistan

115
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,023
Syria

116
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,583
Seeds from Ukraine sit next to seeds from Russia

117
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:58,399
It's almost like this is the one thing

118
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,423
Whole world can get the

119
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,471
Protecting our food supply

120
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,007
In case of an emergency

121
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,311
Like a big emergency

122
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,359
This single back

123
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:10,687
This planet's worth of crop diversity living in relative

124
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:12,223
Keys under a mountain

125
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:15,551
Spirit of this has its origins in World War II

126
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,855
The global existential crisis

127
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:18,879
Like no other

128
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,839
Svalbard Story start actually not too far away

129
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:28,863
In Russia

130
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:32,191
The guy you could call svalbard seed Vault grandfather

131
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:34,751
Was a man named Nikolai vavilov

132
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:39,615
I don't know what the crop dress my organization would have been without Boblo

133
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,407
He really

134
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:43,967
Explain to the world back in

135
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:45,759
The early nineteen hundreds

136
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:46,783
How

137
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:52,159
Globally are fully interdependent when it comes to the crops

138
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:58,303
The crazy part of Babel of story though is that this man a giant in the world of crop genetics

139
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:01,375
Was thrown in a Russian Gulag for his scientific

140
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,143
Principles

141
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:07,775
In a bunch of is devoted co-workers had to fend off rats in Starvation to protect his life's work

142
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,055
The richest

143
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:11,615
Seed supply the world had ever seen

144
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:12,639
Hidden away

145
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,407
Underground

146
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,943
In its own vault

147
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:17,503
In what is now the city of st. Petersburg

148
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,807
It had a different name

149
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:20,831
Leningrad

150
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,367
And Leningrad

151
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,647
Was Under Siege

152
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,071
Okay

153
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:34,143
You know how people say so-and-so wrote the book on x

154
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:39,519
Well agricultural ecologist ethnobotanist in Franciscan Brother Gary nabhan

155
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:42,591
Wrote the book on a Russian botanist Nikolai vavilov

156
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:47,455
12 ft life was from a very well-educated family

157
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:48,991
In Russia

158
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,599
I think every one of his siblings became a scientist as well

159
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:56,415
The book is called where our food comes from

160
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,207
Retracing Nikolai vavilov

161
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,743
Cuesta in the famine

162
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:06,143
In the circle of life Gary's book shows that this Russian botanist in geneticist story really begins in fan

163
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,935
Hammond just like it ends

164
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:11,007
Grew up in a. Where

165
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:16,895
Russia and Eastern Europe had suffered one famine after another due to

166
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,687
Inclement weather

167
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,967
Causing crop failure

168
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,783
These famines that she grew up with

169
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,807
How serious were they

170
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:28,927
They were of Epic Proportions from the 18:6

171
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,463
These are night there were

172
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:31,999
6

173
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:36,607
Major famines who killed over a half million people in Eastern Europe in

174
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:40,703
And Russia and so he grew up in the smell you

175
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:41,727
Tolstoy

176
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:49,151
Babylon's upbringing around these horrendous crop failures and famines leads him to learn a ton about plants

177
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:49,919
In botany

178
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:56,063
And as he is doing his work as a botanist in the 1920s he starts to get into this idea that

179
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,111
Collecting the plants or the seeds

180
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:01,951
Preserving an understanding crop diversity around the world

181
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,255
Might help fight off crop failures

182
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,303
Because he might be able to breathe

183
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:10,143
And find certain strains that could resist bad weather and dust

184
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:10,911
Shannon

185
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:15,263
There were people with their eyes on the same prize earlier on in

186
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,799
History

187
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,847
Thomas Jefferson for example

188
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:19,615
Collected

189
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:23,711
Are seeds brought back cuttings or plants to the Americas

190
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:26,783
Elolf was the first one who had

191
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,855
The education in what we would call

192
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,415
Evolutionary biology

193
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,975
How plants adapt to different climates

194
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:35,743
Conditions

195
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,279
He answered of this

196
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,327
Humanitarian

197
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,119
Set of values

198
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:44,191
That underscored the way he did science and

199
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,215
Certify

200
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:48,799
Remarkable way I mean he really was a superstar

201
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:52,383
Up there with Charles Darwin and other people that we could mention

202
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:01,343
So we've been talking about Nikolai Babolat

203
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,647
Cool by many measures is one of the Worlds

204
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,671
Seminole plant

205
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,439
Geneticist

206
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:10,047
But also a scientist who has a very pointed reason for his work

207
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,119
She doesn't want any Russian really any human

208
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,423
To die again because of fan

209
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:21,823
Overtime this remarkable humanitarian way of doing science games Babel off a lot of follower

210
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,871
Both in terms of the science

211
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,407
And his altruism

212
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,967
In over his career vasilov does something that's

213
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:28,991
Pretty incredible

214
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:35,135
He and his team of scientists together hundreds of thousands of different kinds of seeds from 64

215
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,975
It takes over 100 different expeditions to do that

216
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:42,559
He's like Russia's Indiana Jones of seed collection

217
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,607
And he's super charismatic

218
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,911
He's handsome he's good at raising money

219
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,447
But he's not without his

220
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,215
Detractors

221
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,519
Everybody famous has some hater

222
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,567
In Babylon has got a problem

223
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,127
Eye problems name is trofim lysenko

224
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,943
I think I'll start out as a student of Babylon

225
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,735
Babbel app encourages him

226
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:04,063
But then listen kid gets into this weird pseudoscience

227
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,367
PepperJax the idea of genetics

228
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:10,719
And he becomes this like Auntie science-based agriculture guy

229
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:16,607
Which is little odd because he also becomes the head of the Academy of Agricultural Science

230
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,911
Wisynco doesn't like Babylon

231
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,191
Their Rivals now

232
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,727
And lysenko Gainesville

233
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,519
The ear and the favor

234
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,543
Stalin

235
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,847
It's August of 1940

236
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,127
You can almost guess

237
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,151
What happens next

238
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:31,967
Davila

239
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:36,063
Without on another collecting expedition in the caucasus

240
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:41,951
Found what he believed was a new subspecies of wild wheat that could be very effective because it was so

241
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,231
Drought tolerant

242
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:46,559
And as he was coming back to his vehicle

243
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:49,375
Several black

244
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:52,447
Unmarked cars from the KGB or its

245
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,519
Its predecessor showed up and without

246
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,311
Talking to any of the other

247
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,871
Doesn't scientist on the expedition

248
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:02,431
Bevilacqua scuttled away

249
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,711
And disappeared

250
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,759
From public site

251
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:11,135
So Babylon is thrown into a prison in Leningrad AKA Saint Peter

252
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,439
His family doesn't know where he is

253
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:15,487
His colleagues don't know where he is

254
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,023
But they have a mission

255
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,303
Babel ops mission

256
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:21,119
Preserving and studying the world's food

257
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,935
Killing off hunger forever

258
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,239
His mission has a headquarters

259
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:29,823
It's this building at 44 person Street in St Petersburg

260
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,615
Kiss staff

261
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:33,919
Sort of

262
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:40,575
Came together they adored this man and said we can't let anything happen to this collection we don't know what's going to happen

263
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:41,855
And so they put

264
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,647
325 of there

265
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,415
Staffers

266
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,719
On duty 24 hours a day

267
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,023
And sealed off 18 rooms

268
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,327
Because there was another threat

269
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,607
About to hit

270
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,887
Saint Petersburg

271
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,215
The siege of Leningrad starts in 1941

272
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:00,543
A year after Babolat disappears into a ghoul

273
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:04,639
This prison is a stone's throw from his family home

274
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:08,735
Battle Ops family members passed by without even knowing he is right there

275
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:09,503
In prison

276
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:12,063
The siege of Leningrad is unique

277
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,087
And that it last

278
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:15,135
Almost the entire War

279
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,927
Nearly 900 days

280
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:21,279
The city is cut off on the North By The Finnish Army in the South by the German

281
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:26,655
And at the time it is one of the most destructive attacks on a major city in known history

282
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,191
Constant bombing

283
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,471
Lack of food and water

284
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:32,799
People actually rush into the craters after bombs drop

285
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:35,103
Because water gathers in the crater

286
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:37,151
That's how they get their water

287
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:40,735
And through all of this people are starving to death in letting go

288
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,015
Everyone

289
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:44,319
Russian soldiers government officials

290
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:47,903
Also the families of the scientists who are protecting

291
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,719
Secretly protecting this massive seed bank

292
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:56,095
They're putting the location of the bank in the fact that it is full of food

293
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:58,143
Seeds rice legumes

294
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,935
In the metaphorical vault

295
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:00,959
They're not

296
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,983
Telling anyone

297
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,031
And they are really freaking out by the way

298
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:09,407
Because Hitler is rumored to be really focused on capturing the seeds in this feedback

299
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,711
As part of his world domination f

300
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:15,039
So it really is a high-stakes mission

301
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:19,135
So think of it you're starving to death your family is

302
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,695
You up for staying in this

303
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:22,975
Very

304
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,279
Powerful

305
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,815
Lee position

306
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,863
Well guarded building

307
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:35,007
And your weight is going down your immune system is going down

308
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,079
And it's one of the curators said

309
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:42,687
When someone asked him was it hard for all of you to try to keep

310
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,247
Defending the seeds

311
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:48,575
When you could have eaten them to improve your own personal health

312
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,111
She said

313
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:53,951
Well it was hard to wake up in the morning it was hard to get on our feet

314
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:57,535
Because we are so weak it was hard to get our clothes on

315
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,327
Because it was cold

316
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,119
But it was not hard.

317
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:01,887
Protect

318
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,911
Proceeds

319
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:05,215
Tell me the story about the

320
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,239
The p

321
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,775
Collection curator

322
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:10,847
Alexander skilken

323
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,639
Took care of peas

324
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,431
Peanuts and other legumes

325
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,735
And he was one of the ones

326
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,015
Who died in the

327
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:21,343
The first year of the effects sofa

328
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,135
Starvation with

329
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:27,231
Seed envelopes in his hand

330
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:31,327
We we know that other people

331
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:32,863
Died of

332
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:35,679
Diseases carried by rats

333
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,959
They were trying to

334
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:39,007
Exempt from eating the seeds

335
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,567
Erase collector name

336
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,103
Dmitry Ivanov

337
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,639
She died within

338
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:47,967
Just a few feet of 1000 packets of rice

339
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,271
It just by boiling up water

340
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:52,575
Cooking the rice could have saved his life

341
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:00,767
Overall

342
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,047
12 scientists

343
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:04,351
Died protecting Babolat slice work

344
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,887
During the siege of Leningrad

345
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,935
Most of starvation

346
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:14,591
As for Babble Of after a year-and-a-half of eating frozen cabbage and Moby Flower he also.

347
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,615
Died of starvation

348
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,919
He never made it out of the gulag

349
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,223
But the seeds survive

350
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,503
And so did the mission

351
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,111
The svalbard seed vault in Norway is a direct descendant of a Velociraptor

352
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:30,975
And that building in St Petersburg is now the Babel of Institute of plant

353
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:31,743
Industry

354
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:39,679
You visited the seed vault in St Petersburg few years back

355
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,007
What was that like for you

356
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,847
In my years of doing

357
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,383
Science

358
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,663
I've only

359
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:50,943
Wet

360
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,223
Twice

361
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,783
And one Swiss

362
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,831
In Hawaii when I saw

363
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,879
15 different endangered

364
00:16:59,135 --> 00:16:59,647
Species

365
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,183
The last individual

366
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:05,023
Of many of those species all sitting on one table

367
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:10,143
Anna nursery and there were none of those species left in the wild

368
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,703
I felt the same way when I saw the wall

369
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,983
A photos

370
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:16,031
Of those 12 scientist

371
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,311
Russian scientist

372
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,847
Who gave up their lives

373
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:19,871
Sago seeds

374
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,151
I

375
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,943
I was Brokenhearted

376
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:25,503
Where did you see in their faces

377
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,087
The best

378
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,135
That any of us

379
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,415
Can hope to be

380
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,695
On behalf

381
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,743
Our fellow creatures

382
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,863
Thanks so much for talking with us

383
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:44,447
Thank you bless you for your good work

384
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,407
So Amory

385
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:55,455
Let's go back to Marie haga forum

386
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:59,807
Whose team of scientists recently opened svalbard seed Vault on that

387
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,599
Frozen island in the Arctic

388
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,903
Ocean so here's a question

389
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,951
If he's Country Store

390
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,743
Seeds are for free

391
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:12,863
Who's playing that song bird electric bill like like who pays for the seed Vault to exist

392
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,399
Great question I asked

393
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,167
To Murrieta

394
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:17,215
Our organization is

395
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,263
First and foremost funded

396
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,287
Bye

397
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,567
Government

398
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:25,919
But increasingly the crop trust is trying to work with the private sector

399
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,967
Ann Marie give me an example

400
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:32,319
We have address developed a conservation strategy

401
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,343
For coffee

402
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:36,671
Coffee happens to be very climate sensitive

403
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:39,999
And that is why we think

404
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:43,583
Badsha the major coffee companies over the world

405
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,375
Who get involved in lava rock

406
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:48,703
And also contribute to finding it

407
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:55,871
I for one am very glad that the organization trying to protect the world's food crops from a doomsday scenario

408
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,919
Is also working on keeping

409
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:58,687
Coffee around

410
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,223
Yeah I think we're going to need

411
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:01,759
Coffee after the

412
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:04,063
But for Murray of course

413
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,087
It's bigger than coffee

414
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:06,623
You know I

415
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,647
Considerate

416
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,439
A great privilege

417
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:15,071
To work on something so fundamentally important

418
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,143
As safeguarding the diversity of crops

419
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,423
That

420
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,727
Job is really about

421
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,519
Safeguarding the bases

422
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,287
4

423
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,591
Knob and

424
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:29,151
Tomorrow and forever

425
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:39,903
There are other seed banks in the world and our very own Emmett Fitzgerald is going to tell us about one of them

426
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:40,927
God bless

427
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:45,535
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices

428
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,303
We're immersed

429
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,119
In a cluttered World a man-made sound

430
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,143
If

431
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:56,543
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife isn't

432
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:02,175
All hearing that voice technology talk to us

433
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:04,479
It is a creation of Sonic trash

434
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:07,551
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

435
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:11,135
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

436
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,927
To make them more human

437
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:17,023
Turn the living room lights on

438
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:18,815
Okay

439
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,351
Dim the living room lights

440
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,375
50%

441
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,167
Okay

442
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:29,567
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

443
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:32,383
Makes for a much more natural experience

444
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:34,431
Turn the living room lights on

445
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,527
Dim the living room lights to 50%

446
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:47,231
We're presenting two special episodes from 99percentinvisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation about how are sound

447
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:49,023
Landscape is impacting our health

448
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:51,583
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

449
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:54,399
Look for them Friday is May 17th and May 24th

450
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,167
Right here

451
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,703
Npit

452
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:01,055
We need to talk about something

453
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:07,455
Constipation abdominal pain and bloating yourself it's not that bad you take laxatives you modify your diet

454
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:10,271
But thinking about it all the time is frustrating

455
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:16,672
It doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again and you don't know why

456
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,976
Then it may be time to seek help

457
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:25,376
Go to oh my God. Info podcast we can learn more about your symptoms that's oh my God

458
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:27,424
Infowars podcast

459
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,192
Oh my God

460
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:29,984
Fox podcast

461
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:36,128
Okay so we're back with 99 Pi producer Emmett Fitzgerald and he's with us because

462
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:38,944
He was actually looking into doing a story on Babylon

463
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,784
Artio while back and it didn't pan out for a bunch of boring reasons

464
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,600
So when I heard the endless thread version I was like what

465
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,904
Play that one because we love the story

466
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,976
But you actually done some interviews on the subject already

467
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:55,584
Yeah and as I was researching it I found out about this other seat

468
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,680
Back this one is based in Syria and it's run by an organization called a

469
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,448
Carter

470
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:06,080
And that stands for the International Center for agricultural research in dry air

471
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:06,848
Areas

472
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,640
And I actually spoke with

473
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:11,200
Former director of a card at muscamoot Sula

474
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:13,504
My name is Mohamed Salah

475
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:19,904
I'm the former director general of the International Center for agricultural research in dry areas

476
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:24,768
And just like Nikolai vavilov when Mahmood was a young plant scientist

477
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:27,840
She said off on on his own seed collecting Journey

478
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,120
And where did he go

479
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:32,192
So she went through all these Central Asian countries places like

480
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:34,496
Jordan Lebanon Iraq

481
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:37,312
Turkey elected in Afghanistan

482
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,592
In August

483
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:40,384
1974

484
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:43,200
And at that time Afghanistan

485
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:45,248
It was a peaceful country

486
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,040
That was a beautiful country

487
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:52,928
Ubf mountains of pistachio trees in Afghanistan

488
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:58,560
Mahmoud drove all over Afghanistan in this little Jeep looking for in a wild lentils

489
00:22:59,072 --> 00:22:59,584
Chickpeas

490
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:00,608
Pistachios

491
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:01,632
What you're talking about

492
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:07,776
Inspired by Nikki literally following in Babylon footsteps

493
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:08,800
Or at least

494
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:09,824
At least I was trying

495
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,360
Like that time

496
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:13,408
I had the map

497
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:20,064
Very low where did he go so I was trying to follow the routes but rule Afghanistan

498
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,344
Extremely mountainous

499
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:22,624
Too mountainous

500
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,392
For the Jeep

501
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:25,696
Turned out we would love to go

502
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:29,024
Does certain areas without going on a

503
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,072
Back of a horse or a donkey

504
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,608
You know because

505
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,912
Those areas are so narrow

506
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:36,192
Sost

507
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:39,776
But to be honest with you even in 74

508
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:43,360
We could not follow what very low bid

509
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:45,152
In the earlier years

510
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:47,968
And that's why you really admire this man

511
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:50,784
You know he was certainly a remarkable person

512
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:54,112
So what happened to all the seeds that collected

513
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:57,952
So those seeds were the beginning of the year card at collection

514
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:04,608
And a cart of basically works with farmers in dry parts of the world and then one of the ways that they help them is by cancer

515
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:08,704
Serving and also breeding drought-tolerant varieties of different crops

516
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:12,288
Collectible huge variety of C

517
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:14,336
From Farmers all over the Middle East

518
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,104
East and North Africa

519
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,432
They've got one of the world's largest collections of drought tolerant

520
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,456
Including

521
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,992
Thousands of varieties

522
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:23,552
The barley and lentil and fava beans

523
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:27,392
And 4 years this collection was stored in the facility in Aleppo

524
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,160
Syria

525
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:31,232
Which I can see the problem

526
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:37,632
Right and when violence broke out in that country in 2011 the plant scientist

527
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,656
Starting to get worried about the

528
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,752
And so they sent some collective The Collection to other CB

529
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:43,520
Banks around the world

530
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,056
They were creating

531
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:45,824
Duplicate

532
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,128
The Collection you know in order to safeguard

533
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:52,224
All that material and then and then eventually they were forced to it to level up

534
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,528
But we got the seats out

535
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:55,808
Before

536
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:58,880
The staff Polly had to abandon the research station

537
00:24:59,136 --> 00:24:59,904
This is

538
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:04,256
Harry Fowler and he's actually the founder of the svalbard global seed vault which

539
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,792
Suite we heard about in DMs

540
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:06,560
Spread peace

541
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:08,096
And Fowler end up

542
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:10,656
Calling up my mood and an inviting him to

543
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:11,936
Store some of the Carters

544
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,984
Seeds up in up in the Norwegian Arctic

545
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,776
We got them up to svalbard

546
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:21,152
When it became clear that those researchers were not going to be able to go back to their insta

547
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:21,920
Esthetician

548
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:27,552
Leggett re-establish themselves in Morocco and Lebanon date they ask for their

549
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:30,624
There's a collection back so they could re-establish their

550
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,392
Receipt Bank

551
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:35,488
This is actually the first time that anyone had taken seeds back out of the

552
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,512
Svalbard seafall

553
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,536
And they use those

554
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:39,584
Lucy is that Pepin store there in that

555
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:41,120
Tunnel in the mountain

556
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:43,168
To create two new seed banks

557
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:45,728
One in Morocco and one in Lebanon

558
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,568
So it's almost like they had this external backup hard drive their computer

559
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:55,712
At unit something happens to the physical computer you've still got all the data in this case all the seeds with

560
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:57,248
Backed up somewhere else

561
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,272
To start anew

562
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,552
Seed bank somewhere else

563
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:01,856
Yeah yeah that's exactly right that's

564
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:04,160
Analogy that a lot of people use and you know

565
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:08,256
There are seeds in a Carter's collection that you can't find anywhere else

566
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:13,632
So the consequences of not having that back up could be

567
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,656
Catastrophic

568
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:17,472
You know in the past this would likely

569
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,496
This kind of event

570
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:19,264
Would like

571
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,312
Likely have led to Extinction

572
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:24,384
And in this case I think it's pretty clear that

573
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,408
That would be the

574
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:28,224
Extinction of something terribly valuable

575
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,760
2 world agriculture

576
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:32,064
Because you can imagine that drought and Heat

577
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,856
Tolerant varieties of wheat

578
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:34,624
Barley went

579
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,392
Is Chickpea in

580
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:37,440
Weather going to be in high demand and that's

581
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,464
What's the place you got to get

582
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:40,768
Sweetest name to hear a story

583
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:42,304
Of the seed bank

584
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,584
Not just being this

585
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:44,608
Potential

586
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:45,376
To save us

587
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:46,400
Really

588
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:47,680
It was used

589
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:52,032
As it was meant to be to take him seeds and then send them out into the world

590
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,056
To stop

591
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:56,896
What could be a potential Extinction of a species it's kind of stomach

592
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:57,920
What an action

593
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:03,808
It's interesting as people refer to it often as the Doomsday vaults and there's this kind of

594
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,648
This kind of expectation that it's it's just waiting around for the Apocalypse

595
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:09,696
Casinos that we could then use the seeds

596
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:16,096
Regrow Mina restart our civilization or something but but Fowler actually see that is having a much more active role

597
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,120
What is this kind of like

598
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:20,192
You know this her backup hard drive for others

599
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,984
Seed banks around the world so that if you

600
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,776
If you run into trouble you can

601
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:27,104
You can store your receipts there and then and then take him out when he did again

602
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:28,640
It seems like

603
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,944
They're truly inspired by wawel off

604
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,224
Work

605
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:36,064
Yeah yeah I mean obviously like at the turn of

606
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,368
A veterinarian of the early 20th century was

607
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,136
It was super

608
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:42,720
Concerned about food security for Russia and then the idea was like

609
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,512
You know we got to have

610
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:48,096
Are are genetic diversity

611
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:51,936
Protected and then obviously people people are going to die

612
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:52,960
For that

613
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:56,032
Went with the idea that that Russia you don't need this season

614
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,312
The other side of the war I think

615
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,920
The challenges are different obviously today and then and more Global potentially but

616
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:02,944
But when you think about it

617
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:04,736
The importance for all of us

618
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,808
Are genetic diverse

619
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,904
Inspiring in a lot of these people work

620
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:16,512
Continue to be inspired by vivalavi E everyone I spoke with was was

621
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,792
Thot meaning

622
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:24,192
Referred back to him very fondly so much so that they literally followed in his footsteps

623
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:30,592
Tried to call Brian that he did on unkind of centers of diversity

624
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:33,152
Cities around the world in and how he thought about seeds

625
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:36,736
We're very much like ahead of their time and people still

626
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:39,552
Refer back to him and then his his ideas have relevance

627
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:40,320
Today

Before we go I want to tell you about the body genius

652
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:27,328
A five-part series from Bello radiotopia show the truth

653
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:29,888
The body genius is a Dark comic mystery

654
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:31,424
That whines through a

655
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,472
Treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

Might cost you your life

658
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:41,664
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

659
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:46,016
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

660
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:50,368
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like a dad

661
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,720
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

662
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:57,024
Actually if I'm being honest

663
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,072
I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that

664
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:06,752
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

665
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:10,080
Was found dead in my private gym

666
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:13,408
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

667
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:17,760
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

668
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:18,784
Now

669
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,088
