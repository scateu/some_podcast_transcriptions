00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,480
During the Cold War were expressions of creativity in art

38
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:57,504
Much of which

39
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:58,784
Came from the West

40
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,832

51
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:29,760
That's because vinyl the material itself

52
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,552
Was impossibly expensive

53
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:33,856
