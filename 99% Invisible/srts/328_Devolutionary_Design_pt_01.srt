This is 99% invisible

22
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,608
I'm Roman Mars

23
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:15,008
It's hard to overstate just how important record album art was to music before we

24
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:16,288
I downloaded everything

25
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,872
Our experience with a record or CD used to be visual

26
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:23,968
The design of the record cover was your first impression of what was to come

27
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:30,368
I would stare at the font on the cover and pour over the liner notes the first time I put an album on it why

28
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:35,232
Was a ritual I'm not saying that error music was better it wasn't it was just different

29
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:41,632
BR on the records try to encapsulate the essence of a band and then that Essence was transferred to you because you were a

30
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:44,448
Fan and it became part of your identity to

31
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,752
At least that's what it felt like

32
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:50,592
Albemarle would certainly important to my friend and reporter Shawn Cole

33
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:52,384
One certain album

34
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,944
In one certain band in particular

35
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:57,504
The Roman were you ever Devo fan

36
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:03,648
I was aboard evil appreciate it I don't think it was really a fan like I listen to unlike the songs I heard

37
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,696
I remember with it when I was a kid

38
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:09,536
I remember that you're not a devotee

39
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,816
I remember the wren

40
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:11,584
Hats

41
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,352
NFL

42
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:14,144
Particular memory of them

43
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,192
Doing a cover of

44
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:21,312
I Can't Get No Satisfaction by The Rolling Stones on Saturday Night Live

45
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,360
Really weird yes

46
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,944
This story is about that

47
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,296
Devo album the one that they were promoting on that Saturday Night Live performance Yousaf

48
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,856
More specifically it's about

49
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,648
The album art

50
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,928
App that record

51
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,536
Because the story of the image that ultimately ended up on the cover of that record

52
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:42,816
Is this

53
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:45,632
Crazy rabbit hole that I fell down

54
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:50,240
Before we get there I just need to cover some some things about Diva that you might not know

55
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,288
Do you know where the name comes from

56
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:53,568
I do not

57
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:58,688
So a lot of people think of DeVos this really silly you know not even jumping around

58
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:02,528
But they were actually very serious and had a very considered

59
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,296
Philosophy

60
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,576
And that was at the

61
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:05,600
Human race

62
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:08,160
Is an estate of D evolution

63
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,440
Devo

64
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:15,328
So their songs are all the songs are mostly about corporate control and

65
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,656
Blind Conformity and they were actually visual artist

66
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:20,704
Before they before they wrote any songs

67
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,776
It wasn't the early 70s in Akron Ohio

68
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:27,104
So I talked with one of the founders of Devo Jerry Casale

69
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:31,456
And who says like back then they weren't they were mostly trying to figure out what

70
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,248
Devolutionary art

71
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,016
Would look like

72
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:37,856
You know cuz we were very very enamored and put off at

73
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:38,624
At the same time

74
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,392
Bye

75
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,416
Pop culture

76
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:43,232
Like the lowest end of like add graphics

77
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,792
Terrible TV commercials

78
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:48,352
We were kind of drawn to kitsch

79
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,632
And occasionally they

80
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,424
Would go out shopping

81
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,192
Fourchette

82
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,472
So

83
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,008
Walking through the Kmart

84
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:58,080
Nope it was the predecessor to Kmart it was click

85
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:01,664
And this is Mark mothersbaugh is another member of the band

86
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,296
This is probably the point to mention that this was more than four decades ago and and not everybody's memory is is

87
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:13,696
Declare independence department store

88
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:16,768
Department store we were looking for supplies we were

89
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,047
Collaborating on a

90
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,839
Visual art piece together

91
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:20,863
And

92
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:25,983
Walking through the sports section and there's V6 practice golf balls in a

93
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,775
Clear plastic pouch

94
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:30,847
Sealed shut at the top with a

95
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:34,943
Cardboard display head took a new picture this its like that display had

96
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:38,015
With a hole in it that that hangs on a hook

97
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:40,319
Yes I can picture it kind of like the rocks

98
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:43,391
With bags of generic candy at the gas station

99
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,439
Like a clear bag full of candy and it just says

100
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,975
Gummy bears at the top

101
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:47,743
Alright so

102
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,023
On that

103
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,047
Display head

104
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,607
Is an illustration

105
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,655
Of the smiling face

106
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,447
Chi Chi Rodriguez

107
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,007
And who was Chi Chi Rodriguez

108
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,591
Chi-Chi Rodriguez is one of the most famous golfers

109
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,615
In history

110
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,663
He was like

111
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:12,575
I don't know what you do Rodriguez was like he was he was he was like that he was like the the Elvis of golfers he was just like

112
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,599
The Big Show

113
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,415
I saw it and I just loved it was a picture of him

114
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:20,255
In front of a golf ball to his head's kind of Halo to buy a big golf ball

115
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,791
Kind of imitating

116
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:24,863
Something that I'd already been printing which was

117
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,911
Human heads in front of the Moon and

118
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,447
It made us laugh

119
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,471
Wee chuckle

120
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,007
We have to have that

121
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,799
Intercourse golf

122
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:36,127
Was almost symbolically like the most lame

123
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,407
Kind of

124
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,455
Leon bourgeois

125
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,991
Pursuit that you could

126
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,527
Have especially that time

127
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,831
Unless your parents are rich you didn't get to

128
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:51,487
If we ever imagined our self on a golf course it was probably as a caddy how boring it looked in on TV

129
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,583
Was Chichi because

130
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,351
He didn't

131
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,119
Fit

132
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,679
With the rest of the golfers at all

133
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,215
He wore these loud

134
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,751
Pants and

135
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,799
Bright shirts in he had this

136
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:07,359
Famous hat that only he wore which at a

137
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,151
Specific hat band

138
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:12,223
We don't have my hat

139
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,271
So did they buy those golf balls

140
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,807
They bought the golf balls

141
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:16,831
Mark

142
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:20,927
Used the Chichi image in a Manifesto he was writing about being a quote on quote

143
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:23,231
Spud boy in the rubber town of Akron

144
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,023
But other than that

145
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,071
Nothing really happened with it

146
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,095
Until

147
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:31,167
We were already putting out our self-produced single

148
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,447
You still

149
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,103
Oh I like that song

150
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:44,991
It's it this is my favorite one is so it's it's like this kind of jokey Anthem celebrating

151
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:47,807
Like literal stiffness like uptightness

152
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:51,391
Talking about televangelist politicians and how if they are

153
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:54,719
Somehow and I don't really remember the moment but

154
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,487
We had

155
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,767
The idea

156
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,071
I'm putting Chichi on that cover

157
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,143
And so they used that picture of chichi

158
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,935
On the cover of the 45

159
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:04,959
The Sing-Off

160
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,239
And it was like this

161
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:10,079
Commentary on on on Commercial as a Min Pin or obsession with selling

162
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:12,383
And in this case selling plastic golf balls

163
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,943
And the Americana of the

164
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:15,711
The golfer

165
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,527
Toby stuff comes out in 1978

166
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,551
And

167
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,087
Yeah they're still not famous there

168
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:23,391
None of this obscure art rock band

169
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:26,207
But then about four months later

170
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:26,975
Diva gets

171
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,255
Their big break

172
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,559
Warner Brothers sign the Bantu there

173
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,351
First full-length album

174
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,655
Gordon Jerry

175
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,959
Is where the real D Evolution begin

176
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,751
We've laid that whole thing out

177
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:39,775
And working up

178
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,055
This moment

179
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:43,871
And then comes the real Devo twist

180
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:46,431
Only a corporation could provide

181
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:50,015
In other words what we're talking about we become part of

182
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,343
They're about to be

183
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,439
On top 40 radio and broadcast on the TV screens at Middle America

184
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,719
What was that

185
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,255
First record call

186
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,535
The long title

187
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,815
Called question

188
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:05,375
Are we

189
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,679
Question are we not men

190
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:11,007
Answer we Are Devo

191
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:16,127
And this is their first major label album

192
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,527
So Mark and Jerry than the other members of the band are there like that

193
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:29,183
That picture of chichi work so well on the single let's just stick with it you know it's kind of our brand now let's just put that on the on the cover of the full-length

194
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:34,559
And this is like a picture of Chi-Chi Rodriguez the original picture from that

195
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,839
Thing they bought at Kmart

196
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,887
They just took that lifted it directly

197
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,007
And put it on

198
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,335
So they had to California

199
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:52,991
IMovie montage Beverly Hillbillies whatever and

200
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:53,759
Warner Brothers

201
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:58,623
Q and their this is like the process back then but then maybe now I don't know but like they're heading from

202
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:05,023
Department to department at Warner Brothers you know dealing with all of the new album things that need to happen

203
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:11,423
We're told to go see I think Rick Serena was his name and he seemed to be an okay guy in the Arctic

204
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,471
Ways ahead of the Arts

205
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:19,871
I was creative director at Warner Brother records he seemed to like what we were up to that one band that I pray

206
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:22,175
Appreciated the most was Devo

207
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:28,575
I love the fact that they just never took anything very seriously do you remember that first meeting with

208
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:31,903
Maryland you are remembered have a Polaroid

209
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,695
We showing the image

210
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,719
He Chuckles

211
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,255
I thought it was clipart

212
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:39,327
Yeah she does look a lot like clipart

213
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,375
And I guess I never asked

214
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,679
I only found out that it was

215
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,471
Kim sometime later

216
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:48,543
Well I guess what it is I just wanted to do vote for you

217
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,335
Absurdity

218
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:56,479
I mean you have to think about what was going on back

219
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,503
In the day

220
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,527
Artwork

221
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,575
Album covers

222
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,599
Has had rules

223
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,367
Attached to it

224
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,135
Most of them

225
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,439
Albums were delivered to little mama

226
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,463
Pop music

227
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,743
Stores all around the country

228
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,535
Let there be sound

229
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:15,423
Kid would come in at 4 after school and his job was to open up the box of records from

230
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,703
Warner Brothers Are

231
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,495
Columbia what not and then rack

232
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:19,775
Right

233
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,567
So the one thing that they

234
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,615
Told all of us in the art Department

235
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,151
Just don't screw that up

236
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:30,783
A rock band has to look like a rock band country western has to look like country western

237
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:35,903
They better have cowboy hats on otherwise they get Miss racked and then if people can't

238
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,183
Find them in the rack

239
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:39,743
Of the genre they're interested in they don't buy it

240
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:45,887
DeVos case the music was so unusual that it could have something

241
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,191
Completely absurd on the cover and make

242
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:48,959
Make sense

243
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,263
So even though it makes no sense

244
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,799
That a picture

245
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,847
Of a flamboyant golfer

246
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,919
Stolen from package of golf balls

247
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:03,295
As is the mascot of Devo it does make perfect sense because that's who

248
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,319
It was just like

249
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:08,415
Pick something impossible and and react is just psyched like he loves

250
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,719
He loves working on this

251
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:15,327
There you know it's there doing all the little designing things and giving me like

252
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:16,863
Font

253
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:20,703
Getting getting everything ready

254
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,495
He laid it all out

255
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,287
Spectre colors

256
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:27,103
You know did the whole series thing where they give you

257
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,895
A transparency that amaka

258
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,175
Right

259
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,455
And we approved

260
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,783
And 10 about two days later

261
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,319
Who get this call

262
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,623
And it's a big crisis

263
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,695
The car was from the vice president of business Affairs for

264
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,463
Warner Brothers

265
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,487
David Berman

266
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:47,583
Who was the guy that you would cast in a movie about the music

267
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,399
As a villain or is the hero

268
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,215
Depends on your point of view

269
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,519
He was very smart very good at what he did

270
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,311
Played Hardball

271
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,127
The first communication is

272
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,151
I'm a golfer

273
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,687
And I'm a fan of golf

274
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,735
I know she

275
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,527
I've met chichi

276
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:09,087
You cannot use Chi Chi Rodriguez

277
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:09,855
Status

278
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,903
Completely and totally false

279
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,695
This is David Berman

280
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:17,279
I told you not everybody's memory is Crystal Clear regarding the story

281
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:20,607
Not only have I never I have never seen chi chi

282
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,143
Other than a television

283
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,679
I'm not going to make fun of them

284
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:27,007
Friend of mine never met him I never spoken to him

285
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,287
Get this company sued

286
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,567
That part is accurate

287
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,871
Does David Berman about maybe being sued

288
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,407
Yes he did play hardball

289
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,711
But he says his objection was purely illegal

290
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:36,735
Shirley

291
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,783
In California laws crystal clear

292
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:43,135
You can't use somebody's name or likeness for commercial purposes without their permission

293
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:46,207
Had nothing to do with my being a golfer other than

294
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:50,303
Because I was I knew that it was clearly Chi Chi Rodriguez

295
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:52,351
It wasn't the fact that he was likable

296
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:55,167
Equipment Rory sabbatini I would have done the same thing

297
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,215
Wait who is Rory sabbatini

298
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,239
He's a golfer

299
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,055
But nobody likes Rory sabbatini

300
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:04,639
Why does nobody like Aurora's cavatini

301
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,407
I don't know

302
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:11,551
Also Rory sabbatini was born in 1976 and would have been 2 years old when this Diva record came out but anyway

303
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:14,111
This all came as a real

304
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:14,879
Blow

305
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:15,903
To the band

306
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,695
We're dumb fight in Creswell

307
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,463
We don't know what

308
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,279
Curse words

309
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,303
Giving up

310
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:26,399
Let's just right Chichi letter and ask his permission

311
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:28,191
But in the meantime you know

312
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:31,519
Corporate gears are rolling in money has been paid and

313
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,823
Warner Brothers is expecting a product

314
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,359
Sol Divas like

315
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,151
Let's come up with a plan B

316
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:42,783
And they had this idea that actually involves another piece of The evolutionary are

317
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:47,135
The artist rendering of what the last four presidents would have looked like

318
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,671
Had you combine them

319
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:52,255
The Ford Nixon Johnson and Kennedy all of their faces

320
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,023
Mashed

321
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:53,791
Together

322
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:56,351
Mark mothersbaugh I just had the pictures lying around

323
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,119
Neurosis

324
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:01,471
It is bizarre face that had John Kennedy's hairline and it had

325
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:05,567
Lyndon Johnson's ears and Richard Nixon's nose

326
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:08,895
So the band brings that image to the Warner Brothers Art Department

327
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:11,455
Why couldn't we just

328
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,991
Beauty chichi

329
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,111
So that it isn't Chichi anymore

330
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:28,095
So basically like it was like building a mr. Potato Head Toy like they grafted

331
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:32,703
Johnson's ears and Nixon's dos Chi-Chi's head reverse the mouth

332
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:37,823
I should I should actually I should say that the David Berman from was in business.

333
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,895
The time he doesn't remember the image being altered

334
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:47,551
So I sent him the original Chichi image from the from the golf balls and the Potato Head collage

335
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,319
I was just so he could

336
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,599
He could compare them

337
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,391
Looking at it today

338
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:55,487
I wonder why I proved it cuz to me it still looks like a chicken

339
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,815
Obviously I must have

340
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,351
Interior strike Salt Lake

341
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,143
About three weeks later

342
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:05,471
A letter comes back from Chi-Chi's Representatives

343
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:10,079
Yes Chichi thinks it's fine

344
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,615
To use that image

345
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:12,895
He just wants

346
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:13,919
50

347
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:14,687
Records

348
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,711
Christmas time

349
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:18,015
To give out to his friends and family

350
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:21,343
He wanted to say his friends and family look like like I'm going to record

351
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,111
Right

352
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:22,879
He like that

353
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,415
And this is Mark mother

354
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:27,743
So it was at that point it's like we couldn't go back

355
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:30,559
It would date already printed the cover so now we had this

356
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:31,839
Mutilated

357
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,119
Potato face

358
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,655
For an album cover

359
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:39,263
And it didn't really look like the handsome Chichi anymore so I'm sure he was quite so

360
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,127
Surprised when he got a box of them in the mail all our efforts were in fact

361
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,919
What it looks like in the end

362
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:48,479
Is it Devo hit meanly trick

363
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,527
Chi-Chi Rodriguez

364
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:54,111
And put out something made him look hideous

365
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,415
It was you. Was a mess

366
00:15:56,927 --> 00:16:00,255
They did send Chichi a couple thousand dollars

367
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:03,327
Also as well as the records he wasn't

368
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,095
The total loss

369
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:04,863
For him

370
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:07,679
But then they just then I never heard from him

371
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,727
Celine ever

372
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:12,287
Got his take on the album art or even

373
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,847
The songs on the album or anything like that which is

374
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,895
My reigning question and all of the

375
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:20,991
I really want to know if Chichi ever listen to that record and what he thought of us

376
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,783
Yeah that would be the big

377
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,391
Hello

378
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,671
Hello Gigi Rodriguez

379
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,207
Yeah who is this

380
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:33,279
Hit Sean Karrueche at a country club

381
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,047
Naturally

382
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,095
In West Palm Beach Florida

383
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,911
He's in his early eighties now still handsome still plays golf

384
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,191
Professionally

385
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:42,239
Does a lot of philanthropic work through his

386
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,799
Foundation annual charity event

387
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:47,103
It's really an honor to talk to you

388
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:49,407
It is my honor to talk to you Johnny

389
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,199
It's Sean but that's okay

390
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:58,111
It sounds like the best Johnny I love him so sweet

391
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,391
I love him

392
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:02,463
Chichi says he remembers getting this letter

393
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:08,095
And he says he did give out those records to his friends and family

394
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:13,215
Did you notice when you got the record that it didn't quite look like you that much

395
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:18,335
What it look like me and I look at the plushies it look like me a little bit

396
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,615
At least 1/2 look like

397
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:22,431
But I don't know anything about them messing with his face

398
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:25,247
And he had no idea that they were worried he was going to sue them

399
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,271
Show them

400
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,623
Well anybody that worried about somebody showing them

401
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:34,463
That they show people that they think that people are going to sue them

402
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:40,863
I thought it was this young people trying to make a career out of it and I could help him and that's it because I

403
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:47,263
I like to do something good every day of my life and I want to leave the the Earth better than I found it

404
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,311
So even young sort of

405
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,615
Avant-garde Punk musicians you want to hell

406
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:52,639
Yeah

407
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,943
Did you listen to that record

408
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,503
Yeah I listen to it one time

409
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,271
Just once

410
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:01,087
I put away that you didn't like it

411
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:04,671
No I

412
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,463
Nat King Cole

413
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:08,511
Dean Martin was my favor

414
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,095
Cuz music is not supposed to Rally up

415
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:14,143
Music is something to bring you down

416
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,703
So the most important question

417
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:17,727
Answer

418
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:24,127
He did he did not like it right and like it but as I was talking to that there's like a

419
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:26,431
A kind of Greater question here

420
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,967
Which is like

421
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,527
What did he think about

422
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,551
His face

423
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:35,135
Mutated version thereof

424
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:37,695
Being on the cover of this apocalyptic

425
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,719
Weirdo

426
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,999
Art rock bands

427
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:43,327
First record like the diet like did that make sense to him

428
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,375
And it's

429
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,239
Because because

430
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,519
Chichi

431
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,543
Knows he's

432
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:56,127
He knows how much he stands out and how

433
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,407
Outlandish

434
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,431
PS

435
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,455
None of that is lost

436
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:02,527
He said it's it's

437
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:03,295
Purposeful

438
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,319
Golf

439
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,367
Gulfshore business and

440
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,671
When you're a space you got to

441
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:10,719
The people that show and that's

442
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:15,327
Nashville time

443
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:18,655
Oh so that is the similarity between you and Devo

444
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,423
Yes

445
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:23,519
So in a way it really makes sense that they used you on the cover of their record

446
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,567
I think they were geniuses

447
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:28,127
I need takes a genius to recognize another

448
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,111
You guys sound almost

449
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:41,183
Diabolical

450
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,719
Me and Chichi

451
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:44,511
The bottom of a volcano

452
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:49,375
Planning

453
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,215
One could argue that

454
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,751
Again Jerry casali

455
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:56,287
What we were put through

456
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,079
By David Berman

457
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,103
Actually

458
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:01,407
Achieved something here better than just

459
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,687
Using a found image

460
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,783
Corporate interference

461
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:11,647
Plus the faces of Four American presidents who prosecuted the Vietnam War

462
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,183
And it's aftermath

463
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:18,047
In this wonderfully dandyish golf legend all of this together

464
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:21,375
Yeah it's more DeVos in the original TGIF

465
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,911
Is it that's what I'm saying

466
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,959
Devo and action like

467
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:26,495
Do you need an example of what

468
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,031
Talking about

469
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:28,799
Here it is

470
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:36,479
So this whole story takes place at the beginning of his career end

471
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:40,575
They go on a play for decades and extremely famous

472
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:44,159
They were just nominated to be in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame

473
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:44,927
Yeah

474
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,975
Do they think about Chichi as

475
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:48,767
Part of their origin story

476
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:52,095
Cinemark Melrose Park

477
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:55,935
I really I don't think anybody ever tried to measure

478
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:56,703
How much

479
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:58,239
That album cover had in the sea

480
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,519
Excessive Devo but

481
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:01,567
It could possibly have been

482
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:03,103
The Tipping

483
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,639
Stone that Duchess like a

484
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,199
The chance to

485
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,991
Have a public career so

486
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,039
Just in case

487
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,087
Thank you chichi

488
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:21,792
Yeah

489
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,328
Story's not over

490
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:26,144
One more diabolical Devo twist

491
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:27,936
Netgear start casali

492
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,984
I have to say that now.

493
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,056
That I'm a senior citizen I completely changed my

494
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,848
Attitude about the game of golf

495
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,640
You did not really

496
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,200
Yeah I like it now

497
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:41,760
I really has changed

498
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,552
So much from Those Days Inn

499
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:46,112
Who got to play it and how it's played

500
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:48,416
I mean those guys really are athletes

501
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:51,488
I never thought I would hear a member of Devo say that

502
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:52,256
I know

503
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,560
I hear that here's a

504
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:55,840
EE

505
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,120
Hideous Secret

506
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,912
Unfolding right now

507
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,960
I really like

508
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,008
Professional football

509
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:29,120

Hugh Brown who helped Sean Cole with the research

512
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:45,504
Around the time Depot with putting out their first singles in the mid-1970s a music teacher in Canada

513
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,784
Dazn DIY records

With a haunting and uplifting Outsider Art masterpiece

516
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:55,744
That story

517
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,024
After this

518
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,640
Between the Beats bongs and chatter of our devices were immersed

519
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:15,200
The cluttered World a man-made sound

520
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:20,832
If I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexa

521
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:26,720

522
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:28,512
Technology talk to us

523
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,816
It is a creation of Sonic trash

524
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:33,632
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

526
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,360
Turn the living room lights on

527
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:44,896
Okay

528
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,688
Dim the living room lights

50%

530
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:49,504
Okay

531
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:55,904
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

532
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,720
Makes for a much more natural experience

533
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,768
Turn the living room lights on

534
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:04,352
Dim the living room lights to 50

535
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,120

00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:05,280
The music teacher named Hans finger recorded 60 of his Elementary School students singing in a gymnasium

554
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:10,144
He pressed a few vinyl records of those recordings and handed them out to parents

555
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:16,800
The Langley School music project was little known until a record collector named Brian land found one of those albums in a trust

556
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,080
In the year 2000

557
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:20,640
Lynn shared it with some people and eventually

558
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:23,456
Bar None records gave it a proper release

559
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:29,088
The records cover featured a collage of black and white pictures of the students singing strumming guitars

560
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,880
Playing drums and clapping along

561
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:33,696
The album was called innocence and despair

562
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:36,000
The rediscovered recordings were a hit

563
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:38,560
Salon music critic Steven Hyden wrote

564
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:41,632
The gloomy title innocence and despair is no lie

565
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:45,216
The echoing yelping Renditions of this feel good music

566
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:48,032
Gives off a powerfully aching melancholy

567
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,568
It's the sound of you

568
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,848
Frozen on tape

569
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,128
As it fades

570
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,408
Probably away

571
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:57,504
Here's the music teacher from the Langley School music project hans fenger

572
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,040
Talking to Katie Mingle

573
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,064
In 2010

574
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:07,744
Before I was teaching in Langley I played in the heavy metal band

575
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:12,352
It never occurred to me to be a teacher I wasn't really good student myself

576
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:16,960
Kids were okay but I wasn't all that gushy about them to be honest with you

577
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:23,360
I knew nothing about kids music I knew nothing about teaching I knew nothing but everything you know I'd hair

578
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:29,760
Jared attitude weight 98 comes off I went to Langley and

579
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:36,160
I started teaching

580
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:38,208
I was having to pee dippy

581
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:42,304
Reading of philosophy at all about teaching the head.

582
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:45,888
I can't really say I thought about it a lot

583
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:48,704
I know I had a lot of ideas about music

584
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:50,752
But sitting out about teaching

585
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:57,408
You know for me I mean I've been playing in bands since I was like 11 or 12 years old and

586
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,456
It wasn't like anybody taught us

587
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:01,504
It wasn't even like anybody said oh oh

588
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,064
This is the way you do it or that's the way you do it we just

589
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,392
Certificated and I've been doing music like that since I was a little kid

590
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:13,536
So when I went in to teach music it never occurred to me that I was going to teach anybody how to read notes

591
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:16,864
Or that I was going to teach anybody how to pass a test

592
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:23,264
The only thing I ever tried to teach children is really

593
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,568
It's just to fall in love with making music

594
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:27,616
But that was always my goal

595
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:46,304
I just thought songs I knew

596
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:51,168
And and and I was very good to David Bowie in those days that was variant Iggy Pop

597
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:56,032
I was into a fill soul Phil Spector records Brian Wilson

598
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,568
And it wasn't until much

599
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:58,592
Later

600
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:00,128
Did I realize that

601
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,664
Songs with thematic

602
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:10,368
You know I had gotten a teaching job originally because I was with my girlfriend and she was having a baby and I needed a job

603
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:13,440
And by the time I got this job we're breaking up

604
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,720
And I think that

605
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:15,744
In the back of my

606
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,512
Mind

607
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,584
You know I was feeling like a little bit lost

608
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:32,896
Contrary to what people think a lot of kids aren't that happy

609
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:35,712
They'll have troubles they got problems at home

610
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:37,504
They can feel lonely.

611
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,528
Isolated

612
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,576
And the music

613
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,136
Can contract that feeling into them

614
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:44,672
The weather in Northridge

615
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:46,976
Completely literally understand the words

616
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:49,280
I'm not sure sure that's so important

617
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:59,776
But I don't think Sheila when she was singing Desperado

618
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:03,616
Reading knew what a lot of those references were about

619
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:06,432
But you certainly captured the feeling of the song

620
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:15,648
Why don't you

621
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:33,056
But I know that

622
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:40,224
Disney

623
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:44,320
When I heard other school choirs in

624
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:46,368
Vis-a-vis so different

625
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,416
So weird

626
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:54,816
Any good to know how to sing

627
00:29:55,328 --> 00:30:01,472
I never thought of it in terms of its special cuz it was good I was out of interns it was special cuz it was different

628
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:20,672
Oftentimes habitat 69

629
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:21,696
Kids in my class

630
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:25,792
And it'd be all over the place because there's no room and we have instruments

631
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:29,632
We had no equipment so I brought in all the equipment for my band

632
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:32,192
Which were used Marshall amplifiers in

633
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:35,776
Bass guitars and all kinds of things are kids supposed to really like that

634
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:37,824
Said it wasn't much room in kids room

635
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,128
Practically on top of one another and

636
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:41,920
I just saw

637
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,712
Arrange them according to height

638
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:59,328
I always felt like with my music teaching that I always was an outsider music

639
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,608
Teacher you know I mean

640
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,400
I never I never really put

641
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:03,680
2 pages in a lot of

642
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:04,704
Music

643
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,240
Teaching events and all that kind

644
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:08,288
The stuff I was always like those little Island.

645
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:10,848
To myself you know people always uses this term

646
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:13,152
Like thinking outside the box and all that but it's

647
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:13,920
I think

648
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:15,712
For me I didn't even know there was a bomb

649
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:17,248
You know I mean

650
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:30,048
It does have the sort of the Children of the Corn

651
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,704
Hyatt does it does have that feeling well I think we were kind of like a little call

652
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:42,592
It became kind of a

653
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,896
What type of an underground hit in New York

654
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:48,224
Tony Visconti who is David Bowie

655
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,760
Producer had heard it and

656
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,320
I think he thought it was a New Wave band

657
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,344
New Jersey

658
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:00,512
I couldn't quite believe it was a bunch of little kids on some Farm country in Canada

659
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:27,136
Yeah I have students

660
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,696
Facility music to this day

661
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:33,024
They're always in touch with me I jam with some of them once in awhile

662
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:38,656
I felt that the whole success of this would you really vindicating kind of

663
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:40,704
Experience it made me feel really like

664
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:42,752
Wow I can't do something

665
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:48,384
So it was great I mean when you know what I'd always taught by students in a really positive way and then

666
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:53,504
When somebody suddenly is positive about what you doing like that and it gives you a great feeling

667
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:42,144
