The proud family goes to wherever you get your podcast and find out why they say

22
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:04,768
Every house is haunted

23
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,072
This is 99% invisible

24
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,608
I'm Roman Mars

25
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:13,216
And I'm sitting in that tiny little room this microphone right up to my mouth

26
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:16,032
So the sound of my voice is transmitted directly

27
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:17,312
From me to you

28
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:19,360
There's no sense of the room that I'm in

29
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:21,152
When I stop speaking

30
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,432
The sound stop

31
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,480
There is no reverberation

32
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:25,760
No Reaper

33
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:30,624
Roman and I are both talking in rooms outfitted special 8 for recording

34
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:32,672
Rooms that sound

35
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:33,440
Good

36
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:35,232
Mass producer Avery trufelman

37
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:38,048
Because if I step outside this tiny

38
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:40,096
Completely padded Studio

39
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,424
Okay it's so quiet

40
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,448
Because I'm inside

41
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:48,544
But I'm going to walk around a little bit so you can secure the architecture around me

42
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:51,104
You can tell now that I'm in a bathroom

43
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,688
Or you can tell if I enter the stairwell at better office

44
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:59,552
If you're not listening in headphones my voice is bouncing around your car

45
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,832
Or whatever room you're in

46
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,368
Whatever you're hearing

47
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,160
Sound is affected

48
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:04,928
By The Arc

49
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:09,792
There are two main ways to control the sound in a building

50
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,072
Active acoustics

51
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,096
Impassive

52
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,888
Passive acoustics

53
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,424
Are the materials in a space

54
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,472
Like a padding in the studio room

55
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:20,800
Carpeting and drapes are also absorptive material

56
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,080
Soak up sound

57
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:24,384
Glass and Porcelain on the other hand

58
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,664
Create more Reverb

59
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:31,808
Essentially if it's shiny it's going to be reflective isn't easy way to interpret that

60
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,600
This is Ashley Hansen

61
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:37,696
My name is Ashley Jansen I'm the design services manager at Myerstown

62
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:40,256
Meyer sound is a company that mostly makes

63
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,280
Active acoustic

64
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,816
Which is this a speakers

65
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:45,376
Amplifiers and other electric sound equipment

66
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:48,448
People probably have run into our products

67
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:50,240
They just don't know that it's

68
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,776
Meyer sound

69
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,824
Meyer sound makes a lot of the Big Show

70
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,152
Speakers hanging off of the ceilings at concerts and Broadway shows

71
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,736
But their products are also in a lot of unexpected places

72
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,016
Cruise ships

73
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,808
Restaurants

74
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,392
We are in some corporate headquarters at

75
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:09,184
Educational facilities

76
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,464
Airport

77
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:14,304
Over 600 Meyer sound speakers were used when the Pope

78
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,328
Spoke in Mexico

79
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,656
One of the things I tell people in general is

80
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,448
If we're doing our job right

81
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:23,776
You might never notice that were even there

82
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:27,104
And that's part of Ashley's job at Myerstown

83
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:31,968
To make sure the sound equipment is effortlessly integrated into a building

84
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,784
Using both passive and active

85
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,600
Materials and electronics

86
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:43,232
But often in architecture what looks the best is at odds with what sounds the best

87
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:49,888
Of course you don't necessarily want to always see the big black speaker somewhere and so we have to get creative

88
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,192
We like our speakers out of sight

89
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:56,032
And we also like high ceilings and long glass windows which makes

90
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,056
Spaces sound

91
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:57,824
Wheatley

92
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,592
River

93
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:03,200
So architecture is a puzzle for Ashley and her team to solve

94
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:07,552
Whenever we see rooms that have curveballs we kind of cringe

95
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:09,088
Especially if they're out of glass

96
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,624
Oh that's pretty

97
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:14,720
When we approach spaces there are things that although they're beautiful

98
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:17,280
We know are going to definitely

99
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,071
Put pressure on us

100
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,375
To come up with creative and unique ways

101
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,143
2

102
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,167
A Pista

103
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:23,935
Visual

104
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,471
And Sonic needs a

105
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,239
Set the room

106
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:28,287
So it depends on what you're trying to do and that's

107
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,055
Space

108
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:33,151
If it's a venue for the symphony or the Opera you want the sound to be big

109
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:33,919
And resonance

110
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,479
An echoing

111
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,783
Or cafe or place with

112
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,319
Acoustic performances

113
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,111
A little Reverb is nice

114
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,183
But you're trying to hear a lecture or reading

115
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:45,951
Per se

116
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,719
Have a meeting

117
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:49,279
You probably don't want much Reverb at all

118
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:53,631
But we haven't always been able to precisely control the acoustics

119
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,399
Sever building

120
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,447
Sound until fairly recently

121
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:00,031
Was a somewhat mysterious element in architecture

122
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:06,431
In the late 18th century there are all sorts of different theories about how to get good sound but

123
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,479
Half of them contradict the other half

124
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,015
And no one really knew what

125
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,063
To do this is Emily Thompson

126
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,647
She's a history professor at Princeton and a scholar of sound technology

127
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:18,463
She says at the turn of the 20th century

128
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:21,791
Architectural Acoustics are pretty much a roll of the dice

129
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,815
Architects

130
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:23,839
Begin to fret

131
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:26,911
But they don't really know what they're doing with this aspect

132
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:31,519
Of their designs and it was all kind of left to chance and if you were lucky

133
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,311
Aurora Theater would sound good

134
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,103
And if you were unlucky

135
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,127
It wouldn't

136
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:38,431
And in 1895

137
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,711
Harvard University

138
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,503
Was very unlucky

139
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,807
The university had just completed building

140
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:46,623
Fogg Art Museum and it had a lecture hall

141
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,695
Where there was so much reverberation that they simply

142
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,743
Could not hold classes in that room

143
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:58,143
You couldn't understand the speaker

144
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:06,591
Harvard had just wasted a lot of money on a completely useless room

145
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,359
Sound

146
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,127
Henry Linda

147
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,943
And in an attempt to save the space

148
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,039
They listed the help of a rookie physics Professor who had some time on his hands

149
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,087
So the president of Harvard

150
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,391
Ask this young physics professor

151
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:22,975
To figure out how to fix that Auditorium and make it use

152
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:23,743
Visible teaching

153
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:24,511
Hbase

154
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,047
This professor's name

155
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,583
Was Wallace Sabine

156
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,119
And through this task

157
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,679
Sabein would eventually

158
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:34,495
Become the father of architectural acoustics

159
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:40,639
Lissette Wallace sabein onto an investigative path that actually took several years

160
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:45,759
Collecting data basically making sounds in rooms and timing the Reverb

161
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,575
He would take

162
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:53,951
Measurements of the different reverberation times in different rooms all over campus

163
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,999
And in order to do this under the quietus

164
00:06:56,255 --> 00:07:00,351
Possible circumstances he tended to run his experiments in the middle of the night

165
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:04,447
And he would change the reverberation

166
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:07,775
In time within a given room by bringing into it.

167
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,311
Sound absorbing material

168
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,615
Sabein was a perfection

169
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,943
Keep throughout over 3000 measurement

170
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:17,503
After determining that his own clothes

171
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,039
Had a small effect

172
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,319
Upon the sound of the room

173
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,623
He started all over again

174
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,671
Taking measurements in the dead of night

175
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,439
But now

176
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,975
Wearing the exact

177
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:27,743
Same outfit

178
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:28,767
Every time

179
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:35,679
Meanwhile the president of Harvard is is waiting and waiting for this lecture hall to be made useful again

180
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,959
One point you finally

181
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,263
Does to the young Professor it's

182
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,311
It's time for you to tell us what to do here

183
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,591
Enough is enough

184
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:43,615
Night night

185
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,407
Feeling nervous under pressure

186
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,455
Saybein pours over his notebook

187
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:48,991
I had a breakthrough

188
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:54,879
Looking at all his measurements he starts to notice a trend a mathematical relationship

189
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:58,719
Between the size and materials of a room and it's reverberation time

190
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,767
Relationship so steady

191
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,303
That you can make a formula out of it

192
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,863
He discovers a mathematical formula

193
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:05,887
Bitconnect

194
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:12,543
The architectural materials of the room and the behavior of sound within it and this is a formula

195
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:16,383
Sa Vines formula now that really

196
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,175
A enables

197
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,967
People to be able to predict

198
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:22,271
The reverberation time of a room

199
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,295
Based on its design

200
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:25,599
Design savings equation allowed for

201
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,367
Planning

202
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,415
Something you can manipulate the Reverb of a

203
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:31,231
Space by changing the materials the room was made of

204
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:34,047
So that then you can take any sort of Arkansas

205
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,071
Textural plan

206
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:37,631
You know the dimensions you know

207
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,167
How many square feet of

208
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:41,215
Plaster or wood or glass

209
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,751
Soar upholstered seats

210
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,287
Fill this room

211
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:50,431
And you can just kind of plug and chug and if the formula will turn out a predicted number for the reverberation

212
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,455
The room

213
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:56,831
Stabilized formula helped Architects design for as little or as much Reverb as they want

214
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:57,855
Architect

215
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,391
Could now control

216
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,415
Sound of a

217
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:01,951
They could make

218
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:02,975
Big rooms

219
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,255
With very little Reverb

220
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,303
Until they begin to do Jess

221
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,071
Stat

222
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,631
And the most remarkable early example of this

223
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,167
Was Saint Thomas

224
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,215
St. Thomas Church

225
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,239
Which is

226
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:18,079
In New York City not far from the Museum of Modern Art

227
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,919
The architect of this church wanted to build it in a neo-gothic style

228
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:25,759
Basically to make it look like a European cathedral made of stone with

229
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:28,063
High ceilings and stained glass windows

230
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,599
But while they wanted

231
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,647
This building to look Gothic

232
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,951
They realized that a Gothic

233
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,255
Sound would not work for modern

234
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,535
Temp service

235
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,863
They wanted to hold a much more sermon Focus

236
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:41,631
Service

237
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,911
Not Justa medieval math

238
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,983
I needed less Reverb

239
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:48,031
I'm so prisoners could understand the words

240
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,103
So the Architects turn to Wallace Avon

241
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,407
How to make a Sacred Space that would be

242
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,175
Clear

243
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,199
Calming

244
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,223
Reverb

245
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:56,991
Free

246
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:00,831
Shure wireless Avon could add felt and padding to the building

247
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:03,647
But he thought that didn't fit the feeling of a church

248
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,439
He work with a tile maker

249
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:08,767
To come up with special sound absorptive ceramic tile

250
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,047
Dogs with porous surfaces

251
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,351
He called them run for tile

252
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,911
Rumford tile

253
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,703
Named it after

254
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,471
Physicist

255
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:20,543
2hat kind of been interested in solving practical problems

256
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,311
And

257
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:25,919
Play the substantial architectural material it's not a matter of just hanging drapes or tack

258
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,967
Felt onto a surface it's a

259
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,503
It's much more integral

260
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,295
So with St Thomas Church

261
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:36,159
By using the sound absorbing tiles way up and all the ceiling vault

262
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,207
They have the gothic look

263
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,999
But without the gothic sound

264
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:43,071
St. Thomas Church was completed in 1930

265
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,887
It's definitely not modern look

266
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,703
But it was a landmark modern

267
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,727
Sounding building

268
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:54,335
Completely engineered of formulated for environmental control

269
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,127
Thanks to the Rumford tile

270
00:10:56,895 --> 00:11:00,735
Say mine works in public and private spaces all along the east coast

271
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,271
And came out with more Broad

272
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,063
To accompany the Rumford tile

273
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:07,391
And he passed away in 1919

274
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:10,719
Rate really at a moment when a much

275
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,767
More pervasive interest in

276
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,303
Controlling environmental song

277
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,119
The Roaring Twenties

278
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:21,983
It got that name for a reason

279
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:26,591
It may very well be the case that it was louder in the twenties then now

280
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:32,991
This was an ERA when cars and trucks did not uniformly come with Mufflers there were

281
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:37,343
For these new unfamiliar unprecedentedly loud sound

282
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:40,415
A car the trains of industrial machinery

283
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:43,231
Construction of skyscrapers Rising everywhere

284
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,279
In the crowded City

285
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,303
An escape

286
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,583
Was hard to find

287
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:55,007
Sound Christmas and Clarity could provide calm and control

288
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:57,823
It meant a complete Mastery of the

289
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,895
And so the desire

290
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:05,759
To control sound within interior spaces isn't parked

291
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:08,575
A kind of a drive to create Refuge

292
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:12,159
From the noisy tumult of the world outside

293
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:15,487
Rumford tile launched in industry

294
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,023
By the 1930s

295
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:23,423
Dozens of different corporations were manufacturing and selling vast quantities of acoustic build

296
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,191
Building materials

297
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,239
With names like acoustic

298
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,775
Acousti celotex

299
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,799
And saving it

300
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,591
For those who could afford it

301
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:33,151
You know whether you could buy it at a soundproof

302
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:35,199
Apartments or just enjoy

303
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:38,527
Quiet offices or or theaters

304
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,551
Quiet

305
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,087
Became a luxury commodity

306
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,903
Acoustic materials were so advanced

307
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:46,719
It's a Barnes formula couldn't apply anymore

308
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,559
By 1930

309
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:52,095
You're really able to

310
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:54,399
Create spaces that simply didn't exist

311
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,167
The 19th

312
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:55,935
Century

313
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,983
State lines equation doesn't work

314
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,543
It was a product

315
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,823
Of the world

316
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,359
In which he did his invest

317
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,663
Castigation which was still that 19th set

318
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,943
Country World filled with

319
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,479
Glass and wood and

320
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,247
I'm class

321
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:14,111
After all this new acoustic technology was able to create a level of Silence

322
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,159
Unprecedented in say Vines

323
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:16,927
Time

324
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,207
Finally

325
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:18,975
It was quiet

326
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,279
Too quiet

327
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,887
What is the 20th century went on

328
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:31,519
Who became disenchanted with the idea of completely closed off spaces with dampened acoustics

329
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:34,079
They wanted to let in air or light

330
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:34,847
And sound

331
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,943
Interesting lay by the 1970s

332
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:41,503
Some of the cultural

333
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,551
Factors in the aesthetic

334
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,575
Preferences of

335
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,855
People with respect

336
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,135
To sound design

337
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,159
Headchange

338
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,951
Since the early 20th

339
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:54,047
Rhiannon some of these spaces including st. Thomas Church

340
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:56,095
They actually decided they wanted

341
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,375
More reverberation

342
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,911
And this material

343
00:13:59,423 --> 00:13:59,935
Engendered

344
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:00,959
So

345
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,239
In some cases

346
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,519
Porous surface

347
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,287
Of the rump

348
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,055
For tile

349
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,591
Has been painted over

350
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,127
Peel off those

351
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,943
Pores and then to make it more reflective

352
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,711
Of sound

353
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:15,551
And these days we want our architecture to have a range of

354
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:20,159
No one single room or venue can accommodate a lot of

355
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,439
Kind of sounds

356
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:24,255
And that's possible using not just passive

357
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,815
Acoustic materials like the ones they bind pioneered

358
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,839
But also

359
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:28,863
Active

360
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:32,959
Using microphones and loudspeakers

361
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,495
And digital signal processor

362
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,335
That's Melody Parker and acoustic engineer at Meyer sound

363
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,615
Cannabis product

364
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,151
Called constellation

365
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,967
And so what constellation allows

366
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:44,991
You to do

367
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:48,063
Is to create multiple environments in one space

368
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:52,671
It basically allows you to manipulate the sound of the room completely digital

369
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:56,255
Do a system of many Chinese speakers and microphone

370
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,535
Where the microphone

371
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,559
Throughout the ceiling

372
00:14:59,071 --> 00:14:59,839
They're really smart

373
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:03,167
Melody showed Avery the test room for consolation

374
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:05,471
Inside Meyer sound headquarters in Berkeley

375
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,775
It looks like a very small theater

376
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,567
It's a room with a low Reaver

377
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,615
Time thanks too much acoustic padding

378
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:14,431
But it's outfitted with a variable active acoustics

379
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:17,247
We're tiny microphones capture the sound

380
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:19,295
And the speakers playback no sound

381
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,367
Monster mimic the reverberation in different size rooms

382
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:28,255
Okay so I'll grab Melody took out an iPad and activate a different settings

383
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,303
Which completely changed

384
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,095
The Sonic shape of the room

385
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,119
Midol do

386
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,143
I'm dramatic

387
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,191
Demonstration

388
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:38,239
This is what

389
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,007
It sounds like

390
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,543
With a very long

391
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:45,663
Melody play the clave to demonstrate the Reverb time

392
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:52,063
This setting was called Sacred Space I gave this tiny room the sound of a cathedral

393
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:55,647
And it's one thing to hear a Reverb effect

394
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:57,183
In a song or podcast

395
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,487
It's another thing entirely

396
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,535
To experience a Reverb effect

397
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,815
In a room

398
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,095
In real life

399
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,119
In real time

400
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:08,191
The echo completely changed my perception of the

401
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:12,031
Then Melody took the Reverb completely out of the room

402
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,055
Entirely

403
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,335
And suddenly it felt

404
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,103
Stifling

405
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,895
Like I'd been muzzled or something

406
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,431
It's hard to breathe

407
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:20,735
And those are some of the most dramatic setting

408
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,295
There are lots of subtle change

409
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,831
Is that a client can make to a room

410
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:29,439
They have the ability to change the length of the reverberation change the strength

411
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,207
The loudness

412
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,231
Set the reverberation

413
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,511
And 2 even

414
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,815
Change the perceived height

415
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,863
Of the room in the perceived width

416
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,631
The room

417
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:44,031
Constellation and its competitor sound systems are expensive so they're not

418
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,311
, exactly

419
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:51,967
But they're in a lot more places than you'd think like a number of big venues all over the world and classrooms and offices

420
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:55,551
Restaurants use so-called variable active acoustics

421
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,343
So they can adjust the noise level

422
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,391
How to keep it a pleasant home

423
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:02,207
Regardless of how many people are in the space

424
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,791
An architectural implications of this

425
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:06,815
Are fascinating

426
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:11,423
Of course Architects and acoustician still have to pay attention to the path of acoustics

427
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,447
Building materials

428
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,519
But there's a lot more design flexibility now

429
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:19,103
Yeah we actually have an interesting one that we're working on

430
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:19,871
4

431
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:22,431
Attack business where they took over an old

432
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,199
Factory

433
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:25,759
Does Ashley Henson at Meyer sound again

434
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:28,319
And so the challenges in that space

435
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:31,647
It's the factories all brick and exposed and beautiful

436
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,415
And

437
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,231
Have these high ceilings and she says

438
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:38,815
Combination of active and passive acoustic systems

439
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,095
Help architects

440
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,631
Repurpose old buildings

441
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,423
Were able to

442
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:48,543
Text faces that would never be used for certain applications and make them

443
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:49,823
Great for

444
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,103
All sorts of

445
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:51,871
Different events

446
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:54,431
And that wouldn't happen before this office

447
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:59,039
Space in this old factory would just be a reverberant nightmare no one could

448
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,575
Focus and

449
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,599
They probably wouldn't have

450
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,367
I purchased it

451
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,135
For that

452
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:09,791
Buildings like Saint Thomas Church Mark the beginning of our quest to control sound in the built environment through Pass

453
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:14,911
Passive Acoustics no hundred years later with Advanced active acoustics

454
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:21,311
We can separate sound from space warehouses can be made to sound like Opera Houses and Opera House

455
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:27,711
Siskin sound like small clubs it's just a matter of how much Reverb we want

456
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:37,951
In this episode we featured some actual sounds from New York City from the 1920s and 1930s you can find them on the

457
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:44,351
Portable interactive website that Professor Thompson made in collaboration with the University of Southern California, map of

458
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:49,471
New York and you can click around it to see what it look like and what sounded like in the twenties

459
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:55,871
And the easiest way to find it is to go to shut out the noise. Com

Bongs and Charter of our devices

470
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,175
We're immersed

471
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:32,991
In a cluttered World a man-made sound

472
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:38,367
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa not Alexa

473
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:44,255
Is talking to me and my wife is in another room in a kid is another word for all hearing that voice

474
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,279
Technology

475
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,047
You talk to us

476
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,351
It is a creation of Sonic trash

477
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:51,423
Mets Joel Beckerman is a sound designer and composer

478
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,007
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

479
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,799
To make them more human

480
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,895
Turn the living room lights on

481
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:02,687
Okay

482
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,223
Dim the living room lights

483
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,247
50%

484
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,039
Okay

485
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:13,439
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

486
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,743
Makes for a much more natural

487
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:16,511
Experience

488
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,303
Turn the living room lights on

489
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:22,399
Dim the living room lights to 50%

490
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:31,103
We're presenting two special episodes from 99percentinvisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation about how are sound

491
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,895
Landscape is impacting our health

492
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:35,455
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

493
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:38,271
Look for them Friday is May 17th and May 24th

494
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,039

MPI fade

496
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,927
We need to talk about something

497
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:47,231
Constipation abdominal pain and bloating

498
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:52,095
You tell yourself it's not that bad you take laxatives modify your diet and exercise routine

499
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,143
But thinking about it all the time is frustrating

500
00:20:54,399 --> 00:21:00,543
It doesn't have to Define you if your constipation and abdominal symptoms come back again and again and you don't know why

501
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,847
Then it may be time to see cow

Before we go I want to tell you about the body Genie

513
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:50,464
Series from Bellow radio TV show the truth

514
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,280
The bunny genius is a Dark comic mystery

515
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,560
That whines through a

516
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:56,352
Treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

517
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:58,144
We're looking the part

518
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,680
Might cost you your life

519
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:05,056
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

520
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:09,152
What is a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

521
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:12,736
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like

522
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:13,760
A dad

523
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:18,112
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

524
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:22,464
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main guy to know how to do that kind of

525
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:29,888
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

526
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,216
Was found dead in my private gym

527
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:36,544
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

528
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,896
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

529
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:44,224
Now I need to clear my name

530
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,600
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes

531
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:50,624
To find them
