That's cool in Athens Georgia which is a great place to be from the 80s

34
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,352
Have about

35
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,144
18 to 25

36
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,192
If you like going out to bars

37
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,472
And listening to live music

38
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,544
You know Adams is a fairly small college town

39
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:49,568
It's hot

40
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:52,384
Huge and important music scene for decades

41
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,200
And the most famous band to come out of the oven scene

42
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,224
Undoubtably

43
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,760
Is REM

44
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:11,072
To be provocative right from the start I'm going to say that REM out of time

45
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:15,168
Is the most politically important album in the history of the United

46
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,752
Provocateur is reporter Whitney Jones do I have to say

47
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:23,872
I don't think out of time is even the most important album in the history of REM

48
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:26,688
Actually my argument here is nothing to do with the music

49
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,784
This isn't one of those oh it's a soundtrack to a generation or anything like that

50
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,832
Out of time made such a huge impact

51
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:33,856
Because of its

52
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:34,624
Packaging

53
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:39,488
The box out of time originally came in led to a bill being passed in Congress

54
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,792
An actual concrete law

55
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:45,120
Let's go back to 1985

56
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,912
The pop charts were full of

57
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,704
Prince and Sheena Easton

58
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,240
And the Youth of America

59
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,520
For being corrupted

60
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:57,152
Tipper Gore in a few other Elite women of Washington form of the parents music Resource Center

61
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,200
Or the pmrc for short

62
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:03,040
They put pressure on the creators and Distributors of quote on quote

63
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,320
Objectionable music

64
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:07,136
Musicians and labels called the censorship

65
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,928
There were Senate hearings about this

66
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:13,536
And eventually those little black and white Parental Advisory sticker started appearing on albums

67
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:16,864
This set off a wave of censorship across the country

68
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:22,496
In 1990 a federal district judge in South Florida ruled that the rap group 2 Live Crew album

69
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,776
As nasty as they wanna be

70
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:28,640
Was so obscene that it couldn't be sold or performed within his jurisdiction

71
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:41,184
3 days after the ruling 2 Live Crew played a show in Broward County Florida

72
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:44,000
And after the show two members of the group got arrest

73
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:46,304
And it was a live performance I believe

74
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,144
That they found obscene with you know girls doing what would be

75
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:55,520
Like what might working I think it would be a very early version of the twerking

76
00:03:55,776 --> 00:04:01,152
Jeff ayeroff wasn't there he saw it on TV and I just it was just so offencive to me

77
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,200
Jeff was an executive at Virgin Records

78
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:06,272
And to be clear he wasn't offended by the raunchy lyrics

79
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,552
Ixora the twerking

80
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:09,088
He was offended by the arrest

81
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:11,392
Send the blatant censorship of the artist work

82
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,744
Jeff spent the next couple days mulling this over and then he had a revelation

83
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,280
One of the reasons why

84
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:21,631
Politicians get away with things because there isn't an anti constituency

85
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:24,191
There was never anything to lose by

86
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,471
Baiting

87
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:28,543
Rock and roll because there was this

88
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,615
Qunar that young people didn't vote

89
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:36,991
And you know within the next two days the idea came to me like fully formed in some way

90
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,551
And I came up with this damn Rock the vote

91
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:40,831
Progesterone

92
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:43,135
The idea behind rock the boat with simple

93
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:46,975
Get young people to vote for politicians who wouldn't censor music

94
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:49,279
Yeah it was that simple it was the idea of you put

95
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:51,071
Kids in the game

96
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,119
The game becomes different

97
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:57,727
Politicians can no longer scapegoat music they can't keep using us as Annex

98
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,495
Excuse

99
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:04,639
Sogefi Rob got about 60 people together in a Los Angeles hotel the talk about launching Rock the Boat

100
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,175
Frank Zappa was there

101
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,247
Past and present California Governor Jerry Brown was there

102
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,039
As we're a bunch of other record exec

103
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,319
So there we are

104
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,855
Part of this

105
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,415
Virtuous circle of record executives

106
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:23,583
Who have spent a lot of their career being criticized for destroying the Youth of America and it was sort of like an affair

107
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,375
Very altruistic way

108
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:28,959
I think we could do something positive we can get kids to vote we can

109
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,751
You know that's cool

110
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:35,615
Also in attendance was Jeff Sprint

111
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,383
Jeff gold

112
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,431
He was working for Warner Brothers

113
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:40,479
And one of his major project of the time

114
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,759
Trying to figure out

115
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,295
How to package CDs

116
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:49,183
Compact disc packaging was the Hot Topic in the record world in the late eighties and early nineties

117
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:52,255
CDs have been around for a few years at this point

118
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,815
But record stores still didn't have a good way to display them

119
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,095
Here's Jeff gold

120
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,119
When

121
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,167
CDs first came out on the market

122
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,215
Record retailers

123
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:06,079
Were angry about them because their stores were formatted

124
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,383
To display

125
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,943
12 and 1/2 inch for 12 and 1/4 inch square

126
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:11,967
Talbots

127
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:16,319
In other words they didn't have any stands or display cases for these new CDs

128
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,879
So somebody the record industry said look

129
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:24,255
If you put a CD jewel case inside of a cardboard box that's as long as a vinyl album

130
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,047
And only half as wide

131
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:26,815
You can fit

132
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:30,911
Two of these longbox CD side-by-side in an LP rack

133
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,447
Problem solved

134
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,007
Retailer said fine perfect

135
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:39,359
It's so millions of these things out of nowhere started getting made

136
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,687
Record people loved the long box

137
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,479
They thought it was the future

138
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:50,623
A head honcho AEM I wrote this opinion piece in billboard magazine in 1989 entitled

139
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,927
Why we should keep the CD longbox

140
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,719
He writes quote

141
00:06:54,975 --> 00:07:00,863
I want to see the music industry continue to thrive and prosper as one of the cornerstones of entertainment

142
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:05,215
And I think making full use of the 6 by 12 CD carton

143
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:07,007
Is one way to help us do just

144
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:09,823
That but not everyone loved along box

145
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,127
Artist said wait a minute

146
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:15,455
We don't want you cutting down millions of trees

147
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,479
To put

148
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,015
Are CD's in

149
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,831
And then having people throw these things away it's a

150
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,111
Incredibly wasteful

151
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,135
In bed thing to do for

152
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,695
Because the thing about the longbox

153
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,743
Is that it was never meant to be collected

154
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,303
And the feel of a big Mike and Ike Carter

155
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,607
You when you bought a CD in a longbox

156
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,887
You open it up

157
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,423
It take out the jewel case

158
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:38,239
Switch out the actual CD in the album art in it

159
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,775
I need to toss a long box

160
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,567
There's no reason to keep it around

161
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:44,383
Auriemma record coming out

162
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,663
In 1990

163
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,199
And they're saying

164
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:51,551
To me and to Warner Brothers there's no way our record is coming at a long box

165
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,111
We're sensitive to the environment

166
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,671
This is a ridiculous thing forget it

167
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:01,023
And one of their sales department is saying it absolutely has to come out in a long box

168
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,559
Or record retailers

169
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,327
Going to penalize

170
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,887
And that's when Jeff gold got this idea

171
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:08,191
He could merge the two projects He was working

172
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,031
They could use the CD longbox to advance The Rock the vote camp

173
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:16,127
But first he needed a concrete political cause to connect it to

174
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,687
And Jeff are all fat found just the thing

175
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:22,015
We were sitting there looking for a reason. Try to get us

176
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:22,783
Send

177
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,575
A political situation

178
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:28,159
I'm reading Newsweek or time and there's this column article

179
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,207
About the Motor Voter bill

180
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,487
We just said

181
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:34,303
We're going to help these people from the Motor Voter bill

182
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:40,703
This was going to be our first thing we were going to do but so there's this Motor Voter bill that's been bouncing around Congress since the 1970s

183
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:46,079
If passed Motor Voter would allow people to register to vote at the DMV when you got a driver's license

184
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:52,223
It also allowed you to register by mail or when you apply for social services like welfare or unemployment

185
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:55,039
Basically making it easier for a lot of people

186
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,855
Including Rock loving young people

187
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:58,879
The register to vote

188
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:01,439
By 91 a few states that already adopt

189
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:04,511
But Congress has never been able to get it passed naturally

190
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:08,351
Jeff gold went to a political event in Hollywood about the Motor Voter bill

191
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,887
And one of the speakers was

192
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:12,191
Columbia sociologist in political activist

193
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,215
Richard cloward

194
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:16,543
He said that writing to elected officials could help sway them on the issue

195
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:20,127
After clouds talk Jeff gold went up and spoke with

196
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,663
Then when the Panic started talk

197
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:27,039
What amount of letters would a senator a congressman

198
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:27,807
And take note of

199
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:28,831
Particular

200
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:31,647
350 200

201
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,927
That would really have an empath

202
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,207
Can I should really that

203
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:34,975
Few

204
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:37,535
People don't write so

205
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,351
Getting 150-200 letters

206
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:44,447
About an issue would would definitely make them sit up and take notice

207
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,775
That weekend Jeff gold was riding his bike around Santa Monica

208
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,567
And I had this moment where

209
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:52,383
It rushed into my mind this fully formed idea that

210
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,175
That we could

211
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,711
Take care of REM

212
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,527
By turning their long box into a positive

213
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:02,111
If we put a petition on the back of the long box

214
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:06,207
That would go to rock the boat saying I support the Motor Voter bill

215
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,511
And we could distribute it to

216
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,047
Their respective senator

217
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,839
And I knew

218
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,119
We can generate

219
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,655
Unbelievable amount of mail

220
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,471
Jeff gold got on the phone with Jeff era

221
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,519
And they agreed that this would be the strategy

222
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:23,615
They would turn the album long box into a piece of political machinery

223
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:26,943
And they would flood congress with support for the Motor Voter bill

224
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:30,527
That Monday Jeff called REM manager with the plan

225
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:32,319
It's alright let me call the guys

226
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,343
I'll call you back

227
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,391
I probably heard back from him within an hour

228
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,951
Bernie said great idea they're totally into it let's do

229
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:41,535
So out of time hit the record stores on March 12th 1991

230
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:44,095
And then the petition started rolling in

231
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,655
And I remember vividly

232
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:50,239
Maybe four or five days after the record come out

233
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,775
I mean a very short period of time

234
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,311
They had bags

235
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,127
It was really incredible

236
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:59,967
Nobody can seem to put their hand on what the exact number of

237
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,783
That we got of these were but I remember thinking

238
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:06,111
Well after 3 weeks we got ten thousand I mean that's

239
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,159
100%

240
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:11,999
That's already half of what Richard cloward said would make an impact

241
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:16,607
And he sings just kept coming in and drove their canvas bags full of them coming in

242
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:23,775
About a month after REM release the album Rock the books political director plus two members of the hip hop group KMD

243
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:27,871
Wheeled a shopping cart full of these first ten thousand petition

244
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:28,639
Into a senator

245
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:32,479
And they just left them there for senators window Ford

246
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,783
And a very young looking Mitch McConnell

247
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:39,391
It may have 1992 after thousands of petitions

248
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,415
Senate testimony

249
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,951
The Motor Voter bill passed

250
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:42,719
Congress

251
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,023
But then president HW Bush vetoed

252
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:49,119
This was in July right in the middle of Bush's re-election campaign

253
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,703
Bush's opponent Bill Clinton took up Motor Voter as a talking point

254
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,983
Bashing Bush over

255
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:54,751
What is veto

256
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,543
And the rest is basically history

257
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,079
Clinton wins 92

258
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:03,711
The bill comes back before the house is actually the second bill that the house takes up in January of 93

259
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:06,271
Motor Voter passofallpasses the Senate

260
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,575
And then Bill Clinton signed it into law

261
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:12,159
As the national voter registration Act of 1993

262
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,207
At the White House earlier

263
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:14,975
Today prison

264
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,255
Bill Clinton signed

265
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,303
The voter registration Act

266
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,071
Commonly

267
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,607
Referred to as the Motor Voter bill

268
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,655
Can we get invited to the White House

269
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,423
The signings

270
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,447
And it's this

271
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,751
Totally surreal scene

272
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,311
His wife were there and I'm there with my wife and

273
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,335
All the people

274
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,127
And

275
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:35,711
Clinton at the signing talks about how Rock the vote really helped make the difference

276
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,479
How to get this built

277
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,015
As I said I have

278
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,063
Long supported the idea of

279
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,087
Motor Voter

280
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,391
More than a year ago I promised

281
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,159
Does president

282
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:46,207
But I would sign HR 2 and 5

283
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:46,975
Rich Passage

284
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,023
I'm pleased to be able to keep

285
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,047
The promise today

286
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,583
That I made on this rock

287
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,351
The boat card

288
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,887
Still has my signature

289
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,167
Back in New Hampshire

290
00:12:56,191 --> 00:13:01,311
Shaking his hands after the bill-signing we identified ourselves as rock the boat and said you guys got this past

291
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,103
That was really one of the most

292
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:03,871
Surreal

293
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,151
Moments of my life

294
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:14,367
I want to stop a Minit in point out just how bizarre this scene is

295
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,975
Remember Rock the Boat had formed in open protest against censorship group

296
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,791
That was started by the new vice president wife

297
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:22,559
Tipper Gore

298
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:27,423
You know those little black and white parental advisory stickers those were nicknamed Tipper stickers

299
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:30,751
Tipper Gore's husband was now praising Rock the vote

300
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:34,079
And it's a tribute to one group

301
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,359
Is voice an organ

302
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,383
Malaysian was apps

303
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,663
Impressive

304
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,711
America's young people

305
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,735
They Rock

306
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:41,503
The vault

307
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,271
They got this

308
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,831
So when Jeff gold says

309
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,111
Was really one of the most

310
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:46,879
Surreal

311
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:47,647
Moments Abaya

312
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,415
My wife

313
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,183
Yeah

314
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,487
I think the real is probably the right word

315
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:55,071
What's interesting here is that this campaign

316
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:59,167
Really could have only happened during a very brief period of time

317
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:02,239
Because before Clinton had even signed the Motor Voter bill

318
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:06,079
Jeff gold at actually found a way to kill off the long box for good

319
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:11,455
He hatched a plan and he went to talk about it with the Chief Financial Officer at Warner Brothers

320
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,223
Murray

321
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:16,831
Lisa Marie how many of these things do we make a year and he said okay

322
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,135
I don't know 90 million between the

323
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,159
Something like that

324
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,975
Niacin how much do they cost you said

325
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,511
$0.25

326
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,047
I said Okay so

327
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,071
You talking about

328
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,143
20 to 25 million dollars a year were music

329
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,167
Expense on lombok

330
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,447
And he said yeah

331
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:35,519
I said so what if we stopped making long box

332
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:40,895
And we took that 25 million dollars and gave it in the form of rebates

333
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,943
Trek retailers

334
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,271
Just to pay for them to reconfigure

335
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:47,807
There been

336
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,879
And we did it as a one-time

337
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,415
You know discount or payment

338
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:56,511
And they got all the money we saved for the first year

339
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,047
And then

340
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,351
For the rest of time

341
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,655
We're saving 25 million dollars a year

342
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:07,519
El jacal tell that the other Warner Brothers Executives liked his idea

343
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,567
They took it to the distributor

344
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,103
The distributor went for it

345
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,407
And that was the end of the long box

346
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:17,503
Some stores got new racks to accommodate the long box Free Jewel cases

347
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:20,063
Others held on to their 12-inch bin

348
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:23,391
But started putting CDs inside of these reusable plastic

349
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,159
Stick cartridges

350
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:27,999
And record companies have been profitable and solvent ever since

351
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,303
So long boxes or not

352
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,583
The Motor Voter bill

353
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,679
Which after apus became the national voter registration Act of 1993

354
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,471
That's still very much a thing

355
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:40,287
Between 1995 when the law went into effect

356
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,311
In 2012

357
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:45,919
The percentage of the voting age population that is registered to vote went up more than 10 points

358
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,479
From 69.5%

359
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,759
279.9

360
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:55,903
And in that same time span more than a hundred and fifty million voter registrations have been filled out at the DMV

361
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:00,255
