I'm John Hanson president

35
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,664
There's a conception in the public I think that

36
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:00,064
Design is a lot about making things pretty that shifting I think there's a big DIY

37
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:06,464
Why movement maker movement and people are getting a better sense of how things come to be we've always known how kind of buildings can

Navigate to Speed wash them go up

39
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:12,096
The products just kind of appear on the store shelf from somewhere from China

40
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:12,864
Right

41
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,936
But I really loved the process of design and love

42
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,216
Bringing things to life

43
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,544
The story that I want to tell

44
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,592
About the details that go into product make

45
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:23,616
Is about a tooth

46
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:24,896
But there's a bit of

47
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:25,664
Comfort Inn Ventura

48
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,688
Just released the perception

49
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,968
That requires that the

50
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,504
So I asked Matt Martin

51
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,272
Michaela

52
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,552
What matters

53
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,320
Tami Roman

54
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,344
Is that you are

55
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,624
About the fact

56
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,392
The John Edson

00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:36,416
The present of lunar

58
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:37,440
Lunar under eyes

59
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,536
Same time you got complete editorial control

60
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,304
Over

61
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,840
How 99percentinvisible sound

62
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,376
So what do you think

63
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:48,960
You know what he said

64
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,752
This is the story of a toothbrush

65
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,080
Pressing is getting a design out there in the world and a prototype

66
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:55,872
For the other people can look at it

67
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:56,896
You can test it

68
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:59,968
You can evaluate it and then you can decide what you're going to do next

69
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,504
And it really is good

70
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,528
This kind of forced

71
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,296
Evolutionary

72
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,064
Reprocess

73
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,904
So the toothbrush company came to lunar with what John Edson cause a make

74
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,928
Pretty extra make

75
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:09,952
Pretty exercise

76
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:14,304
That's not really Innovation how do people hold toothbrush

77
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,608
But the toothbrush company didn't actually know this

78
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,912
So we engaged a hand

79
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:19,680
Kinesiology

80
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:24,032
But somebody who knows how people hold stuff it turns out there are five common to

81
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,872
And the meantime our designers went out and bought every toothbrush under the sun

82
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:31,456
We started to take the conventional flat toothbrush with bristles sticking up

83
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:35,552
And we use the heat gun and made a bunch of different prototype

84
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,320
We just

85
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:39,648
Those standard brushes into different shapes

86
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,952
Sissy fundamentally what was working and what was not

87
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:45,280
Hundreds of sketches and dozens of prototypes

88
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,584
One of the first things we found when we were

89
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,632
Molding our prototypes was that

90
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,168
At the time the reach toothbrush

91
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,960
Probably best known as

92
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,496
The most ergonomic toothbrush

93
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,520
This was all

94
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:58,592
Perception is only ergonomic in that it looked like a dental

95
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:01,920
And it was a dental tool that somebody else would use on you

96
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,200
Crook in the dental mirror

97
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:06,784
It's so that somebody can stick it in your mouth and manipulate it so they can see around

98
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,064
The reach toothbrush

99
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,368
Infuse yourself you end up with your hand back at you

100
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,904
Describe the bed

101
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,928
Straight handle is bad

102
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,464
One of the things we found was a

103
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,768
Batter toothbrush handle is more comfort

104
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:19,839
The fat is better than thin but it's some point in the process

105
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:20,607
Someone

106
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,375
Peppa toothbrush

107
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,143
Company said

108
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,679
Wait a minute

109
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,215
You can't ship a toothbrush

110
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,263
That's got a fat handle on it

111
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,823
Because it's not going to fit into those

112
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:34,687
1950s Style ceramic toothbrush holders that people have stuck to their walls

113
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,479
Part of their houses

114
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,527
But this turned out to be a good thing

115
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,551
For the toothbrush manga

116
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:45,951
They got a ton of press about it though here's the toothbrush it doesn't fit and Luna came up with a strategy anybody called to complain

117
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,999
We created the little nickel plated

118
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,279
Stand that

119
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:51,327
Send out this $5 component

120
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:55,167
Just like biological evolution Shore the organism adapt to the environment

121
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:55,935
But also

122
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:56,959
Environment

123
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:00,031
Add apps to the organism and now if you buy a toothbrush holder

124
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,055
It's going to have these

125
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:04,127
Gigantic holes in the top right so you can fit

126
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,663
These newfangled Cooper

127
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,063
In addition to the straight and fat handles the new toothbrush also had crisscross bristles angle

128
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:16,927
That was brand-new the handle was strategically flattened in parts to help you oriented

129
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:17,951
Fingers no

130
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:18,719
Which way the person

131
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:23,839
Appointed in your mouth and it accommodated all of the five brushing reps identified by the kinesiologist there's a

132
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:24,607
Spoon grip

133
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,887
There's the death grip

134
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,423
More women than men use

135
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,191
The death grip

136
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:32,799
When I asked Jonathan which was his favorite innovation in the toothbrush he name something that most people

137
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:33,823
Consider a lack

138
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,847
Designer anime

139
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,151
Just getting the toothbrush back

140
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:39,967
Back to having a straight handle not trying to do anything

141
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,503
Crazy through the neck

142
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,527
That's the best shape

143
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,063
You know those kind of

144
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,343
The

145
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,367

146
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,391
And that's a big

147
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,415
Part of design

148
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,719
The thing you don't think about or notice

149
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:51,999
Probably had the most

150
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,023

Before we go I want to tell you about the body genius

159
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:14,015
Series from Bello radiotopia show the truth

160
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,807
The body genius is a dark

Comic mystery

162
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,111
That whines through a

163
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:20,159
Treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

164
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,695
We're looking the part

165
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,231
Might cost you your life

166
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:28,607
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

167
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:32,959
Or lose a ton of weight to play a prisoner or a psychopath

168
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:36,287
Or put on 50lb all of a sudden to play like

169
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,311
Adad

170
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:41,663
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

171
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:46,015
Actually if I'm being honest I'm one of the main guys who knows how to do that kind

172
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:53,439
A few days ago Wesley Stern and actor that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

173
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:56,767
Was found dead in my private gym

174
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:00,095
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

175
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,375
Even worse

176
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:04,447
The cops think that I had something to do with it

177
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,727
Now

178
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,775
I need to clear my name

179
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:14,175
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes to find them
