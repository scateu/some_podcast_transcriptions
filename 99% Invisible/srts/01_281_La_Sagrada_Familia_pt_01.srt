1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:01,792
This is 99% invisible

2
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:03,072
I'm Roman Mars

3
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:11,264
The Mind enter Barcelona's most famous Cathedral often stretches around the block

4
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:13,056
La Sagrada Familia

5
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:19,456
Designed by Antoni Gaudi draw so many people to see it that the neighborhood is congested with tour buses and

6
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:21,760
Taxis in scooters

7
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:31,232
Some three million people went inside the church in 2016 and another 7 million came just to stare at the outside

8
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:33,536
A bit strange Behemoth structure

9
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:37,120
If you travel around Spain you'll see a lot

10
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:38,400
Old Gothic

11
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,168
Churches

12
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:42,496
Producer Katie mingle was in Spain earlier this year

13
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:44,544
But this one is different

14
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:47,872
First it doesn't look like a Gothic Cathedral

15
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:49,408
It looks like it was built out of

16
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:50,176
Phones

17
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:51,968
Are sand or like it just

18
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:53,504
World out of the sea

19
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,528
Like a fractal

20
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:56,832
It looks organic somehow

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,672
But there's another thing that sets it apart from your average

22
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:02,464
Old Gothic Cathedral

23
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:04,768
It isn't actually old

24
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:09,632
LD wasn't able to build very much of it before he died in 1926

25
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:12,704
Most of the church has been built in the last 40 years

26
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:14,496
And it still isn't finished

27
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:17,312
Which means that Architects have had to figure out

28
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:19,616
And still are figuring out

29
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:22,432
How gow do you wanted the church to be built

30
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:26,784
We are all together in that room is

31
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,552
Special room

32
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:29,600
The most important part of the

33
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,392
Feeling we are building

34
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:34,720
That's heronema Boucher

35
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,768
One of the current architects of the building

36
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,400
He says the clues to understanding how to move forward on the construction of La Sagrada Familia

37
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:45,216
Are kept in the room were standing in right now

38
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,752
In the basement of the church

39
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:51,104
Photosynthesis radio can you describe what's in this room

40
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,224
Now let us Shelf

41
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:57,504
With

42
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,272
Fragments

43
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,320
Little pieces of

44
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,368
Plaster make

45
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,160
Small

46
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:10,304
Boy died geldi left elaborate plaster model of the detailing his plans for finishing the church

47
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,096
What about 80 years ago

48
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,888
They're all basically destroyed

49
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,168
Now they're in pieces

50
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,704
Is it doesn't look like

51
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,032
Just from this and those little pieces that that would be enough

52
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:20,800
Dilate

53
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,592
Figure out the hole

54
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,360
Thing

55
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:30,016
I understand that it's difficult to know what we have to do if the main architect is not

56
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:33,600
Cartier how is not with us what we try to do is

57
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,624
Understand

58
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,904
How he thought

59
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,440
And it's not easy

60
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:38,720
I know

61
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,424
It definitely hasn't been easy for the new Architects to recreate and understand the vision of Antoni Gaudi

62
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,728
And there are people who think

63
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,264
They shouldn't even have tried

64
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,312
But the building should have stopped

65
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,592
Took out east.

66
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,128
But it didn't

67
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,968
The building is currently the longest running construction project

68
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:00,736
In the world

69
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:05,088
And The Architects are still trying to understand the mind

70
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:11,488
Antoni Gaudi grew up in a little town called where you

71
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,024
Switch like Barcelona

72
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,816
As part of a region Spain called

73
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:15,584
Catalonia

74
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,656
And although he's become one of Spain's most famous art

75
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:22,240
Yode would never have identified as Spanish

76
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,776
He was catalonian

77
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:24,544
Through and through

78
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:30,176
Catalonia has been in the news recently because of its movement for independence from Spain

79
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:33,248
But in many ways this movement isn't new

80
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:37,088
Catalonians have struggled against the rule of the Spanish for centuries

81
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:41,696
Castlevania has a separate language castle and it is always felt very separate

82
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,000
That's gay Stantonsburg n

83
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:48,608
My name is Guy Stantonsburg I'm the biographer of Antoni Gaudi

84
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:54,752
Pennsburg and says that as a child growing up in Catalonia Gowdy spent a lot of time outside

85
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:58,848
And was completely enthralled with the natural world around him

86
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:01,152
What he would later call the Great Book of nature

87
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,968
A lot of kids are curious about nature

88
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:06,272
The fur Antoni Gaudi it was different

89
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,832
It became a total obsession

90
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:16,000
He seemed to absorb essential lessons from the patterns and shapes he saw in nature

91
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:22,399
The insects were walking and flowers grew the way that A Tree Grows and where it's raised up

92
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,167
Brooches

93
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,471
A dried-out snake skeleton

94
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,239
Honeycomb

95
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:28,799
These were Nature's Perfect Construction

96
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,871
Pittsburgh Aldi a deeply religious Catholic

97
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:36,479
God was the master architect of these Flawless organic structures

98
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,295
Eventually God he left

99
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:44,159
A small town in the countryside and moved to Barcelona for University and then

100
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,183
Tree School

101
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:49,791
When he graduated in 1878 the director of the school said

102
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:52,351
We are here today either in the presence

103
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,375
Savage genius

104
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,655
Or a Madman

105
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:57,983
Gaudi began his career at a difficult moment in Barcelona

106
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:03,103
Industrial Revolution and brought thousands of workers from the countryside into the city for factory job

107
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,663
They were toiling in terrible conditions

108
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:08,735
Packed into filthy tenements drinking dirty water

109
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:11,551
Diseases like yellow fever in Colorado

110
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,319
We're ramping

111
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:18,975
In the midst of all of this suffering a Bookseller name shows up Boca Bay of begins selling a fundamentalist news

112
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:19,743
Paper

113
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:24,607
Kind of reminded everyone that their misery was punishment for their sins

114
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,399
Surprisingly a cool song

115
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:33,055
Pretty soon broke up with making quite a lot of money from his Catholic guilt seemed newspaper

116
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:36,639
Kept apparently on the hidden under the tiles of his book shop

117
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:42,015
With the piles of money he was accumulating decided to build a church

118
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:44,575
Women to inspire the common Folk

119
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,111
Toledo religious life

120
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:51,487
The church will be dedicated to Mary Joseph and Jesus the secret family

121
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,023
La Sagrada Familia

122
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:57,887
The first architect at Boca Bay hired quit after a year and he went looking for a new one

123
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:04,287
Legend goes book of Isaiah had a dream one night blue eyes man would come to the rescue

124
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:09,407
The very next day book of Isaiah saw the person from his dream in real life

125
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,783
Drawing in the studio of another architect Inu

126
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,343
And he says what are you older man

127
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:21,695
The man he had seen was Antoni Gaudi in immediately

128
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,743
Boca Bay hired him to be the architect

129
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:24,767
Of his church

130
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,583
Greatest job in Spain

131
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,911
At that time was given to this completely

132
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,471
Who is completely online twenty-nine-year-old

133
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:34,751
Done

134
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,031
Very little work

135
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:38,591
The basic floor plan for La Sagrada Familia

136
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,895
Had already been laid out by the former architect

137
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,687
And Goldie would stick with it

138
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:47,295
The church will be built in the Neo Gothic style Which is popular at the time in Europe

139
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:51,135
Miguel D also wanted to charge to be something completely unique

140
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,671
Inspired by Nature

141
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,951
And by God

142
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:57,279
What county wanted was a building which would actually have

143
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:59,071
The kind of harmonies

144
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:02,911
All of the celestial sphere is the idea that everything

145
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,447
As a home mini in nature

146
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,751
And if you got that rice in your building

147
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:09,311
The building itself with spiritualized

148
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:13,919
That said Gowdy would never allow the building

149
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,199
Outshine gods

150
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:15,967
Creations

151
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:19,551
So he set a limit on how tall the church would ever get

152
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:23,903
He felt that he didn't want to be told than God's handiwork and God's handiwork

153
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,439
We're close to mountains

154
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,719
Only the sign

155
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:33,375
La Sagrada Familia would be one or about three feet shorter than Mount montjuic in Barcelona

156
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,167
Just to keep it humble

157
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:41,311
In 1883 when Gaudi started work on La Sagrada Familia is first matter of business was

158
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,335
Finish the Krypt

159
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:44,639
Which had been started by the previous Arc

160
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,991
The Crypt is essentially a small church under the bigger chart

161
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:51,295
And a place where important people are buried

162
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:56,159
In fact I was buried there when he died in 1892

163
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,719
9 years after he hired Gowdy

164
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:06,399
Sagrada Familia Crypt was big enough to hold services in Endless kept everyone happy while Gowdy took his time designing the rest

165
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,167
The building

166
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:11,263
The book of Isaiah died management of the construction passed through various hands

167
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,543
Purple Galaxy

168
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,079
There was only one plan

169
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,103
That really matter

170
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,663
God is the client and God is never in a hurry

171
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:23,295
After the Crypt was finished Gowdy begin to build the first big wall of the building

172
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,319
The nativity

173
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,087
Facade

174
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,135
He would work on it for the rest of his life

175
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:30,463
But it was important to him that this facade get done first

176
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,487
Because

177
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:34,047
It would be the Bible written in stone

178
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:34,815
Which

179
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:38,911
People if they couldn't even read or write they could look at the building and btools about

180
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,215
The values of the Catholic faith

181
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,775
LD was a sculptor as much as an architect

182
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:47,871
The wall would be full of stone sculptures depicting biblical scenes

183
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:53,247
The baptism of Christ Christ in the workshop with his father flight to Egypt

184
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,551
With a life-size donkey

185
00:08:56,063 --> 00:09:00,927
The stone sculpture of a donkey in that c was actually cast in plaster

186
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,719
Become a real life donkey

187
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,279
It had to be particular to the Donkey

188
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,351
It looked as if it had been through the desert for 40 days

189
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:13,215
One of these workers actually wandered the streets until he found the perfect

190
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,495
Starving donkey

191
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:17,311
Which he exactly hand it over to Gowdy

192
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:21,151
Each of the donkey and the Donkey

193
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:25,503
And he Costco

194
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:30,623
Antoni Gaudi also tried making plaster molds from live human beings

195
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:34,719
Yeah she tried to do with one of his workers but we almost killed him and

196
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:37,023
I decided that maybe that wasn't the best

197
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,887
The way forward

198
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,703
This all took an incredibly long time

199
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,495
But eventually the wall started

200
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,543
Telestory in stone

201
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:52,895
And it featured hundreds of celestial and Earthly creatures

202
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:56,735
Little snails crawling all over engine tortoises

203
00:09:56,991 --> 00:10:00,831
The song became crowded and cluttered and teeming with life

204
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:03,391
Lumist swamp fish

205
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:06,719
Can the quality of the stain oozing out of organic

206
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,535
Shaping of the building it was very unusual

207
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,839
Barracks Road

208
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:17,471
Antoni Gaudi was slowly building a Catholic Church

209
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,263
But not everyone was convinced that

210
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,615
Catholicism have anything of value to offer the average working citizen

211
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:27,967
Leftist saw the church is getting rich from the tithes of the poor

212
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:31,295
They sold them as being wealthy as being parasitic

213
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,087
As living off them

214
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:38,207
Communism socialism and anarchism we're taking hold in other parts of the world and in Spain

215
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:42,047
He left his parties thought they could offer the struggling worker a better life

216
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,631
Conflict between leftist in the state and left us and the church

217
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,399
Oar concert

218
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,215
For the Lost Decades of the 19

219
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:49,983
Century

220
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:53,055
It's probably on the average something like two bombs every week

221
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,335
In the center of the city

222
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:59,199
Brother years Gaudi work on other architecture projects in Barcelona

223
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:01,759
His work is Peppers all over the city

224
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:05,087
Impalas is Pavilions and extracting homes

225
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:08,415
His sinuous in skeletal architecture was unmistakable

226
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,975
Everyone in Barcelona new hairstyle

227
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,535
A La Sagrada Familia is a project

228
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,815
That consumed him

229
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:19,167
He realized the coast he could never finish it in would never see it finished in his lifetime

230
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,703
My 1926

231
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:25,311
73 year old Antoni Gaudi had never married and was living alone

232
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,871
He spent a lot of nights sleeping in his

233
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:30,175
Studio at La Sagrada Familia

234
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:33,503
Too obsessed with his work to care about his appearance

235
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,527
He was

236
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:37,087
Looking up it's like a tramp actually busy

237
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:41,183
Trousers what held up with safety pins in a bit of string

238
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,767
On June 7th of 1926

239
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,303
Gowdy is leaving work

240
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:52,191
And as he crosses the railroad tracks and runs amoeba

241
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:56,799
Antoni Gaudi was left nearly dead on the railroad tracks

242
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:01,407
His body was found he was taken to the hospital where he died three days later

243
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:05,503
LD was buried in the Crypt under La Sagrada Familia

244
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:09,343
His last years have been consumed with building the church

245
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:12,415
The Barcelona have not forgotten Gaudi

246
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,975
Brown's of people came out to mourn

247
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:18,047
It was just an almost a quarter of the population

248
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:21,375
Castlevania turned up in recession

249
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:23,679
Thousands of people that

250
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:28,799
When Gaudi died he left behind a largely unfinished Church

251
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,847
Withstood was a massive wall

252
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,127
The Nativity facade

253
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,175
One Tower and the Crypt

254
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,967
His colleagues and apprentices

255
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:39,807
We have a lot to do to bring his full vision into being

256
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:44,415
Look out he had anticipated that other Architects would finish his work

257
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:51,071
And he left behind detailed drawings and models outlining exactly how he wanted his magnum opus to be built

258
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:56,191
For 10 years work on losco De Familia continue

259
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,471
Very slowly

260
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:00,287
Much of calories former team stayed on

261
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:03,359
Even though they could have gone and started their own project

262
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,895
They were loyal

263
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,687
It was still work to be done

264
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,735
The jewel ring still existed

265
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:11,039
They continued walking away

266
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,599
And then in 1936

267
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:18,207
Abstain from the north east south and west

268
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:23,583
Don't want to Spill the lifeblood of the Spanish Civil War

269
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,351
Begin

270
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:30,751
The decades-old conflict between leftist in the state and finally come to a head

271
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:36,127
The Republicans who were in Alliance of various Latin parties

272
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,663
Fought against the nationalists

273
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,735
Which was the lines of fascists and other conservatives

274
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,039
Led by General Francisco Franco

275
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:46,879
The nationalists also have the support of most of Spain's Catholic clergy

276
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:50,719
On the 18th of July two days off at the start of the Spanish Civil War

277
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:55,327
A group of young anarchists break into the studios of Goldie

278
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,631
And smash everything with hammers

279
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:01,215
All the multiples everything is smashed up into tiny little bits

280
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:04,287
When they're done smashing daylight the place Ablaze

281
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,823
Everything Burns

282
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,127
Including the architectural drawings

283
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,919
Absolutely everything in fact

284
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,199
The following day

285
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:14,783
Trying to come back and bum the Nativity facade

286
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:17,599
Which is the only one standing there with Gowdy's

287
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,879
Which

288
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:21,183
Miraculously they failed to do

289
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:25,023
Catholicism was under attack during the war and by the end of it

290
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,839
40 churches in Barcelona had been destroyed

291
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:34,239
12 people associated with the Sagrada Familia project including some of its managing patrons and clergy

292
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,263
Have been killed

293
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:43,199
The war ended in 1939

294
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,223
Leftist law

295
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:48,575
The fastest 1 and general Francisco Franco took control of Spain

296
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,391
Should I use eco

297
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,439
What is all over

298
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:57,023
Few workers return to gaudi's Studio to salvage what they could

299
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,815
They very carefully

300
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,351
Picked up in boxes

301
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:03,679
Little sections and fragments of of the multiples

302
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:07,263
Unlike archaeologists do today they started piecing them together

303
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:11,103
For the next couple of decades the remaining Architects and other workers

304
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:15,711
Try to figure out how to move forward on the construction without Gowdy's plans

305
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:20,063
But outside the church there was opposition to moving forward at all

306
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:26,719
In the 1960s an impressive group of intellectuals and Architects including Le corbusier and Alvaro Alto Road

307
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:30,559
Golden open letter opposing the continuation of La Sagrada Familia

308
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:33,887
LD wasn't only an architect they argued

309
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:34,911
He was an artist

310
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:37,471
And you shouldn't attempt to finish a work of art

311
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,495
Without the artist

312
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,775
They felt that

313
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,311
This was a total waste of

314
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,591
The time they should have left

315
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:45,151
Just the original Nativity facade

316
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:47,199
Almost like a Gothic ruin

317
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,247
That as a homage to Gaudi

318
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,807
And the Gaudi wasn't being well so

319
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,879
But the patrons of the project would have none of it

320
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:59,231
The building was never supposed to be an homage to Gaudi they argued

321
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:02,047
It was always about something bigger

322
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:07,679
That said they would try to honor Gowdy's original Vision as Faithfully as possible

323
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,959
But it would be easy

324
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:15,615
The models and drawings had been the roadmap for how to move forward on the construction and they were burned and smashed to pieces

325
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,943
And this wasn't just any Cathedral

326
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,527
All these years have been designing something

327
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,807
So unique

328
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:26,879
So complex and so completely new

329
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:29,183
But it would take his successors

330
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:29,951
Years

331
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,487
Definitely get a handle on it

332
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,655
The church still had no interior and no roof

333
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,703
It was just walls and Towers

334
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:42,239
A construction site

335
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,263
Open to the Rain

336
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,615
I first went to Barcelona in 1977

337
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,151
But I was 20

338
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:51,199
That's architect Mark burry

339
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:57,599
Mark actually been told an architecture school that Gowdy was not worth studying because his approach was to

340
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,879
Esoteric

341
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,159
That he was sad

342
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:03,231
Two extraordinary and that there was no school

343
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,511
Meaning that there was

344
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:10,655
Nothing to say you move alone this just got blurry more curious

345
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:17,055
So he went to have a look at the Sagrada Familia himself accident

346
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:19,871
Meeting the 290 rolled architects

347
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:22,175
Directions to project

348
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,967
And had died

349
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:27,295
They have been young Architects listing to Goudy expanding his latest

350
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,063
Discoveries

351
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,343
When they were students

352
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:34,207
The old Architects were ready to move on to the interior of the building

353
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:37,535
But they didn't exactly know how to do it

354
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,327
They knew that he had a system

355
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,375
Facebook geometry

356
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:45,727
Then use a system which translates into

357
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,031
I got a building methodology

358
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:50,847
In other words The Architects knew it was

359
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:51,871
Theoretically

360
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:54,943
Possible to figure out how to create the rest of the church

361
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,247
But it was a Monumental task

362
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:00,063
They pointed burrito couple of boxes

363
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,391
Monster Paris models

364
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:06,207
Invitation to come and join the demon

365
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,023
Have a mistress

366
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,631
Puryear burry work with the models

367
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:16,447
Trying to extrapolate the geometry of the rest of the church

368
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:18,239
Based on the pieces he has

369
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,519
After a year

370
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:22,079
He managed to draw out architectural blueprints

371
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,359
For one window

372
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,639
It was a start

373
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:29,247
Mercury didn't stay long at the Sagrada Familia

374
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:33,087
He was only 20 and he had to go back to New Zealand finish school

375
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,879
He returned to work on the church

376
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:37,695
10 years later and found that when he was gone

377
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,231
Anew thingamabob

378
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,767
I've been moved into the office

379
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,303
Computer

380
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:46,911
Thought these computers must have something to offer cuz I've never actually personally tax form

381
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,775
Winberry finally touch the computer he figured out that it had architectural software on it

382
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:57,407
But the software wasn't capable of dealing with Gowdy

383
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,431
Trying to do

384
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:00,735
The complexity of gaudi's designs with

385
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:04,063
Too much for architectural software of the early 90s

386
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:09,183
Marie wondered if there was anyone else who designed with similar geometric complexity

387
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,231
And finally you landed on it

388
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:13,535
People who design airplanes

389
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:20,447
He started using aeronautical software to figure out an architectural strategy for the interior of the church

390
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:25,055
And because I had to spray sophisticated software by accident undiscovered parametric design

391
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:29,151
So we were working parametrically from 1991

392
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:33,759
Parametric design uses computer algorithms to allow you to plug in different variables

393
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:37,087
And see what the end result is each time you change something

394
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:41,951
Mark Berry was one of the first Architects to use computers to design this way

395
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:47,327
Eventually figured out that Frankie Ruiz team had also started using aeronautical software

396
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:53,983
To bring Gary strangely shaped curvaceous buildings into being

397
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:57,055
Is it Frank's office and talk to their technical team and compare notes

398
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:00,383
Eventually Gary Technologies with help from work break

399
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:04,479
Went on to create their own parametric design software specifically for Arkansas

400
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,271
By the early 2000s

401
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:09,087
Many of the most exciting new projects in architecture

402
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,111
We're being done this

403
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:15,231
At the Forefront of this was a church design over a century ago by Antoni Gaudi

404
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,767
La Sagrada Familia

405
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:20,095
So from being the selection is a man interesting

406
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:22,143
Irrelevant it became actually the

407
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:25,983
Delete projects in the Hall of the digital Revolution affect

408
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:32,895
Parametric design allowed Mark Berry in the other Architects to move a lot faster on the interior of the church

409
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,431
Without this technology

410
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:36,479
It's possible they would still be no

411
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,759
Inside the sea

412
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:40,063
It was only a few years ago in 2010

413
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:43,903
The Architects were able to put the finishing touches on the interior

414
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:47,487
Now people line up around the block to get a glimpse inside

415
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:51,839
And it really is breathtaking

416
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:58,239
Partly because of these incredibly tall columns that Gaudi designed the branch out like trees at the top

417
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:00,031
Stop and are capable of carrying

418
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,823
A tremendous amount of weight

419
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:05,919
When people go into that building I'm not suggesting

420
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:08,735
It is necessarily always a religious experience

421
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,039
The shock

422
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:13,087
And surprise

423
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:15,391
Of walking in trailers doors

424
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:17,952
Into this explosion of light

425
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:18,720
The light

426
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:21,792
Coursing through giant stained glass windows

427
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:24,864
In the afternoon it's a red orange light

428
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,168
And in the morning it's a bluish-green light

429
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,752
And it filters through the huge tree like columns

430
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,544
You feel like you're in a forest

431
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,080
And you feel very tiny

432
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,360
If you're very small

433
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:38,176
You feel as if there's a hold of universe above you

434
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:42,272
But the building is still not finished

435
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:54,816
I'm in An Extremely Loud metal cage elevator that runs on the outside of the church with head on emo

436
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:55,840
Bruschetta

437
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:59,168
The architect volume at the very beginning of the story

438
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:04,800
And Anna Barbie who handles press for La Sagrada Familia

439
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:10,176
It's very safe Anna says but it doesn't feel that safe

440
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:16,832
The elevator is shaking and we can see Barcelona getting smaller below us as we rattle up alongside the tower

441
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:17,856
Church

442
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,976
The elevator door opens to a spec

443
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,000
Angular View

444
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:33,216
We are standing on the top

445
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,520
The Sagrada Familia

446
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,056
I have the parts

447
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:37,824
Over there

448
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:42,944
Barcelona city blocks stretch out all around us

449
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:45,760
To the east we can see the Mediterranean Sea

450
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:46,784
Until the South

451
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,832
The mountain that Gowdy promise not to

452
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:49,600
Surpass

453
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,976
When the building is finished there will be 18 Towers

454
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:57,536
Including a new one right where I'm standing

455
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:03,680
This one will be the tallest of all reaching to 560 ft or 170 m

456
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:08,800
I don't email is working on designing it right now and he's using the fragments

457
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:11,872
Gattis plaster models to figure out how to do it

458
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:14,944
These will be Jesus Christ Our in the middle

459
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,712
One of Anjali

460
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:19,552
The Architects of the building will be finished in 2026

461
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:22,112
The 100th anniversary of gaudi's death

462
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:24,160
But there is still a lot to be done

463
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:30,560
Meanwhile some of the neighbors seem set up with La Sagrada Familia and all of the congestion and Taurus

464
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,840
It brings to the neighborhood

465
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,888
Sometimes they're a little protest

466
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:34,912
Against the place

467
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:36,960
Like this one in 2011

468
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:38,496
Where locals chanted

469
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,544
No more tourist buses

470
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,456
The want their neighborhood back

471
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,248
The bigger the building gets

472
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,784
The more Taurus

473
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:55,392
130 years ago

474
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:58,976
Joseph Polka Band decided to Bill Foster about a Familia

475
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:01,536
Cleanse the people of Barcelona up their sins

476
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:04,608
Inspire the common folk to live a religious life

477
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,680
He picked a piece of land on the outskirts of the city

478
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:10,240
What cows and goats would sometimes wonder

479
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:14,592
He probably never imagined that it would become tourist attraction it is today

480
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:18,176
Architect head-on T-Mobile shadow

481
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:23,552
Does one of the perks of working at La Sagrada Familia is getting to be inside the church

482
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:25,088
When no one else is there

483
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:26,880
Hermes

484
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,416
Is Israeli special

485
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:30,208
To be alone or to be

486
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,000
With not too many people

487
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:38,912
The church only holds one Mass a month right now and it can be hard as throngs of Taurus bump into you with their

488
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:39,680
Are selfie sticks

489
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:43,264
To feel connected to the building as a place of worship

490
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:48,896
Geronimo let me come into the church with him in the early morning before it was open to the public

491
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:50,688
So that I could try to get a sense of it

492
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,224
Are you going to feel that

493
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,784
Espiritual en.

494
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,600
Maybe somebody somebody or something more

495
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,160
Goddess symbol

496
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,184
Ansgear

497
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:05,536
To me and I'm not a religious person

498
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:08,352
La Sagrada Familia is not so much a testament

499
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:11,680
The God as it is to humans and what they can create

500
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:14,752
The Gaudi would dispute that assessment

501
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,288
He once said

502
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,640
The creation continues incessantly through the media of man

503
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,944
The man does not create

504
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,736
He discovers

505
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:37,536
Coming up we discuss Kaldi's revolutionary models for La Sagrada Familia in a segment that was just

506
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:40,096
Too nerdy and dense for the piece itself

507
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,376
But it's new

508
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:43,168
The too cool not to mention it at all

509
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,192
That's right after that

510
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,432
Between the beats

511
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:56,736
Bongs and chatter of our devices

512
00:25:56,992 --> 00:26:00,320
We're immersed in a cluttered world of man made sound

513
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:01,344
If

514
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:07,744
I'm in room listen to an Alexa interacting with Alexa that Alexis talking to me and my wife isn't

515
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,840
All hearing. Voice

516
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:12,608
Technology

517
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:13,376
She talked to us

518
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:15,680
It is a creation of Sonic trash

519
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:18,752
Mets Joel Beckerman he's a sound designer and composer

520
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:22,336
Who studies how we can improve our interactions with technology

521
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:24,128
To make them more human

522
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:28,224
Turn the living room lights on

523
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,016
Okay

524
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:32,064
Dim the living room lights to 50

525
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:32,832
2%

526
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:34,624
Okay

527
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:40,768
It's not exactly a thrilling conversation but taking away the fake human and adding and some thoughtful sound

528
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,072
Makes for a much more natural

529
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:43,840
Experience

530
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,632
Turn the living room lights on

531
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,960
Dim the living room lights

532
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:49,984
50%

533
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,312
We're presenting to

534
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:57,408
Special episodes from 99% invisible and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

535
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:00,224
About how are soundscape is impacting our health

536
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:02,784
And how we can humanize the sounds around us

537
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,600
Look for them Fridays May 17th and May 24th

538
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,368
Right here

539
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,904
E9pay

540
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:12,256
What are things you mentioned that piece are these models

541
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,536
That were destroyed and

542
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:18,400
How important they were in realizing gaudi's vision for La Sagrada Familia

543
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:21,216
Little too technical to get into in the piece

544
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:22,240
Costa

545
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,008
Noses

546
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,568
And I asked him to come to the studio and explain

547
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:27,104
Gowdy's modeling technique

548
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,664
And why it is so important to the creation

549
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,944
La Sagrada Familia

550
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,968
Like a lot of artists

551
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,760
Especially once you'd like to use

552
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,832
Preferred to work in models rather than

553
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:40,160
Models help them experiment with really complex

554
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,184
Control structures

555
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:42,720
And Albany

556
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:45,536
Model out structural Arrangements test things out

557
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,840
Photograph as models in

558
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:48,864
Over the photo

559
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:51,168
But the bottles were behind all of the

560
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:52,448
If they were driving the design

561
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,800
And one of the things that you tried with a lot and bottles were variations on what's called a

562
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,104
Okay so what is a

563
00:27:59,360 --> 00:27:59,872
Catenary

564
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,176
Catenary is

565
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:04,480
Curved shape that a hanging chain

566
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:05,248
Assume

567
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,528
Under its own weight

568
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,320
Basically picture

569
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,600
Electric lines

570
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:10,624
Suspended between you

571
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,184
Okay so you're driving on the highway

572
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,976
C2 utility poles

573
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:18,304
Electric line goes across time and there's that natural Boeing

574
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:20,352
Of the electrical wire

575
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:21,632
And that is

576
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:22,656
The catenary arch

577
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:23,680
Exactly

578
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:24,704
And that term is actually

579
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,752
Drive from the Latin word for chain

580
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:32,384
And it was already well-known by gaudi's time that an optimal Arch shape could be made

581
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,408
By mirroring

582
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:35,200
A catenary curve vertically

583
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:37,504
Basically you take that hanging curve

584
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,296
And you just flip it up

585
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:41,344
And that becomes the model of your

586
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:43,136
And that Arch

587
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:45,184
Distributes building loads efficiently

588
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,208
And a lot of Gothic

589
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:50,048
Okay that makes sense you take this boat to chain

590
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:50,816
It crepes

591
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,864
The optimal Arch when you flip it over

592
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,680
And when Ukrainian churches in the gothic style this is a

593
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:57,472
Good way to create a good

594
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:58,496
Model

595
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:00,800
But I already took the idea further

596
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:04,384
He hung strings other strings from other strings

597
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:06,176
They added birdshot

598
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:08,736
To weight them down at structural intersections

599
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,016
Need treated these

600
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:12,320
Huge intricate wire frame models that

601
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:13,600
End up looking a bit like

602
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,368
Like chandeliers

603
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:17,184
And then God would use mirrors to flip

604
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,464
These vertically

605
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:20,768
And study the shapes they created

606
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:23,584
In order to shape his own elaborate building skeleton

607
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,632
And it sounds a lot like what

608
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:28,192
Leader Architects to use soft

609
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,472
When they

610
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,240
Did 3D mod

611
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:32,288
Yeah there are a lot of parallel

612
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,568
In essence

613
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:37,152
Long before parametric design was a computer software

614
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,944
Gowdy change

615
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,784
Parameters in his models by moving strings and weights around to see how

616
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,576
Who's individual modifications

617
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,856
Could reshape an entire

618
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:46,624
Structure

619
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:50,464
And then a century later people came along and finally made these digital

620
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:52,000
I could be anybody

621
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,536
These handmade models have been doing

622
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:56,608
Allowing Architects to see how small changes with ripple out

623
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:57,632
To their entire design

624
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,680
So you know what you can imagine

625
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:00,448
It would take like

626
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,472
Call Amanda

627
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,520
Moving around a little bit

628
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:05,568
And that deforms like all the other shapes

629
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:06,336
Self-destruction rap

630
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:08,128
Right and then

631
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:09,920
Software you do this and

632
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:12,736
Nail dust off our cranks long and does its thing

633
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:14,528
But in gaudi's time

634
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:16,576
You would move a weight around

635
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:17,856
And you'd see how the

636
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:22,208
Connected set of chains with all kind of deform by adding

637
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:23,488
A little bit of birdshot

638
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:24,512
21 Little

639
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,560
That's amazing

640
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:28,096
And it looks stunning

641
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:30,656
Yeah the results are amazing

642
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,216
A lot of people you know they think Audi and they think of you

643
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:35,520
He's beautiful sculptural scenes in these details

644
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,288
He created

645
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,056
Underneath

646
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:37,824
All of that

647
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,128
Is this really lovely structural logic

648
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:41,920
Instagram Familia

649
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:42,688
The Tostitos are

650
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:44,992
Beautiful but so is this internal framework

651
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,784
Columns and arches

652
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,552

Fractal Forest

656
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:52,416
Spell because

657
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:54,720
Dowdy didn't spend a lot of time teaching or

658
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:57,280
Explaining his methods are really writing about his

659
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,048
Designs

660
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:00,352
And because his work was so out of sync

661
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:05,728
What modern is for trying to do with the time he didn't always get a lot of recognition from the architectural list

662
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:10,848
So he's like a starchitect but in hiding

663
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:12,384
Yeah pretty much you can eat

664
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,480
Yeah he's a Trier starchitect who doesn't spend all of his time bragging about

665
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:20,064
That's so cool

666
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,088
These models are

667
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:25,184
Really sunny their mazing to look at and we have some pictures on our website correct

668
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:28,256
Yes we have a ton of pictures of these bottles

669
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,792
That he made as well as

670
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,584
The really beautiful Church

671
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:32,864
Help create

672
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,144

Before we go I want to tell you about the body genius

702
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:08,352
Series from below radiotopia show the truth

703
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:10,912
The body genius is a Dark comic mystery

704
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:12,448
That whines through a

705
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:14,240
Treacherous fictionalized Hollywood

706
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:15,776
We're looking the part

707
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,568
Might cost you your life

708
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:22,688
You know how sometimes a famous actor has to get really jacked play superhero in a movie

709
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:24,992
Or lose a ton of weight

710
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:27,040
Play a prisoner or a psychopath

711
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:31,392
Or put on 50 pounds all of a sudden to play like a dad

712
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:35,744
I'm a Hollywood trainer and I specialize in that stuff

713
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:38,048
Actually if I'm being honest

714
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:40,096
I'm one of the main guy to know how to do that

715
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,376
Kind of thing

716
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:44,448
A few days ago Wesley Stern

717
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:47,776
After that I was helping to get huge for an action movie called Immortal cop

718
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:51,104
Was found dead in my private gym

719
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,432
Crushed inside a high-tech weight machine

720
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:58,784
Even worse the cops think that I had something to do with it

721
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,808
Now

722
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:02,112
I need to clear my name

723
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:07,488
Somebody out there killed Wesley and I'm going to do whatever it takes

724
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:08,256
To find them
